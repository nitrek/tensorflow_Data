Dear UWM ePantherACCOUNT holder:

According to our records, you have not registered for classes during the
 past two full semesters, are no longer employed by or hold a sponsored
 affiliation with UWM. Therefore, as part of routine maintenance of IT
 services provided to the UWM community, IT services accessed using your
 UWM ePantherACCOUNT are scheduled to be closed after the last day of
 finals during this current semester. All files and information that are
 part of these services will be permanently removed at that time.

In preparation for account closure, access to your UWM IT services, including the following, will be restricted:
– Office 365 e-mail/calendar services
– OneDrive
– pantherFILE space
– pantherLIST
– UWM web space
– UWM Survey Instrument

What you need to do to prepare for account closure

It is important to prepare now for restricted access and impending
 account closure of your services. Following are some recommendations.

1. Files and/or data you have maintained as part of these ePanther
 services should be immediately moved to personal storage. This includes
 any e-mail or calendar events stored in Office 365, files stored in
 OneDrive or pantherFILE, coursework in D2L, website files, data contained
 in the UWM Survey Instrument, etc. Once the services associated with your
 ePanther account are closed at the end of the semester, your data will
 be removed and will not be retrievable.

Any resources used in the business of  or files required by
 departments should be shared with qualified personel in the department to
 ensure their continued use.

2. If you are actively using your Office 365 e-mail and calendar
 services, notify individuals that your o365 service account will
 be closing. This can be done using the o365 automated response
 feature described on this web page: https://kb.uwm.edu/page.php?id=45433
 Note this automated notification will only be in effect until your
 account is closed at the end of the semester. If you are still using the
 calendar feature, move all your calendar appointments to a non-UWM
 calendar service.

3. If you are the owner of Office 365 Shared Mailboxes you should update
 the ownership. See this web page for instructions:
https://kb.uwm.edu/page.php?id=50161

4. If you schedule Office 365 Calendar Resources that should be continued,
 See this web page for information on how the scheduling users may be
 changed: https://kb.uwm.edu/page.php?id=405475.


If you are the owner of pantherLIST e-mail lists you should update the ownership. See the ownership info at the bottom of the PantherLIST
 FAQ page: https://kb.uwm.edu/page.php?id=42159



Some additional information to consider with ePantherACCOUNT services when
 leaving UWM is available at http://uwm.edu/iam/procedures/before-you-leave-uwm/



For assistance with the above, contact the UWM Help Desk at
 414-229-4040, toll-free at 877-381-3459, or use the online form at

You may verify the status of your access by visiting the ePantherACCOUNT
 deprovisioning website located at http://epanther.uwm.edu/close



NOTE: Alumni who would like to continue using a UWM-affiliated e-mail
 account may be eligible for a free UWM Alumni Gmail account. This
 is not a continuation of your Office 365 account; it is a new e-mail
 account. For more information, visit the UWM Alumni Association website
 at http://alumni.uwm.edu

Services remaining open

Access to the PAWS service (http://paws.uwm.edu) for students or faculty
 and the My Wisconsin portal for employees (http://my.wisconsin.edu) will
 remain open using your ePantherID and password.
————————————————————————
What to do if you believe your account closure is in error

Individuals who are late registrants, retired professors with emeritus
 status, research assistants, recently hired employees, individuals with
 a sponsored affiliation with UWM, or individuals who have recently
 changed their ePantherIDs may be entitled to have access to all ePanther
 services.

If you believe you should retain access to your ePanther services, do
 not reply to this e-mail. Contact the UWM Help Desk at 414-229-4040,
 toll-free at 877-381-3459 or use the online form at
http://GetTechHelp.uwm.edu. Provide the following information:

1. A statement of why your account should remain open and you should
 continue to be granted access to ePanther services.

2. An alternate e-mail address and your ePantherID if the reply should
 be sent to a non-UWM account. Do NOT include your ePanther password.

3. A phone number at which you can be contacted.

On occasion, accounts are flagged that should not be closed. Most
 issues are resolved quickly after information is provided to the UWM
 Help Desk.

Thank you,
 UWM ePantherACCOUNT Administration Office Staff <helpdesk@uwm.edu>
