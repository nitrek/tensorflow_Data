Dear Mr. Ahsan,

I have attached five samples of my original designs to this email. The sixth attachment is a list of designs where I collaborated with other designers including the location (URL) of the designs on the Internet.

Thank you for allowing me to send samples to you. I will be pleased to participate in the forthcoming competition and also introduce my services to your team.

Kindly notify me should you need any other information.

Regards,

With the above reply email samples, you should be able to effectively respond, whether positively or negatively, to emails that come your way.

As a recap, you should always ensure your email replies are:
1.Clear, direct and unambiguous
2.One-to-one (between you and the reader)
3.Short, Simple and Sweet
