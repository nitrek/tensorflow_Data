Dear Mr. Frank,

Thank you for applying for the opening in our company and sending your design samples. I have reviewed your style and thought about the issues you raised during our last discussion, especially your reluctance to create new design samples for our evaluation. Since then, I have received new design samples from more than ten candidates, lending credence to their works.

Eventually, I have concluded that your samples are not enough to help me reach a conclusion about you. So, we now have a new Chief Designer for our company. However, I would be happy to work with you on contract basis if you agree to this.

Thanks again, Frank, for your interest in our company.

Cordially,
