Dear Miss Sheryl,

Pardon the delay in responding to your last email. I have been in the process of setting up my own social network; so I had to resign from Facebook Inc.

I very much appreciate your invitation to help evaluate the Facebook App you are developing this time, but this may not be in the best interest of Facebook’s management. You may contact some other editors on Facebook forum.

Thank you for understanding.

Best regards,

Dear Mr. Mohammed,

I was flattered by your request to make me a minister in your church branch in Bahamas. Regrettably, I won’t be able to accept this position.

I wish you well in Bahamas

Yours truly,
