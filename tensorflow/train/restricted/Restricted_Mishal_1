Q2 Results
Non-GAAP revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was $352 million with GAAP revenue of $334 million.
The non-GAAP revenue breakdown for the quarter was approximately 44% for software and services, 26% for
service access fees (SAF), and 30% for mobility solutions.
BlackBerry had around 3,000 enterprise customer wins in the quarter. Approximately 81% of the second quarter
software and services revenue was recurring.
Non-GAAP operating income was $16 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share was break even for the second
quarter. GAAP net loss for the quarter was $(372) million, or $(0.71) per basic share. Adjustments to GAAP net
income and earnings per share are summarized in a table below.
Total cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments was approximately $2.5 billion as of August 31,
2016. This reflects a use of free cash of $37 million, which includes $34 million of cash used in operations.
Excluding $1.25 billion in the face value of our debt, the net cash balance at the end of the quarter was $1.22
billion. Purchase orders with contract manufacturers totaled approximately $71 million at the end of the second
quarter, compared to $150 million at the end of the first quarter and down from $248 million in the year ago quarter.
“We are reaching an inflection point with our strategy. Our financial foundation is strong, and our pivot to software
is taking hold,” said John Chen, Executive Chairman and CEO, BlackBerry. “In Q2, we more than doubled our
software revenue year over year and delivered the highest gross margin in the company’s history. We also
completed initial shipments of BlackBerry Radar, an end-to end asset tracking system, and signed a strategic
licensing agreement to drive global growth in our BBM consumer business.”
“Our new Mobility Solutions strategy is showing signs of momentum, including our first major device software
licensing agreement with a telecom joint venture in Indonesia. Under this strategy, we are focusing on software
development, including security and applications. The company plans to end all internal hardware development
and will outsource that function to partners. This allows us to reduce capital requirements and enhance return on
invested capital,” continued Chen.
“We remain on track to deliver 30 percent revenue growth in software and services for the full fiscal year. We are
revising upward our non-GAAP EPS outlook to a range of breakeven to a five cent loss, compared to the current
consensus of a 15 cent loss. This reflects increased confidence based on improving margins and reduced interest
expense from the recent refinancing of our debt, as well as planned investments in growth areas.”
