there will be four brokers online when we launch on or about March 19, 2001.  Between now and the launch date we will be giving these brokers additional user ids to view prices on EnronOnline.

Listed below are the brokers that will have access and the products they will have execute rights on:

1. Amerex: Worldwide gas, power, crude products and bandwidth
2. Prebon: North American gas and power; European gas and power
3. Natsource: North American gas and power; Emissions; Coal
4. Power Merchants: US Financial Gas 

All transactions which are executed by brokers on EnronOnline numbers will be free of brokerage charges.  We are under non-disclosure agreements with each of these brokers and therefore should not discuss the terms of these deals.  The brokers are particuliarly concerned about the impact with other customers if the terms of these agreements become public.

We are in discussion with other brokers to provide this same service.  I encourage you to contact us with any brokers that may have an interest in viewing and executing on EnronOnline prices.

Please call me with any questions or concerns at 713 853-0397.
