Below are a number of the e-mail's that I've exchanged with TrueQuote.  I 
can't say that they make for interesting reading but if you note any 
potential issues please let me know.  Most of the notes relate to product 
mapping issues but you will notice highlighted in red a note regarding the 
ordering of a leased line which in my mind is "acceptance of responsibility 
by action."  I'll be crafting a note regarding testing soon and will 
coordinate this with Jay and yourself.  I'll also be forwarding e-mails with 
Houston Street.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do to further 
clarify our status.

Thanks for sending the answers to our technical questions. After carefully
reviewing your answers, we have a few follow-up questions.  These appear in
"green".  Please let me know if anything needs further clarification.

We are looking forward to meeting with you next week. Tentatively, we are
planning to have 5 or 6 people attend.  These include three really technical
people, a couple of leads (including myself), a user from the True Quote
business side who understands the products that are traded on True Quote,
and the new True Quote CIO (who's mainly interested in hearing what is said
more so than actively participating in the discussion).

By next Tuesday, I plan to send you our proposed agenda for the meeting.  If
you have a different agenda in mind for the meeting, let's discuss it over
the phone on Wednesday and jointly priortize the items for discussion. We
are very flexible in terms of the agenda.

Thanks in advance for any additional information you can send us.  It's nice
to have a contact to be able to correspond with.  Have a great day!
