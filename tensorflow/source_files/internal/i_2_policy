this document is about some new policy.

this policy was created by some bank to ensure some cause, these policies
ensure that whatever the work that we do is adhering to areas of safety and 
legal.

this is what policies mean :- 
A set of policies are principles, rules, and guidelines formulated or adopted
 by an organization to reach its long-term goals and typically published in a
 booklet or other form that is widely accessible. 
Policies and procedures are designed to influence and determine all major 
decisions and actions, and all activities take place within the boundaries 
set by them. Procedures are the specific methods employed to express 
policies in action in day-to-day operations of the organization. 
Together, policies and procedures ensure that a point of view held by 
the governing body of an organization is translated into steps that result 
in an outcome compatible with that view.
