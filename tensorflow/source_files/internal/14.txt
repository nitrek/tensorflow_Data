You, or a representative from your
organization, are invited to attend a meeting on June 14, 2001 from 10am to
12pm in our offices. It has been some time since the group has met and in
the mean time we have put some processes in place to address the ongoing
supply adequacy concerns within Alberta. Thank you for your support. We
would like to review how the current processes are working and examine areas
for improvement. We have proposed the following agenda.

*	Review of current coordination practices
*	Information posting practices
*	System Controller practices - re: coordination
*	Information requirements for 2002 - update of maintenance by October
*	System Restoration requirements
*	Other issues?

				Please confirm your attendance by June 8,
2001. If you are unable to attend, perhaps you would like to be telephone
conferenced into the meeting. Please confirm.
				Also, please advise if you have any other
agenda items.
