This email is acknowledgement from the Power Pool of Alberta of the change
in direct sales registration for contracts that are currently registered
with the Power Pool between your organization and Enron Canada Power
Corporation for trading after December 29 HE 1 2001.  On January 4 the Power
Pool received your acknowledgement of Enron's change in the source asset for
the direct sales registrations for contracts 259, 260, 1950 to 1976 (total
of 29 contracts) to modify the source from the Sundance 3 unit (SD3) to
Enron's unmetered source asset (ECP-).  The modified registration terms will
be effective December 29 HE 1 2001 and will apply until the expiry date of
the contract for net settlement purposes.

In addition, as has been verbally communicated to you, the Power Pool was
required to modify two of Encore/EPCOR's direct sales contracts with Enron
Canada Power Corporation that were registered with the Power Pool in 2001
due to the sale of the Sundance 3 unit effective December 29 HE 1 2001.  The
details of these changes are provided below.
