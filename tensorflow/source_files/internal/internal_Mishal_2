1.      INTRODUCTION 

This document describes the standards for document structure and style, and provides guidelines for readability.

 

2.      DOCUMENT TEMPLATE 

A template has been developed to help maintain consistency of deliverable documents.  The format of working documents is at the author's discretion.

WordPerfect will be used to create all deliverable documents.  If you absolutely must use an alternate tool (such as Microsoft Word) you are responsible for converting it to a WordPerfect format document that is fully formatted in accordance with the template.

All deliverable documents must be created using the conventions identified in the template.

The template is found on the LAN (L:\S&P\V4\DOCUMENT.STD).

 

3.      DOCUMENT STRUCTURE 

The standard structure and content of any document is as follows:

·          Title Page,

·          Table of Contents,

·          Introduction,

·          Body of the Report,

·          Appendices and Annexes.

The requirements for each of these sections are described below. 

3.1       Title Page

A title page is required on all deliverable documents. The title page includes:

·          the title of the report,

·          the document number,

·          the document status,

·          the date.

3.2       Table of Contents

The table of contents feature of WordPerfect is used with no more than three levels of subsection titles. The Table of Contents lists all sections and sub-sections with their corresponding page numbers. 

3.3       Introduction

The purpose of the introduction is to explain why the document was commissioned and give the perspective of where and how the report fits into the scheme of the project. The material in the introduction is presented in a logical sequence, along the following lines:

Background - describes the situation that led to the production of the report. Typically it describes the objectives, who conducted the study, where and when it was conducted, and special instructions given by the project to complete the objective.

Scope - describes the scope of the work to which the report applies.

Approach - describes how the assignment was carried out: the methodology followed; the techniques used, the assumptions made, and the steps taken to arrive at the conclusions.

 
3.4       Body of the Report

The body of the report presents the data collected and conclusions reached in accordance with the accepted work plan and the agreed upon table of contents.

Main section titles are numerically identified. Subsections within each section are numbered sequentially in a decimal format as follows, to a maximum of three levels:

1.         TITLE

1.1       Subtitle

1.1.1    Sub-subtitle

Main section titles (level one) are left-justified in bold upper-case letters.  Level two and level three titles are in upper-case and lower-case letters, bold face.

Include a space line after headings or subheadings before the following text.

Text is indented to fall under the title and not the number, of each section.  The first line in a paragraph is not indented.

3.5       Appendices and Annexes

An Appendix or Annex consists of supplementary material supporting and complementing the various elements in the body of the report. It contains the detailed information that is necessary for a full understanding of the report and complete justification of the recommendations.

The word "Appendix" is used for additions bound within the same report. Appendices are numbered 1,2,3, etc.

The word "Annex" is used for additional information that is provided in a separate volume.  Annexes are labeled A, B, C, etc.  Lettered Appendices may be attached to each Annex.
