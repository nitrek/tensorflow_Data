An acquisition or merger is not a frequent event for my organization. However, it seems like in the past year or so we have worked on a number of these activities. So, it seems like it may be time to create a formalized checklist for the IT department items that need to be addressed during an acquisition.

To get the ball rolling, I am listing some items that I consider to be important to the infrastructure/security folks like me. I know this list is not exhaustive or complete. It is a work in progress and will need to be refined for each event since they are all different. Some of these may be done in the due-diligence but the rubber hits the road during the implementation.

So, without further ado:
Absorbing a new acquisition – to do list (general & incomplete)
Private WAN connectivity – 30-90 days or more lead time depending on location
flexible IP addressing scheme to absorb devices on new network(s)
Internet firewall changes – ports, source addresses, NAT, etc.
DNS ownership and management changing registrars
changing DNS nameservers – use a dig tool to get information concerning current configuration – MenAndMice

Network hygiene – how clean are the devices and what personnel habits need to be changed?
Device inventory – what effort will it take to do this?
Software licensing inventory
What about handling loss of staff & knowledge? ? Documentation of processes, procedures, configurations?

Phone list sharing
E-mail addressbook sharing
E-mail system integration anti-spam/anti-virus
calendar sharing

ERP process integration
Resource access permissions
Financial reporting integration – accounts payable, receivable, tax, etc.
Staff reporting structure
Other HR activities – benefits, payroll, etc.

I welcome your insight and experience on the many other activities you feel is important to address during a merger/acquisition.
