Product ID
* Product ID is a fully transactable item  and fully qualified instrument -
Includes: Product, Location, Dates; Excludes: Price, Volume and Couterparty
* Tokenized Dates:  Product ID for next day and balance of month are
tokenized dates which means that the product ID will remain the same for
designated date range (next day, next 2 days, BOM, etc).  The dates will
role, but the product ID will remain the same
* Product IDs for anything but the rolling Tokenized products/dates (i.e. -
spot month), expire after date has been reached.
* There will be no redundancy of product IDs that encompass the same date
ranges (i.e.:  there are usually two separate product IDs for next day and
balance of month, but when the next to the last day of the month is reached,
both will reference the same day.  At this point, Enron will only have one
product ID associated with the given date range)
* Enron has set up product IDs to adequately reflect Weekend trading on
Friday (deals entered for Saturday will encompass Sat - Mon (and include
extra days when Holidays are involved))
* Once a strip term has been reached, trades within the month then change to
the tokenized product IDs.
* Enron will Fill or Kill all transaction attempts - they will execute or
cancel the trade immediately
* Enron will Partial fills transaction attempts
* When True Quote sends a request for a transaction, the threshold for
waiting on a response from Enron will be defined by True Quote.
* Trade failure will re-broadcast product (failure for any reason)
* If for any reason there is a concern about a product, True Quote can
request (HTTP) validation of the product in question
* Frequency of updates:  Enron will send True Quote a document that contains
all information since last time polled (includes all changes (only changes)
since last transmission)
* Every product sent will have only one bid and offer price associated with
it at time of transmission.  What you see on EOL is what is sent to True
Quote.
* There will be no market depth transmitted to True Quote from Enron
* Duration of orders
* Orders will be displayed on True Quote until suspended by traders
* All orders will remain on system until traders pull deals
* True Quote session is finite (7 -7).  At the end of every day all deals
will be removed from True Quote (either by Enron traders removing them, or
TRUE QUOTE will run a batch job to clear Enron deals).  In the morning, TRUE
QUOTE will authenticate and all products will be loaded from Enron to TRUE
QUOTE.
* The Currency and Unit of measure are implied as part of Product ID, it's
not an attribute.
* Granularity of orders transmitted from True Quote to Enron will show each
order associated with each price and volume of a Product ID (i.e. 100,000
mmbtu @ $5 is made up of 10 separate orders of 10,000, Enron would like to
see all 10 orders of 10,000 - including counterparty information)
* Transaction attempts made from True Quote to EOL - Point of execution will
be on EOL
* Transaction attempts made by Enron Traders against True Quote price
postings will be executed on True Quote

Offline:
* Will we know if a transaction has failed due to volume not available,
credit failure, or Enron has not heard of the transaction
* How to handle increments <> 5000 increment on the Enron side (will we only
display the 5000 increment below the volume submitted by Enron; if trader
has a minimum tradable volume greater than entities are willing to
participate (i.e. Enron minimum tradable amount is 10,000 or 15,000) how do
we display this and how does the minimum increment come across in the order)
* If we transmit to Enron the granularity of all orders (including
counterparty information), how will True Quote / Enron ensure the fair and
equitable treatment with prices sent to Enron (proper processing of orders
without bias)
* Business question: how much do we want to send Enron (they are ok with
sending each order for all price points in an instrument), do we show top 1
or top 5?
* Need to discuss in more detail how to handle EOL price interface
transactions and Enron Trader transactions
