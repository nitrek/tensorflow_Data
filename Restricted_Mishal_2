Re: Loan Request for $ 200,000

Dear Mr. Brown,

I am requesting a loan of $200,000 in order to expand my business. I have over 15 years of experience in the fashion industry. I worked for 5 years sewing clothes for the Uniform Company and another 5 years sewing high fashion clothes for Boutique Mabelle. In 2000, I started my own business with personal and family funds and began selling ladies T-shirts with hand-painted designs. I later started doing silk-screening in order to accommodate larger orders.

I plan to use the $200,000 as follows: $100,000 to purchase a new silkscreen machine and sewing machine that will allow me to print 20 T-shirts at one time,  $100,000 for building materials to expand a new space for the business.

The market for this business is good. Women in particular, especially, are fond of my unique, hand-painted designs, and I have had a continuous and growing demand for these customized T-shirts. Many of these customers are repeat customers. There is also a growing number of groups and businesses, which are preferring to purchase custom designed T-Shirts for their business, rather than use the standard products from the uniform manufacturers. I strive to produce quality products which satisfies basic needs, and offered at reasonable prices. 

My target market is threefold: fashion oriented young people who seek an exclusive and unique design (retail or through a boutique); working women; and groups and associations who require a T-Shirts for different occasions such as conferences, or to mark special events.

My competition includes: the tourism oriented shops which print designs on T-shirts at a very low price; the boutiques which make blouses for ladies; and, companies such as the Uniform Company, which produce T-Shirts and Shirts for businesses. My business has two advantages over my competition - my prices are slightly lower because I have a lower cost structure, and my designs are very beautiful and unique. My hand-painted T-shirts cannot be found anywhere else, and my silkscreen designs are also quite popular because of the richness of the colors. I believe I am responding to the needs of my customers, who want something unique and fashionable, while still reasonably priced.

I am investing $30,000 of my own money, generated over the last months from the business. My collateral consists of business assets having a fair market value of $35,000 and personal real estate assets with a value of $35,000.

Attached is my business plan which backs up the loan request. If you have any questions, please contact me at 555-1234. I would like to meet with you to go over my financing proposal. I would also like to invite you to visit my shop.

Sincerely,

Melissa Campbelll
