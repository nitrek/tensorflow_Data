Release Nos. 33- 10233; IC- 32315; File No. S7-16-15
RIN 3235-AL61
Investment Company Liquidity Risk Management Programs
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Final rule.
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission is adopting new rules, a new form and
amendments to a rule and forms designed to promote effective liquidity risk management
throughout the open-end investment company industry, thereby reducing the risk that funds will
be unable to meet their redemption obligations and mitigating dilution of the interests of fund
shareholders. The amendments also seek to enhance disclosure regarding fund liquidity and
redemption practices. The Commission is adopting new rule 22e-4, which requires each
registered open-end management investment company, including open-end exchange-traded
funds (“ETFs”) but not including money market funds, to establish a liquidity risk management
program. Rule 22e-4 also requires principal underwriters and depositors of unit investment trusts
(“UITs”) to engage in a limited liquidity review. The Commission is also adopting amendments
to Form N-1A regarding the disclosure of fund policies concerning the redemption of fund
shares. The Commission also is adopting new rule 30b1-10 and Form N-LIQUID that generally
will require a fund to confidentially notify the Commission when the fund’s level of illiquid
investments that are assets exceeds 15% of its net assets or when its highly liquid investments
that are assets fall below its minimum for more than a specified period of time. The Commission
also is adopting certain sections of Forms N-PORT and N-CEN that will require disclosure of
1

certain information regarding the liquidity of a fund’s holdings and the fund’s liquidity risk
management practices.
DATES: Effective Dates: This rule is effective [insert date 60 days after date of publication in
the Federal Register] except for the amendments to Form N-CEN (referenced in 17 CFR
274.101) which are effective June 1, 2018.
Compliance Dates: The applicable compliance dates are discussed in section III.M. of this final
rule.

INTRODUCTION
Redeemability is a defining feature of open-end investment companies. 2 At the time the

Act was adopted, this feature was recognized as unique to open-end investment companies, 3 and
the Act’s classification of management investment companies as either open-end (“open-end
funds” or “funds”) 4 or closed-end, upon which several of the Act’s other provisions depend,
turns on whether the investment company’s shareholders have the right to redeem their shares on
demand. When the Investment Company Act was enacted, it was understood that redeemability
meant that an open-end fund had to have a liquid portfolio. 5 Since the 1940s, the Commission
has stated that open-end funds should maintain highly liquid portfolios and recognized that this

2

See Investment Trusts and Investment Companies: Letter from the Acting Chairman of the SEC, A Report
on Abuses and Deficiencies in the Organization and Operation of Investment Trusts and Investment
Companies (1939), at n.206 (“[T]he salient characteristic of the open-end investment company…was that
the investor was given a right of redemption so that he could liquidate his investment at or about asset value
at any time that he was dissatisfied with the management or for any other reason.”). An open-end
investment company is required by law to redeem its securities on demand from shareholders at a price
approximating their proportionate share of the fund’s net asset value (“NAV”) next calculated by the fund
after receipt of such redemption request.

See Investment Trusts and Investment Companies: Hearings on S. 3580 before a Subcomm. of the Senate
Comm. on Banking and Currency, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. (1940) (“1940 Senate Hearings Transcript”), at 453
(Statement of Mahlon E. Traylor) (“Open-end companies are unlike any other type of investment company,
principally because of the highly important distinguishing feature that their shareholders can, by contract
right, withdraw their proportionate interest at will simply by surrendering their shares to the company for
redemption at liquidating value.”).

In-Kind ETFs (as defined below) are included when we refer to “funds” or “open-end funds” throughout
this Release, except in the sections discussing classifying the liquidity of a fund’s portfolio positions and
the highly liquid investment minimum requirement, from which In-Kind ETFs are excepted. We have done
this for conciseness and we recognize that these naming conventions differ from the text of rule 22e-4.
Additionally, while a money market fund is an open-end management investment company, money market
funds are not subject to the rules and amendments we are adopting (except certain amendments to Form NCEN and Form N-1A) and thus are not included when we refer to “funds” or “open-end funds” in this
Release except where specified.

See Investment Trusts and Investment Companies: Hearings on H.R. 10065 before a Subcomm. of the
House Comm. on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 112 (1940), at 57 (Statement of
Robert E. Healy) (“due to the right of the stockholder to come in and demand a redemption, the [open-end
fund] has to keep itself in a very liquid position. That is, it has to be able to turn its securities into money
on very short notice.”).

may limit their ability to participate in certain transactions in the capital markets. 6 Section 22(e)
of the Act enforces the shareholder’s right of prompt redemption in open-end funds by
compelling such funds to make payment on shareholder redemption requests within seven days
of receiving the request. Potential dilution of shareholders’ interests in open-end funds also was
a significant concern of Congress when drafting the Act and was among the noted abuses that led
to the enactment of the Act, as reflected in sections 22(a) and (c). 7
Although the Investment Company Act provides funds with a seven-day window to pay
proceeds upon an investor’s redemption, the settlement period for open-end fund redemptions
has shortened considerably over the years. There are several reasons for shorter settlement
periods, including broker-dealer settlement cycle requirements, 8 evolving industry standards, and
technological advances in the settlement infrastructure. 9 In addition, many funds state in their
prospectuses that investors can ordinarily expect to receive redemption proceeds in shorter
6

See Investment Trusts and Investment Companies: Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(1942), at 76 (“Open-end investment companies, because of their security holders’ right to compel
redemption of their shares by the company at any time, are compelled to invest their funds predominantly
in readily marketable securities. Individual open-end investment companies, therefore, as presently
constituted, could participate in the financing of small enterprises and new ventures only to a very limited
extent.”).

7

See 1940 Senate Hearings Transcript, supra footnote 3, at 37, 137-145 (stating that, among the abuses that
served as a backdrop for the Act, were “practices which resulted in substantial dilution of investors’
interests”, including backward pricing by fund insiders to increase investment in the fund and thus enhance
management fees, but causing dilution of existing investors in the fund).

8

Open-end funds that are redeemed through broker-dealers must meet redemption requests within three
business days because broker-dealers are subject to rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the “Exchange Act”), which establishes a three-day (T+3) settlement period for security trades effected by
a broker or a dealer.

9

Generally, settlement time frames for mutual fund shares have been shortening for decades. See Open-End
Fund Liquidity Risk Management Programs; Swing Pricing; Re-Opening of Comment Period for
Investment Company Reporting Modernization Release, Investment Company Act Release No. 31835
(Sept. 22, 2015) [80 FR 62274 (Oct. 15, 2015)] (“Proposing Release”), at section II.C.2. See also, e.g.,
T+2 Industry Steering Committee, Shortening the Settlement Cycle: The Move to T+2 (2015), at n.18,

through NSCC generally on a T+1 basis (excluding certain retail trades which typically settle on T+3).”).

periods than seven days. 10 At the same time, open-end funds have experienced significant
growth, 11 markets have grown more complex, and funds pursue more complex investment
strategies, including fixed income and alternative investment strategies focused on less liquid
asset classes. These trends have made the role of fund liquidity and liquidity management more
important than ever in reducing the risk that a fund will be unable to meet its obligations to
redeeming shareholders or other obligations under applicable law, while also minimizing the
impact of those redemptions on the fund (i.e., mitigating investor dilution). Furthermore, recent
events have demonstrated the significant adverse consequences to remaining investors in a fund
when it fails to adequately manage liquidity. 12
We remain committed, as the primary regulator of open-end funds, to designing
regulatory programs that respond to the risks associated with the increasingly complex portfolio

As of the end of 2015, there were 10,633 open-end funds (excluding money market funds, but including
ETFs), as compared to 5,279 at the end of 1996. See Investment Company Institute, 2016 Investment
Company Fact Book (2016) (“2016 ICI Fact Book”), available at
https://www.ici.org/pdf/2016_factbook.pdf.

For example, during the pendency of our proposal, the Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund, a nondiversified open-end fund, adopted a plan of liquidation, and requested and obtained exemptive relief to
suspend shareholder redemptions, following a period of heavy redemption requests that the fund stated
reduced the fund’s portfolio liquidity. The Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund has yet to complete the
liquidation of fund assets. Additionally, the fund reported that, as a result of the continuous liquidation of
securities without reinvestment, the fund became increasingly more concentrated, which negatively
impacted performance. See Third Avenue Trust and Third Avenue Management LLC, Investment
Company Act Release No. 31943 (Dec. 16, 2015) (“Third Avenue Temporary Order”); Third Avenue
Focused Credit Fund Semi-Annual Report to Shareholders (April 30, 2016), available at:
http://thirdave.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Q2-2016-TFCIX-Semi-Annual-Report.pdf (“The Fund is
considerably more concentrated than it has ever been. As we have been liquidating securities and not
recycling the cash, the top 10 holdings have increased from 32.6% at March 31, 2015 to approximately
67% of the Fund. We are increasingly dependent on the top 10 names to drive performance.”). See also

composition and operations of the asset management industry. In developing the proposed rules,
Commission staff engaged with large and small fund complexes to better understand funds’
management of liquidity risk. Through these outreach efforts our staff has learned that, while
some funds and their managers have developed extensive liquidity risk management programs,
others have dedicated significantly fewer resources, attention and focus to managing liquidity
risk in a formalized way. We believe that it is in the interest of funds and fund investors to
create a regulatory framework that would reduce the risk that a fund will be unable to meet its
redemption obligations and minimize dilution of shareholder interests by promoting stronger and
more effective liquidity risk management across open-end funds.
We sought to address these goals with the proposal on fund liquidity risk management
that we published in late 2015. 13 This proposal would have required funds to: establish liquidity
risk management programs, including classifying and monitoring each portfolio asset’s level of
liquidity and designating a minimum amount of highly liquid investments; provide additional
reporting to us; and enhance disclosure to investors regarding the liquidity of fund portfolios and
how funds manage liquidity risk and redemption obligations. In order to provide funds with an
additional tool to mitigate potential dilution and to manage fund liquidity, the proposal included
amendments to rule 22c-1 under the Act to permit funds (except money market funds and ETFs)
to use “swing pricing,” a process of adjusting the NAV of a fund’s shares to pass on to
purchasing or redeeming shareholders more of the costs associated with their trading activity. 14

13

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9.

14

We note that we are adopting swing pricing, and associated changes to Form N-PORT and N-CEN in a
companion release. See Investment Company Swing Pricing, Investment Company Act Release No. 32316
(Oct. 13, 2016) (“Swing Pricing Adopting Release”). All comments on the proposed swing pricing rules
and associated issues are discussed in that release.

8

We received more than 70 comment letters on the proposal. 15 The majority of
commenters generally supported a requirement that funds adopt a formal, written liquidity risk
management program that is risk oriented and principles based, although many provided
suggestions and alternatives for us to consider. 16 Many commenters objected to certain aspects
of the proposal, particularly the liquidity classification requirement, the three-day liquid asset
minimum, and the requirement that funds publicly disclose the liquidity of each portfolio
position. 17 Several commenters specifically supported applying the liquidity risk management
requirements to all open-end funds, with the exception of money market funds. 18 Others
expressed concerns with regard to ETFs, and recommended that the Commission exclude ETFs
that primarily satisfy purchase and redemption orders in kind from the liquidity risk management
requirements or develop a more tailored liquidity risk management program applicable to
ETFs. 19
Today, after consideration of the many comments we received, we are adopting the

liquidity of each portfolio position may confuse and mislead investors).

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter I; BlackRock Comment Letter (suggesting that the Commission should
develop a separate and comprehensive rule addressing the different types of ETFs and their respective

the Commission treat ETMFs in the same manner as ETFs and did not recommend any further unique
treatment of ETMFs. See Comment Letter of the American Bar Association (Feb. 11, 2016); Comment
Letter of Financial Services Roundtable (Jan. 13, 2016) (“FSR Comment Letter”).

proposal with a number of modifications to enhance the effectiveness and workability of the
rule’s liquidity risk management requirements. The Commission is adopting new rule 22e-4,
which will require each fund to adopt and implement a written liquidity risk management
program designed to assess and manage the fund’s liquidity risk, which will be overseen by the
fund’s board. As discussed in more detail below, the Commission is modifying from the
proposal some of the liquidity risk management program elements, including reducing the
liquidity classification categories from six to four, providing tailored program requirements for
ETFs, and revising the fund board oversight requirements.
The new rule contains a highly liquid investment minimum requirement, which is similar
to the proposed three-day liquid asset minimum. However, instead of barring a fund from
purchasing securities other than highly liquid investments if the fund falls below its minimum as
proposed for the three-day liquid asset minimum, under the adopted rules, if the fund falls below
its highly liquid investment minimum, it would: (1) report that occurrence to the fund board at its
next scheduled meeting; (2) if it is below the minimum for more than a brief period of time,
report the occurrence to the board and, on Form N-LIQUID, to the Commission within one
business day; and (3) develop and provide to the board a plan for restoring the minimum within a
reasonable period of time.
We also are adopting a 15% limitation on funds’ purchases of illiquid investments,
largely as proposed, but the definition of investments considered illiquid and subject to this 15%
limit has been enhanced and substantially harmonized with the classification system we are
adopting today. Additionally, the Commission is adopting new reporting Form N-LIQUID,
which will require a fund to confidentially notify the Commission within one business day if the
fund’s illiquid investment holdings exceed 15% of its net assets or if its highly liquid
10

investments fall below its minimum for more than a brief period of time. Furthermore, much as
proposed, the Commission is adopting reporting and disclosure requirements under Form NCEN, Form N-PORT, and Form N-1A regarding liquidity risk and liquidity risk management. In
response to commenters’ concerns, a number of the additional reporting items on Form N-PORT
will be non-public. 20
Taken together, these reforms are designed to provide investors with increased protection
regarding how liquidity in their open-end funds is managed, thereby reducing the risk that funds
will be unable to meet redemption or other legal obligations, and mitigating dilution of the
interests of fund shareholders. These reforms also are intended to give investors better
information to make investment decisions, and to give the Commission better information to
conduct comprehensive monitoring and oversight of an ever-evolving fund industry.
II.

BACKGROUND
A.

Open-End Funds
As we discussed in the Proposing Release, individual and institutional investors

increasingly have come to rely on investments in open-end funds to meet their financial needs
and access the capital markets. At the end of 2015, 54.9 million households, or 44.1 percent of
all U.S. households owned funds. 21 Funds allow investors to pool their investments with those
of other investors so that they may together benefit from fund features such as professional
investment management, diversification, and liquidity. Fund shareholders share the gains and

If any provision of these rules, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held to be
invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or application of such provisions to other persons or
circumstances that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application.

11

losses of the fund, and also share its costs. 22
As noted above, investors in mutual funds can redeem their shares on each business day
and, by law, must receive approximately their pro rata share of the fund’s net assets (or its cash
value) within seven calendar days after receipt of a redemption request. 23 Under the Act’s
definition of redeemable security, open-end funds have the right to redeem shareholders in cash
or in kind (that is, by delivering certain assets from the fund’s portfolio, rather than cash, to a
redeeming shareholder). 24 However, while funds often reserve the right to redeem in kind for

22

There are currently four primary kinds of open-end funds: money market funds, mutual funds other than
money market funds, ETFs, and ETMFs. Money market funds are a special kind of mutual fund that
complies with the requirements of rule 2a-7 under the Act. ETFs registered with the Commission are
organized either as open-end management investment companies or unit investment trusts. See section 4(2)
of the Act (defining “unit investment trust” as an investment company which (A) is organized under a trust
indenture, contract of custodianship or agency, or similar instrument, (B) does not have a board of
directors, and (C) issues only redeemable securities, each of which represents an undivided interest in a unit
of specified securities, but does not include a voting trust). Most ETFs are organized as open-end
management investment companies and, except where specified, when we refer to ETFs in this Release, we
are referring to ETFs that are organized as open-end management investment companies.

23

See section 2(a)(32) of the Act (defining a “redeemable security” as any security, other than short-term
paper, that entitles its holder to receive approximately his proportionate share of the issuer’s current net
assets, or the cash equivalent thereof), and section 22(e) of the Act (providing, in part, that no registered
investment company shall suspend the right of redemption, or postpone the date of payment upon
redemption of any redeemable security in accordance with its terms for more than seven days after tender
of the security absent specified unusual circumstances). See also rule 22c-1 (requiring that redeemable
securities be transacted “at a price based on the current net asset value of such security which is next
computed after receipt of a tender of such security for redemption or of an order to purchase or sell such
security”).

24

Prior to the adoption of the Act, open-end funds largely redeemed fund shares in cash and, as such, a
redeemable security was generally understood to mean a security that was redeemable for cash. See, e.g.,
Investment Trusts and Investment Companies: Senate Report 1775 on S. 4108, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. (1940),
at 2 (“[a redeemable security] is, a security which provides that the holder may tender it to the company at
any time and receive a sum of money approximating the current market value of his proportionate interest
in the company’s assets.”[emphasis added]). However, section 2(a)(32) has traditionally been interpreted
to give funds the option of redeeming their shares in cash or in kind. See, e.g., Investment Trusts and
Investment Companies: Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission Part I (1939) at 21 (“A
company is of the ‘open-end’ type if a shareholder has the right to require the company to purchase or
redeem or cause the purchase or redemption of the shares representing his proportionate interest in the
company’s properties, or the cash equivalent of such interest.”); see also Adoption of (1) Rule 18f-1 Under
the Investment Company Act of 1940 to Permit Registered Open-End Investment Companies Which Have
the Right to Redeem In Kind to Elect to Make Only Cash Redemptions and (2) Form N-18F-1, Investment
Company Act Release No. 6561 (June 14, 1971) [36 FR 11919 (June 23, 1971)] (“Rule 18f-1 and Form N18F-1 Adopting Release”) (stating that the definition of “redeemable security” in section 2(a)(32) of the
Investment Company Act “has traditionally been interpreted as giving the issuer the option of redeeming its

12

certain redemption requests, the majority of mutual funds redeem only in cash for a variety of
reasons, including the limited ability and/or unwillingness of fund shareholders to receive
securities rather than cash. 25
ETFs also offer investors an undivided interest in a pool of assets. 26 ETF shares, similar
to listed stocks, are bought and sold throughout the day by investors on an exchange through a
broker-dealer. 27 In addition, like mutual funds, ETFs provide redemption rights on a daily basis,
but, pursuant to exemptive orders, such redemption rights may be exercised only by certain large
market participants – typically broker-dealers – called “authorized participants.” 28 When an
authorized participant transacts with an ETF to purchase and sell ETF shares, these share
transactions are structured in large blocks called “creation units.” Most ETFs are structured so
that an authorized participant will purchase a creation unit with a “portfolio deposit,” which is a
basket of assets (and sometimes cash) that generally reflects the composition of the ETF’s
portfolio. 29 After purchasing a creation unit, an authorized participant may hold the ETF shares

securities in cash or in kind.”).
25

See Comment Letter of Invesco Advisers, Inc. (Jan. 13, 2016) (“Invesco Comment Letter”) (“The primary
problem with using redemptions in kind to meet large redemptions is the willingness and ability of the
redeeming entity to receive securities instead of cash.”). See also Money Market Fund Reform;
Amendments to Form PF, Investment Company Act Release No. 30551 (June 5, 2013) [78 FR 36834,
(June 19, 2013)] (“2013 Money Market Fund Reform Proposing Release”), at n.473 and accompanying text
(stating that “[m]any commenters believed that requiring in-kind redemptions would be technically
unworkable due to complex valuation and operational issues that would be imposed on both the fund and
on investors receiving portfolio securities.”).

26

Since 2003, the number of ETFs traded in U.S. markets has increased by more than 2,200 funds, and the
assets held by ETFs have increased from $151 billion at the end of 2003 to $2.1 trillion at the end of 2015.

or sell (or lend) some or all of them to investors in the secondary market. Similarly, for most
ETFs, when an authorized participant wishes to redeem ETF shares, it presents a creation unit of
ETF shares to the ETF for redemption and receives in return a “redemption basket,” the contents
of which are publicly declared by the ETF before the beginning of the trading day. 30
ETMFs are a hybrid between a traditional mutual fund and an ETF. 31 Like ETFs, ETMFs
have shares listed and traded on a national securities exchange; directly issue and redeem shares
in creation units only; impose fees on creation units issued and redeemed to authorized
participants to offset the related costs to the ETMFs; and primarily utilize in-kind transfers of
portfolio deposits in issuing and redeeming creation units. Like mutual funds, ETMFs are
bought and sold at prices linked to NAV and seek to maintain the confidentiality of their current
portfolio positions.
B.

The Role of Liquidity in Open-End Funds
1. Introduction
A hallmark of open-end funds is that they must be able to convert some portion of their

portfolio holdings into cash on a frequent basis because they issue redeemable securities, and are
required by section 22(e) of the Investment Company Act to make payment to shareholders for
securities tendered for redemption within seven days of their tender (although some funds may
reserve the right to make redemptions in kind for certain redemption requests). As a practical

30

See ETF Proposing Release, supra footnote 27, at n.24 and accompanying text.

31

The Commission approved ETMFs in 2014 and the first ETMFs have since been launched. See Eaton
Vance Management, et al., Investment Company Act Release No. 31333 (Nov. 6, 2014) (notice of
application) (“ETMF Notice”) and In the Matter of Eaton Vance Management, et al., Investment Company
Act Release No. 31361 (Dec. 2, 2014) (order) (“ETMF Order”). Given the similarities between ETFs and
ETMFs and that the new requirements will apply to ETMFs as they do to ETFs, this Release generally
includes ETMFs in the term “ETF” and separately mentions ETMFs only if appropriate. See supra
footnote 19.

matter, many investors expect to receive redemption proceeds in fewer than seven days as some
mutual funds represent in their prospectuses that they will generally pay redemption proceeds on
a next business day basis. 32 Given the statutory and regulatory requirements for meeting
redemption requests, as well as any potential liability for representations made to investors
regarding payment of redemption proceeds, a mutual fund must adequately manage the liquidity
of its portfolio so that redemption requests can be satisfied in a timely manner.
Sufficient liquidity of ETF portfolio positions also is important. Many ETFs typically
make in-kind redemptions of creation units, which can mitigate the need for ETFs to maintain
cash compared to mutual funds, particularly if the in-kind redemptions are of a representative
basket of the ETF’s portfolio assets that do not alter the ETF’s liquidity profile. However,
transferring illiquid or less liquid instruments to the redeeming authorized participants could
result in a liquidity cost to the authorized participants or other market participants, which could
increase the cost of their participation and interfere with their role in the ETF arbitrage
mechanism, resulting in the ETF trading at increased bid-ask spreads and/or a premium or
discount to its NAV and ultimately impacting investors. 33 Declining liquidity in an ETF’s basket
assets also could affect the ability of an authorized participant or other market participants to
readily assemble the basket for purchases of creation units and to sell securities received upon
redemption of creation units.
In addition, all ETFs reserve the right to satisfy redemption requests in cash rather than in
32

See supra footnote 10; see also supra footnote 8 (noting that open-end funds that are redeemed through
broker-dealers must meet redemption requests within three business days due to the application of rule
15c6-1 under the Exchange Act).

33

A significant amount of illiquid securities in an ETF’s portfolio can make arbitrage opportunities more
difficult to evaluate because it would be difficult for market makers to price, trade, and hedge their
exposure to the ETF. See infra footnote 843 and accompanying text. Commenters noted that the effective
functioning of this arbitrage mechanism has been pivotal to the operation of ETFs. See ICI Comment
Letter I.

kind, but the extent to which ETFs satisfy redemption requests in cash varies. While many ETFs
redeem in cash only rarely, some ETFs ordinarily redeem authorized participants in cash. ETFs
that elect to redeem authorized participants in cash in more than a de minimis amount, like
mutual funds, would need to ensure that they have adequate portfolio liquidity (in conjunction
with any other liquidity sources) to meet shareholder redemptions.
As noted above, ETMFs have features of both mutual funds and ETFs. As ETMFs would
redeem their shares on a daily basis from authorized participants, ETMFs would need to hold
sufficiently liquid assets to meet such redemptions to the extent that the ETMFs satisfy the
redemption requests in cash. As with ETFs, however, the ETMFs’ practice of making in-kind
redemptions could mitigate the need to maintain cash. Further, as ETMF market makers would
not engage in the same kind of arbitrage as ETF market makers because the pricing of the ETMF
shares is linked to the fund’s NAV (subject to execution costs), the liquidity of an ETMF’s
portfolio is more relevant to an ETMF’s ability to meet redemptions and the amount of execution
costs than to an arbitrage function.
2. Statutory and Regulatory Requirements
An open-end fund’s failure to maintain sufficiently liquid assets or otherwise manage
liquidity implicates multiple provisions of the Act, as well as other federal securities laws and
regulations. Section 2(a)(32) of the Act, 34 when read together with sections 4(2) and 5(a), 35
creates an obligation on open-end funds and UITs to provide shareholders with approximately
their proportionate share of NAV upon the presentation of a redemption request. Section 22(e)
34

See supra footnote 23.

35

Section 4(2) of the Act defines a “unit investment trust” as an investment company which, among other
things, “issues only redeemable securities.” Section 5(a) of the Act defines an “open-end company” as a
“management company which is offering for sale or has outstanding any redeemable security of which it is
the issuer”.

16

of the Act provides in turn that the right of redemption may not be suspended and payment of
redemption proceeds may not be postponed for more than seven days after tender of a
redeemable security absent specified unusual circumstances. 36
For decades, the Commission has recognized that because open-end funds hold
themselves out at all times as being prepared to meet these statutory redemption requirements,
they have a responsibility to manage the liquidity of their investment portfolios in a manner
consistent with those obligations and any other related representations. 37 Thus, long-standing
Commission guidelines contain a liquidity standard that generally limits an open-end fund’s
aggregate holdings of “illiquid assets” to no more than 15% of the fund’s net assets (the “15%
guideline”). 38 Under the 15% guideline, a portfolio security or other asset is considered illiquid

36

Section 22(e) of the Act permits open-end funds to suspend redemptions and postpone payment for
redemptions already tendered for any period during which the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) is
closed (other than customary weekend and holiday closings) and in three additional situations if the
Commission has made certain determinations. First, a fund may suspend redemptions for any period
during which trading on the NYSE is restricted, as determined by the Commission. Second, a fund may
suspend redemptions for any period during which an emergency exists, as determined by the Commission,
as a result of which it is not reasonably practicable for the fund to: (i) liquidate its portfolio securities, or
(ii) fairly determine the value of its net assets. Third, a fund may suspend redemptions for such other
periods as the Commission may by order permit for the protection of fund shareholders. The Commission
has rarely issued orders permitting the suspension of redemptions for periods of restricted trading or
emergency circumstances but has issued orders “for such other periods” under section 22(e)(3) on a few
occasions. See, e.g., In the Matter of The Reserve Fund, on behalf of two of its series, the Primary Fund
and the U.S. Government Fund, Investment Company Act Release No. 28386 (Sept. 22, 2008) [73 FR
55572 (Sept. 25, 2008)]; In the Matter of Municipal Lease Securities Fund, Inc., Investment Company Act
Release No. 17245 (Nov. 29, 1989); Third Avenue Temporary Order, supra footnote 12. Money market
funds are able to suspend redemptions in certain limited circumstances. See rule 22e-3 under the Act; see
also the Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at n.155.

depending on the facts and circumstances, such as private equity securities and certain other
privately placed or restricted securities 40 as well as certain instruments or transactions not
maturing in seven days or less, including term repurchase agreements. 41
Relatedly, the Commission has recognized that the liquidity management practices of
open-end funds implicate certain antifraud provisions of the securities laws. 42 For example,

guidance that set a 10% limit on illiquid assets for open-end funds. See Restricted Securities Release,

that must be considered when assessing the liquidity of these or other types of securities under the 15%
guideline. However, in the context of rule 144A securities, the Commission had provided “examples of
factors that would be reasonable for a [fund’s] board of directors to take into account” but which would not
necessarily be determinative. See Rule 144A Release, supra footnote 37. These factors include: the
frequency of trades and quotations for the security; the number of dealers willing to purchase or sell the
security and the number of other potential purchasers; dealer undertakings to make a market in the security;
and the nature of the security and the nature of the marketplace in which it trades, including the time
needed to dispose of the security, the method of soliciting offers, and the mechanics of transfer.

the persons responsible for the sale of its securities should give careful consideration to the possible
application of the provisions of section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.”); see also
Money Market Funds Release, supra footnote 39 (explaining that because “most money market funds
promise investors that they will receive proceeds much sooner” than seven days and “experience a greater
and perhaps less predictable volume of redemption transactions than do other investment companies,” they
“must have sufficient liquidity to meet redemption requests on a more immediate basis”). The Commission
has considered the failure to take risk-limiting measures in other contexts to implicate antifraud provisions
as well. See Adoption of Revisions to Rules Regulating Money Market Funds, Investment Company Act
Release No. 18005 (Feb. 20, 1991) (“The Commission believes that there is a significant danger of
misleading investors if an investment company holds itself out as a money market fund when it engages in
investment strategies not consistent with the risk-limiting conditions of rule 2a-7. It is therefore necessary
and appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors for the Commission to adopt a new
paragraph (b) of rule 2a-7 prohibiting an investment company from holding itself out as a ‘money market
fund’ unless it meets the risk-limited conditions of rule 2a-7.”).
43

Exercising authority under section 34(b) and sections 9(b), 38(a), and 42 of the Act, the Commission
adopted paragraph (b) of rule 2a-7 in 1997, which provides that “it shall be an untrue statement of a
material fact within the meaning of section 34(b) of the Act for a registered investment company . . . to
hold itself out to investors as a money market fund or the equivalent of a money market fund” unless the
fund complies with rule 2a-7. Under rule 2a-7, money market funds must maintain sufficient liquidity to
meet reasonably foreseeable redemptions, generally must invest at least 10% of their portfolios in assets
that can provide daily liquidity and at least 30% of their portfolios in assets that can provide weekly
liquidity, and may not acquire any illiquid security if, immediately after the acquisition, the money market
fund would have invested more than 5% of its total assets in illiquid securities. Rule 2a-7. Additionally,
the Commission adopted amendments to rule 2a-7 in 2014 that, among other things: (i) give boards of
directors of money market funds discretion to impose a liquidity fee or temporarily suspend the right of
redemption if a fund’s weekly liquidity level falls below the required regulatory threshold; and (ii) require
all non-government money market funds to impose a liquidity fee if the fund’s weekly liquidity level falls
below a designated threshold of 10%, unless the fund’s board determines that imposing such a fee is not in
the best interests of the fund. See Money Market Fund Reform; Amendments to Form PF, Investment

redeemed through broker-dealers generally represents to investors that it will redeem its
securities within three days, as required by rule 15c6-1. 48 Failure by a fund to maintain a
sufficiently liquid portfolio or to otherwise manage liquidity risk calls into question the fund’s
ability to fulfill the representations (explicit or implicit) made in its prospectus regarding its
ability to meet its redemption obligations, as well as its status as an open-end fund. Such failure
thus potentially exposes the fund, the investment adviser that manages the fund, and the persons
responsible for the sale of the fund’s securities to the possible application of the antifraud

See Restricted Securities Release, supra footnote 37 (describing the “serious problems of valuation” arising

properly value its portfolio securities is important, primarily because, under the Act, fund
shareholders are entitled to their proportionate share of the fund’s NAV upon redemption.
Section 2(a)(41) of the Act and rule 2a-4 thereunder provide that in determining NAV, funds
must value “securities for which market quotations are readily available” at current market value,
and must value all other securities and assets at “fair value as determined in good faith by the
board of directors.” Illiquid or less liquid assets are less likely to have readily available market
quotations, and thus are more likely to require a fair value determination. Determining the fair
value of illiquid or less liquid assets consistent with section 2(a)(41) and rule 2a-4 can pose a
number of challenges, some of which the Commission has previously described in the context of
the acquisition of restricted securities, 51 and improper valuation of such assets could result in
liability under the antifraud provisions. 52 The difficulties valuing illiquid or less liquid securities
also implicate section 22(c) and rule 22c-1, which requires the use of the next-determined NAV
for pricing purchases and redemptions. Transactions in such securities are more likely to be
effected at prices that differ from fair value and, therefore, may result in increasing risk of
investor dilution. 53

See Restricted Securities Release, supra footnote 37 at n.1 and accompanying text for a discussion of the
various valuation challenges facing purchasers and sellers of restricted securities.

52

See Restricted Securities Release, supra footnote 37. As the Commission explained there, “[t]he offering
price of securities issued by a management investment company is premised upon the net asset value of
such shares as determined pursuant to [section 2(a)(41)] of the Act and Rule 2a-4 thereunder and is so
represented in its prospectus.” Consequently, “the improper valuation of restricted securities held by such a
company would distort the net asset value of the shares being offered or, in the case of an open-end
company, redeemed, and would therefore constitute a fraud and deceit within the meaning of section 10(b)
and Rule 10b-5.” See also infra footnote 66.

53

See Restricted Securities Release, supra footnote 37, at n.1 (“the valuation of restricted securities by
reference to the market price for unrestricted securities of the same class assumes that the market price for
unrestricted securities of the same class is representative of the fair value of the securities. This may not be

22

A separate and independent issue arising from the failure to maintain a sufficiently liquid
portfolio is the risk of shareholder dilution associated with improper fund pricing. Thus, section
22(a), 54 when read together with section 22(c), 55 gives the Commission broad powers to regulate
the pricing of redeemable securities for the purpose of eliminating or reducing so far as
reasonably practicable any dilution of the value of the outstanding fund shares. In its 1969
guidance on restricted securities, the Commission observed that a fund with significant holdings
of restricted securities may have to engage in private sales on short notice to meet redemption
obligations, which could result in the fund “receiving less than its carrying value of the restricted
securities.” 56 That, in turn, would “result in a preference in favor of the redeeming shareholders
and a diminution of the NAV per share of shareholders who have not redeemed,” further
highlighting the need for funds to maintain “a high degree of liquidity” given the unpredictability
of redemption demands or other exigencies. 57 Similarly, here, as a general matter, to the extent a
fund’s portfolio is made up of a large amount of illiquid or less liquid securities, the fund may
face difficulties meeting shareholder redemption requests while at the same time protecting the
value of the shares of existing shareholders from dilution. Limited liquidity may hinder the
the case when the market for the unrestricted securities is very thin, i.e., only a limited volume of shares are
available for trading.”).
54

Section 22(a) authorizes securities associations registered under section 15A of the Exchange Act to
prescribe rules related to the method of computing purchase and redemption prices of redeemable securities
and the minimum time period that must elapse after the sale or issue of such securities before any resale or
redemption may occur, for the purpose of “eliminating or reducing so far as reasonably practicable any
dilution of the value of other outstanding securities of such company or any other result of such purchase,
redemption, or sale which is unfair to holders of such other outstanding securities.”

55

Section 22(c) authorizes the Commission to make rules and regulations applicable to registered investment
companies and to principal underwriters of, and dealers in, the redeemable securities of any registered
investment company, whether or not members of any securities association, to the same extent, covering
the same subject matter, and for the accomplishment of the same ends as are prescribed in section 22(a) in
respect of the rules which may be made by a registered securities association governing its members.

portfolio manager’s ability to defensively reposition the fund in anticipation of shifting or
volatile markets because asset sales necessary to effectuate those shifts can be executed only
with substantial liquidity costs. If limited liquidity in the fund’s portfolio limits which assets the
fund can sell to meet redemptions, such limited liquidity also could even result in the fund
straying from its investment objective. Accordingly, a fund that does not effectively manage its
liquidity risk may become constrained in its portfolio management, to the detriment of its
investors and contrary to the way the fund represents its investment strategy to the public. 58
Therefore, when constructing a fund’s portfolio of securities, it is essential for the fund to take
into account the importance of maintaining a portfolio that is liquid enough to fulfill the fund’s
obligations under these provisions. 59
As previously discussed, in addition to the seven-day redemption requirement in section
22(e), rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act also affects the timing of open-end fund redemptions
because the rule requires broker-dealers to settle securities transactions, including transactions in
open-end fund shares, within three business days after the trade date. Furthermore, rule 22c-1
under the Act, the “forward pricing” rule, requires funds, their principal underwriters, and
dealers to sell and redeem fund shares at a price based on the current NAV next computed after
receipt of an order to purchase or redeem fund shares, even though fund assets may be sold in
subsequent days in order to meet redemption obligations. 60

maximum flexibility in the choice of portfolio securities which, on the basis of their relative investment
merits, could best be sold where necessary to meet redemptions.”).

With the exception of money market funds subject to rule 2a-7 under the Act, 61 the
Commission has not promulgated rules requiring open-end funds to invest in a minimum level of
liquid assets. 62 As discussed above, the Commission has historically taken the position that, in
order to comply with section 22(e) and other applicable legal provisions, open-end funds should
maintain a high degree of portfolio liquidity to ensure that their portfolio securities and other
assets can be sold and the proceeds used to satisfy redemptions in a timely manner. 63 In addition
to a fund’s “general responsibility to maintain a level of portfolio liquidity that is appropriate
under the circumstances,” the Commission has stated that open-end funds must engage in
ongoing portfolio liquidity monitoring to determine whether an adequate level of portfolio
liquidity is being maintained in light of their redemption obligations. 64
Registered investment companies and their investment advisers are subject to rules under

Guidelines Release, supra footnote 38, at n.11 (“[T]he Commission expects funds to monitor portfolio
liquidity on an ongoing basis to determine whether, in light of current circumstances, an adequate level of
liquidity is being maintained. For example, an equity fund that begins to experience a net outflow of assets
because investors increasingly shift their money from equity to income funds should consider reducing its
holdings of illiquid securities in an orderly fashion in order to maintain adequate liquidity.”). Therefore,
under current SEC guidance, a fund experiencing net outflows may wish to consider managing its illiquid
asset holdings to maintain adequate liquidity. Similarly, a fund may need to determine whether it is
appropriate to take certain actions when the fund has determined that a previously liquid holding has
become illiquid due to changed circumstances. See also Rule 144A Release, supra footnote 37, at n.61.

certain of the fund’s service providers, including the fund’s investment adviser; the rule also
requires board approval and review of the service providers’ compliance policies and procedures.
Additionally, rule 206(4)-7 under the Advisers Act requires registered investment advisers to
adopt and implement written compliance policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent
violations of the Advisers Act and the rules thereunder by the adviser or any of its supervised
persons. Such compliance policies and procedures should be appropriately tailored to reflect
each firm’s particular compliance risks. 65 For example, an open-end fund holding a significant
portion of its assets in securities with long settlement periods or that trade infrequently may be
subject to relatively greater liquidity risks than other open-end funds, and should appropriately
tailor its policies and procedures in light of its particular risks and circumstances. The
Commission has brought enforcement actions under the compliance rules against funds and their
advisers for failures to adopt and/or implement policies and procedures reasonably designed to
prevent violations relating to, for example, disclosure, valuation, and pricing for assets with
limited liquidity. 66

65

In the compliance rules adopting release, the Commission highlighted certain, non-exclusive examples of
particular areas to be addressed in funds’ and advisers’ policies and procedures. For example, it stated that
funds or advisers should adopt policies and procedures regarding valuation and the pricing of portfolio
securities and fund shares, as well as the processing of fund shareholder transactions in accordance with
rule 22c-1. See Compliance Programs of Investment Companies and Investment Advisers, Investment
Company Act Release No. 26299 (Dec. 17, 2003) [68 FR 74714 (Dec. 24, 2003)] (“Rule 38a-1 Adopting
Release”) (“These pricing requirements are critical to ensuring fund shares are purchased and redeemed at
fair prices and that shareholder interests are not diluted.”). The Commission also identified “portfolio
management processes” as an issue that should be covered in the compliance policies and procedures of a
fund or its adviser and indicated that each fund should tailor its policies and procedures to address the
fund’s particular compliance risks. See id., at n.82 (noting that the chief compliance officer’s annual report
should discuss the fund’s particular compliance risks and any changes that were made to the policies and
procedures to address newly identified risks). The Commission further identified “the accuracy of
disclosures made to investors, clients, and regulators” as an issue to be covered.

Thus, funds and their advisers already are required to adopt and implement written
compliance policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of various
provisions implicated by fund liquidity, including those provisions identified above. The
liquidity risk management program requirements of rule 22e-4, which we are adopting here, in
effect will provide more specific and enhanced requirements in certain areas already generally
covered by the compliance program rules.
In short, there are a number of statutory and regulatory provisions across the federal
securities laws that bear on redemptions and the potential dilution of shareholders’ interests.
New rule 22e-4 advances the purposes of the Act by enhancing the ability of funds to meet their
redemption obligations, reducing the risk of shareholder dilution, and reducing the potential for
antifraud violations. 67
3. Liquidity Management by Open-End Funds
Portfolio managers consider a variety of factors in addition to liquidity when constructing
respect to adoption and implementation of valuation policies and procedures by mutual funds holding
securities with reduced liquidity and caused funds’ violations of rule 38a-1); In re UBS Glob. Asset Mgmt.

securities without an active market and violated rule 38a-1); In re Morgan Asset Mgmt., Inc., et al.,

67

One commenter argued that the Commission lacks the statutory authority to issue rule 22e-4. Comment
Letter of Justin Banks (Jan. 13, 2016) (“Banks Comment Letter”) (considering the authority conferred by
sections 22(c), 22(e), and 38 of the Act, although we note that in referring to our authority under section 38,
the commenter actually quoted and addressed the text of section 39 of the Act.). We disagree. The
Commission has ample authority under the Act, including sections 22(c), 22(e), and 38(a), as well as under
the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, to require that open-end funds maintain adequate
liquidity and adopt responsible liquidity risk management policies and procedures. See supra section
II.B.2. Section 38(a), in particular, gives the Commission authority to issue rules, regulations, and orders
“as are necessary or appropriate to the exercise of the powers conferred upon the Commission elsewhere in
this title.” As discussed above, the liquidity risk management program required under rule 22e-4 is
necessary and appropriate to reduce the risk that funds will be unable to meet their redemption obligations,
to improve industry-wide liquidity risk management practices, to mitigate potential dilution of the interests
of non-redeeming shareholders, and to increase the likelihood that funds are able to fulfill representations
made in their prospectuses and advertising materials and implicit in their open-end status.

27

a fund’s portfolio, including but not limited to the fund’s investment strategies, economic and
market trends, portfolio asset credit quality, and tax considerations. Nevertheless, meeting
redemption obligations is fundamental for open-end funds, and funds must manage liquidity in
order to meet these obligations. 68 Several factors influence how liquidity management by openend funds affects the equitable treatment of investors in a fund, investor redemption behavior,
and potentially the orderly operation of the markets when fulfilling redemption obligations.
First, it is important to consider how a fund meets redemptions. When a fund receives
redemption requests from shareholders, and the fund does not have cash on hand to meet those
redemptions, 69 the fund may sell portfolio assets to generate cash to meet the redemptions and
generally has the discretion to determine which assets will be sold. 70 It is possible that a fund
would choose to sell its most liquid assets first. This method of selling is limited to some degree
by the investment strategies of the fund, and a fund pursuing this method of meeting redemptions
to any significant degree may need to adjust its portfolio so that the fund continues to follow its
investment strategies. A fund that chooses to sell its most liquid assets to meet fund redemptions
68

See Comment Letter of Investment Company Institute on the Notice Seeking Comment on Asset
Management Products and Activities, Docket No. FSOC-2014-0001(“FSOC Notice”) (Mar. 25, 2015)
(“ICI FSOC Notice Comment Letter”) (“For mutual funds, the central importance of meeting redemptions
means that liquidity management is a key element of regulatory compliance, investment risk management,
and portfolio management—and a constant area of focus. Even before launching a mutual fund, the fund
manager and fund board consider whether the fund’s proposed investments and strategies are suitable for
the mutual fund structure, including whether it will be able to satisfy applicable regulatory requirements on
an ongoing basis. If not, the manager may decide to offer that strategy through a different vehicle (e.g., a
closed-end fund or a private fund).”). See also supra footnotes 2, 3, and 5-7.

69

A fund can have cash on hand to meet redemptions from cash held in the fund’s portfolio, cash received
from investor purchases of fund shares, interest payments and dividends on portfolio securities, or maturing
bonds. See, e.g., Comment Letter of Fidelity Investments on the Notice Seeking Comment on Asset
Management Products and Activities, Docket No. FSOC-2014-0001 (Mar. 25, 2015) (‘‘Fidelity FSOC
Notice Comment Letter’’), at n.17 (“[S]ecurities do not need to be sold every time a redemption order is
placed. Sale of fund assets is necessary only when gross redemptions significantly exceed net inflows.”).

70

A fund may also obtain cash by other available means such as bank lines of credit, but funds infrequently
utilize this method to meet redemptions. See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at n.35 and
accompanying text. See also infra footnote 262 and accompanying text for a discussion of the use of
interfund lending as an alternative source of cash for funds.

28

may minimize the effect of the redemptions on short-term fund performance for redeeming and
remaining shareholders, but may leave remaining shareholders in a potentially less liquid and
riskier fund until the fund adjusts the portfolio. 71 An ETF redeeming in kind with its most liquid
assets first would similarly leave remaining shareholders in a potentially less liquid and riskier
fund. In contrast to meeting redemptions by selling its most liquid assets first, a fund
alternatively could choose to meet redemptions by selling, to the best of its ability, a “strip” of
the fund’s portfolio (i.e., a cross-section or representative selection of the fund’s portfolio
assets). 72 Funds also could choose to meet redemptions by selling a range of assets in between its
most liquid, on one end of the spectrum, and a perfect pro rata strip of assets, on the other end of
the spectrum. Similarly, an ETF redeeming in kind could use a pro rata strip of assets.
Additionally, funds could choose to opportunistically pare back or eliminate holdings in a
particular asset or sector to meet redemptions.
Second, the effect of redemptions on shareholders is determined by how and when those
redemptions affect the price of the fund’s shares. Under rule 22c-1, all investors who redeem
from an open-end fund on any particular day must receive the NAV next calculated by the fund
after receipt of such redemption request. 73 As most funds, with the exception of money market
funds, calculate their NAV only once a day, this means that redemption requests received during
the day receive the end of day NAV, typically calculated as of 4 p.m. Eastern time. 74 When

71

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at n.37 and accompanying text.

72

There are practical limitations on a fund’s ability to sell a pro rata slice of its portfolio, such as minimum
trade sizes, transfer restrictions, illiquid assets, tax complications from certain sales, and avoidance of odd
lot positions.

73

The process of calculating or “striking” the NAV of the fund’s shares on any given trading day is based on
several factors, including the market value of portfolio securities, fund liabilities, and the number of
outstanding fund shares, among others.

74

Commission rules do not require that a fund calculate its NAV at a specific time of day. Current NAV

29

calculating a fund’s NAV, however, rule 2a-4 requires funds to reflect changes in holdings of
portfolio securities and changes in the number of outstanding shares resulting from distributions,
redemptions, and repurchases no later than the first business day following the trade date. 75 We
allowed this calculation method to provide funds with additional time and flexibility to
incorporate last-minute portfolio transactions into their NAV calculations on the business day
following the trade date, rather than on the trade date. 76 As a practical matter, this calculation
method also gave broker-dealers, retirement plan administrators, and other intermediaries
additional time to receive transactions submitted before the cut-off time on the trade date, which
then may be reflected in the fund’s NAV on the business day following the trade date.
Nevertheless, we recognize that trading activity and other changes in portfolio holdings
associated with meeting redemptions may occur over multiple business days following the
redemption request. If these activities occur (and their associated costs are reflected in NAV) in
days following redemption requests, the costs of providing liquidity to redeeming investors could
be borne by the remaining investors in the fund, thus potentially diluting the interests of
non-redeeming shareholders. 77 The less liquid the fund’s portfolio holdings, the greater these

must be computed at least once daily, subject to limited exceptions, Monday through Friday, at the specific
time or times set by the board of directors. See rule 22c-1(b)(1).

Rule 2a-4(a)(2)-(3).

Securities Issued by a Registered Investment Company, Investment Company Act Release No. 4105

77

The transaction costs associated with redemptions can vary significantly, with some costs having a more
immediate impact on shareholders than others. For example, during times of heightened market volatility
and wider bid-ask spreads for the fund’s underlying holdings, selling the fund’s investments to meet
redemptions will necessarily result in costs to the fund, which in turn may negatively impact investors who
chose to redeem in the days immediately following the stress event. The impact of such costs on the
remaining fund investors can vary depending on when a shareholder chooses to redeem. See, e.g.,

Products and Activities, Docket No. FSOC-2014-0001 (Mar. 25, 2015), at 6.

liquidity costs can become. 78
There can be significant adverse consequences to remaining investors in a fund that does
not adequately manage liquidity. 79 As noted above, the proportion of illiquid assets held by a
fund can increase if the fund sells its more liquid portfolio assets to meet redemptions. This in
turn could adversely affect the fund’s risk profile and cause the fund to have difficulty meeting
future shareholder redemptions. 80 For example, during the pendency of our proposal, the Third
Avenue Focused Credit Fund, a non-diversified open-end fund, adopted a plan of liquidation,
and requested and obtained exemptive relief to suspend shareholder redemptions. 81 The
Commission noted that the fund represented that, at the time the fund and its investment adviser
requested exemptive relief, it had experienced a significant level of redemption requests over the
prior six-month period that reduced the fund’s portfolio liquidity, as well as a significant decline

meaningful economic impact on the returns of passive, nontrading shareholders, particularly in U.S.-based
international funds. The overall sample of domestic equity funds shows no dilution impact, but we find an
annualized negative impact of 0.48% in international funds (and nearly 1% for a subsample of funds whose
daily flows are particularly large).”).

problems (caused in part by adviser’s unwillingness to sell bond holdings at prices below which the funds
had valued them) and, as a result, the funds borrowed heavily against a line of credit to meet fund
redemption requests, and investors redeemed fund shares at prices that benefited redeeming shareholders at
the expense of remaining and new investors).

See Third Avenue Temporary Order, supra footnote 12. But see infra footnote 209 and accompanying text.
We note that there is no assurance that the Commission would grant similar relief in the future. See also
ICI Comment Letter I (“Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund experienced a significant level of redemption
requests and an ongoing reduction in the liquidity of its portfolio securities, which consisted largely of junk
bonds…The SEC granted a temporary order under section 22(e)(3) after expressing concerns with a boardapproved plan of liquidation that provided for distribution to shareholders of the fund’s remaining net cash
and a separate transfer of the fund’s other assets into a liquidating trust.”); BlackRock Comment Letter

Avenue Focused Credit Fund, a small and highly concentrated portfolio can present its own liquidity
challenges.”); see also infra footnote 84.

in its NAV. 82 The fund’s board authorized the plan of liquidation after it determined that
additional redemptions would have to be made at prices that would unfairly disadvantage the
fund’s remaining shareholders. 83 This event highlights the extent to which shareholders can be
harmed when a fund holding portfolio assets that entail significant liquidity risk does not
adequately anticipate the effects of market deterioration and increased shareholder
redemptions. 84 Furthermore, if a fund finds that it can sell portfolio assets only at prices that
incorporate a significant discount to the assets’ stated value, the discounted sale prices can
materially affect the fund’s NAV.
These factors in fund redemptions—either individually or in combination—can create
incentives in times of liquidity stress in the markets for shareholders to redeem quickly to avoid
further losses (or a “first-mover advantage”). 85 If shareholder redemptions are motivated by this

liquidation, the fund had experienced $1.1 billion in estimated net outflows for the year to date through
December 9, 2015, which was more than 145% of the fund’s total net assets as of that date. Furthermore,
in November 2015, the fund experienced a total of $317 million in estimated net redemptions and the
fund’s retail class NAV per share fell from $7.82 to $7.09.

See Comment Letter of Americans for Financial Reform (Jan. 13, 2016) (“AFR Comment Letter”) (“By all
accounts, Third Avenue was holding the great majority of its assets in illiquid distressed debt and had very
limited cash reserves, a strategy that can increase returns but at the price of greatly increased risks for
investors… While the Third Avenue fund may be an outlier in terms of the sheer volume of illiquid assets it
holds, evidence also indicates that larger and more significant funds are also testing the bounds of previous
SEC guidance on liquidity, and are holding a large fraction of potentially illiquid assets. If such funds
come under selling pressure, the need to dispose of such assets could add to market stress in ways that have
a negative impact on corporate credit and the real economy, as well as potentially harming investors.”); see

fund increases, the incentive for remaining shareholders to redeem may also increase.
Additionally, a fund experiencing large outflows as a result of redemptions may be exposed to
predatory trading activity in the securities it holds. 86 Regardless of whether investor redemptions
are motivated by a first-mover advantage or other factors, there can be significant adverse
consequences to remaining investors in a fund when it fails to adequately manage liquidity. 87
This underlines the importance of fund liquidity management for advancing investor protection
by reducing the risk that a fund would be unable to meet redemption obligations without
significant dilution of remaining investors’ interests in the fund.

tendency among funds experiencing large inflows to expand existing positions creates positive price
pressure in overlapping holdings. Investors who trade against constrained mutual funds earn significant
returns for providing liquidity. In addition, future flow-driven transactions are predictable, creating an
incentive to front-run the anticipated forced trades by funds experiencing extreme capital flows.”); Teodor

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at n.37.

There also is a potential for adverse effects on the markets when open-end funds fail to
adequately manage liquidity. 88 For example, if liquid asset levels are insufficient to meet
redemptions, funds may sell less-liquid portfolio assets at discounted or even fire sale prices.
These sales can produce significant negative price pressure on those assets and correlated assets.
Accordingly, redemptions and funds’ liquidity risk management can affect not just the remaining
investors in the fund, but any other investors holding these assets. Depending on the asset and
the level of stress, such liquidity stress on the assets held in the fund has the potential to transmit
stress to other funds or portions of the market as well. 89

Recent Developments in the Open-End Fund Industry
Recent industry developments have underlined our focus on the importance of sufficient

liquidity and liquidity risk management practices in open-end funds. 90 These developments
include significant growth in assets of, and shareholder inflows into, open-end funds with fixed
income strategies and alternative strategies since 2008 and the evolution of settlement periods
and redemption practices utilized by open-end funds. We will discuss each of these
developments in turn.
1. Fixed Income Funds and Alternative Funds
We have observed significant growth in cash flows into, and assets of, fixed income

88

See, e.g., See Comment Letter of Americans for Financial Reform on the FSOC Notice (Mar. 27, 2015)
(“AFR FSOC Notice Comment Letter”) ( citing evidence that “bond fire sales by mutual funds during the
financial crisis created direct economic harm to real economy companies, reducing investment and
profitability over a period of years.”); Fidelity FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra footnote 69, at 18

remaining] shareholders as well as the broader financial markets.”).

We note that, up until 1970, open-end funds had limited investments in the bond market. See Protecting
Investors: A Half Century of Investment Regulation (May 1992) for a discussion of the regulatory and
market developments that occurred between 1940 and 1992.

mutual funds and fixed income ETFs (excluding ETMFs). 91 As growth in fixed income fund
assets was occurring, we increased our focus on fixed income market structure, publishing a
report on the municipal securities markets in 2012 and holding a roundtable focused on the fixed
income markets in 2013. 92 In addition, Commissioners and Commission staff have spoken about
the need to focus on potential risks relating to the fixed income markets and their underlying
liquidity. 93 Commission staff also has focused on the nature of liquidity risk management in
fixed income funds, including by selecting fixed income funds as an examination priority in
2014, 2015, and 2016. 94

91

Assets in these funds grew from $1.5 trillion at the end of 2008 to $3.6 trillion at the end of 2015, with net
inflows exceeding $1.4 trillion during that period. These figures were obtained from staff analysis of
Morningstar Direct data, and are based on fund categories defined by Morningstar. While mutual funds
holding U.S. equities continue to make up the largest category of funds in terms of fund assets, their share
of the total industry assets has declined from 65.2% in 2000 to 44.7% in 2015. DERA Study, infra footnote

staff used the CRSP US Mutual Fund Database to update them as of the end of 2015.

We also have observed significant growth in alternative mutual funds over the last
decade. 95 Although the assets of open-end funds pursuing alternative strategies accounted for a
relatively small percentage of the mutual fund market as of December 2014, the growth of assets
in these funds has been substantial. Assets of open-end funds with alternative strategies grew
from approximately $365 million at the end of 2005 to approximately $334 billion at the end of
2014. 96
Unlike alternative mutual funds and ETFs, private funds (such as hedge funds and private
equity funds) and closed-end funds pursuing similar alternative strategies can invest in portfolio
assets that are relatively illiquid without generating the same degree of redemption risk for the
fund because investor redemption rights are often limited. 97 In addition, investor expectations of
private funds’ redemption rights differ from the redemption expectations of typical retail

https://www.sec.gov/dera/staff-papers/white-papers/liquidity-white-paper-09-2015.pdf . While there is no
clear definition of “alternative” in the mutual fund space, an alternative mutual fund is generally
understood to be a fund whose primary investment strategy falls into one or more of the three following
buckets: (i) non-traditional asset classes (for example, currencies or managed futures funds); (ii) nontraditional strategies (such as long/short equity, event driven); and/or (iii) less liquid assets (such as private
debt). Their investment strategies often seek to produce positive risk-adjusted returns that are not closely
correlated to traditional investments or benchmarks, in contrast to traditional mutual funds that historically
have pursued long-only strategies in traditional asset classes.

their capital for the life of the fund. 99
In contrast, alternative strategy mutual funds and ETFs have no such ability to tailor
investor redemption rights based on the liquidity profile of the funds’ portfolios. Yet some of
these funds seek to pursue similar investment strategies as hedge funds and other private funds,
while still being bound by the redemption obligations applicable to open-end funds.
Accordingly, our staff has been focused on the liquidity of alternative strategy mutual funds and
ETFs (excluding ETMFs), as well as the nature of liquidity and redemption risks faced by
investors in these funds given their legal right to be paid the proceeds of any redemption request
within seven days and a fund’s representations about payment in less than seven days. 100 Certain
observations by the Commission’s Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (“DERA”) have lent
further support to our focus on liquidity risk management practices in this industry segment, as
DERA’s analysis has shown that alternative strategy mutual funds demonstrate cash flows that
are significantly more volatile than other strategies, indicating that these funds may face higher
levels of redemptions, and thus higher liquidity risk. 101 Volatility in flows places additional
importance on liquidity risk management to prevent some of the consequences from a failure to
adequately manage liquidity discussed in section II.B.2 above. The final rules and rule
amendments build off of many of the observations we and our staff have made through efforts
examining the growth in funds and ETFs with fixed income strategies and alternative strategies.

redemption proceeds to investors also have evolved considerably over the decades since the
Commission last addressed liquidity needs in open-end funds. 102 Due to the adoption of rule
15c6-1 under the Exchange Act in 1993, the standard settlement time frame declined from five
business days (T+5) to three business days (T+3). 103 Furthermore, while standard settlement
periods for securities trades in many markets have tended to fall significantly over the last
several decades—and investor expectations that redemption proceeds will be paid promptly after
redemption requests have risen—settlement periods for other securities held in large amounts by
certain funds have not fallen correspondingly. For example, some bank loan funds do not
consider most of their portfolio holdings to be illiquid and generally represent in their disclosures
that they comply with the Commission’s current guidelines, 104 even though the settlement
periods associated with some bank loans and participations may extend beyond the period of
time the fund would be required to meet shareholder redemptions. This creates a potential
mismatch between the timing of the receipt of cash upon sale of these assets and the payment of
cash for shareholder redemptions. 105
Overall, the evolution of the market towards shorter settlement periods – and
corresponding fund disclosures – combined with open-end funds holding certain securities with
longer settlement periods have raised concerns for us about whether fund portfolios are
sufficiently liquid to support a fund’s ability to meet its redemption and other legal obligations.

102

See supra footnotes 7-9 and accompanying text.

103

The decline in the securities trading settlement period from T+5 to T+3 prompted funds that were sold
through broker-dealers to satisfy redemption requests within three business days. See supra footnote 32.

D.

Overview of Current Practices
Over the last several years, Commission staff has observed through a variety of different

events the current liquidity risk management practices at a cross-section of fund complexes with
varied investment strategies. The staff has observed that liquidity risk management techniques
may vary across funds, including funds within the same fund complex, in light of unique fund
characteristics, including, for example, the nature of a fund’s investment objectives or strategies,
the composition of the fund’s investor base, and historical fund flows. These observations
collectively have shown the staff that, even with various unique characteristics, many open-end
funds and fund complexes have implemented procedures for assessing and managing the
liquidity of their portfolio assets. 106
Specifically, some of the funds observed by the staff assess their ability to sell particular
assets within various time periods (typically focusing on one-, three-, and/or seven-day
periods). 107 In conducting this analysis, these funds may take into account relevant market,
trading, and other factors, and monitor whether their initial liquidity determination should be
changed based on changed market conditions. This process helps these funds determine their
ability to meet redemption requests without significant dilution in various market conditions
within the disclosed period for payment of redemption proceeds.
Funds observed by the staff that have implemented procedures for assessing the liquidity
of their portfolio assets also often have developed controls to manage fund portfolio liquidity risk
106

There are varying degrees of formality in the adoption and implementation of these procedures. Several
commenters also discussed existing liquidity risk management practices. See, e.g., Blackrock Comment
Letter; ICI Comment Letter I; Comment Letter of Vanguard (Jan. 6, 2016) (“Vanguard Comment Letter”).

107

See 2014 Fixed Income Guidance Update, supra footnote 94 (noting that fund advisers “generally assess
overall fund liquidity and funds’ ability to meet potential redemptions over a number of periods” and
discussing certain steps that fund advisers may consider taking given potential fixed income market
volatility); see also Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at n.151 and accompanying text.

39

and the risk of changing levels of shareholder redemptions, such as holding certain amounts of
the fund’s portfolio in highly liquid investments, setting minimum cash reserves, and
establishing committed back-up lines of credit or interfund lending facilities. 108 A few of the
funds observed by staff conduct stress testing relating to the availability of liquid assets to cover
possible levels of redemptions. 109 Some of these funds’ advisers also have periodic discussions
with their boards of directors about how the funds approach liquidity risk management and what
emerging risks they are observing relating to liquidity risk. The staff has observed that some of
the funds with the more thorough liquidity risk management practices have appeared to be able
to better meet periods of higher than typical redemptions without significantly altering their risk
profile or materially affecting their performance, and thus with less dilutive impacts.
Conversely, the Commission is concerned that some funds employ liquidity risk
management practices that are substantially less rigorous. Some funds observed by the staff do
not take different market conditions into account when evaluating portfolio asset liquidity, and
do not conduct any ongoing liquidity monitoring. Some funds do not incorporate any
independent oversight of fund liquidity risk management outside of the portfolio management
process. 110 Staff has observed that some of these funds, when faced with higher than normal
redemptions, experienced particularly poor performance compared with their benchmark and
some even experienced an adverse change in the fund’s risk profile, each of which can increase
the risk of investor dilution as well as the risk that the fund will be unable to meet those
redemptions.

Finally, the Commission learned through staff outreach that many funds treat their risk
management process for assessing the liquidity profile of portfolio assets, and the incorporation
of market and trading information, as entirely separate from their assessment of assets under the
15% guideline. The former process is typically conducted on an ongoing basis through the
fund’s risk management function, through the fund’s portfolio management function, or through
the fund’s trading function (or a combination of the foregoing), while assessment of assets under
the 15% guideline is more typically conducted upon purchase of an asset through the fund’s
compliance or “back-office” functions, with little indication that information generated from the
risk management or trading functions informs the compliance determinations. This functional
divide may be a by-product of the limitations of the 15% guideline as a stand-alone method for
comprehensive liquidity risk management, a situation that our final liquidity risk management
program framework is meant to address. 111
Overall, our staff outreach has increased our understanding of some of the valuable
liquidity risk management practices employed by some firms as a matter of prudent risk
management. This outreach also has shown us the great diversity in liquidity risk management
practices that raises concerns regarding various funds’ ability to meet their redemption and other
legal obligations and minimize the effects of dilution under certain conditions. Collectively,
these observations have informed our understanding of the need for an enhanced minimum
baseline requirement for fund management of liquidity risk.
E.

Rulemaking Adoption Overview
Against this background, today we are adopting a set of reforms designed to promote

effective liquidity risk management throughout the open-end fund industry and thereby reduce
111

See supra section II.B.2 for a discussion of the limitations of the 15% guideline.

41

the risk that funds will not be able to meet redemption or other legal obligations and mitigate
potential dilution of the interests of fund shareholders. We believe that limitations on illiquid
holdings and more effective liquidity risk management among funds would, in turn, result in
significant investor protection benefits and enhance the fair and orderly operation of the
markets. 112 The final amendments also seek to enhance reporting and disclosure regarding fund
liquidity and redemption practices.
First, we are adopting new rule 22e-4, which requires each registered open-end fund,
including open-end ETFs but not including money market funds, to adopt and implement a
written liquidity risk management program reasonably designed to assess and manage the fund’s
liquidity risk. 113 The new rule requires a fund’s liquidity risk management program to
incorporate certain specified elements. These include: (i) assessment, management, and periodic
review of the fund’s liquidity risk; (ii) classification of the liquidity of each of the fund’s
portfolio investments, 114 as well as at-least-monthly reviews of the fund’s liquidity
classifications; (iii) determining and periodically reviewing a highly liquid investment
minimum—the percentage of its net assets that the fund invests in highly liquid investments that
are assets; (iv) limiting the fund’s investment in illiquid investments that are assets to no more
than 15% of the fund’s net assets; and (v) for funds that engage in, or reserve the right to engage
112

See infra section IV.C.

113

See rule 22e-4(b). Rule 22e-4, as adopted today, defines “liquidity risk” as the risk that a fund could not
meet requests to redeem shares issued by the fund without significant dilution of remaining investors’
interests in the fund.

114

As discussed in more detail below, rule 22e-4 as adopted requires a fund to classify each of the fund’s
portfolio investments, including investments that are liabilities of the fund (e.g., certain out-of-the-money
derivatives transactions). See infra footnote 480 and accompanying text. As proposed rule 22e-4 would
have required each fund to classify the liquidity of its portfolio positions (or portions of a position in a
particular asset), but did not specifically address the treatment of a fund’s holdings that are liabilities.
Thus, in this Release, we use the term “assets” when referring to the proposed classification requirement
and comments on the proposed requirement, and the term “investments” when referring to the adopted
classification requirement.

42

in, redemptions in kind, the establishment of policies and procedures regarding how they will
engage in such redemptions in kind.
The liquidity risk assessment requirement generally provides a broad, principles-based
foundational framework for a fund’s liquidity risk management program, including a
requirement that the fund assess whether its investment strategy is appropriate for an open-end
fund. The final rule also provides for a tailored program for ETFs, requiring them to consider
additional factors as part of their liquidity risk assessment and management that reflect potential
liquidity-related concerns that could arise from the structure and operation of ETFs, and
excepting ETFs that redeem in kind (“In-Kind ETFs”) from the classification and highly liquid
investment minimum requirements. 115 The final rule also provides that funds whose assets
primarily consist of highly liquid investments need not adopt a highly liquid investment
minimum. 116 Additionally, rule 22e-4 will not apply to closed-end funds, and will apply to
principal underwriters and depositors of UITs only to a limited degree, as discussed further
below. The classification requirement will provide important liquidity profile information to the
Commission and investors and reflects that liquidity may be viewed as falling on a spectrum
rather than a binary conclusion that an investment is either “liquid” or “illiquid.” 117 The highly
115

Under the final rule, each “In-Kind ETF,” or an ETF that meets redemptions through in-kind transfers of
securities, positions, and assets other than a de minimis amount of cash, will be subject to the tailored
program requirement. See rule 22e-4(a)(9) (definition of “In-Kind Exchange Traded Fund” or “In-Kind
ETF”); rule 22e-4(b)(1)(i)(D) (incorporating additional factors that an ETF would be required to consider
as applicable as part of its liquidity risk assessment and management that reflect liquidity-related risks that
could be particularly relevant to the ETF). Under rule 22e-4(a)(5), the term “fund” is defined to exclude an
In-Kind ETF. As a result, rule 22e-4(b)(1)(ii) and rule 22e-4(b)(1)(iii), which apply to funds as defined in
rule 22e-4(a)(5), exclude In-Kind ETFs from the classification and highly liquid investment minimum
requirements, respectively.

116

See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(iii) (applying the highly liquid investment minimum requirement only to a fund that
does not primarily hold assets that are highly liquid investments).

117

The Commission is adopting a classification framework consisting of four liquidity categories based on the
number of days within which it is determined that the investment is reasonably expected to be convertible
to cash (or, in the case of the least-liquid categories, sold or disposed of) without the conversion (or, in the

43

liquid investment minimum requirement is aimed at decreasing the likelihood that funds would
be unable to meet their redemption obligations.
Rule 22e-4 includes board oversight provisions related to the liquidity risk management
program. Specifically, a fund’s board will approve, but not design, the fund’s liquidity risk
management program, as well as the fund’s designation of the fund’s investment adviser or
officers as responsible for administering the day-to-day aspects of the fund’s liquidity risk
management program. 118 A fund also will be subject to board reporting requirements to the
extent that its investments in assets that are highly liquid investments fall below its minimum or
its assets that are illiquid investments rise above 15% of its net assets. 119 We anticipate that the
new program requirement will result in investor protection benefits, as improved liquidity risk
management could decrease the chance that a fund could meet its redemption obligations only
with significant dilution of remaining investors’ interests or changes to the fund’s risk profile.
Rule 22e-4, by requiring funds to limit illiquidity and manage liquidity, should reduce the
potential likelihood and extent of dilution of non-transacting shareholders that otherwise could
result from redemptions effected at prices determined in accordance with rules 22c-1 and 2a-4.
Thus, rule 22e-4, although it is numbered with reference to section 22(e), has a broader scope
and also should separately help rule 22c-1 operate so as to reduce dilution, as contemplated by
case of the least-liquid categories, sale or disposition) significantly changing the market value of the
investment. More specifically, as discussed below, rule 22e-4 would require a fund to classify each of its
portfolio investments into one of the following liquidity categories: highly liquid investments (category
based on fund’s reasonable expectation that an investment can be converted to cash within three business
days); moderately liquid investments (category based on fund’s reasonable expectation that an investment
can be converted to cash within four to seven calendar days); less liquid investments (category based on
fund’s reasonable expectation that an investment can be sold or disposed of in seven calendar days but the
settlement is reasonably expected to be greater than seven calendar days); and illiquid investments
(category based on fund’s reasonable expectation that an investment cannot be sold or disposed of within
seven calendar days).

Rule 22e-4(b)(1)(iii)(A)(3) and rule 22e-4(b)(1)(iv).

44

sections 22(a) and (c).
Second, we are adopting certain public disclosure- and confidential reporting-related
rules and amendments to provide shareholders and other users with additional information with
respect to funds’ liquidity risk profile as well as assist the Commission in its monitoring efforts.
Specifically, we are adopting reporting requirements on Form N-PORT that will require a fund
to report monthly position-level liquidity classification information and its highly liquid
investment minimum to the Commission on a confidential basis. 120 Form N-PORT will also
require a fund to publicly disclose the aggregated percentage of its portfolio representing each of
the four classification categories adopted by the Commission as of the end of each of its fiscal
quarters. 121
We are adopting new rule 30b1-10 and Form N-LIQUID to require a fund to
confidentially notify the Commission when the fund’s illiquid investment holdings exceed 15%
of its net assets or if its amount of highly liquid investments declines below its highly liquid
investment minimum for more than a brief period of time. We also are adopting amendments to
Form N-1A to require a fund to publicly disclose certain information regarding the fund’s
redemption procedures. Finally, we are adopting requirements for funds to provide information
on Form N-CEN about funds’ use of lines of credit and interfund lending.
We anticipate that these new requirements will facilitate the Commission’s risk and
120

We are adopting Form N-PORT today in a companion release. See Investment Company Reporting
Modernization, Investment Company Act Release No. 32314 (October 13, 2016) (“Investment Company
Reporting Modernization Adopting Release”) We discuss the Form N-PORT reporting requirements
related to rule 22e-4 in this Release, including the requirements that a fund report: (i) the liquidity
classification assigned to each portfolio position (which may be based on asset type to the extent discussed
below); (ii) the asset type label that the fund has assigned to each portfolio position, using any asset type
labeling scheme the fund employs in its own portfolio management systems; and (iii) the fund’s highly
liquid investment minimum.

121

This information will be reported monthly on Form N-PORT, but it will be disclosed to the public only for
the third month of each fiscal quarter with a 60-day delay.

45

compliance monitoring efforts by providing greater transparency regarding the liquidity
characteristics of fund portfolio holdings, as well as its ability to monitor and assess compliance
with rule 22e-4. While Form N-PORT and Form N-CEN are primarily designed to assist the
Commission, we believe that the requirements to publicly disclose certain information will also
help investors and other potential users utilize information on particular funds’ liquidity-related
risks and redemption policies, which in turn may assist investors in making more informed
investment choices. 122 As further discussed below, we believe that these reporting requirements
strike the right balance between protecting the funds from certain adverse effects that could arise
from public disclosure of detailed portfolio liquidity information with the need to provide
shareholders and other users with improved information about funds’ liquidity risk profile.
III.

DISCUSSION
A.

Program Requirement and Scope of Rule 22e-4
Today the Commission is adopting rule 22e-4 under the Investment Company Act. This

rule will require each registered open-end management investment company, including open-end
ETFs but not including money market funds, to establish a written liquidity risk management
program. Rule 22e-4 will not apply to closed-end funds, and will apply to UITs only to a limited
degree, as discussed further below.
1. Liquidity Risk Management Program
Rule 22e-4 generally will require each registered open-end management investment

122

See, e.g., Comment Letter of Markit on the Notice Seeking Comment on Asset Management Products and
Activities, Docket No. FSOC-2014-0001 (Mar. 25, 2015) (“[W]e believe that liquidity and redemption risk
contained in asset management products can be mitigated by providing risk managers or investors of
pooled investment vehicles better information about the liquidity risk associated with pool investments so
that they can price it more accurately. This could be done through, among other things, disclosures of the
‘prudent valuation’ (accounting for pricing uncertainty) of the fund’s investments and the implementation
of appropriate liquidity risk management policies and procedures.”).

46

company to establish a written liquidity risk management program. The majority of commenters
generally supported the proposed requirement for each fund to adopt a formal, written liquidity
risk management program, 123 although many commenters objected to certain aspects of the
proposal and suggested modifications to certain proposed program elements, as discussed in
more detail below. Other commenters opposed the proposed written program requirement,
asserting that funds have a history of successfully managing their liquidity and that the proposed
requirement was thus unnecessary. 124 We continue to believe, as discussed in the Proposing
Release, that the program requirement will produce significant investor protection benefits, in
light of the fact that funds are not currently subject to specific requirements under the federal
securities laws or Commission rules obliging them to manage their liquidity risk. Outreach by
Commission staff has identified practices at some funds that raise concerns regarding funds’
ability to meet their redemption obligations and lessen the effects of dilution. 125 The
Commission is thus adopting, as proposed, a requirement for each fund to adopt and implement a
written liquidity risk management program. 126 However, we note that the program requirement

we are adopting incorporates modifications to most of the proposed program elements. 127
A fund may, as it determines appropriate, expand its liquidity risk management
procedures and related disclosure concerning liquidity risk beyond the required program
elements. 128 While a fund would be required to adhere to certain requirements—such as the
requirement to classify the liquidity of a fund’s portfolio investments and determine a highly
liquid investment minimum 129—in other respects, the proposed program requirements would
permit each fund to tailor its liquidity risk management program to the fund’s particular risks and
circumstances. Commenters stressed that many funds are currently engaged in operational
practices that are designed to support fund liquidity and the redeemability of fund shares. 130
Commenters also noted that funds’ approaches to liquidity risk management should, and
currently do, differ markedly depending on their individual risks. 131 We believe that the program
requirement will permit funds that already have programs that satisfy the rule requirements to
continue to engage in the liquidity risk management practices that they have found to be
effective. However, the program requirement’s common obligations should strengthen liquidity
risk management across the fund industry, while also providing important transparency into
funds’ liquidity profiles and risk management practices.
2. Scope of Rule 22e-4 and Related Disclosure and Reporting Requirements
127

As discussed throughout this Release, we believe that these modifications respond appropriately to specific
concerns noted by commenters and help to increase the effectiveness of the program requirement in
advancing the Commission’s goals, while at the same time reducing associated burdens.

128

See supra footnotes 113-115 and accompanying text for a description of the required program elements.

129

In-Kind ETFs are excepted from the classification and highly liquid investment minimum requirements.
See infra section III.J. In addition, funds whose portfolios consist primarily of highly liquid investments
would not be required to determine a highly liquid investment minimum. See infra section III.D.5.

Comment Letter.

48

The liquidity risk management program requirements of rule 22e-4, as well as related
disclosure and reporting requirements, will apply to all registered open-end funds, except money
market funds. 132 Rule 22e-4 will apply to open-end ETFs, but incorporates tailored program
requirements to reflect their particular liquidity-related risks. 133 The final rule also excludes from
the highly liquid investment minimum requirement funds whose portfolios consist primarily of
highly liquid investments. Closed-end funds are excluded from the scope of rule 22e-4, 134 and
UITs are not subject to the rule’s general program requirement, although each UIT’s principal
underwriter or depositor will be required to determine, on or before the date of the initial deposit
of portfolio securities into the UIT, that the portion of illiquid investments that the UIT holds or
will hold at the date of deposit that are assets is consistent with the redeemable nature of the
securities it issues. 135 We discuss these scope determinations in more detail below.
a. Inclusion of Funds with All Investment Strategies and Inclusion of ETFs within the
Scope of Rule 22e-4
We are not excluding funds with any particular strategies from the scope of rule 22e-4. 136
We proposed to apply rule 22e-4 to all open-end funds (except money market funds) regardless
of the fund’s investment strategy, stating that even funds with investment strategies that have
historically entailed little liquidity risk could experience liquidity stresses in certain

132

Although money market funds are excluded from the scope of rule 22e-4, they will be subject to the
amendments to Form N-1A and Form N-CEN. See infra section III.A.2.a (“Inclusion of Funds with All
Investment Strategies and Inclusion of ETFs within the Scope of Rule 22e-4”); section III.A.2.b (“Inclusion
of Funds of All Sizes within the Scope of Rule 22e-4”); and section III.A.2.e (“Exclusion of Money Market
Funds from the Scope of Rule 22e-4”).

environments. 137 We also stated that different types of funds within the same broad investment
strategy could demonstrate different levels of liquidity and relatedly, different levels of liquidity
risk.
Some commenters expressed concern about the costs of some of the proposed
requirements relative to the liquidity risks typically associated with certain investment
strategies, 138 as well as concerns about burdensome effects of some particular requirements for
certain strategies. 139 Other commenters, however, generally supported a program requirement
that applies to all registered open-end funds, regardless of the fund’s investment strategy. 140 We
believe the modifications to the proposal we are adopting (in particular, changes to the
classification requirement and the proposed three-day liquid asset minimum requirement)
appropriately address commenters’ concerns and reflect support that some commenters provided
for a program requirement that applies to all registered open-end funds.
As noted above, rule 22e-4 will apply to open-end ETFs, although we are adopting
certain tailored program requirements for ETFs. 141 Some commenters objected to all or certain

138

See, e.g., infra footnote 1107 and accompanying text.

139

For example, some commenters expressed concerns about the extent to which the proposed liquidity
classification factors were applicable to certain investment strategies, particularly funds that invest in fixed
income or other OTC assets (see, e.g., Comment Letter of Federated Investors, Inc. (Jan. 13, 2016)
(“Federated Comment Letter”); Comment Letter of Government Finance Officers Association (Jan. 13,
2016) (“GFOA Comment Letter”); Comment Letter of Nuveen Fund Advisors, LLC (Jan. 13, 2016)
(“Nuveen Comment Letter”); Comment Letter of OppenheimerFunds (Jan. 13, 2016) (“Oppenheimer
Comment Letter”)). Commenters also expressed concerns about the extent to which a three-day liquid
asset minimum requirement could impede an index fund’s ability to track its index (see, e.g., BlackRock

We note that rule 22e-4 only applies to ETFs that are structured as open-end funds. For ease of reference,
however, unless indicated otherwise, when we refer to ETFs we mean open-end ETFs only.

proposed program requirements applying to ETFs. 142 We respond in detail to these comments in
section III.J below. We note, however, that while ETFs’ liquidity risks can differ from the
liquidity risks faced by other open-end funds, ETFs still have liquidity-related risks that could
affect their shareholders, as well as the broader markets in which they operate. The tailored
requirements that we are adopting for ETFs respond to commenters’ suggestions that the
Commission tie these funds’ liquidity risk management obligations to the particular risks that
they face, as well as our assessment of how these funds’ risks could most appropriately be
addressed. 143
b. Inclusion of Funds of All Sizes within the Scope of Rule 22e-4
Also, as proposed, we are not excluding any fund from the scope of rule 22e-4 on the
basis of size or adopting different liquidity requirements for relatively small funds. As discussed
in the Economic Analysis section below, smaller funds tend to demonstrate relatively high flow
volatility, and thus we believe they should be subject to the same liquidity risk management
requirements as other funds. 144 Conversely, some commenters argued that the proposed
classification requirement could unduly burden larger funds by inappropriately making these
funds appear to be less liquid than they actually are, and we have incorporated certain
modifications to the proposed classification requirement that we believe respond to these
concerns, as discussed below. 145
c. Exclusion of Closed-End Funds from the Scope of Rule 22e-4
As proposed, rule 22e-4 would have excluded closed-end investment companies from the

scope of rule 22e-4. As discussed in detail in the Proposing Release, closed-end funds’ liquidity
needs are different from those of open-end funds, because closed-end funds generally do not
issue redeemable securities and are not subject to sections 22(c) and 22(e) of the Investment
Company Act. 146 Although closed-end interval funds do have to comply with certain liquidity
standards under rule 23c-3 and therefore must manage their liquidity risk, we are not subjecting
them to rule 22e-4 because they are already required to adopt written liquidity procedures under
rule 23c-3(b)(10)(iii). 147 Closed-end interval funds may be better able to anticipate their liquidity
needs than open-end funds because closed-end interval funds do not permit daily redeemability,
closed-end interval funds must limit the size and timing of repurchase offers, and rule 23c-3
requires shareholders who wish to tender their shares pursuant to a repurchase offer to provide
advance notice thereof to such funds. 148 Commenters uniformly agreed that closed-end funds
should be excluded from the scope of rule 22e-4 and we continue to believe that closed-end
funds (including closed-end interval funds) should be excluded from the rule’s scope.
d. Separate Requirements for UITs Under Rule 22e-4

146

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at nn.132-135 and accompanying text. Certain closed-end funds
(“closed-end interval funds”) do elect to repurchase their shares at periodic intervals pursuant to rule 23c-3
under the Investment Company Act.

147

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at n.134.

148

See id., at text following n.135.

52

As proposed, the scope of rule 22e-4 did not include UITs. 149 As adopted today, the rule
will require a limited liquidity review under which the UIT’s principal underwriter or depositor
determines, on or before the date of the initial deposit of portfolio securities into the UIT, that the
portion of the illiquid investments that the UIT holds or will hold at the date of deposit that are
assets is consistent with the redeemable nature of the securities it issues. 150 UITs and their
principal underwriters and depositors will not, however, be subject to any of the rule’s other
liquidity risk management program requirements.
While one commenter supported excluding UITs from the scope of rule 22e-4, 151 several
other commenters argued that ETFs structured as UITs should be subject to the same rule
requirements as ETFs structured as open-end funds. 152 We respond in detail to these comments
in section III.K below, including discussing how we believe the requirement to determine that a
UIT’s illiquid investment holdings are consistent with the redeemable nature of the UIT’s
securities responds to commenters’ concerns.
e. Exclusion of Money Market Funds from the Scope of Rule 22e-4
Finally, as proposed, money market funds are excluded from the scope of rule 22e-4.
Money market funds are currently subject to extensive requirements concerning the liquidity of
their portfolio assets that are more stringent in many respects than the requirements of rule 22e-4,
due to the historical redemption patterns of money market fund investors and the characteristics

149

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at section III.A.2.

150

See rule 22e-4(c). The rule also requires UITs to maintain a record of that determination for the life of the
UIT and for five years thereafter.

of the assets held by money market funds. 153 Money market funds also are already subject to
broad liquidity-related disclosure and reporting requirements, 154 and they have certain tools at
their disposal to manage heavy redemptions that are not available to other open-end funds. 155 For
these reasons, we did not include money market funds within the scope of the proposed rule, and
commenters uniformly agreed that money market funds should be excluded from the rule’s
scope. 156 We continue to believe that money market funds should be excluded from the scope of
rule 22e-4.
B.

Assessment, Management, and Review of Liquidity Risk
Section 22(e) of the Investment Company Act requires a registered investment

company157 to make payment to shareholders for securities tendered for redemption within seven
days of their tender. 158 The legislative history of the Act indicates that shareholder dilution was a
significant concern of the Act’s framers. 159 An open-end fund’s ability to pay redeeming
shareholders within this seven-day period without significant dilution is directly related to its
liquidity. Thus, assessing and managing liquidity risk in a comprehensive manner is critical to
an open-end fund’s capacity to honor redemption requests within this seven-day period, as well
as within any shorter time period disclosed in the fund’s prospectus or advertising materials,
while mitigating dilution.

Today we are adopting a new liquidity risk assessment and management framework for
funds. Specifically, rule 22e-4 requires a fund to assess, manage, and periodically review its
liquidity risk, considering certain factors as applicable. As discussed in more detail below, the
requirements we are adopting incorporate a definition of “liquidity risk” that focuses on whether
a fund can meet redemption requests without significant dilution of remaining investors’ interests
rather than, as proposed, whether the fund can meet redemption requests without materially
affecting the fund’s NAV. 160 We are also adopting certain changes to the proposed factors that a
fund would consider in assessing and managing its liquidity risk. These changes aim to simplify
and streamline the proposed liquidity risk assessment and management factors, and reflect
additional considerations that the Commission, along with certain commenters, believes could
entail heightened liquidity risk. Notably, the proposed requirement to consider a fund’s
investment strategy and portfolio liquidity in assessing and managing liquidity risk now
incorporates the instruction that this consideration includes whether the investment strategy is
appropriate for an open-end fund, as well as whether the strategy involves a relatively
concentrated portfolio or large positions in particular issuers. 161 Additionally, the proposed
requirement to consider a fund’s short-term and long-term cash flow projections has been
simplified to eliminate the five separate sub-considerations relevant to this factor that were
incorporated in the proposed rule, but which now are discussed as guidance in this Release. 162
We proposed liquidity risk assessment and management program requirements with the
primary goals of reducing the risk that funds would be unable to meet redemption and other legal

obligations, minimizing dilution, and elevating the overall quality of liquidity risk management
across the fund industry while at the same time providing funds with reasonable flexibility to
adopt policies and procedures that would be most appropriate to assess and manage their
liquidity risk. 163 As we discuss throughout this section, we believe that the modified
requirements we are adopting today continue to reflect these goals, while promoting a more
efficient and workable framework.
1. Definition of “Liquidity Risk”
Rule 22e-4, as adopted today, defines “liquidity risk” as the risk that a fund could not
meet requests to redeem shares issued by the fund without significant dilution of remaining
investors’ interests in the fund. 164 This definition is largely similar to the proposed definition of
“liquidity risk,” that is, the risk that a fund could not meet requests to redeem shares issued by
the fund that are expected under normal conditions, or are reasonably foreseeable under stressed
conditions, without materially affecting the fund’s NAV. 165 However, in response to comments,
the revised definition substitutes the phrase “without significant dilution of remaining investors’
interests in the fund” for the phrase “without materially affecting the fund’s net asset value.”
The definition also does not include references to redemption requests that are expected under
normal conditions or reasonably foreseeable under stressed conditions. Instead, the final
definition simply refers to “requests to redeem.” We believe our modifications to the liquidity
163

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at paragraph following n.261.

164

When determining whether a fund’s liquidity risk will cause significant dilution for purposes of this
definition, a fund should consider the impact of liquidity risk on the total net assets of the fund and the
adverse consequences such dilution will have on all the fund’s remaining shareholders. Furthermore, as
discussed above, a fund’s inability to meet redemption requests may cause harm to shareholders. See, e.g.,
supra footnotes 81-84 and accompanying text for a discussion of the suspension of shareholder
redemptions in the Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund following a period of heavy redemptions that the
fund stated reduced the fund’s portfolio liquidity.

165

See proposed rule 22e-4(a)(7); see also Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at text accompanying n.255.

56

risk factors used to assess a fund’s liquidity risk, as discussed below, make any reference to
market conditions within the definition of liquidity risk unnecessary, confusing, and
duplicative. 166
a. Evaluating Risk of Significant Dilution of Remaining Investors’ Interests
Multiple commenters objected to the proposed inclusion of any NAV-impact standard in
the definition of “liquidity risk.” One commenter argued that including the concept of “without
materially affecting the fund’s net asset value” in the definition of liquidity risk would
inappropriately merge liquidity and valuation, which are subject to different regulatory and
compliance controls. 167 Many commenters also objected that including such a price concept in
the definition of “liquidity risk” would incorrectly indicate that market impact can be accurately
identified and measured separate from market price movements generally. 168 These commenters
argued that many factors (including market volatility, portfolio composition, and trade execution
and activity) influence the price at which a fund transacts in a security as well as the levels of
cash the fund holds, and thus it is difficult to identify the effects of the fund’s transaction activity
on the fund’s NAV. Finally, some commenters argued that the inclusion of a NAV-impact
standard in the definition of “liquidity risk” could lead investors to believe that appropriate
liquidity risk management will protect their investments from declining in value. 169
While we agree that liquidity and valuation are distinct concepts, we consider these

Commission to adopt a definition of liquidity risk that incorporates language related directly to dilution

concepts as having certain inter-relationships. First, liquidity risk in an open-end fund inherently
involves an assessment of the liquidity of the fund’s investments. Common definitions of
investment liquidity include consideration of the value impact or costs from trading that
investment. 170 Second, our staff has observed in its outreach many occasions when a fund was
unwilling to transact in certain portfolio investments when such sales would yield a price that the
fund considered unacceptable. 171 This relationship is clear in the Commission guidelines limiting
a fund’s investment in illiquid investments. These guidelines specify that an illiquid investment
is one that cannot be sold or disposed of within seven days at approximately the value at which
the fund has valued the investment” (emphasis added). 172 We continue to believe that the
170

See, e.g., Radhakrishnan Gopalan, et al., Asset Liquidity and Stock Liquidity, 47 J. FIN & QUANT. ANAL.
333 (2012), available at http://apps.olin.wustl.edu/faculty/gopalan/asset_stock_liquidity.pdf (“An asset is
liquid if it can be converted into cash quickly and at a low cost.”); Yakov Amihud & Haim Mendelson,

http://www.jstor.org/stable/4479488?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents (“An asset is liquid if it can be bought
or sold at the current market price quickly and at low cost.”).
In addition, we note that many funds disclose liquidity risk as a principal investment risk in their
prospectuses, and these disclosures often reference possible adverse value impacts from selling fund
investments under certain conditions. See, e.g., Schwab Strategic Trust rule 485(b) Registration Statement
(June 30, 2016), available at
https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1454889/000119312516632635/d203200d485bpos.htm
(“Liquidity Risk. The fund may be unable to sell certain securities, such as illiquid securities, readily at a
favorable time or price, or the fund may have to sell them at a loss.”); Voya Variable Funds rule 485(b)
Registration Statement (May 1, 2016), available at
https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2664/000119312516562669/d124096d485bpos.htm (“Liquidity:
If a security is illiquid, the [fund] might be unable to sell the security at a time when the [fund’s] manager
might wish to sell, or at all. Further, the lack of an established secondary market may make it more
difficult to value illiquid securities, exposing the [fund] to the risk that the price at which it sells illiquid
securities will be less than the price at which they were valued when held by the [fund]. The prices of
illiquid securities may be more volatile than more liquid investments. The risks associated with illiquid
securities may be greater in times of financial stress. The [fund] could lose money if it cannot sell a
security at the time and price that would be most beneficial to the Portfolio.”).

171

That is, the price that a portfolio manager could realistically receive for certain portfolio investments could,
in effect, render such investments de facto illiquid if these pricing considerations cause the portfolio
manager to refrain from selling them. See, e.g., Third Avenue Temporary Order, supra footnote 12 (“On
December 9, 2015, after considering the environment the Fund was in and the likelihood that incremental
sales of portfolio securities to satisfy additional redemptions would have to be made at prices that would
unfairly disadvantage all remaining shareholders, the Board determined that the fairest action on behalf of
all shareholders would be to adopt a plan of liquidation.”).

172

See supra footnote 39 and accompanying text.

58

inclusion of a conceptual relationship between liquidity and sale price in the definition of
“liquidity risk” is appropriate. 173 Such a relationship indicates that liquidity risk involves the risk
that a fund will not be able to meet redemption requests under any circumstances, as well as the
risk that a fund could meet redemption requests, but only in a manner that adversely affects the
fund’s non-redeeming shareholders through significant dilution. 174
We believe a definition of “liquidity risk” that includes a reference to the value impact
from trading portfolio investments should not imply that mutual fund shareholders are
guaranteed a protected NAV or that the fund cannot sell investments at a loss due to market risk,
credit deterioration, or liquidity risk. Indeed, funds’ narrative risk disclosure in their registration
statements and other shareholder communications generally should make clear those risks that
could adversely affect the fund’s NAV, yield, and total return, including liquidity-related risks. 175
However, we believe defining liquidity risk clarifies what funds must manage under rule 22e-4,

173

We also note that several commenters favorably discussed foreign and international regulators’ liquidity
risk management regimes, including ones that define the concepts of liquid (or illiquid) portfolio assets, as
well as funds’ liquidity risk, with reference to value impact or a discount that the fund may incur upon sale.
See, e.g., Dechert Comment Letter (favorably discussing certain liquidity risk management requirements,
including the definition of “liquidity risk,” under the UCITS Directive); ICI Comment Letter I (noting that
the Commission could look to other jurisdictions, including the European Union, for support for a
principles-based program rule); Invesco Comment Letter (also noting that the UCITS Directive provides a
framework for a principles-based liquidity risk management program requirement); see also Commission
Directive 2010/43/EU, OJ L 176 (2010), at Ch. 1, Art. 3(8) (defining “liquidity risk” as “the risk that a
position in the UCITS portfolio cannot be sold, liquidated or closed at limited cost in an adequately short
time frame and that the ability of the UCITS to comply at any time with its redemption obligation is
thereby compromised”); Ontario Securities Commission, Report on Staff’s Continuous Disclosure Review
of Mutual Fund Practices Relating to Portfolio Liquidity, OSC Staff Notice 81-727 (June 25, 2015)
(definition of “illiquid asset” refers to the “ability to readily dispose of a portfolio asset through a market
facility on which public quotations are available at a price that approximates the amount at which the
portfolio asset is valued”).
We note as well that U.S. banking regulators have defined “liquidity” as “a financial institution’s capacity
to meet its cash and collateral obligations at a reasonable cost.” Interagency Policy Statement on Funding
and Liquidity Risk Management, 75 FR 13656 (Mar. 22, 2010), available at http://www.occ.gov/newsissuances/federal-register/75fr13656.pdf.

See, e.g., Item 4(b) of Form N-1A.

59

and, for the reasons discussed above, we believe impacts on valuation may play a significant role
in evaluating the ability to effectively meet shareholder redemptions while lessening the effects
of dilution.
Nonetheless, we agree with commenters that using the proposed specific standard of
“materially affecting the fund’s NAV” may pose certain challenges. We recognize that it may be
difficult to calculate the particular market impact that a fund’s transactions in an investment will
have on that investment’s price, which some commenters suggested was inherent to the proposed
standard. There could be other reasons for a fund’s NAV fluctuating, separate from the fund’s
sales of portfolio investments to meet redemption requests as well.
Accordingly, in the final rule we have modified the NAV-impact standard in the
definition of “liquidity risk” to substitute the phrase “without significant dilution of remaining
investors’ interests in the fund” for the phrase “without materially affecting the fund’s net asset
value.” This revised standard more directly corresponds to the concerns of the Act 176 and rule
22e-4 by focusing on meeting investor redemptions without dilution.
We also note that commenter interpretations of the term “materially” varied, with some
commenters adopting very narrow interpretations 177 of the term and others taking a more broad
view. 178 We note that, for purposes of this definition, the term “significant” is not meant to

See supra footnote 32and accompanying text for a discussion of the liquidity concerns of the Act.

177

See Comment Letter of Interactive Data Pricing and Reference Data (Dec. 18, 2015) (“Interactive Data
Comment Letter”) (noting that there are several possible interpretations of the term, including an NAV
price impact based on a one penny movement, among others.).

178

See SIFMA Comment Letter I (proposing the Commission substitute the phrase “assuming no fire-sale
discounting” for the phrase “without materially affecting the fund’s net assets” and arguing that a fire-sale
standard is a more appropriate outer boundary for price movements.). We believe that adopting a fire-sale
standard as the outer boundary for price movements would be inappropriate because such an extreme outer
boundary would fail to capture a fund’s liquidity risk exposure during normal and stressed conditions and
would, thus, inadequately address the liquidity risk management concerns of rule 22e-4.

60

reference slight NAV movements, the causes of which may not be easily distinguishable, nor is it
limited only to fire-sale situations. Instead, a fund’s liquidity risk management program should
focus on the fund’s ability to meet redemptions in a manner that does not harm shareholders. 179
In particular, “significant” dilution of remaining investors’ interests in the fund can occur at
much lower levels of dilution than what would occur in a fire sale situation. We believe
“significant” conveys more effectively than “materially” that the definition is not meant to
reference slight NAV movements, while avoiding the confusion around the term “materially”
evident in the comment letters and better focusing the rule on the level of dilution that would
harm remaining investors’ interests even in the absence of a fire sale.
Under rule 22e-4, a fund would be required to adopt a liquidity risk management program
that is “reasonably designed to assess and manage the fund’s liquidity risk.” A fund’s liquidity
risk management program should be appropriately tailored to reflect that fund’s particular
liquidity risks. Therefore, while a fund is required to consider certain liquidity risk factors
specified in rule 22e-4 as applicable, a fund may also, as it determines appropriate, expand its
liquidity risk management program beyond the required program elements, and must do so to the
extent it would be necessary to effectively assess and manage its liquidity risk. 180 This
requirement, however, requires a fund to assess and manage liquidity risk and does not require a
fund to eliminate all adverse impacts of liquidity risk, which would be incompatible with an
investment product such as a mutual fund or ETF, whose NAV may fluctuate for a variety of
179

The classification requirements under rule 22e-4 include a value impact standard as well, which is based on
the number of days within which it is determined that an investment would be convertible to cash (or, in the
case of the less-liquid and illiquid categories, sold or disposed of) without the conversion (or, in the case of
the less-liquid and illiquid categories, sale or disposition) significantly changing the market value of the
investment. See infra section III.C and accompanying text.

180

Rule 22e-4(b) requires that a fund “adopt and implement a written liquidity risk management program that
is reasonably designed to assess and manage its liquidity risk,” and identifies certain specific elements that
a fund must consider in doing so.

61

reasons, including changing liquidity conditions.
b. Expected and Reasonably Foreseeable Redemption Requests
As proposed, the definition of “liquidity risk” would have required funds to consider
redemption requests that are expected under normal conditions, as well as those that are
reasonably foreseeable under stressed conditions. Some commenters stated that the concept of
redemption requests that are reasonably foreseeable under stressed conditions was vague and
could subject funds to ex-post second guessing. 181 One commenter suggested that the
Commission clarify: (i) whether funds should address both normal and reasonably foreseeable
stressed conditions (or select one set of conditions) in assessing liquidity risk; and (ii) the level of
market stress that funds should assume in conducting a liquidity risk assessment. 182
The final definition of liquidity risk eliminates references to redemption requests that are
expected under normal conditions or reasonably foreseeable under stressed conditions. The final
definition simply refers to “requests to redeem.” We believe our modifications to the liquidity
risk factors used to assess a fund’s liquidity risk, including the clarification that a fund must
consider certain liquidity risk factors both during normal and reasonably foreseeable stressed
conditions, makes any reference to market conditions within the definition of liquidity risk
unnecessary, confusing and duplicative. We believe the revised definition also addresses
commenters’ concerns that the proposed definition was unclear. We have provided guidance
below regarding each liquidity risk factor and the need to consider normal and reasonably
foreseeable stressed market conditions.

2. Liquidity Risk Factors
Rule 22e-4 will require each fund to assess, manage, and periodically review (with such
review occurring no less frequently than annually) its liquidity risk, considering the following
factors as applicable:
•

Investment strategy and liquidity of portfolio investments during both normal and
reasonably foreseeable stressed conditions (including whether the investment strategy
is appropriate for an open-end fund, the extent to which the strategy involves a
relatively concentrated portfolio or large positions in particular issuers, and the use of
borrowings for investment purposes and derivatives);

•

Short-term and long-term cash flow projections during both normal and reasonably
foreseeable stressed conditions; and

•

Holdings of cash and cash equivalents, as well as borrowing arrangements and other
funding sources. 183

A fund may incorporate other considerations, in addition to these factors, in evaluating its
liquidity risk.
Like the rule we are adopting today, rule 22e-4 as proposed would have required each
fund to assess its liquidity risk, taking certain specified factors into account. 184 Specifically, the
proposed rule would have required each fund to take the following factors into account in
183

See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(i). We note that rule 22e-4 as adopted also includes two additional factors that an ETF
will have to consider as applicable in assessing, managing, and periodically reviewing its liquidity risk,
which reflect potential liquidity-related concerns that could arise from the structure and operation of ETFs
(including In-Kind ETFs). These are: (i) the relationship between the ETF’s portfolio liquidity and the way
in which, and the prices and spreads at which, ETF shares trade, including, the efficiency of the arbitrage
function and the level of active participation by market participants (including authorized participants); and
(ii) the effect of the composition of baskets on the overall liquidity of the ETF’s portfolio. These factors
are discussed in more detail below. See infra section III.J.

184

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at section III.C.1.

63

assessing the fund’s liquidity risk: (i) short-term and long-term cash flow projections,
considering size, frequency, and volatility of historical purchases and redemptions of fund shares
during normal and stressed periods; the fund’s redemption policies; the fund’s shareholder
ownership concentration; the fund’s distribution channels; and the degree of certainty associated
with the fund’s short-term and long-term cash flow projections; (ii) the fund’s investment
strategy and liquidity of portfolio investments; (iii) use of borrowings and derivatives for
investment purposes; and (iv) holdings of cash and cash equivalents, as well as borrowing
arrangements and other funding sources. 185 The person(s) designated to administer the liquidity
risk management program must also conduct reviews of the adequacy and effectiveness of the
implementation of the liquidity risk management program, and such reviews must occur no less
frequently than annually. 186 Commenters generally supported the requirement for a fund to
assess its liquidity risk. 187 Additionally, some commenters expressed support for the proposed
liquidity risk factors, as well as the proposed requirement to consider these factors in assessing
liquidity risk. 188 However, several commenters objected to the proposed requirement for a fund
to consider certain specified factors and suggested instead that consideration of the factors be
permissive instead of mandatory. 189
We continue to believe that the factors are central to evaluating and managing a fund’s
liquidity risk and that requiring each fund to consider, as a baseline, a standard set of factors for
assessing and managing liquidity risk would promote effective and thorough liquidity risk

management across the fund industry. However, we recognize that some of the proposed factors
may not be applicable in assessing and managing the liquidity risk of certain funds or types of
funds. 190 One commenter requested that we clarify that a fund only needs to consider factors
relevant to its operations, which may include some or all of the factors outlined in rule 22e-4,
and others not enumerated. 191 We agree, and to the extent any liquidity risk factor specified in
rule 22e-4 is not applicable to a particular fund, the fund will not be required to consider it in
assessing and managing its liquidity risk. We have therefore added the words “as applicable” in
the rule’s instruction to consider the specified factors. 192 For example, a fund will not be
required to consider the use of borrowings for investment purposes and derivatives, as specified
under rule 22e-4(b)(1)(i)(A), if that fund does not engage in borrowing or use derivatives.
Similarly, a fund that maintains borrowing sources for investment purposes will be required to
consider the use of borrowings for investment purposes as specified under the rule. We also
believe that condensing and simplifying the proposed factors helps respond to commenters’
concerns that the proposed factors were overly complex 193 and potentially inapplicable to certain
funds. 194
As noted above, this list of liquidity risk factors is not meant to be exhaustive. In
assessing, managing, and periodically reviewing its liquidity risk, a fund may take into account
considerations in addition to the factors set forth in rule 22e-4 and must do so to the extent

necessary to adequately assess and manage the fund’s liquidity risk. 195 For example, as discussed
in the Proposing Release, if a fund elects to conduct stress testing to determine whether it has
sufficient liquid investments to cover different levels of redemptions, a fund may wish to
incorporate the results of this stress testing into its liquidity risk assessment and management. 196
We continue to believe that stress tests that analyze the proposed factors could be particularly
useful to a fund in evaluating its liquidity risk.
Below we provide guidance on specific issues associated with each of the liquidity risk
factors and also discuss the Commission’s decision to adopt each of these factors (some with
modifications).
a. Investment Strategy and Portfolio Liquidity
We are adopting the proposed requirement for a fund to consider its investment strategy
and portfolio liquidity in assessing, managing, and periodically reviewing its liquidity risk, but
with certain modifications in response to commenters. 197 The principal changes include a
requirement to consider whether the investment strategy is appropriate for an open-end fund, as
well as the extent the strategy involves a relatively concentrated portfolio or large positions in
particular issuers, and a clarification that this factor should be assessed both during normal and
reasonably foreseeable stressed conditions.
We continue to believe that various aspects of a fund’s investment strategy—including
whether the fund is actively or passively managed 198 and a fund’s portfolio management

decisions that are meant in part to decrease an undesirable tax impact on the fund 199— could
significantly affect the fund’s liquidity risk. Also the extent to which the fund is diversified,
including a fund’s status as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal
Revenue Code, as well as its principal investment strategies as disclosed in its prospectus, could
affect its liquidity risk in that the fund could be limited by its diversification obligations in its
ability to sell certain portfolio securities. 200 We note, for example, that the Third Avenue
Focused Credit Fund stated that its status as a regulated investment company under Subchapter
M limited the fund’s ability to return cash to its shareholders after it suspended redemptions
because of its need to comply with certain asset diversification tests to maintain its regulated
investment company status. 201 As discussed in the Proposing Release, we also continue to
caution that while a fund’s investment strategy is an important factor in evaluating a fund’s
liquidity risk, different types of funds within the same broad investment strategy may
demonstrate different levels of liquidity, (and thus, presumably, different levels of liquidity
risk). 202

199

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at paragraph accompanying n.299 (detailing the ways in which a
fund’s tax management strategy could make its portfolio managers unwilling to sell certain portfolio assets
in order to meet redemptions, which could in turn increase the fund’s liquidity risk compared to a similarly
situated fund).

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at paragraph accompanying nn.296-298 (discussing the extent to
which a fund’s portfolio is diversified (or, relatedly, a fund’s concentration in certain types of portfolio
assets) could have ramifications on the fund’s potential liquidity risk, including the ways that various
diversification requirements could constrain its ability to sell certain portfolio securities in order to meet
redemptions).

diversification tests under Subchapter M would require the fund to have less than 50% of its assets in
concentrated positions, the fund needed to retain cash in order not to violate this test, in light of the manner
in which it chose to manage the fund’s liquidation of its other assets).

Consideration of Strategy Appropriateness for Open-End Fund Structure
We are adopting several modifications to the proposed requirement to consider a fund’s
investment strategy and portfolio liquidity in assessing, managing, and periodically reviewing its
liquidity risk. First, we clarify in final rule 22e-4 that consideration of investment strategy must
take into account whether the fund’s strategy is appropriate for an open-end fund. This
clarification reflects several commenters’ suggestions that a fund’s liquidity risk management
program could (or should) involve a consideration of whether the fund’s investment strategy and
permissible holdings are suitable for the open-end structure. 203
We agree with this suggestion raised by commenters. As discussed above, all open-end
funds are subject to section 22(e) of the Investment Company Act, which requires a fund to pay
redemption proceeds within seven days after receipt of a redemption request, and hold
themselves out at all times as being able to meet redemptions (in many cases within an even
shorter period of time). 204 To the extent that a fund’s investment strategy involves investing in
securities whose liquidity is limited, or otherwise entails a significant degree of liquidity risk, the
fund may not be able to meet its redemption and other legal obligations, or may not meet
redemptions without diluting its shareholders’ interests in the fund. We understand that it is a
common best practice for a fund and its management to consider the appropriateness of a fund’s
investment strategy in the context of launching an open-end fund, and then for an open-end fund

203

See BlackRock Comment Letter (“[W]e recommend that the Commission consider whether funds should be
required to explicitly address the level of position concentration that is appropriate for the fund’s
investment strategy and investor profile in [liquidity risk management] policies and procedures”); ICI
Comment Letter I (“A risk-based liquidity management program could require a fund manager, when
launching a new mutual fund, to assess whether the fund’s investment strategy and permissible holdings are
suitable for the open-end structure in light of [its] liquidity characteristics.”); see also CRMC Comment
Letter (encouraging the Commission to consider whether certain funds may be inappropriate for the
open-end fund structure).

68

to continue to manage its liquidity risk such that its strategy and holdings remain appropriate for
the open-end structure. However, not all funds appear to consider this. Also, as we have
observed funds beginning to pursue more complex investment strategies, 205 we believe it is
appropriate to require that each open-end fund consider whether it has a liquidity risk
management framework in place that corresponds with the liquidity risks inherent in its strategy
and its structure as a fund that offers redeemable securities.
We believe that specifically requiring an open-end fund to consider whether its
investment strategy is appropriate for the open-end structure would supplement existing practices
and provide an important additional layer of shareholder protection. For example, this
requirement will likely cause funds to evaluate the suitability of investment strategies that will be
permitted under the 15% illiquid investment requirement, but still could entail significant
liquidity risk—such as strategies involving highly concentrated portfolios, or strategies involving
investment in portfolio investments that are so sensitive to stressed conditions that funds may not
be able to find purchasers for those investments during stressed periods. 206 Furthermore, funds
that have significant holdings of securities with extended settlement periods may face challenges
operating as open-end funds and should take these holdings into account when determining
whether the fund’s portfolio is appropriate for an open-end fund. 207 For example, primarily
holding securities with extended settlement periods beyond seven days may not be appropriate

205

See supra footnote 11 and accompanying text.

206

We note that, when a fund files its initial registration statement and post-effective amendments thereto with
the Commission’s Division of Investment Management for review, Commission staff could request
information from the fund regarding the fund’s basis for determining that its investment strategy is
appropriate for the open-end structure, just as staff currently may request information from a fund to
support its disclosure reflecting the fund’s compliance with various provisions of the Investment Company
Act and rules thereunder.

207

See infra footnote 378 and accompanying text.

69

for an open-end fund, as primarily having such extended settlement holdings may raise concerns
with the fund’s ability to meet redemptions within seven days, particularly if the fund has not
established adequate other sources of liquidity.
Because a fund will be required to consider the liquidity risk factors (as applicable) in
periodically reviewing its liquidity risk, the final rule requires a fund’s periodic liquidity risk
review to include a consideration of whether the fund’s investment strategy is appropriate for an
open-end fund. 208 For example, if a fund’s illiquid investments exceed 15% of net assets, this
could indicate that the fund is encountering liquidity pressures that could significantly impair the
fund’s ability to meet its redemption and other legal obligations. In this case, we believe it
would be appropriate for a fund to review and potentially update its liquidity risk management
procedures for handling the fund’s high levels of illiquid investment holdings. In circumstances
in which it appears unlikely that the fund will be able to reduce its illiquid investment holdings to
or below 15% within a period of time commensurate with its redemption obligations, a fund’s
periodic liquidity risk review could lead the fund to reconsider its continued operation as an
open-end fund. 209
Consideration of Portfolio Concentration, and Holdings of Large Portfolio Positions
We also are adopting a modification to the proposed liquidity risk factors to clarify that
consideration of a fund’s investment strategy must include an evaluation of whether the strategy
involves a relatively concentrated portfolio or large positions in particular issuers. Some
commenters suggested that funds with extraordinarily concentrated portfolios may have
208

See infra section III.B.3.

209

Moreover, we note that actions that either directly or indirectly extinguish the rights of shareholders to
redeem their shares could, depending on the facts and circumstances, involve violations of section 22(e)
and other provisions of the Act, such as section 48(a) (prohibiting a person from doing indirectly, through
another person, what that person is prohibited by the Act from doing directly).

70

particular liquidity risks that could make redeemability from these funds especially
challenging. 210 Our evaluation of these comments, together with recent events discussed below,
have led us to revise the proposed “investment strategy” liquidity risk factor to focus on fund
concentration issues.
We believe that this component of a fund’s investment strategy is a particularly
significant factor in evaluating the extent to which investment strategy contributes to liquidity
risk. As we noted in the Proposing Release, while a fund with a relatively more diversified
portfolio that needs to sell portfolio investments to build liquidity may be able to select
investments for sale based on whether the markets for those investments are favorable, a
relatively less diversified fund may have fewer options (i.e., because it has less choice of
investments to sell or because the markets for its portfolio investments are uniform or correlated)
and could thus be compelled to transact in unfavorable markets. 211 In addition, as discussed
below, holding a large portion of a particular issue could adversely affect a fund’s ability to
convert the position to cash without a value impact, and this can hamper a fund’s portfolio
management flexibility due to the higher liquidity risk in its positions. 212 Thus, we believe that
investment strategies that involve holding large portions of a particular issue—particularly if the
market for these securities is thinly traded 213 or if the fund’s strategy involves investment in a

210

See, e.g., BlackRock Comment Letter; CRMC Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter I; Invesco Comment
Letter.

211

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at paragraph accompanying nn.296-298.
However, as also discussed above, the extent to which a fund is required to be diversified, including a
fund’s status as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, could
affect its liquidity risk in that the fund could be limited by its diversification obligations in its ability to sell
certain portfolio securities. See supra footnotes 200-201 and accompanying text.

See infra footnote 440 and accompanying text; infra paragraph accompanying footnote 450.

See infra footnote 544 and accompanying text.

71

relatively small number of holdings—could notably increase a fund’s liquidity risk. As
discussed above, the recent suspension of redemptions by Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund,
which had a concentrated portfolio and large holdings of particular issues, illustrates how these
methods of concentration directly affect liquidity risk, which in turn could adversely affect
shareholders to the extent that they are not able to redeem their shares, or redeem their shares
only at a significant discount. 214
Use of Borrowings for Investment Purposes and Derivatives
We have incorporated the proposed requirement to consider a fund’s use of borrowings
for investment purposes and derivatives within the requirement to consider investment strategy
in assessing, managing, and periodically reviewing a fund’s liquidity risk. 215 As proposed, this
consideration was not included within the investment strategy factor, but instead was a standalone liquidity risk factor. However, we believe that including this consideration within the
general investment strategy factor is clearer, because a fund’s use of borrowings for investment
purposes and derivatives may be viewed as a component of its investment strategy. We note that
we have also revised the phrase “use of borrowings and derivatives for investment purposes” that
was used in the Proposing Release, and instead are using the term, “use of borrowings for
investment purposes and derivatives” in the final rule. We have made this revision in order to
clarify that funds should consider all derivatives, including those used for hedging purposes. As

11, 2015), available at

its large, concentrated allocation to distressed and other low-quality fare”); see also Third Avenue
Temporary Order, supra footnote 12 (noting that “Applicants further state that relief permitting the Fund to
suspend redemptions in connection with its liquidation would permit the Fund to liquidate its assets in an
orderly manner and prevent the Fund from being forced to sell assets at unreasonably low prices to meet
redemptions.”).

See proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii)(C); rule 22e-4(b)(1)(i)(A).

72

proposed, this provision could potentially have been read to exclude the consideration of
derivatives used for hedging, which was not the intent of the proposed requirement. We believe
this clarification will make clear that the requirement is for a fund to consider both use of
borrowings for investment purposes and use of derivatives in general. One commenter stated
that it agreed that funds should consider the use of derivatives when assessing liquidity risk,
including the extent and types of derivatives used, as well as the structure and terms of a fund’s
derivatives transactions. 216 No commenters suggested that a fund’s use of borrowings for
investment purposes and derivatives is inapplicable to a fund’s liquidity risk (provided that the
fund engages in borrowing or uses derivatives 217).
We continue to believe that the potential effects of the use of borrowings for investment
purposes and derivatives are relevant to assessing, managing, and periodically reviewing a fund’s
liquidity risk. 218 As we noted in the Proposing Release, borrowing for investment purposes,
whether from a bank 219 or through financing transactions such as reverse repurchase agreements
and short sales, 220 may affect a fund’s liquidity risk. 221 Similarly, a fund’s use of derivatives

See CFA Comment Letter.

217

See supra footnotes 191-192 and accompanying text (clarifying that, to the extent one of the factors
specified in rule 22e-4(b)(1)(i) is not applicable to a particular fund, the fund would not be required to
consider that factor in assessing its liquidity risk).

218

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at section III.C.1.c.

219

See id., at n.303 and accompanying text (noting that, in addition to the asset coverage limitations imposed
by section 18 of the Investment Company Act, any borrowing from a bank would be subject to the terms
agreed between a fund and the bank, including terms relating to the maturity date of the borrowing and any
circumstances under which the borrowing may be required to be repaid).

220

See id., at nn.304-305 and accompanying text (noting that funds that borrow for investment purposes, for
example through financing transactions such as reverse repurchase agreements and short sales, generally do
so in reliance on certain Commission guidance, under which funds cover their obligations under such
transactions by segregating certain liquid assets, and discussing the effects of asset segregation on funds’
liquidity risk).
Segregated assets are considered to be unavailable for sale or disposition, including for redemptions, unless
replaced by other appropriate non-segregated assets of equal value. See Securities Trading Practices of
Registered Investment Companies, Investment Company Act Release No. 10666 (Apr. 18, 1979) [44 FR

73

such as futures, forwards, swaps and written options may affect a fund’s liquidity risk as well. 222
We note that in addition to the liquidity of the derivatives positions themselves, assessing,
managing, and periodically reviewing liquidity risk generally may include an evaluation of the
potential liquidity demands that may be imposed on the fund in connection with its use of
derivatives, including any variation margin or collateral calls the fund may be required to
meet. 223 To the extent the fund is required to make payments to a derivatives counterparty, those
assets would not be available to meet shareholder redemptions.

25128 (Apr. 27, 1979)] (“Release 10666”). This means that a fund that receives significant redemption
requests may need to exit a portion of its financing transactions in order make more liquid investments
available for sale to fulfill such requests. Furthermore, if a fund seeks to exit its financing transactions in a
declining market, it may need to dispose of a greater amount of its more liquid holdings in order to repay its
borrowings, thereby reducing the amount of liquid investments it has available to meet redemptions.
Consequently, a fund’s assessment and management of its liquidity risk must include an evaluation of the
nature and extent of its borrowings and the potential impact of borrowings on the fund’s overall liquidity
profile.
221

We note that borrowings for investment purposes pose a variety of liquidity risks, including the risk that
redemptions may require the sale of securities in amounts exceeding the amount of the redemption,
resulting in a reduction of the fund’s borrowings. Additionally, even without redemptions, the fund may
need to sell securities and reduce borrowings if its investment values decline, which may have negative
effects on the fund’s liquidity.

222

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at paragraph accompanying nn.306-307 (discussing how the use
of derivatives may affect a fund’s liquidity risk). Funds that use derivatives under which they have an
obligation to pay typically do so in reliance on the guidance we provided in Release 10666 and in related
no-action letters issued by our staff, and therefore segregate liquid assets in respect of their obligations
under derivatives transactions. See generally Use of Derivatives by Investment Companies under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, Investment Company Act Release No. 29776 (Aug. 31, 2011) [76 FR
55237 (Sept. 7, 2011)], at 13–17; see also Use of Derivatives by Registered Investment Companies and
Business Development Companies, Investment Company Act Release No. 31933 (Dec. 1, 2015) [80 FR
80884 (Dec. 28, 2015)] (“2015 Derivatives Proposing Release”), at n.47 and accompanying text; see also
supra footnote 220. Derivatives may therefore raise concerns that are similar to those discussed at footnote
220 in the context of borrowings. Funds also may be required to dispose of assets in order to post required
margin with respect to their short sale transactions. In addition, some derivatives transactions—
particularly those that are complex or entered into OTC—may be less liquid, have longer settlement
periods, or be more difficult to price than other types of investments, which potentially increases the
amount of time required to exit such transactions.

223

See In re OppenheimerFunds, Inc., et al., Investment Company Act Release No. 30099 (June 6, 2012)
(settled action) (“OppenheimerFunds Release”) (alleging the adviser made misleading statements
regarding two fixed income mutual funds that suffered significant losses during the 2008 financial crisis
primarily due to their use of total return swaps to obtain exposure to commercial mortgage-backed
securities and noting that the funds “had to raise cash for anticipated [total return swap] contract payments
by selling depressed bonds into an increasingly illiquid market.”).

74

Consideration of Investment Strategy and Portfolio Liquidity during Normal and
Reasonably Foreseeable Stressed Conditions
Finally, we also are modifying the proposed liquidity risk assessment requirement to
clarify that certain liquidity risk factors must be considered during both normal and reasonably
foreseeable stressed conditions. As proposed, rule 22e-4 did not specify whether a consideration
of these factors should consider normal conditions, stressed conditions, or both. One commenter
stated that the proposed rule’s treatment of stressed conditions was unclear, 224 and another said
that the proposed rule was unclear about what needed to be considered in assessing “stress.” 225
For those liquidity risk factors that could vary depending on market conditions (i.e., a fund’s
portfolio liquidity and cash flow projections), we believe that it is appropriate to require a fund to
evaluate those factors in normal and reasonably foreseeable stressed conditions. Thus, if a
fund’s portfolio strategy involves investing in securities whose liquidity is likely to decline in
stressed conditions, a fund should take this into account in determining how its portfolio liquidity
could contribute to its overall liquidity risk. For example, a fund’s portfolio liquidity could
decrease in stressed conditions if such conditions led to market participants pulling back on
transacting in the fund’s portfolio securities, or if stressed conditions affecting other assets or
asset classes were to have correlated effects on the fund’s portfolio securities. In considering
normal and reasonably foreseeable stressed conditions, funds should consider historical
experience but should recognize that such experience may not necessarily be indicative of future
outcomes, depending on changes in market conditions and the fund’s particular circumstances.
We note that “stressed” conditions will likely entail different scenarios for different types
of funds. For example, differing levels of changes in interest rates and/or interest rates’ implied
224

See BlackRock Comment Letter.

225

See AFR Comment Letter.

75

volatility could affect two bond funds very differently, depending on factors such as the maturity,
coupon rates and other characteristics of the funds’ portfolio holdings. Assessment of stressed
conditions also should take into account stresses originating outside of market stress. For
example, certain funds could be significantly affected by geopolitical stresses, such as an
emerging markets debt fund whose holdings’ liquidity is affected by factors such as economic
uncertainty in the holdings’ countries of issuance. The extent to which stressed conditions are
reasonably foreseeable will vary depending on the fund’s facts and circumstances.
b. Cash Flow Projections
We are adopting the requirement for a fund to consider its short-term and long-term cash
flow projections, during both normal and reasonably foreseeable stressed conditions, in assessing
and managing its liquidity risk. 226 The proposed rule also included the requirement for a fund to
consider its cash flow projections in assessing its liquidity risk. However, we are adopting some
modifications to this proposed requirement. Most significantly, although the proposed rule
specified five separate considerations a fund would have to take into account in evaluating the
extent to which its cash flow projections contribute to its liquidity risk, rule 22e-4 as adopted
today does not enumerate these five considerations. Instead, we are discussing these five
considerations as guidance that funds should generally take into account in evaluating their cash
flow projections, as discussed in more detail below.
We continue to believe, as discussed in the Proposing Release, that understanding a
fund’s cash flows is important in determining whether the fund will have sufficient cash to
satisfy redemption requests. 227 We also continue to believe that the better a fund’s portfolio and

226

See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(i)(B).

227

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at nn.267-268 and accompanying text.

76

risk managers are able to predict the fund’s net flows, the better they will be able to measure and
manage the fund’s liquidity risk. 228 Predictability about whether periods of market stress or
declines in fund performance generally lead to increased redemptions of fund shares is
particularly significant, as careful liquidity risk management during these periods could prevent
the need to sell less-liquid portfolio assets under unfavorable circumstances. This type of selling,
in turn, could create significant negative price pressure on the assets and, to the extent the fund
continues to hold a portion of those assets, decrease the value of the assets still held by the fund
at least temporarily. 229 To the extent a fund understands the composition of its shareholder base
(for example, among retirement investors, other individual investors, or discretionary accounts),
it may be able to better predict fund flows in response to market events or fund performance.
Consideration of Cash Flow Projections during Normal and Reasonably Foreseeable
Stressed Periods
We also are revising the rule to require a fund to consider its short-term and long-term
cash flow projections during both normal and reasonably foreseeable stressed conditions. 230 As
discussed above, proposed rule 22e-4 would have required a fund, in evaluating short-term and
long-term cash flow projections, to consider the size, frequency, and volatility of historical
purchases and redemptions of fund shares during normal and stressed periods. 231 Although we
are not including a specific requirement for a fund to consider historical purchases and
228

See id., at n.269 and accompanying text. See also Fidelity Comment Letter (noting that the predictability of
fund cash flows varies depending on the predictability of the redemption behavior of the fund’s shareholder
base. “[F]unds whose shareholders include investors who purchased shares distributed through a
retirement program or other planned savings program may exhibit redemption patterns that are relatively
more predictable.”); BlackRock Comment Letter (noting that funds may need additional data from their
distributors and transfer agents regarding shareholder redemption activity to allow funds to make shortterm and long-term cash projections).

77

redemptions in considering its cash flow projections, we believe continuing to incorporate the
concept of normal and reasonably foreseeable stressed conditions within the requirement to
consider cash flow projections is critical for a fund to obtain a complete picture of how its cash
flows may affect its liquidity risk, particularly because greater, more frequent, or more volatile
outflows during stressed conditions could exacerbate a fund’s liquidity risk. 232 A fund and its
portfolio and/or risk managers should review the guidance we provide below regarding funds’
evaluation of the size, frequency, and volatility of historical purchases and redemptions of fund
shares during normal and reasonably foreseeable stressed circumstances, as well as similar
funds’ purchases and redemptions, in determining how normal and reasonably foreseeable
stressed market conditions could affect a fund’s cash flows and contribute to the fund’s liquidity
risk. 233
Guidance on Evaluating a Fund’s Cash Flow Projections
As discussed above, rule 22e-4 as adopted today requires a fund to consider its short-term
and long-term cash flow projections during both normal and reasonably foreseeable stressed
conditions in assessing, managing, and periodically reviewing liquidity risk. This liquidity risk
factor simplifies the rule as proposed, which would have codified five separate considerations
that would comprise a fund’s consideration of its cash flow projections—namely, (i) the size,
frequency, and volatility of historical purchases and redemptions of fund shares during normal
and reasonably foreseeable stressed periods, (ii) the fund’s redemption policies, (iii) the fund’s
shareholder ownership concentration, (iv) the fund’s distribution channels, and (v) the degree of
certainty associated with the fund’s short-term and long-term cash flow projections. Instead of
232

233

See infra footnotes 236-239 and accompanying text.

78

enumerating these five considerations in the text of rule 22e-4, we are discussing each of them as
guidance in this Release (together, the “cash flow guidance considerations”).
We are not codifying the cash flow guidance considerations to simplify the rule 22e-4
liquidity risk factors and to alleviate certain commenter concerns about the complexity of the
proposed factors. Commenters argued that the requirement to consider a specified list of
multiple liquidity risk factors is overly complex—making compliance more difficult for funds,
and oversight more difficult for the Commission.234 Commenters discussed the dangers of an
analysis that mandates consideration of multiple factors becoming a generic “checklist” approach
to liquidity risk management that does not fully capture the business practices, strategies, and
risks that are germane to certain funds. 235 We agree that requiring an overly complex liquidity
risk assessment analysis could lead to this result, to the detriment of investors. Such procedures
could appear to be robust, but in actuality may not reflect (or may underweight) a fund’s most
significant risk factors because of the perceived requirement to focus on enumerated factors that
may not be particularly important to a fund’s operations and risks. Thus, we believe that
simplifying the cash flow liquidity risk factor in rule 22e-4 will benefit funds and their
shareholders and continue to advance the Commission’s goal of promoting meaningful liquidity
risk analysis.
With respect to the size, frequency, and volatility of historical purchases and redemptions
of fund shares, we continue to believe, as discussed in the Proposing Release, that funds whose
historical net flows are relatively less volatile in terms of size and frequency will likely entail

234

See, e.g., Better Markets Comment Letter.

235

See, e.g., MFS Comment Letter.

79

less liquidity risk than similar funds with more volatile net flows. 236 A fund should generally
review historical purchases and redemptions of fund shares across a variety of market conditions
in order to determine how the fund’s flows may differ during normal and reasonably foreseeable
stressed periods (keeping in mind that historical experience may not necessarily be indicative of
future outcomes). 237 In addition to considering its own historical flow data, a fund, particularly a
fund without substantial operating history, should consider purchase and redemption activity in
funds with similar investment strategies. 238 A fund may wish to evaluate whether the size,
frequency, and volatility of its shareholder flows follow any discernible patterns (for example,
patterns relating to seasonality, shareholder tax considerations, fund advertising, changes in fund
performance ratings provided by third-party rating agencies, and the fund’s investment strategy
and size). 239
We also continue to believe that a fund generally should consider its normal redemption
policies and practices in evaluating the extent to which its cash flow projections may contribute
to its liquidity risk. Specifically, as discussed in the Proposing Release, a fund should generally
consider its disclosed or advertised time period for paying (or endeavoring to pay) redemption

236

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at nn.272 and accompanying text.

237

See supra footnotes 230-233 and accompanying text. A fund may find it instructive to understand when its
highest, lowest, most frequent, and most volatile purchases and redemptions occurred within various time
horizons, such as the past one, five, ten, and twenty years (as applicable, considering the fund’s operating
history).

238

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at text following n.273. We note that consideration of similar
funds’ purchases and redemptions could show whether the fund’s historical flows are typical or aberrant
compared to those seen in similar funds and assist new funds in predicting flow patterns.

239

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at nn.274-279 and accompanying text (discussing how a fund’s
investment strategy could contribute to its shareholder flows and noting that smaller funds may experience
greater flow volatility). For instance, we understand that certain investors tend to trade in and out of ETFs
with index-based strategies frequently because they invest in these ETFs for hedging and/or short-term
trading purposes.

80

proceeds and whether this time period varies based on the payment method the fund employs. 240
For example, a fund whose policies require it to typically pay redeeming shareholders on a nextday basis may have fewer options for managing high levels of redemptions than a fund whose
policies require it to typically pay redeeming shareholders on a T+3 basis. 241
A fund’s shareholder ownership concentration also could affect its cash flow projections,
as a fund that has a concentrated set of beneficial owners could experience considerable cash
outflows from redemptions by a single or small number of shareholders, or by the decisions of an
intermediary that has discretionary power over a significant number of shareholder accounts. 242
This in turn could hamper a fund’s management of liquidity risk if the fund does not have
procedures in place to manage large redemptions. For these reasons, we believe a fund should
consider the extent to which its shareholder concentration affects its liquidity risk, particularly
taking into account other factors that could magnify shareholder concentration-related liquidity
risk (e.g., if a fund has an investment strategy that attracts shareholders who trade based on
short-term price movements).
We also continue to believe that a fund should consider how its distribution channels
could affect its cash flows, including the predictability of its cash flows. For example, a fund
may wish to consider the extent to which its redemption practices could depend on its
240

See Item 6(b) of Form N–1A (requiring a fund to briefly identify the procedures for redeeming shares);
infra section III.M.1 (discussing amendments to Item 11 of Form N–1A).

241

To illustrate, when a fund that pays redemption proceeds within one day receives a large redemption
request and a fund that pays redemption proceeds within three business days receives a redemption request
of the same size, the first fund must satisfy the full request within one day, whereas the second fund has
more time to satisfy the redemption request. Even though the shareholder flows of the first and second
fund are identical, the redemption policies of the first fund magnify its liquidity risks by requiring that the
fund pay redemptions quickly. See, e.g., Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at n.270.

242

We note that a relatively concentrated fund shareholder base may make it easier for funds to communicate
with those shareholders or intermediaries about anticipated future redemptions, and thus plan liquidity
demands. However, those shareholders are under no legal obligation to forewarn the fund of their
redemptions and, particularly in times of stress, may not do so.

81

distribution channels, 243 as well as whether its distribution channels (particularly, whether the
fund’s shares are held through omnibus accounts) could make it difficult for a fund to be fully
aware of the composition of its underlying investor base, 244 including investor characteristics that
could affect the fund’s short-term and long-term flows. 245 A fund’s distribution channels could
affect its cash flow predictions because certain distribution channels are generally correlated with
particular purchase and redemption patterns. 246 Additionally, we note that investors in mutual
funds distributed through certain channels also may have similar purchase and redemption
characteristics relating to their financial and tax-related needs. 247
Finally, we continue to believe that a fund should consider the degree of certainty
surrounding its short-term and long-term cash flow projections. A fund could consider the
length of its operating history (including the fund’s experience during points of market
instability, illiquidity, or volatility) and any purchase and redemption patterns. A fund may use
243

For example, mutual funds that are sold through broker-dealers will generally have to meet redemption
requests within three business days, because rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act effectively establishes a
T+3 settlement period for purchases and sales of securities (other than certain types of securities exempted
by the rule) effected by a broker or dealer, unless a different settlement period is expressly agreed to by the
parties at the time of the transaction.

244

See, e.g., Comment Letter of Coalition of Mutual Fund Investors (Jan. 18, 2016) (“CMFI Comment
Letter”) (raising concerns regarding omnibus account transparency).

245

These investor characteristics could include whether ownership in the mutual fund is relatively
concentrated, as well as whether the types of underlying investors in the fund typically share common
investment goals affecting redemption frequency and timing.

246

For instance, investors in mutual funds distributed through a retirement plan channel or other planned
savings channel (such as a qualified tuition plan authorized by section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code)
may be more likely to be long-term investors who do not trade based on short-term price movements, and
their purchase and redemption patterns thus may be relatively predictable compared to those of other
investors.

247

For example, taxable investors who are considering purchasing mutual fund shares around capital gains
distribution dates have an incentive to delay their purchases until after the distribution, but non-taxable
shareholders (such as those who invest through IRAs and other tax-deferred accounts) face no such
incentive for delaying purchases. See Woodrow T. Johnson & James M. Poterba, Taxes and Mutual Fund
Inflows around Distribution Dates, NBER Working Paper 13884 (Mar. 2006, rev’d Mar. 2008), available
at http://economics.mit.edu/files/2512; see also supra footnote 239 and accompanying text (discussing
seasonality in mutual fund flows).

82

ranges in considering cash flow projections and their relationship to liquidity risk. If a fund has
implemented policies to encourage certain shareholders (e.g., large shareholders or institutional
shareholders) to provide advance notification of their intent to redeem a significant number of
shares of the fund, this could increase the degree of probability surrounding its cash flow
projections. 248
c. Holdings of Cash and Cash Equivalents, Borrowing Arrangements, and Other Funding
Sources
We are adopting the requirement for a fund to consider its holdings of cash and cash
equivalents, as well as its borrowing arrangements and other funding sources, in assessing,
managing, and periodically reviewing its liquidity risk, as proposed. 249 As discussed in the
Proposing Release, current U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) define
cash equivalents as short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known
amounts of cash and that are so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes
in value because of changes in interest rates. 250 While we understand based on staff outreach and
the comments we received on the proposal that many asset managers establish minimum cash
and cash equivalent targets as part of their liquidity risk management practices, 251 commenters
stated that significant cash and cash equivalent holdings are not necessarily appropriate for all

248

We understand, based on staff outreach, that advance notification procedures are a relatively common
liquidity risk management tool that funds currently employ. See Comment Letter of Invesco on the Notice
Seeking Comment on Asset Management Products and Activities, Docket No. FSOC-2014-0001 (Mar. 25,
2015), at 11 (“Invesco FSOC Notice Comment Letter”) (noting that Invesco has advance notification
arrangements regarding anticipated redemptions above certain levels in place with certain distribution
partners).

249

See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(i)(C).

250

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at n.311 and accompanying text.

251

See, e.g., Comment Letter of Pacific Investment Management Company LLC (Jan. 13, 2016) (“PIMCO
Comment Letter”).

83

funds and as a stand-alone tool do not necessarily entirely mitigate liquidity risk. 252 We agree
with commenters that the amount of cash and cash equivalent holdings appropriate for liquidity
risk management depends on a particular fund’s facts and circumstances. Similarly, we agree
with commenters that significant holdings of cash and cash equivalents could still be insufficient
to protect a fund with large holdings of illiquid investments (or investments whose liquidity
decreases significantly during stressed periods) if the fund were faced with heavy redemptions. 253
But we continue to believe that holdings of cash and cash equivalents can be a valuable liquidity
risk management tool because these holdings tend to remain very liquid under nearly all market
conditions. 254 Thus, a fund could use its cash and cash equivalent holdings in normal and
stressed conditions to meet some redemption requests without significant dilution of remaining
investors’ interests. Holdings of cash and cash equivalents also could provide a fund’s portfolio
manager with flexibility to readjust its portfolio as it deems advantageous (either in terms of
performance or risk management) under changing market circumstances. We therefore believe it
is appropriate for a fund to consider its holdings of cash and cash equivalents as part of its
liquidity risk assessment.
Several commenters discussed the extent to which a fund’s borrowing arrangements and
252

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter I (noting that fund complexes that specialize in U.S. equity funds, especially
those focusing on large-cap stocks, are likely to be able to meet redemptions with only modest holdings of
cash or cash equivalents because the U.S. equity market is so liquid); see also infra footnote 662 and
accompanying text (discussing commenters’ concerns that the proposed three-day liquid asset minimum
requirement would be construed to require a fund specifically to hold cash and cash equivalents, which
commenters argued could prevent funds from meeting their principal investment strategies and could give
investors a false sense of security that cash buffers will eliminate liquidity risk).

253

We also note that a substantial investment in cash and cash equivalents could decrease a fund’s total return
and/or cause the fund to diverge from its investment strategy, and thus a fund may wish to calibrate its
holdings of these instruments to manage its liquidity risk while taking these concerns into consideration.

254

We note that cash and cash equivalent holdings and borrowing arrangements are just two of several
liquidity management tools that are at a fund’s disposal. Though we are requiring funds to consider these
tools, the rule neither creates a substantive obligation on funds to maintain specific levels of cash and cash
equivalents nor requires funds to procure any specific borrowing arrangements.

84

other funding sources could shape the fund’s liquidity risk. Some commenters strongly
supported the use of borrowing arrangements to help mitigate liquidity risk, asserting that funds
historically have generally succeeded in managing liquidity risk, partly due to lines of credit and
interfund lending. 255 Commenters also asserted that obtaining access to backup sources of
liquidity like lines of credit, interfund lending arrangements, and repurchase agreements should
be considered beneficial as the flexibility to use these liquidity sources has value to a fund’s
shareholders. 256 However, another commenter argued that asset managers should not meet
redemptions through the use of borrowing facilities other than to meet short-term settlement
mismatches, as this could potentially disadvantage non-redeeming investors. 257
We continue to believe that entering into borrowing or other funding arrangements could
assist a fund in meeting redemption requests in certain cases (for example, by bridging any
timing mismatches between when a fund is required to pay redeeming shareholders and when
any asset sales that the fund has executed in order to pay redemptions will settle). 258 However,
we have concerns that, in some situations, borrowing arrangements may not be beneficial to a
fund’s liquidity risk management to the extent that the fund’s use of borrowings to meet
redemptions leverages the fund at the expense of non-redeeming investors. In such a case, nonredeeming shareholders would effectively bear the costs of borrowing and the increased risk to
the fund created by leverage. 259 Thus, we believe that funds should consider the likely overall
benefits and risks in including such borrowing or other funding arrangements within a liquidity

risk management program.
In evaluating the extent to which a fund’s borrowing arrangements could help the fund
manage its liquidity risk, a fund may wish to consider any aspects of those arrangements that
could limit the fund’s ability to borrow. For instance, a fund generally may wish to consider the
terms of the credit facility (e.g. whether the credit facility is committed or uncommitted), as well
as the financial health of the institution(s) providing the facility. A fund also generally should
consider whether a credit facility would be shared among multiple funds within a fund family.
When a credit facility is shared, a fund should assess the extent the facility mitigates its liquidity
risk given the liquidity risk associated with the other funds sharing the facility. 260 Similarly, with
respect to interfund lending within a family of funds, the terms of an interfund lending
arrangement and any conditions required under exemptive relief permitting the arrangement 261
(including limitations on the circumstances in which interfund lending may be used) will shape
the role that interfund lending has in a fund’s overall liquidity risk management. 262

260

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at paragraph accompanying nn.314-317.

261

See, e.g., Nationwide Mutual Fund, et al., Investment Company Act Release No. 32115 (May 16, 2016) [81
FR 31988 (May 20, 2016)] (notice of application) (“Nationwide Exemptive Relief”); TCW Alternative
Funds, et al., Investment Company Act Release No. 32113 (May 11, 2016) [81 FR 30585 (May 17, 2016)]
(notice of application) (“TCW Exemptive Relief”); see also Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at
paragraph accompanying nn.318-319.

262

For example, it is common for such exemptive orders to permit interfund lending in circumstances in which
there is a timing mismatch between when a fund is required to pay redeeming shareholders and when any
asset sales that the fund has executed in order to pay redemptions will settle (e.g., a fund may be required to
pay redeeming shareholders within three business days, but the portfolio transactions the fund has executed
in order to pay these shareholders may not settle for seven days). A fund can reasonably predict that it will
repay borrowed money relatively quickly and reliably under these circumstances. Under these conditions,
this type of borrowing would tend to be low risk, and thus entail less liquidity risk than borrowing money
to pay redemptions without already having secured a price at which the assets used to cover the borrowing
will be sold.
Funds may only engage in interfund lending when it is in the best interests of both the lending and the
borrowing fund. The exemptive relief anticipates a fund family’s interfund lending arrangements include
an assessment of: (i) if the fund participates as a lender, any effect its participation may have on the fund’s
liquidity risk; and (ii) if the fund participates as a borrower, whether the fund’s portfolio liquidity is
sufficient to satisfy its obligation to repay the loan along with its other liquidity needs. See Nationwide

3. Periodic Review of a Fund’s Liquidity Risk
Rule 22e-4 as adopted includes the requirement for a fund to periodically review the
fund’s liquidity risk, taking into account the same liquidity risk factors a fund would have to
consider in initially assessing and managing its liquidity risk. 263 The proposed rule also included
the requirement for a fund to periodically review its liquidity risk, considering those factors it
would evaluate in initially assessing its liquidity risk. 264 Commenters generally supported the
proposed liquidity risk review requirement. 265 Specifically, some commenters agreed that this
requirement will help further the Commission’s goals, 266 expressed support for the proposed
liquidity risk review factors, 267 and agreed with the Commission’s general approach of permitting
funds to develop their own policies and procedures for conducting periodic liquidity risk
reviews. 268 Other commenters objected to the requirement for a fund to consider certain
specified liquidity risk review factors and suggested instead that consideration of the factors be
made permissive instead of mandatory. 269 Still another commenter argued that the proposed
liquidity risk review approach gives funds too much discretion and recommended that the
Commission adopt a baseline standard for the frequency of funds’ liquidity risk reviews (i.e.,
adopt an annual or quarterly review requirement). 270

87

We are adopting a periodic review requirement substantially as proposed. As discussed
above, we have revised the liquidity risk factors that a fund must consider in assessing,
managing, and periodically reviewing its liquidity risk. A fund will not have to consider any
factor that is not applicable to a particular fund. 271 This requirement is principles-based, and thus
each fund may develop and adopt procedures to review the fund’s liquidity risk tailored as
appropriate to reflect the fund’s particular facts and circumstances.
After evaluating commenters’ concerns about the liquidity risk assessment factors, we
continue to believe that these factors, modified as discussed above, are central to reviewing a
fund’s liquidity risk. We also continue to believe that requiring each fund to consider a baseline
set of factors, as applicable, in reviewing liquidity risk would promote effective liquidity risk
management across the fund industry. As discussed above, 272 we believe that our changes to the
proposed liquidity risk factors—which highlight particular risks but also condense and simplify
some proposed factors—strike an appropriate balance between promoting consistency in funds’
consideration of a standard set of liquidity risk factors and easing burdens associated with this
analysis.
We considered a commenter’s suggestion that the Commission adopt a minimum
frequency for funds’ liquidity risk review, and we have modified the proposed rule to clarify that
a fund’s periodic review of its liquidity risk must occur no less frequently than annually. 273 As
discussed below, we are adopting a requirement that a fund periodically review, no less
frequently than annually its highly liquid investment minimum (as determined considering the

271

272

See supra footnotes 193-194 and accompanying text.

273

See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(i).

88

same factors that a fund would reference in periodically reviewing its liquidity risk). 274 Because
this review of a fund’s highly liquid investment minimum would, de facto, necessitate a fund’s
review of its liquidity risk, we believe it is appropriate to align the minimum periods for these
reviews. Similarly, as discussed further below, we also are adopting a requirement that a fund’s
board must review, no less frequently than annually, a written report that describes a review of
the adequacy of the fund’s liquidity risk management program. 275 Accordingly, the minimum
period for the liquidity risk review will be aligned with the period in which this report will be
presented to the fund’s board, creating further synergies. We note, however, that a fund may
determine that it is appropriate for its liquidity risk to be reviewed more frequently than annually,
depending on the extent to which the required review factors could vary based on market- or
sector-wide developments, as well as changes to the fund’s operations or other fund-specific
circumstances.
C.

Classifying the Liquidity of a Fund’s Portfolio Investments, and Disclosure and
Reporting Requirements Regarding Portfolio Investments’ Liquidity
Classifications
Today we are adopting requirements for each fund, with the exception of In-Kind ETFs,

to classify the liquidity of its portfolio investments. Rule 22e-4 as adopted today requires a fund
to classify the liquidity of each portfolio investment based on the number of days within which it
determined that it reasonably expects an investment would be convertible to cash (or, in the case
of the less-liquid and illiquid categories, sold or disposed of) without the conversion (or, in the
case of the less-liquid and illiquid categories, sale or disposition) significantly changing the
market value of the investment. Specifically, rule 22e-4 will require a fund to classify each of its

274

See infra section III.D.4.

275

See infra section III.H.2.

89

portfolio investments, including its derivatives transactions, 276 into one of four liquidity
categories:
•

Highly liquid investments, defined as cash and any investment reasonably expected to be
convertible to cash in current market conditions in three business days or less without
the conversion to cash significantly changing the market value of the investment.

•

Moderately liquid investments, defined as any investment reasonably expected to be
convertible to cash in current market conditions in more than three calendar days but in
seven calendar days or less without the conversion to cash significantly changing the
market value of the investment.

•

Less liquid investments, defined as any investment reasonably expected to be sold or
disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without the sale
or disposition significantly changing the market value of the investment, but where the
sale or disposition is reasonably expected to settle in more than seven calendar days.

•

Illiquid investments, defined as any investment that may not reasonably be expected to be
sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without
the sale or disposition significantly changing the market value of the investment.

This determination must be based on information obtained after reasonable inquiry; the term
“convertible to cash” in the category definitions refers to the ability to be sold, with the sale
settled. The final rule requires a fund to take into account relevant “market, trading, and
investment-specific considerations” in classifying its portfolio investments’ liquidity, but the rule

276

See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(ii). The final rule requires a fund to classify all portfolio investments, including
investments that are liabilities of the fund. See infra section III.C.3.c.

90

does not detail a list of factors comprising these considerations. 277 This Release does include,
however, guidance on certain considerations that a fund may wish to evaluate in taking into
account relevant market, trading, and investment-specific considerations when classifying the
liquidity of its portfolio investments. 278 The fund may classify portfolio investments based on
asset class, so long as the fund or its adviser, 279 after reasonable inquiry, does not have
information about any market, trading, or investment-specific considerations that are reasonably
expected to significantly affect the liquidity characteristics of an investment that would suggest a
different classification for that investment. 280 As discussed in more detail below, the fund also
must consider the investment’s market depth in classifying the investment. 281 The fund also must
review its portfolio investments’ classifications at least monthly and more frequently if changes
in relevant market, trading, and investment-specific considerations are reasonably expected to
materially affect one or more of its investments’ classifications. 282 Finally, the fund must take
into account certain considerations for highly liquid investments that it has segregated to cover
certain derivatives transactions. 283

277

See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(ii).

278

See infra section III.C.4.

279

The term “adviser” as used in this Release and rule 22e-4 generally refers to any person, including a subadviser, that is an “investment adviser” of an investment company as that term is defined in section
2(a)(20) of the Investment Company Act. See infra paragraph accompanying footnote 818 (discussing the
coordination of liquidity risk management efforts undertaken by various service providers, including a
fund’s sub-adviser(s)).

280

See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(ii)(A).

281

More specifically, the fund must determine whether trading varying portions of a position in a particular
investment, in sizes that the fund would reasonably anticipate trading, is reasonably expected to
significantly affect the liquidity of that investment, and if so, the fund must take this determination into
account when classifying the liquidity of that investment. See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(ii)(B).

282

See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(ii); see also rule 22e-4(b)(1)(i) (imposing an ongoing responsibility on the fund to
assess and manage its liquidity risk).

283

More specifically, with respect to the fund’s derivatives transactions that it has classified as moderately
liquid investments, less liquid investments, and illiquid investments, it must identify the percentage of the

91

Rule 22e-4 as proposed would have required each fund to classify the liquidity of its
portfolio positions (or portions of a position in a particular asset) and review the liquidity
classification of each position on an ongoing basis. 284 In classifying and reviewing the liquidity
of portfolio assets, proposed rule 22e-4 would have required a fund to consider the number of
days within which a fund’s position in a portfolio asset (or portions of a position in a particular
asset) would be convertible to cash at a price that does not materially affect the value of that
asset immediately prior to sale. 285 Based on this determination, made using information obtained
after reasonable inquiry, the proposed rule would have required a fund to classify each of its
positions in a portfolio asset (or portions thereof) into one of six liquidity categories: (i)
convertible to cash within 1 business day; (ii) convertible to cash within 2-3 business days; (iii)
convertible to cash within 4-7 calendar days; (iv) convertible to cash within 8-15 calendar days;
(v) convertible to cash within 16-30 calendar days; and (vi) convertible to cash in more than 30
calendar days. 286 The proposed rule would have required a fund to consider certain specified
factors, to the extent applicable, in determining the time period in which a portfolio position (or
portion thereof) would be convertible to cash. 287
Although some commenters acknowledged potential benefits to the proposed
classification requirement, most commenters were generally opposed to the proposed
six-category liquidity classification framework. As discussed further below, commenters’
fund’s highly liquid investments that it has segregated to cover, or pledged to satisfy margin requirements
in connection with, derivatives transactions in each of these classification categories. See rule 22e4(b)(1)(ii)(C); see also rule 22e-4(b)(1)(iii)(B) (addressing such percentage of highly liquid investments in
connection with determining whether a fund primarily holds highly liquid investments).

Proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(ii); see also infra section III.C.4.

92

primary objections were concerns that the proposed classification framework would: (i) not
reflect current liquidity risk management practices or industry “best practices”; (ii) require funds
to make overly subjective projections about asset liquidity, particularly to the extent that they
would have to project a fund’s ability to sell and settle a position well into the future; (iii) place
undue reliance on third-party data vendors and analysts; (iv) incorporate a materiality standard
that is unclear and impractical to apply; and (v) inappropriately require funds to take position
size and settlement timing into account when classifying the liquidity of a portfolio position.
Commenters suggested many alternatives to the proposed classification requirement—
both changes to the structure of the proposed classification requirement, as well as suggestions
about more granular aspects of the proposed requirement. Although the details vary,
commenters raised three primary structural alternatives to the proposed classification
requirement: (i) a “principles-based” liquidity classification approach, where each fund would
have to classify the liquidity of its portfolio assets, but the Commission would not require any
specific classification scheme; 288 (ii) a simplified version of the proposed classification system,
with fewer classification categories based on shorter time projections than the proposal; 289 and
(iii) an approach with new classification categories based on qualitative distinctions in the
market- and trading-related characteristics of different asset classes under different market
conditions, which generally would rely on the Commission mapping different asset classes to

13, 2016) (“LSTA Comment Letter”); Comment Letter of State Street Global Advisors (Jan. 13, 2016)
(“State Street Comment Letter”); Comment Letter of Wellington Management Company LLP (Jan. 13,
2016) (“Wellington Comment Letter”).

See, e.g., Eaton Vance Comment Letter I; Interactive Data Comment Letter; Comment Letter of Markit
(Jan. 13, 2016) (“Markit Comment Letter”); Comment Letter of Wells Fargo Funds Management, LLC
(Jan. 13, 2016) (“Wells Fargo Comment Letter”). Commenters generally suggested three, four, or five
classification categories.

93

each of these new classification categories. 290
Our adopted liquidity classification requirement most closely resembles the second
alternative described above and is designed to respond to commenters’ concerns while also
continuing to advance the Commission’s goals. As discussed in the Proposing Release, we
understand that funds today employ different practices for assessing the liquidity of their
portfolios. 291 After considering comments, however, we continue to believe that a liquidity
classification framework based on a days-to-cash determination, with certain modifications from
the proposal, is an effective approach to further our goals of creating a meaningful, uniform
framework for reporting to the Commission and providing public disclosure about funds’
liquidity profiles. To achieve this goal, we believe the rule must provide a consistent
methodology for assessing portfolio liquidity. This methodology also will form the basis for the
highly liquid investment minimum and illiquid investment limit, each of which we believe will
play an important role in fund liquidity risk management, as discussed in detail below. We also
believe this classification system maintains the benefits of a spectrum-based liquidity analysis
while responding to concerns about the burden and level of precision implied by the proposed
approach.
While we agree that the suggested “principles-based” alternative approach would have
benefits in terms of flexibility and funds’ ability to leverage their existing procedures for
assessing portfolio liquidity, 292 this approach would not provide a uniform methodology for
funds’ liquidity assessment procedures. It thus would not meaningfully advance our goal of

Systemic Risk Council (Jan. 13, 2016) (“SRC Comment Letter”).

establishing a foundation for reasonably comparable reporting to the Commission and disclosure
to the public about funds’ portfolio liquidity. 293 In particular, this approach would not permit
detailed reporting about funds’ portfolio investments’ liquidity in a structured data format, as
with reports on Form N-PORT, and thus would not provide an efficient basis for the Commission
and its staff to monitor funds’ portfolio liquidity and liquidity risk.
We likewise believe the third alternative classification system, based on liquidity
characteristics of different asset classes—as opposed to a days-to-cash framework—may not
provide clear distinctions between each liquidity category without the Commission assigning
specific asset classes to each classification category. Given the size of the fund industry and the
wide variety and types of asset classes held by funds, we believe that it would be impractical for
the Commission or its staff to attempt to prescriptively categorize every asset class by liquidity.
Further, the classification requirement is designed to provide information regarding the liquidity
of portfolio investments under current market conditions. We are concerned that a classification
system by which the Commission assigns specific asset classes to specific liquidity categories
would not be sufficiently flexible to account for the impact changing market conditions may
have on the liquidity of fund investments.
Relatedly, some commenters suggested an alternative classification system could be
based on notions of liquidity other than “days-to-cash,” including, in whole or in part, on the
fraction of average daily trading volume that each position size corresponds to, the expected
behavior of bid-ask spreads in a given asset, or more qualitative liquidity buckets (e.g.
“converted to cash quickly under most circumstances”). 294 Other commenters suggested that all
293

294

See, e.g., AFR Comment Letter; BlackRock Comment Letter; SRC Comment Letter.

95

of the classification categories be defined based on a days-to-cash or days-to-trade
determination, 295 while some recommended that only certain of the categories (generally, the
relatively more liquid categories) be defined based on a days-to-cash or days-to-trade
determination. 296 After considering comments, we have chosen to adopt a classification system
that most closely resembles the second alternative raised by commenters and includes days-tocash determinations for the more liquid categories. As noted below, some of the more specific
criteria suggested by commenters in place of days-to-cash may not be appropriate for all asset
classes, while more qualitative criteria make it more difficult to compare classifications across
funds relative to the days-to-cash approach in the rule. 297
1. Primary Elements of Classification Framework
a. Consolidation of Proposed Classification Categories
Similar to the proposed classification requirement, the final classification requirement is
generally based on a framework that would require a fund to determine the number of days in
which each portfolio investment is convertible to cash. However, the final classification
framework reduces the number of classification categories from six (as proposed) to four. In
addition, a fund may classify portfolio investments based on asset class under the final
classification requirement, so long as the fund or its adviser does not have information about any
market, trading, or investment-specific considerations that are reasonably expected to
significantly affect the liquidity characteristics of an investment and that would require a
different classification for that investment. When we proposed the rule 22e-4 classification

requirement, we noted that the framework was meant to promote a more nuanced approach than
a classification requirement under which a fund would simply designate assets as liquid or
illiquid.298 The proposed approach also was meant to provide the basis for detailed reporting and
disclosure about the liquidity of funds’ portfolio positions in a structured data format, as the six
liquidity categories described above would be incorporated into the fund’s portfolio holdings
reported on proposed Form N-PORT. 299
Multiple commenters expressed concerns about the proposed six-category classification
framework. Many argued that the proposed classification method would require funds to make
overly subjective projections about asset liquidity because predicting the time to liquidate a
position for cash at a given price—particularly well into the future—is limited by required
assumptions and market data availability, even for sophisticated asset managers. 300 They stated
that making relatively subjective liquidity determinations would render liquidity assessments
inconsistent across funds, and any appearance of objectivity and comparability among funds’
liquidity assessments thus would be false. 301 Relatedly, commenters also maintained that the
proposed liquidity classification categories were overly granular and therefore could present a
false appearance of precision about portfolio assets’ liquidity. 302 For example, commenters
argued that determining whether an asset can be converted to cash in 15 calendar days versus 16

calendar days (that is, distinguishing between the fourth and fifth proposed classification
categories) cannot realistically be known or predicted with accuracy. 303 Some commenters
advocated reducing the number of classification categories 304 and expressed concern that the
proposal would entail overly subjective classification analysis, which would give funds too much
discretion to determine which assets are relatively liquid and thus make enforcement difficult
and hinder meaningful risk mitigation. 305 Finally, commenters also predicted that the complexity
of analyses inherent in the proposed six-category classification framework, and related
operational burdens, could cause many funds to either shift their classification obligations to
third-party analysts entirely, or to rely heavily on data provided by third-party vendors to help
simplify funds’ own classification analyses. 306
After considering these comments, we agree that the level of precision implied by the
proposed six-category classification system could have unintended negative consequences. We
also agree that the six liquidity classification categories that we proposed could lead to varying
liquidity assessments and could give rise to an appearance of a level of precision about liquidity
determinations that may not be achievable for some funds or asset classes. However, we
continue to believe that a classification approach that involves funds evaluating investments’
liquidity across a liquidity spectrum (as opposed to making a binary determination of whether an
investment is liquid or illiquid) provides a basis for more meaningful reporting and disclosure

about funds’ portfolio liquidity. Our opinion corresponds with many commenters’ views that
there are significant benefits associated with evaluating portfolio assets’ liquidity across a
spectrum. 307
We believe that condensing the six proposed categories into four categories should
decrease the variability in funds’ liquidity assessments, since funds will not be required to make
liquidity distinctions that are as detailed as would have been required under the proposal. The
adopted categories also should reduce inconsistency in funds’ liquidity assessments because the
new categories do not include time periods in the least-liquid categories that are as granular or
projected as far in the future as under the proposal. Furthermore, we believe that the adopted
categories could decrease variability in some funds’ liquidity assessments because we understand
that the four adopted categories may correspond more closely than the proposed categories with
classification methods and categories that some funds currently use in evaluating their portfolio
liquidity. 308 For example, the time frames referenced in the moderately liquid, less liquid, and
illiquid classification categories are tied to the seven-calendar-day period in which funds are
required to pay redeeming shareholders under section 22(e) of the Investment Company Act.
We understand through staff outreach conducted prior to the proposal that certain funds already
classify their portfolios across a number of liquidity categories, taking into account days-to-cash
determinations and focusing on assets that can be used to meet redemptions in the short- and
medium-term. 309 Certain commenters likewise acknowledged that some asset managers may
currently classify portfolio positions with categories that take days-to-cash or days-to-trade

determinations into account, although not at the level of detail suggested by the proposal or for
all classes of portfolio assets. 310
We recognize that, although we are providing a uniform classification framework,
different funds may still classify the liquidity of similar investments differently, based on the
facts and circumstances informing their analyses. This simply reflects the fact that different
funds likely have different views on liquidity based on considerations such as their assessment of
various market, trading, and investment-specific factors, and the size of their position in a
particular investment. We acknowledge that liquidity can be difficult to estimate and that there
is no agreed-upon measure of liquidity for all asset classes. 311 Nevertheless, we believe the
reporting of the liquidity classification information to us, and aggregated information to the
public, will provide important information about fund liquidity.
b. Market, Trading, and Investment-Specific Considerations
Rule 22e-4 as adopted today requires a fund to take into account “relevant market,
trading, and investment-specific considerations” in classifying and reviewing its portfolio
investments’ liquidity. 312 Rule 22e-4 as proposed did not include this requirement but instead
included an enumerated list of nine separate factors that a fund would be specifically required to
consider, as applicable, in classifying and reviewing the liquidity of its portfolio assets. 313 The

310

See, e.g., HSBC Comment Letter; MFS Comment Letter; Nuveen Comment Letter; Wellington Comment
Letter.

311

Indeed our recognition of these facts is part of what has lead us to adopt requirements that the more detailed
liquidity classification of each individual portfolio investment be reported to us confidentially, with only
the aggregated fund liquidity profile reported publicly, as discussed in section III.C.6 below.

312

See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(ii).

313

Rule 22e-4 as proposed would have required a fund to take into account the following nine factors, to the
extent applicable, when classifying the liquidity of each portfolio position in a particular asset: (1)
existence of an active market for the asset, including whether the asset is listed on an exchange, as well as
the number, diversity, and quality of market participants; (2) frequency of trades or quotes for the asset and
average daily trading volume of the asset (regardless of whether the asset is a security traded on an

Proposing Release requested comment generally on whether the Commission should codify the
proposed list of nine liquidity classification factors. While one commenter agreed that the
factors should be codified, 314 most opposed codification and stated that funds should be
permitted, but not required, to consider the factors. 315 Commenters stated that codifying the
proposed factors would mandate a classification process that would be overly burdensome on
funds’ resources 316 and could limit portfolio managers’ ability to rely on industry expertise in
evaluating portfolio assets’ liquidity. 317 One commenter specifically expressed concern that “the
scope and complexity of the required analysis may excessively burden fund boards of directors
and may actually act to distract fund managers and directors from the assessment of liquidity and
redemption risk, which we view as the more important analysis.” 318 Commenters also argued
that a codified list of liquidity assessment factors could create a presumption that a fund must
consider each factor in evaluating each portfolio holding, even if certain factors would not be
useful or relevant to evaluating certain portfolio assets’ liquidity. 319 Some commenters also

exchange); (3) volatility of trading prices for the asset; (4) bid-ask spreads for the asset; (5) whether the
asset has a relatively standardized and simple structure; (6) for fixed income securities, maturity and date of
issue; (7) restrictions on trading of the asset and limitations on transfer of the asset; (8) the size of the
fund’s position in the asset relative to the asset’s average daily trading volume and, as applicable, the
number of units of the asset outstanding; and (9) relationship of the asset to another portfolio asset. See
proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(ii). These proposed factors are discussed in more detail in infra section III.C.4.

stated that a codified list of factors could lead funds to place undue reliance on third-party data
vendors, 320 and such reliance could result in these vendors being viewed as “rating agencies” for
liquidity, which could lead to potential systemic risk issues. 321 In addition, they expressed more
granular concerns about certain of the proposed factors, which are discussed in detail in section
III.C.4 below.
After considering commenters’ suggestions and concerns, we are not including the
classification factors in the rule as proposed because we are concerned that including this list in
rule 22e-4 could lead funds to focus too heavily on evaluating certain factors that may not be
particularly relevant to the liquidity of a specific fund’s portfolio investments, the evaluation of
which may not help produce meaningful outcomes in terms of effective classification. This
could operate to the detriment of efficient and appropriate liquidity assessments that focus on the
liquidity characteristics most directly affecting a particular asset class or investment.
We are instead adopting a principles-based requirement that a fund take into account
relevant market, trading, and investment-specific considerations in classifying its portfolio
investments. We understand based on staff outreach that it is common for some funds, in
assessing the liquidity of their portfolio investments, to look only at basic structural
characteristics of an investment (such as asset class or restrictions on transfer) and not to
supplement this analysis with market information or other potentially relevant factors. 322 This

not useful or informative in a liquidity assessment. However, because these securities have observable bidask spreads and volatility, the fund would nonetheless be required to obtain and consider such data.”).

could lead to circumstances in which a fund’s liquidity classifications do not reflect a fund’s
actual ability to sell its portfolio investments without significant dilution to meet redemptions
within a given time period, or do not otherwise result in an accurate picture of a fund’s liquidity
profile. Thus, we believe that the classification requirement must require funds to evaluate
relevant considerations in making liquidity determinations. We believe the requirement to take
into account relevant market, trading, and investment-specific considerations achieves this goal
and is broad and flexible enough to be relevant for all investment strategies and fund risk
profiles. In addition, we continue to believe that the proposed classification factors could help
funds in evaluating relevant market, trading, and investment-specific considerations, and thus we
have included guidance on many of these areas in section III.C.4 of this Release that may be
relevant to a fund’s assessment of portfolio investments’ liquidity characteristics.
We understand that some third-party service providers currently provide data and
analyses assessing the relative liquidity of a fund’s portfolio investments, and that many of these
service providers assess certain market, trading, and investment-specific considerations in doing
so. We believe that a fund could appropriately use this type of data to inform or supplement its
own consideration of the liquidity of an asset class or investment. However, a fund would not be
required to do so. 323 Also, we generally believe that a fund should consider having the person(s)
at the fund or investment adviser designated to administer the fund’s liquidity risk management
program review the quality of any data received from third parties, as well as the particular
methodologies used and metrics analyzed by third parties, to determine whether this data would
effectively inform or supplement the fund’s consideration of its portfolio holdings’ liquidity
323

may be used in a fund’s assessment of liquidity, but that funds are not required to use data provided by
third-party vendors in classifying the liquidity of their portfolio assets).

characteristics. This review could include an assessment of whether modifications to an
“off-the-shelf” product are necessary to accurately reflect the liquidity characteristics of the
fund’s portfolio holdings. As discussed above, certain commenters expressed concern that the
proposed six-category classification framework, including the proposed codification of certain
factors that a fund would be required to consider (as applicable) in classifying its portfolio
holdings, would place undue reliance on data vendors and analysts, and that such reliance could
produce potential systemic risk issues. 324 We believe that our decisions to simplify the proposed
classification framework and not to include the proposed classification factors as part of rule
22e-4, together with the guidance on the appropriate use of data vendors discussed in this
paragraph, should largely mitigate these concerns.
c. Value Impact Standard
As discussed further below, in a modification to the proposed standard, each of the
liquidity categories included in the classification requirement we are adopting requires a fund to
determine the time period in which an investment would be reasonably expected to be converted
to cash (or in some cases, sold or disposed of) in current market conditions without the
conversion to cash (or in some cases, sale or disposition) significantly changing the market value
of the investment. 325 This modification highlights that the standard does not require a fund to
actually re-value or re-price the investment for classification purposes, nor does the standard
require the fund to incorporate general market movements in liquidity determinations or estimate
market impact to a precise degree.
Many commenters opposed the value impact standard incorporated in the proposed

See rule 22e-4(a)(6); 22e-4(a)(8); 22e-4(a)(10); and 22e-4(a)(12). We note the term “market value” as used
in the value impact standard includes the value of investments that are fair valued.

104

liquidity classification requirement—that the asset was convertible to cash “at a price that does
not materially affect the value of that asset immediately prior to sale.” 326 Many suggested that
the value impact component of the proposed standard was inappropriate for liquidity analyses 327
and should be eliminated from the classification requirement. 328 Commenters particularly were
concerned that a “materiality” standard could be difficult and impractical to apply because they
argued any sale of an asset could impact its market value to some degree. 329 They stated that it is
difficult to separate and quantify the market impact of a fund’s trades in a particular asset from
other reasons that an asset’s price could move (such as market events), particularly in dynamic
markets, and that projections of future market impact are difficult to make. 330 Furthermore, they
stated that without further guidance from the Commission funds may not know what “material”
should mean in the context of the proposed classification requirement. 331 Some commenters
specifically noted that the proposed value impact standard differed from the value impact
standard incorporated in the Commission’s guidelines limiting funds’ illiquid asset holdings,
which is based on whether a fund could sell an asset at approximately the value at which the fund

funds or portions of the market”); PIMCO Comment Letter; Vanguard Comment Letter.

has valued it, and that conflicting standards could raise confusion and operational difficulties. 332
Finally, several commenters argued that the inclusion of the value impact standard in the
proposed classification categories could give fund shareholders the false impression that the fund
guarantees a protected NAV. 333
As we noted when discussing the definition of “liquidity risk,” we continue to believe
that incorporating a value impact analysis into liquidity considerations is appropriate because it
indicates that liquidity risk for a fund captures not just the risk of being unable to meet
redemption requests, but also the risk that a fund could only meet redemption requests in a
manner that significantly dilutes the funds’ non-redeeming shareholders. Separately, as we noted
above, the inclusion of some consideration of value impact is common in regulators’
characterization of portfolio liquidity and fund liquidity risk. 334 Because we believe that the
liquidity of portfolio investments is a significant component of a fund’s overall liquidity risk, 335
we continue to believe that the inclusion of a value impact standard in the rule 22e-4
classification categories is appropriate. We also understand that many current trade order
management systems estimate value impacts that may result from trades, which may assist funds
in making these estimates.
Nevertheless, we have determined that certain modifications to the proposed value impact
standard are warranted to address certain concerns raised by commenters. First, we recognize
332

See, e.g., Interactive Data Comment Letter; NYC Bar Comment Letter; see also infra text accompanying
footnotes 341-342 (discussing the harmonization of the value impact standard incorporated in the definition
of “illiquid asset” that we are adopting with the standard incorporated in the rule 22e-4 classification
requirement generally).

See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(i)(A) (requiring a fund to consider its portfolio investments’ liquidity in assessing its
liquidity risk).

106

that in complying with the value impact standard, funds will be making assessments about the
trading behavior of certain asset classes (and individual investments, for investments that need to
be treated on an exception basis in the final classification framework we are adopting today).
Accordingly, funds should be able to rely on their reasonable expectations at the time they make
these assessments, and we do not expect them to estimate to a precise degree the market impact
of trading that investment or the value of that investment as the trades occur. 336 As a result, we
have modified the final rule to provide that an investment’s classification be based a fund’s
reasonable expectations in current market conditions (emphasis added). 337 We also expect that
the consolidation of the liquidity classification categories into ones that only require days-to-cash
projections out to seven days should also mitigate commenters’ concerns about the uncertainty
involved in these value impact projections because the consolidated categories do not involve
projections as far into the future as the proposed categories.
We also changed the standard to capture only value impacts that significantly change the
investment’s market value, rather than the proposed standard that focused on materially affecting
the value of the asset immediately prior to sale (emphasis added). We believe that funds will be
less likely to interpret significant changes in market value as capturing very small movements in
price, and thus this change should address commenters’ concern that the proposal would create a
value impact standard that is impractical to apply because any sale of an investment could affect
336

In the proposal, we noted that the proposed term “immediately prior to sale” was not meant to require a
fund to anticipate and determine in advance the precise current value of an asset at the moment before the
fund would sell the asset. We believe that the alterations to the final value impact standard reinforce this
intent. See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at text following n.170

337

A fund’s reasonable expectations pertain to each aspect of the definition of highly liquid investments,
moderately liquid investments, less liquid investments, and illiquid investments – i.e., a fund may rely on
its reasonable expectations as to the fund’s ability to convert the investment to cash (or, in some cases, sell
or dispose of the investment) in current market conditions in a certain number of days and a fund may rely
on its reasonable expectations as to whether the conversion to cash (or, in some cases, sale or disposition)
of the investment can be done without significantly changing the market value of the investment.

107

its market value to some degree. We also believe that a fund’s classification policies and
procedures should address what it would consider to be a significant change in market value.
Common alternatives that commenters suggested in place of the proposed value impact standard
included an “assuming no fire sale discounting” (or similar) standard 338 or various quantitative
materiality standards. 339 We believe a standard based on fire sale discounting would be too high
of a value impact threshold, whereas suggested quantitative standards would be too precise and
require burdensome calculations. However, we believe that the final value impact standard of
“without the conversion to cash (or in some cases, sale or disposition) significantly changing the
market value” appropriately balances our desire to capture the risk of dilution in cases of
inadequate liquidity, while not also requiring funds to account for every possible value
movement.
Finally, we note that the final value impact standard does not require the fund to
incorporate general market movements in liquidity determinations. We recognize that there can
be many reasons for the market value of a particular investment to fluctuate, separate from the
fund’s transactions in those investments. We do not intend for the value impact standard to
capture movements in an investment’s value due to market events. For this reason, we are not
adopting a value impact standard based on the fund’s most recent valuation of that investment as
suggested by some commenters. 340 This type of standard may have required a fund to compare
the investment’s traded price with the fund’s prior day valuation of the investment – such a
338

See, e.g., SIFMA Comment Letter I; T. Rowe Comment Letter; see also AFR Comment Letter (suggesting
standard should be that an asset could be sold at a price that does not create harm to fund shareholders due
to the fund being forced to accept disadvantageous terms of sale in order to find a buyer).

339

See, e.g., Interactive Data Comment Letter (asset could be sold at a price that has a less than 5% impact on
the value of that asset; asset could be sold at a price that does not create a 1 penny or more impact on the
fund’s NAV; fund could use volatility measures to determine security-specific materiality thresholds).

340

IDC Comment Letter; NYC Bar Comment Letter.

108

comparison likely would reflect the effects of general market movements. The value impact
standard we are adopting today only requires a fund to consider the market value impact of a
hypothetical sale of an investment.
We recognize that the value impact standard incorporated in the “illiquid investment”
definition is slightly different from the standard used in the definition of “illiquid asset” under
the Commission’s current guidelines, as the latter is based on whether a fund could sell an asset
at “approximately the value at which the fund has valued the investment.” 341 We believe the
revised value impact standard in the illiquid investment definition is preferable both because it
prevents confusion by harmonizing the value impact standards within the classification
framework and because, as just discussed, it removes any confusion that the value impact
standard incorporates general market movements that would occur between when a fund strikes
its NAV and when it trades the investment. 342
With respect to commenters’ concerns that the inclusion of a value impact standard in the
rule 22e-4 classification categories could give fund shareholders the false impression that the
fund guarantees a protected NAV, we do not believe that the final rule’s classification categories
imply a protected NAV. As noted in our discussion of the rule 22e-4 definition of “liquidity
risk,” we believe that funds’ narrative risk disclosure in their registration statements and other
shareholder communications generally should make clear those risks that could adversely affect
the fund’s NAV, yield, and total return, including liquidity-related risks. All open-end funds are
required to disclose that loss of money is a risk of investing in the fund. 343

109

d. Consideration of Current Market Conditions
The definition of each liquidity category in the classification requirement we are adopting
today specifically requires a fund to consider the time period in which an investment can be
converted to cash (or, in some cases, sold or disposed of) in current market conditions. 344 The
“current market conditions” specification is a change from the proposed classification
requirement, which did not explicitly require that a fund consider current market conditions in
making liquidity classification determinations. 345 The proposal, however, did require a fund to
“engage in an ongoing review” of the liquidity of each of its portfolio positions. 346 The
Commission suggested in the Proposing Release that a fund’s policies and procedures for
reviewing the liquidity of its portfolio positions generally should include procedures for
assessing market-wide developments, as well as security- and asset-class-specific developments
that could demonstrate a need to change the liquidity classification of a portfolio position. 347 The
proposal’s ongoing review standard (as opposed to the at-least-monthly review standard we are
adopting today 348) thus would have implicitly required that a fund’s liquidity determinations
reflect current market conditions.
Multiple commenters requested guidance and provided suggestions regarding the market
conditions a fund should consider in classifying its portfolio assets’ liquidity. Some commenters

the requirement to review liquidity classifications at least monthly and more frequently if changes in
relevant market, trading, and investment-specific considerations are reasonably expected to materially
affect one or more of a fund’s classifications of investments) and section III.E. (discussing the prohibition
on acquiring illiquid investments if, immediately after acquisition, the fund would have invested more than
15% of its net assets in illiquid investments that are assets).

assets based on an assessment of normal market conditions or stressed market conditions. 349 One
commenter suggested that the Commission provide additional guidance on how to assess the
value impact that a fund’s sale of portfolio assets could have under future stressed market
conditions. 350 Additionally, one commenter suggested that any final liquidity classification
framework should incorporate an assessment of reasonably foreseeable stressed conditions
instead of current market conditions. 351
In addition to the commenters who requested clarification or made suggestions about the
market conditions referenced in the proposed liquidity classification framework, multiple
commenters suggested alternative classification schemes that would more explicitly define
liquidity categories based on distinctions in how a particular asset would trade under normal
versus stressed market conditions. 352 One commenter suggested that this alternative method of
defining liquidity classification categories would reflect directly the extent to which assets’
liquidity can dynamically change as market conditions evolve. 353
After considering commenters’ suggestions and concerns, we are adopting liquidity
classification categories that reflect current market conditions. We appreciate commenters’
concerns that liquidity classifications based on current market conditions capture only a
moment-in-time picture of a fund’s portfolio liquidity, which may not accurately reflect liquidity

at a given price in a normal market environment will not be reflective of the market impact incurred when
liquidating positions during stressed markets.”

in changing market conditions. We also appreciate commenters’ concerns that investments that
are relatively liquid under normal conditions may exhibit significantly reduced liquidity during
times of stress. 354 However, we are concerned that requiring a fund to predict how an investment
may trade in stressed market conditions would introduce an additional layer of subjectivity into
the classification process. Specifically, we are concerned that funds would likely assume
varying levels of stress when classifying the liquidity of their portfolio investments. We believe
that liquidity categories requiring consideration of stressed conditions thus could impede our
goals of promoting consistency in funds’ processes for assessing portfolio investments’ liquidity
and enhancing the data quality of funds’ liquidity-related reporting and disclosure. Conversely,
we believe the requirement to assess current market conditions would increase consistency
among funds’ liquidity determinations by limiting the number of variables informing funds’
classification determinations. Although we understand that the adopted classification scheme
may not produce absolute consistency in how funds classify the liquidity of their portfolio
investments as funds’ assumptions and individual facts and circumstances may differ, 355
classifying based on current market conditions will result in all funds’ classifications at a given
time reflecting the same market conditions.
We believe that it would be informative to Commission staff to understand how the same
set of market conditions could disparately affect different funds’ assessments of their liquidity
and that of different asset classes. Also, we note that, to the extent that the markets in which
funds’ portfolio investments trade are currently stressed, consideration of current market

354

See generally MFS Comment Letter; NYC Bar Comment Letter.

355

As discussed above, we recognize that funds are likely to make different assumptions in classifying the
liquidity of their portfolio investments depending on the facts and circumstances relating to funds and their
trading practices. See supra paragraph accompanying footnote 311.

112

conditions would de facto reflect consideration of stressed market conditions. Therefore, the
requirement to consider current market conditions, along with the requirement for funds to
review the liquidity of their portfolio investments at least monthly356 and the Form N-PORT
reporting requirements concerning funds’ liquidity classifications, 357 will provide data that will
help the staff evaluate the role of changing market conditions on funds’ liquidity by comparing
liquidity data across different sets of current market conditions over time. We believe this
liquidity data would be more useful than data based on projected stressed market conditions,
because it would reflect funds’ assessments in light of actual, not anticipated, market stresses.
Finally, we note that while we are not incorporating a requirement to evaluate potential
future stressed market conditions in the portfolio investment liquidity classification requirement,
we continue to believe that it is appropriate to require funds to consider reasonably foreseeable
stressed conditions as part of the liquidity risk assessment and management requirements. 358 We
believe that funds’ liquidity risk assessment should inform the extent to which funds are prepared
to manage their liquidity under both normal and reasonably foreseeable stressed conditions—
particularly because, for many asset classes, liquidity is adversely affected by market stress and
funds need to have a liquidity risk management program that is resilient under all market
conditions. Thus, as discussed throughout this Release, a fund must establish liquidity risk
management policies and procedures appropriate in light of both normal and reasonably
foreseeable stressed market conditions.

357

See infra section III.C.6.b.

358

See supra section III.B. In discussing funds’ liquidity risk assessment obligations under rule 22e-4, we
note above that if a fund conducts stress testing to determine whether it has sufficient liquid investments to
cover different levels of redemptions, a fund should incorporate the results of this stress testing into its
liquidity risk assessment. See supra footnote 196.

2. Discussion of Specific Classification Categories
a. Highly Liquid Investments
The classification requirement we are adopting today requires a fund to identify its
“highly liquid investments,” that is, cash held by a fund and investments that the fund reasonably
expects to be convertible to cash in current market conditions in three business days or less
without the conversion to cash significantly changing the market value of the investment. This
category condenses the first two liquidity classification categories in the proposed classification
requirement (assets convertible to cash within one business day, as well as two-to-three business
days) to simplify the proposed classification framework. Multiple commenters who suggested
simplified alternatives to the proposed approach suggested including a classification category
based on portfolio assets’ convertibility to cash within three days. 359 One such commenter
suggested that “highly liquid assets” should include cash and any asset that can be converted to
cash in the ordinary course of business within three business days. 360 Additionally, another
commenter agreed that, given current redemption practices, funds should assess how much
liquidity they may need over a three-day period. 361
We continue to believe, as discussed in the Proposing Release, that it is important for
funds to determine what percentage of their portfolio is convertible to cash—that is, available to
meet redemptions—within the relatively short term. We understand that most funds typically
pay redemption proceeds within a fairly short period (typically, one to three days) after receiving
359

See, e.g., Federated Comment Letter; Fidelity Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter I; Vanguard
Comment Letter.

360

See Vanguard Comment Letter.

361

See MFDF Comment Letter (stating in the context of the proposed three-day liquid asset minimum, that
“[g]iven current redemption practices in the industry, we agree with the Commission that funds should
assess how much liquidity they may need, both in normal and stressed market conditions, over a three-day
period to effectively meet anticipated redemption requests.”).

114

a shareholder’s redemption request, even though a fund may disclose that it reserves the right to
delay payment for up to seven calendar days, as permitted by section 22(e) of the Act. 362
Likewise, funds may find it useful to identify portfolio investments that may be converted to
cash quickly in order to meet unexpected or unusually high redemption requests, or to rebalance
or otherwise adjust a portfolio’s composition in all market conditions.
We also understand that funds often consider which portfolio investments can be sold and
settled on a T+1 to T+3 basis when determining their very liquid investments. 363 While such an
analysis may be useful, our decision to define highly liquid investments to include any
investment that the fund reasonably expects to be convertible into cash in current market
conditions in three business days or less is founded in our belief that funds should understand
what portion of their investments are convertible to cash in a short period of time taking into
account current market conditions, not solely on which asset transactions can be settled in three
days or less from the trade date. An investment that takes two days to sell but one day to settle,
for example, would be convertible to cash in a short period of time. Conversely, an asset that
may settle two days after trade date, but which is reasonably expected to take at least three days
to trade, would not be available in a short period of time. Accordingly, we believe we have
appropriately defined “highly liquid investments” under rule 22e-4 notwithstanding initiatives to
shorten the standard settlement cycle for most broker-dealer transactions from T+3 to T+2. 364
In addition, we emphasize that the highly liquid investment category (and the related
highly liquid investment minimum) should not be interpreted as the Commission suggesting that

362

See supra footnote 9 and accompanying text.

363

See supra footnote 309.

364

See supra footnote 9.

115

a fund should, as a matter of routine practice, meet redemptions first by selling its highly liquid
investments. Rather, we believe part of a thorough understanding of a fund’s liquidity profile
includes an understanding of the nature and level of the fund’s highly liquid holdings. 365 As
noted above, we understand that funds currently place significance on understanding the portion
of their portfolio representing very liquid investments, as it is not unusual for funds to determine
the percentage of their portfolio that can be liquidated in the short-to-medium term. 366 We
anticipate that a fund could determine that a broad variety of investments within different asset
classes could be classified as highly liquid investments, depending on facts and circumstances. 367
We note that, as with the proposal, the highly liquid investment category measures the
time period in which an investment could be converted to cash in business days, as opposed to
the other liquidity categories, which use calendar days. Some commenters suggested that,
instead of the references to both business days and calendar days, the categories that the
Commission adopts should only reference business days. 368 One commenter stated that basing
all classification categories on business days instead of calendar days would be “preferable from
a consistency standpoint, and reasonable given the lack of expectations around receiving cash
flows on non-business days.” 369 Other commenters suggested alternative liquidity classification
categories that, like the proposed categories, would reference both business days and calendar

redemption requests).

calendar or business day convention. See infra footnotes 376 and accompanying text.

116

days. 370
After considering these comments, we are continuing to reference business days in the
highly liquid investment definition we are adopting, while referencing calendar days in the other
liquidity classification categories. We appreciate commenters’ concerns that classification
categories that reference both business days and calendar days could add some complexity in the
assumptions and models that funds may use in classifying the liquidity of their portfolio
investments. However, as discussed below, we believe it is important to tie the time frames
referenced in the moderately liquid, less liquid, and illiquid classification categories to the
seven-calendar-day period in which funds are required to pay redeeming shareholders under
section 22(e) of the Investment Company Act. 371 Although we could have referenced calendar
days instead of business days in the highly liquid investment definition to help standardize the
time periods referenced in all of the classification categories, we continue to reference business
days in this classification category for several reasons. First, for short time periods, a calendar
day standard could be unworkable and create absurd results if the time period were to encompass
weekends or holidays, during which trading cannot be expected to occur. Second, many of the
alternate classification categories that commenters suggested incorporated categories that
referenced a three-business-day period, 372 and we understand from these comments and staff
outreach that this is a workable (and, for some fund complexes, currently-used) period for a fund
to consider in assessing the liquidity of its portfolio investments. 373

We also note that rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, which was adopted in 1993 and became effective in
1995, established three business days as the standard settlement period for securities trades effected by a

117

b. Moderately Liquid Investments
A fund also will be required to identify its “moderately liquid investments,” that is, those
investments the fund reasonably expects to be convertible into cash in current market conditions
in more than three calendar days, but in seven calendar days or less, without the conversion to
cash significantly changing the market value of the investment. These investments are those that
are not immediately or very quickly convertible to cash, but that nevertheless may be converted
to cash in a time frame that would permit funds to pay redeeming shareholders within the
seven-day period established by section 22(e) of the Investment Company Act. We expect that
this classification category will be an important component of the Form N-PORT reporting
obligations because it will provide the Commission with information regarding the portion of a
fund’s portfolio that is not on the most liquid end of the spectrum, but still is sufficiently liquid
to meet redemption requests within the statutory seven-day period without causing significant
dilution. We also anticipate that the public will have an interest in gaining transparency into this
information on an aggregate basis. 374 Several commenters who suggested simplified alternatives
to the proposed classification approach recommended including a classification category based
on portfolio investments’ convertibility to cash within seven days. 375
We understand that circumstances could arise in which the sale and settlement period for
a particular portfolio position could be viewed as within three business days or four-to-seven
calendar days. For example, if a sale were to occur on a Thursday and be settled on a Monday,

broker-dealer. Thus, we understand that many funds pay redemption proceeds within three business days
after receiving a redemption request, because a broker or dealer will be involved in the redemption process.
See supra footnote 32 and accompanying text. See also supra footnote 366.

See infra section III.C.6.c.

375

See, e.g., Federated Comment Letter; Fidelity Comment Letter; PIMCO Comment Letter; Vanguard
Comment Letter.

118

the sale and settlement period could be viewed either as within three business days or four
calendar days. This situation could cause ambiguity for reporting purposes. Thus, rule 22e-4,
similar to the proposed rule, includes a note stating that a fund should classify the portfolio
position based on the shorter period (i.e., as a highly liquid investment). 376
c. Less Liquid Investments
Additionally, a fund will be required to identify its “less liquid investments,” that is,
those investments that the fund reasonably expects to be able to sell or dispose of in current
market conditions in seven calendar days or less a without the sale or disposition significantly
changing the market value of the investment, but where the sale or disposition is reasonably
expected to settle in more than seven calendar days. Thus, the less liquid investments category
focuses on investments whose sale cannot be settled quickly. For example, transactions in
certain types of securities—such as certain foreign securities 377 and U.S. bank loan
participations 378—have historically entailed settlement periods that are longer than standard

calendar or business day convention).

and noting that an “important tool in managing settlement times is the establishment of a credit line

settlement periods in the broader securities markets. If a fund were to determine that securities
within these asset classes, or other asset classes with longer-than-standard settlement periods,
were able to be sold within seven calendar days, but could not be settled within this period, the
fund should classify these securities as less liquid investments. As an example, certain foreign
securities may be able to be sold in seven calendar days or less, but may be subject to capital
controls that would limit the extent to which the foreign currency could be repatriated or
converted to dollars within this time frame. Thus, these securities would be considered to be less
liquid investments because they would be reasonably expected to settle in more than seven
calendar days. We note that trades in certain investments, however, may take an extended period
of time to settle. 379 In the event of an extended settlement period, at some point, a fund may need
to consider re-classifying such an investment as illiquid. 380 We also note that if a fund holds a
forward contract on a security, such as a forward in a transaction in the “To-Be-Announced”
(“TBA”) market, 381 the convert to cash determination for that instrument may be based on the
forward contract and not on the underlying securities to be received. 382

381

In the TBA market, lenders enter into forward contracts to sell agency mortgage-backed securities and
agree to deliver such securities on a settlement date in the future. The specific agency mortgage-backed
securities that will be delivered in the future may not yet be created at the time the forward contract is
entered into. The purchaser will contract to acquire a specified dollar amount of mortgage-backed
securities, which may be satisfied when the seller delivers one or more mortgage-backed securities pools at
settlement. For a discussion of the TBA market, see Task Force on Mortgage-Backed Securities
Disclosure, Staff Report: Enhancing Disclosure in the Mortgage-Backed Securities Markets (Jan. 2003), at
section II.E.2, available at http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/mortgagebacked.htm.

382

See ICI Comment Letter I (noting that the “TBA market is similar to the futures market, in which
physically-settled futures contracts may trade continuously (e.g., daily) but the underlying reference assets
are delivered at a later date (e.g., once every 3 months).”).

120

and the “illiquid investments” category, directly reflects the statutorily required seven-day period
for meeting redemption requests. The “less liquid investments” category is meant to identify for
the Commission and its staff, as well as investors and other potential users, the portion of a
fund’s portfolio investments that may be available to meet redemption requests within seven
days, but only to the extent that the fund addresses the lengthier settlement period associated
with these investments. Because less liquid investments are those that may be sold, but not
settled, within seven days, a fund generally could use less liquid investments to meet
redemptions within seven days only if the fund obtained an additional source of financing (for
example, a line of credit) to bridge the period until the sales would settle, or if the fund used its
cash holdings to meet the redemptions while simultaneously selling the less liquid investment
and then replenishing its cash holdings upon settlement.
Transparency regarding the portion of a fund’s portfolio held in less liquid investments
also could demonstrate those investments that could be liquidated in order to meet redemptions
that would occur more than a week in the future, if a fund were to enter into a period of extended
redemptions that it anticipates would last for multiple days. Because an open-end fund has an
obligation to meet redemption requests within seven days, we believe it is important for funds to
identify those investments that could pose certain challenges in being used to meet redemption
requests within that time period, for purposes of the fund’s own liquidity risk assessment and
management, 383 as well as to provide transparency into certain funds or strategies that could have
relatively limited liquidity compared to peer funds.
d. Illiquid Investments
383

For example, a fund’s holdings of less liquid investments typically would be a relevant consideration when
assessing whether its strategy is appropriate for an open-end fund and determining its highly liquid
investment minimum. See supra section III.B; see also infra section III.D.2.

121

A fund also will be required to identify those investments that it considers to be “illiquid
investments.” Rule 22e-4 as adopted today defines an illiquid investment as any investment that
a fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven
calendar days or less without the sale or disposition significantly changing the market value of
the investment. Like the “less liquid investments” and “moderately liquid investments”
category, the “illiquid investments” category references the statutorily required seven-day period
for meeting redemption requests. However, while the “less liquid investments” and “moderately
liquid investments” categories are based on the time period in which investments are convertible
to cash—that is, sold with the sale settled—the “illiquid investments” category only reflects the
period for selling (or otherwise disposing of) an investment and does not also consider settlement
timing.
Rule 22e-4 as proposed would have included a limit on funds’ ability to acquire “15%
standard assets,” or any asset that may not be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of
business within seven calendar days at approximately the value ascribed to it by the fund. 384
Under the proposal, 15% standard assets were not a category in the classification framework. In
determining whether an asset was a 15% standard asset, a fund would not have been required to
take into account any specific market or other factors, or assess position size as it could reflect
market depth, in determining whether it could sell the asset within seven days without the
specified value impact. 385 The proposed limit was intended to be consistent with the
Commission’s guidelines limiting funds’ holdings of illiquid assets to 15% of net assets 386 and

384

See proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iv)(D).

385

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at text following n.355.

386

See id., at section III.C.4.

122

most commenters supported the proposed 15% limit. 387
We understand, however, that funds have engaged in a variety of practices in determining
the illiquidity of investments. It has been our staff’s experience that some of these practices are
less robust than others. We believe that the definition of illiquid investments we are adopting
today will provide a clear standard for determining the illiquidity of investments and will better
ensure that all funds are determining the illiquidity of investments more consistently. We
recognize, however, that as a result of this new definition, some funds may take into account
relevant market, trading, and investment-specific considerations, as well as market depth, for the
first time and therefore, as discussed below, some funds may determine that a greater percentage
of holdings are illiquid. 388
We note that some commenters suggested strengthening the current illiquid asset
guidelines. 389 Many commenters also suggested that these assets continue to be referred to as
“illiquid assets” (not 15% standard assets) and be harmonized with any classification system that
the Commission ultimately adopts. 390 Additionally, commenters requesting such a
harmonization also stated that value impact standards should be consistent between the 15%
standard asset definition and the categories used in the classification. 391
We have determined to incorporate an illiquid investment category into rule 22e-4’s
broader classification requirement for several reasons. Specifically, harmonizing funds’ illiquid

Comment Letter.

123

investment determinations with the general liquidity classification framework will create
consistency in the value impact standards across liquidity categories. 392 As noted above, the
illiquid investment value impact standard in final rule 22e-4 has been changed from whether a
fund could sell an investment at “approximately the value at which the fund has valued the
investment,” to whether a fund could sell the investment “without the sale or disposition
significantly changing the market value of the investment.” 393 We are adopting this new value
impact standard for illiquid investment determinations in part as a response to commenters’
concerns about confusion that could arise from conflicting standards. Accordingly, the value
impact standard for illiquid investments is substantially identical to the value impact standard for
all other classification categories. 394 As discussed in more detail above, the final classification
value impact standard highlights that: (i) the standard does not require a fund to actually re-value
or re-price an investment for classification purposes; and (ii) the standard does not require the
fund to incorporate general market movements in liquidity determinations or estimate market
impact to a precise degree. 395
Significantly, in harmonizing features of the illiquid investment category with other
categories in the liquidity classification framework, we also are replacing existing Commission
guidance on identifying illiquid assets with new regulatory requirements regarding the process
for determining that certain investments are illiquid. 396 In the Proposing Release, we noted that
we were proposing to withdraw Commission guidance because we believed the proposal would

124

provide “a more comprehensive framework for funds to evaluate the liquidity of their assets.” 397
We also requested comment on whether additional guidance is needed in connection with the
proposed codification of the Commission’s illiquid asset guidelines. Although many
commenters supported the proposed codification of the Commission’s guidelines on illiquid
assets, 398 most did not specifically comment on the Commission’s proposal to withdraw the
guidance associated with its illiquid asset guidelines. However, certain commenters suggested
that stronger requirements and guidance regarding assets subject to the 15% limit could be
appropriate. 399 One commenter expressed concern that the Commission’s guidelines today are
having only a “limited impact on fund behavior” and that the current 15% limit “applies to an
inappropriately narrow range of assets and is therefore ineffective as an investor protection
mechanism.” 400 This commenter suggested that the limit should encompass not only those assets
that are not able to be sold within seven days at approximately the value ascribed by the fund,
but also those assets that cannot be converted to cash (that is, sold with the sale settled) within
this same period, taking into account this same value impact standard. 401
We agree with those commenters that suggested the Commission’s current guidelines,
together with many funds’ interpretation of these guidelines today, may result in funds only
focusing on certain largely structural features that can lessen the liquidity of an investment (such
as transfer restrictions and trading halts) rather than more market- and trading-based features.

125

This can result in funds considering only an artificially narrow set of portfolio investments to be
illiquid. As we discussed in the Proposing Release, we understand that today it is common—
even for complexes with generally robust liquidity risk management procedures—to treat the
process for determining whether an investment is illiquid under the current Commission
guidelines as a compliance or “back-office” function, with little indication that information
generated from the risk or portfolio management functions informs the compliance
determinations. Thus, we understand that some funds currently may determine that an
investment is liquid, rather than illiquid, primarily based on certain structural characteristics of
the investment without assessing market or trading information or other potentially relevant
factors. Such investments include private equity securities and certain other privately placed or
restricted securities, 402 as well as certain instruments or transactions that by their structure do not
mature and are not readily transferable in seven days or less, including term repurchase
agreements. 403 While a focus on structural features alone may be appropriate in some
circumstances (for example, an across-the-board assumption that all securities with a trading halt
are illiquid, without an additional assessment of market or trading factors), in other
circumstances the failure to consider market, trading, and other relevant information could result
in a fund considering an investment to be liquid even if the fund cannot reasonably expect to sell
amounts it reasonably anticipates trading without the sale or disposition significantly changing
the market value of the investment within seven calendar days.
For these reasons, rule 22e-4 as adopted today, requires a fund to incorporate certain
additional considerations in determining whether an investment is illiquid. We are withdrawing

existing guidance and replacing it with new regulatory requirements and guidance regarding the
process for determining whether a portfolio investment is illiquid. 404 A fund would have to take
into account “relevant market, trading, and investment-specific considerations” when
determining whether an investment is an illiquid investment. 405
The guidance the Commission provides below on matters funds might consider in
assessing market, trading, and investment-specific considerations reflects factors that the
Commission has previously said are reasonable examples of factors to evaluate in determining
whether a rule 144A security is liquid and makes them more generally applicable to assessing
liquidity of other investments. 406 Thus, this guidance draws on past Commission guidance for
evaluating whether a certain type of investment is liquid or illiquid, and extends this process to a
fund’s liquidity determinations regarding all types of investments. We recognize that the
guidance in the Rule 144A Release anticipates that fund boards will determine whether certain
securities are liquid or illiquid. 407 While we have considered the specific guidance factors
discussed in the Rule 144A Release in the context of the guidance we provide herein with respect
to classifying the liquidity of portfolio investments, neither our guidance nor the final rule places
the responsibility for determining whether a specific security is liquid or illiquid on the fund’s
board. The board would, however, be responsible for approving the fund’s liquidity risk
management program, which provides the framework for evaluating the liquidity of the fund’s
investments, and for reviewing (at least annually) a written report that describes a review of the

program’s adequacy and the effectiveness of its implementation. Overall, a fund must classify
its investments by focusing on those market, trading, and investment-specific considerations that
are relevant to its portfolio. We believe that this principles-based approach should result in funds
making realistic and well-informed determinations about investments’ liquidity (or illiquidity)
based on analysis beyond simple decisions solely about structural features of an asset class.
As with other liquidity classification categories and as discussed in more detail in section
III.C.3.a below, funds can determine illiquid investments on an asset-class basis, with exceptions
for investments whose liquidity characteristics significantly differ from the class. For example, a
fund could employ procedures whereby certain asset classes are initially considered liquid, and
then further evaluated to decide whether relevant market, trading, and investment-specific
considerations should result in a particular investment being treated as an exception and a change
to the initial liquidity determination. 408 A fund could use the specific guidance factors we discuss
in section III.C.4 below as part of its process for taking into account relevant market, trading, and
investment-specific considerations in determining whether an investment is illiquid. For
example, a fund that generally considers certain high-yield bonds not to be illiquid (for instance,
a fund that typically considers high-yield domestic corporate bonds to be moderately liquid
investments) could determine that certain securities within this class are actually illiquid
investments, based on restrictions on trading that could occur if one of these bonds’ issuers were
to enter bankruptcy and the debt were to become distressed. Conversely, a fund that generally
considers certain investments to be illiquid (such as rule 144A securities) could determine that
408

See infra section III.C.3.a (discussing that, under rule 22e-4, a fund would generally be permitted to
classify its portfolio investments according to their asset class, but if it has information that a particular
investment has different liquidity characteristics than other investments within the same asset class, it
would need to treat that investment as an exception to the way that the fund classifies its other holdings
within the same asset class).

128

some of these investments should be included in another liquidity category based on relevant
market, trading, and investment-specific considerations. 409
We also understand, based on staff outreach, that some fund complexes make
determinations of whether a portfolio investment is liquid (or illiquid) under the current
Commission guidelines based on whether a single trading lot for the investment can be sold
within seven days under normal market circumstances. Certain funds interpret this to allow them
to declare an entire holding to be liquid even if they could only sell a very small portion of it
without a significant value impact. Staff has observed that these fund practices and
interpretations of current Commission guidelines may result in a fund determining that very few,
if any, portfolio investments are illiquid under the current guidelines, even in situations in which
the liquidity of a large portion of a fund’s portfolio is fairly limited.
Given the practices described above when funds did not consider market depth in making
liquidity determinations and considering the comments discussed above regarding the proposed
illiquid asset limit, under the final rule, a fund will be required to consider market depth in
determining whether to classify portfolio investments as illiquid investments. To the extent that
the fund determines that trading varying portions of a position is reasonably expected to
significantly affect the liquidity characteristics of that investment—that is, the market depth for
the investment is reasonably expected to significantly affect its liquidity—the fund would need
to take this into account in classifying the investment as illiquid. 410 These are the same market
depth considerations a fund would have to take into account in classifying the liquidity of its

classifying the liquidity of fund securities).

Rule 22e-4(b)(1)(ii).

129

portfolio investments generally, as discussed in detail below. 411
Members of the fund industry have argued that because a fund will not likely need to sell
its entire position in a particular investment under normal market circumstances, liquidity
determinations should be based on the sale of a single trading lot for that investment, except in
unusual circumstances. 412 However, a fund could encounter situations in which it needs to
liquidate larger portions than one trading lot of its positions in order to meet redemption requests,
but cannot do so within the seven-day time period required under section 22(e). As discussed
below, we believe that the market depth considerations required by the final classification
requirement will appropriately require a fund to consider situations in which the size of a fund’s
holdings could significantly affect those holdings’ liquidity and impact the fund’s ability to
manage its liquidity risk—that is, when portfolio liquidity may be significantly constrained by
the fund’s ability to trade meaningful sizes of its portfolio holdings. We believe this assessment
of market depth will assist in illiquidity determinations incorporating a realistic analysis of a
fund’s ability to meet redemption requests without significant dilution, and thus in funds better
managing liquidity risk.
As discussed above, one commenter suggested extending the definition of illiquid assets
to encompass not only those assets that are not able to be sold within seven days at
approximately the value ascribed by the fund, but also those assets where the sale cannot be
settled within this same period, taking into account the same value impact standard. 413 After
considering this suggestion, we have ultimately decided that the “illiquid investments” category

411

See infra III.C.3.b.

412

413

See supra footnote 401 and accompanying text.

130

under rule 22e-4 should reflect only the period for selling or disposing of an investment and not
also consider settlement timing. Instead, the “less liquid” category reflects those investments
that could be sold, but not settled, within seven days without a significant value impact.
Investments that cannot be sold within seven days without a significant value impact (illiquid
investments, under rule 22e-4) have different liquidity characteristics and are essentially less
liquid than investments that can be sold within seven days without a significant value impact, but
whose sale cannot be settled within this period (less liquid investments, under rule 22e-4). 414 As
discussed above, less liquid investments could still be considered a limited source of liquidity for
meeting redemptions within the seven-day period specified under section 22(e) of the Act, with
the caveat that a fund may have to address certain challenges associated with their settlement,
whereas a fund’s illiquid investments are structurally or as a matter of market dynamics less
liquid and a fund may be unable to use them to meet redemptions within seven days. 415
However, we note that trades in certain investments may take an extended period of time
to settle. Trades in some low quality loans, for example, may not settle for a number of
months. 416 A fund that holds less liquid investments with extended settlement periods must
develop a liquidity risk management program that takes into account the liquidity risks

414

When a fund sells an asset (even if the transaction has not yet settled), the fund has a receivable on its
books, and any potential loss from the sale of that asset will be reflected in the fund’s NAV. If the fund has
an asset it cannot sell, however, the fund continues to be exposed to the risk of unknown potential loss until
the asset can be sold.

415

See supra paragraph accompanying footnote 383 (discussing less liquid investments and the extent to
which less liquid investments may be available to meet redemption requests within seven days if a fund
addresses certain challenges associated with their sale and settlement).

See e.g., Michael Mackenzie and Tracy Alloway, Lengthy US loan settlements prompt liquidity fears,
Financial Times (May 1, 2014), available at http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/32181cb6-d096-11e3-9a8100144feabdc0.html#axzz4HQiQv5wj (noting that a quarter of new loans being issued were taking more

associated with extended settlement periods. 417 These policies and procedures could include
limits on the amount of less liquid investments with extended settlement periods a fund will hold
or more frequent liquidity classification reviews for this type of holding. Such a fund may also
wish to consider the circumstances in which it would seek to obtain expedited settlement (where
possible) and establish tailored policies and procedures regarding how and when it would seek
expedited settlement. Funds may also wish to consider whether to obtain an additional source of
financing (for example, a committed line of credit dedicated to that fund) to bridge the period
until the sales would settle.
We believe that the new requirement to take into account market, trading, and
investment-specific considerations, as well as to consider market depth, in identifying illiquid
investments responds to the concern that the way illiquid investments are currently defined has
only limited effects on funds’ liquidity risk management and the liquidity of their portfolios. 418
We understand that, to the extent a fund is not currently taking into account market, trading, and
investment-specific considerations or market depth when assessing the illiquidity of its
investments, the new regulatory requirements regarding the process for determining that certain
investments are illiquid under the rule are likely to result in the fund determining that a greater
percentage of its holdings are illiquid than under the guidelines. In extreme circumstances,
this—in combination with the limitation on funds’ illiquid investment holdings to 15% of its net
assets discussed at section III.E below—could cause certain funds to have to modify their
investment strategies or reconsider their structure as open-end funds. We also understand that
417

Such extended settlement period securities have the potential to pose heightened liquidity risks for funds,
and thus policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to assess and manage the liquidity risk of a
fund that holds such securities would take into account the particular liquidity risks raised by such holdings.
See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(i).

418

See supra footnote 400 and accompanying text.

132

these requirements will entail additional operational costs, to the extent that funds today do not
generally take into account relevant market, trading, and investment-specific considerations, or
market depth, in determining whether their portfolio investments are illiquid. However, as
discussed in detail in the Economic Analysis section below, we believe that these costs are
justified by the investor protection benefits that we believe will result from better portfolio
liquidity assessments. 419
3. Required Classification Procedures
a. Classification Based on Asset Class
Rule 22e-4, as adopted today, generally permits a fund to, as a starting point, classify the
liquidity of its portfolio investments according to their asset class. 420 Notwithstanding this
general approach, a fund will be required to separately classify any investment if the fund or its
adviser, after reasonable inquiry, has information about any market, trading, or
investment-specific considerations that are reasonably expected to significantly affect the
liquidity characteristics of that investment as compared to the fund’s other portfolio holdings
within that asset class. 421 For example, if the fund or its adviser were to know that particular
large-capitalization equity was affected by adverse events at the issuer that caused it to have
different liquidity characteristics than the asset class as a whole, it would be required to treat that
investment as an exception and classify it separately. As another example, a fund could decide
that high credit quality corporate bonds generally fall into a particular liquidity category, but if
the fund or its adviser had information that certain bonds’ bid-ask spreads are significantly wider

419

133

or more volatile than those of their peers, it would be required under rule 22e-4 to separately
assess these bonds and potentially classify them into a less-liquid category than the fund’s other
holdings within the same asset class. We expect that, based on a fund’s responsibility under the
rule to classify each of its investments after reasonable inquiry and taking into account relevant
market, trading, and investment-specific considerations, there are some asset classes, such as
those encompassing some bespoke complex derivatives or complex structured securities, 422 that
have such a range of liquidity characteristics that each position would need to be classified
individually.
Rule 22e-4 as proposed would not have allowed a fund to, as a starting point, classify its
portfolio investments according to asset class. The proposed rule instead would have required a
fund to classify each of its positions in a portfolio asset (or portions of a position) according to
the liquidity categories included in the rule. 423 In the Proposing Release, we requested comment
on whether the proposed classification requirement and associated liquidity categories reflected
the manner in which funds currently assess and categorize the liquidity of their portfolio holdings
as part of their portfolio and risk management.
Many commenters objected to the proposed position-level classification requirement,
arguing that it does not reflect recognized liquidity risk management practices and does not
reflect industry best practices. 424 Commenters likewise maintained that, instead of assessing
portfolio liquidity on a position-by-position basis, asset managers tend to focus on the liquidity
of certain asset classes and/or generally view liquidity at the portfolio level based on a

“top-down” analysis. 425 On the other hand, some commenters acknowledged that certain asset
managers may classify the liquidity of individual portfolio positions within a range of categories,
albeit not at the level of detail suggested by the proposal, or for all classes of portfolio assets. 426
Commenters stated that considering portfolio liquidity on the basis of asset class, at least
as a starting point, has practical, operational, and conceptual benefits compared to considering
the liquidity of each portfolio position individually. 427 Commenters stated that assets with certain
similar characteristics are often “highly comparable and substitutable from a liquidity
perspective,” 428 and liquidity assessments based on asset class would permit a fund manager to
account for differences in market structure and portfolio management objectives among asset
classes. 429 Commenters also argued that evaluating and classifying each portfolio asset
individually would be “overly burdensome and near-impossible to manage,” as a fund complex
may collectively hold hundreds of thousands of individual portfolio assets, 430 and the data
required to classify each asset individually may not be readily available for all asset types
(particularly for fixed income or other OTC assets).
Relatedly, multiple commenters suggested alternative liquidity classification schemes
that would be based on an “asset-type mapping with exceptions” analysis. 431 These alternatives
used an approach where a fund’s portfolio assets’ liquidity generally would be classified by asset

class—with exceptions to the extent a particular portfolio asset demonstrates liquidity
characteristics that differ from the liquidity of its asset class generally and that are deemed to
make the position substantially more or less liquid. 432 Assets treated on an exception basis could
be placed in a different liquidity category than the rest of their asset class, which could be either
higher or lower. 433 The asset class analysis provisions of final rule 22e-4 generally take this
approach. The primary difference between commenters’ “asset-type mapping with exceptions”
suggested approaches and the approach incorporated in final rule 22e-4 is that commenters’
suggested approaches would rely on the Commission (or an industry group) assigning default
liquidity categories to each asset class, whereas the approach we are adopting would depend on
each fund performing this exercise based on its adviser’s individual experience in the markets.
We believe that this approach strikes an appropriate balance between lessening
operational burdens associated with classification and recognizing that many investments within
an asset class may be considered interchangeable from a liquidity perspective, on one hand, and
providing reasonably precise liquidity classifications that appropriately reflect investments’
liquidity characteristics, on the other hand. This approach also should leverage fund managers’
current practices to a greater degree than under the proposal. A fund’s asset-class-based
classification procedures should incorporate sufficient detail to meaningfully distinguish between
asset classes and sub-classes. For example, a fund may wish to distinguish how it classifies its
equity securities based on factors such as the market(s) in which the security’s issuer is based,
market capitalization, and whether the security is common or preferred stock. As another
example, a fund may wish to distinguish its fixed income securities based on factors such as
432

See, e.g., SIFMA Comment Letter III.

433

Id.

136

issuer type, the market(s) in which the issuer is based, seniority, age, and credit quality, and to
distinguish its holdings of structured products based on tranche seniority and credit quality. We
do not consider it appropriate for a fund to use very general asset class categories (e.g.,
“equities,” “fixed income,” and “other”) in classifying the liquidity of its portfolio investments,
as these broad categories would likely not permit a fund to identify investments with fungible
liquidity characteristics. A fund’s asset-class-based classification procedures also should include
procedures for updating default asset-class liquidity classifications as relevant market, trading,
and investment-specific considerations warrant. 434
A fund would be required to separately classify any investment within an asset class if
the fund or its adviser were to have information about any market, trading, or investment specific
considerations that are reasonably expected to significantly affect the liquidity characteristics of
that investment as compared to the fund’s other portfolio holdings within that asset class (its
“exception processes”). 435 Rule 22e-4 does not specify precisely how a fund must identify
investments that should be classified separately as part of its exception processes. However,
reasonably designed policies and procedures would likely include specifying the sources of
inputs that inform its exception processes (for example, inputs from the fund’s portfolio
management, risk management, and/or trading functions), as well as particular variables that
could affect the fund’s classification of certain investments. For example, a fund could
determine that a particular investment should be classified differently than other investments
within its asset class if the market for that particular investment were exceptional in terms of
434

See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(ii) (requiring funds to classify their investments taking into account relevant market,
trading, and investment-specific considerations and to review their portfolio investments’ classifications if
changes in these considerations are reasonably expected to materially affect one or more of their
investments’ classifications).

137

size, breadth, or depth, or if the investment’s typical bid-ask spreads were generally wider,
narrower, or more volatile than the bid-ask spreads of other assets within the asset class. A fund
could incorporate an assessment of the liquidity classification guidance factors discussed below,
as the fund determines appropriate, in its exception processes. 436
b. Required Procedures for Considering Market Depth
Under rule 22e-4 as adopted today, a fund would be required to determine whether
trading varying portions of a position in a particular portfolio investment, in sizes that the fund
would reasonably anticipate trading, is reasonably expected to significantly affect the liquidity
characteristics of that investment. 437 To the extent that the fund determines that trading varying
portions of a position is reasonably expected to significantly affect the liquidity characteristics of
that investment—that is, the market depth for the investment is reasonably expected to
significantly affect its liquidity—the fund would need to take this into account in classifying the
liquidity of that investment. 438 As discussed in more detail below, this requirement would have a
fund consider portions of a portfolio position that are larger than a single trading lot, but not
necessarily the position’s full size, in assessing its portfolio investments’ liquidity.
These market depth-related requirements are meant to substitute for, and modify, the
language of proposed rule 22e-4 that would have effectively required a fund to consider position
size in classifying the liquidity of its portfolio investments. As discussed above, proposed rule
22e-4 would have had a fund consider, for each portfolio position, the amount of time it would
take to convert the entire position, or portions thereof, to cash. 439 Under this proposed

138

requirement, if a fund were to conclude that it would take the fund longer to convert its entire
position in an asset to cash, it could determine, for example, that 50% of the position should be
classified in one liquidity category, and the remaining 50% should be classified in another
category.
This aspect of the proposed requirement arose from our belief that a fund should consider
its ability to trade larger portions of a portfolio asset than a single trading lot in assessing its
portfolio investments’ liquidity. The ability to quickly trade larger portions of a particular
position is a reflection of market depth for a particular asset, which is a well-recognized aspect of
assessing liquidity. 440 In the Proposing Release, we responded to arguments that because a fund
will not likely need to sell its entire position in a particular asset under normal market conditions,
liquidity determinations should be based on the sale of a single trading lot for that asset, except
in unusual circumstances. 441 We noted that, although we agreed that a fund not being able to
convert its entire position in an asset to cash at a price that does not materially affect the value of
that asset should not, by itself, be dispositive of a portfolio asset’s liquidity, assessing liquidity
only on the basis of the ability to sell and receive cash for a single trading lot of an asset ignores
the fact that a fund may need to sell all (or a significant portion) of its position. 442
Multiple commenters expressed concern about the proposed requirement to consider full
position size in classifying the liquidity of a fund’s portfolio assets. 443 Commenters argued that

440

See infra footnote 526 and accompanying text.

441

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at n.177 and accompanying text.

442

See id., at paragraph accompanying n.177. For example, a fund needing to sell certain assets in order to
meet redemptions may need to sell more than one trading lot of a particular asset. In addition, a fund may
determine to dispose of an entire position because of deteriorating credit quality or other portfolio
management factors. Similarly, an index fund may need to sell an entire position in an asset if that asset
falls out of the tracked index.

443

See, e.g., BlackRock Comment Letter; IDC Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter I; Wellington

139

many industry participants currently assess asset liquidity by trading lot (as opposed to
evaluating whether a fund can exit an entire position within a certain time period), reflecting that
a fund generally would not need to liquidate an entire large position unexpectedly. 444
Commenters also contended that this aspect of the proposal could result in large funds’ portfolio
liquidity appearing artificially low compared to smaller funds because large funds are more
likely to hold larger positions and determine that they could not quickly liquidate these positions
entirely without a value impact. 445 Commenters argued that it could be misleading for large
funds to appear to be less liquid than smaller funds, because large funds’ portfolios might
actually entail less liquidity risk compared to smaller funds (because each position, while large in
absolute size, is a smaller portion of the overall portfolio than may be the case in smaller funds),
and large funds may have greater resources than smaller funds to manage liquidity effectively. 446
For example, one commenter stated that large funds often have more diversified holdings than
smaller funds and may wield more negotiating power with broker-dealers. 447
The market depth approach we are adopting takes commenters’ concerns into account,
although as discussed above we continue to believe that an investment strategy involving large
positions in particular issuers—particularly if the fund’s portfolio is relatively concentrated—is
relevant to assessing liquidity risk. 448 We appreciate that, in many cases, a fund may not have to
trade large portions of its portfolio holdings in relatively short time periods in order to meet

redemptions, or to otherwise manage its liquidity risk. For example, a fund may not need to
often quickly convert large portions of its portfolio investments to cash, based on its cash flow
projections (e.g., if the fund’s investors are known to be primarily long-term investors) and other
liquidity risk assessment factors. 449 We also recognize that there could be situations in which the
requirement to consider entire position size in classifying a fund’s portfolio investments,
regardless of the size of trades a fund typically engages in, could make a fund appear to be less
liquid than the fund’s actual trading experiences in light of its portfolio investments’ market
depth. This could be misleading if the fund were actually able to trade a large percentage of its
holdings fairly quickly without the fund’s trades significantly moving the investments’ prices.
We believe that the required market depth considerations incorporated into the final
classification requirement will permit a fund to more realistically assess the liquidity of its
portfolio investments because they allow a fund to classify and review its portfolio investments
taking into account position sizes that the fund would reasonably anticipate trading.
We believe that if a fund reasonably anticipates trading sizeable portions of its portfolio
positions, the fund’s portfolio liquidity could be adversely affected by a lack of market depth for
its portfolio investments. A fund could reasonably anticipate trading sizeable portions of its
portfolio positions if it often trades relatively large portions of its portfolio positions. Likewise,
a fund may not trade larger portions of its portfolio positions on a regular basis, but could
reasonably anticipate, based on past flow patterns or current market conditions that it could
encounter larger-than-typical redemptions that would necessitate larger portfolio trades. In both
of these examples, such a fund could conclude that it may be difficult to find trading partners for
a particular portfolio investment, or may be difficult to sell the investment within a particular
449

See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(i).

141

time frame without this sale causing a significant value impact. For this reason, rule 22e-4
requires a fund to consider the sizes of a particular investment that the fund would reasonably
anticipate trading and whether trading in such sizes could significantly affect the investment’s
liquidity. If so, the fund would be required to take this into account in classifying the liquidity of
that portfolio investment. 450 If the fund determined, after conducting the required market depth
analysis, that a downward adjustment in the liquidity classification of a particular investment is
appropriate, the new liquidity classification that the fund assigns to this investment would apply
to the entirety of the fund’s position in that investment (not, as proposed, to portions of that
position). This approach is meant to lessen burdens on funds, as well as respond to commenters’
concerns, by focusing a fund’s market depth considerations on circumstances in which a fund’s
practices in trading varying portions of its portfolio positions could have a disproportionate
effect on its portfolio investments’ liquidity.
Rule 22e-4 directs a fund to consider sizes that the fund would reasonably anticipate
trading in assessing the impact of market depth on an investment’s liquidity. 451 Depending on
the liquidity risk factors that a fund must consider under rule 22e-4(b)(1)(i), as well as other
factors including the fund’s size, a fund could reasonably anticipate selling various portions of its
position in a particular portfolio investment, or various dollar amounts or block sizes of a
particular portfolio investment. 452 For example, it may be appropriate for a fund with a highly

and operating in very stable market conditions, to adopt policies and procedures that consider
whether trading relatively small fractions of each of the fund’s portfolio holdings would result in
significant liquidity impacts. On the other hand, we would generally consider it appropriate for a
fund whose holdings are relatively illiquid and/or fairly concentrated, with unpredictable cash
flow projections or deteriorating market conditions in the markets in which it invests, to consider
whether trading larger portions of its portfolio holdings would result in significant liquidity
impacts.
c. Classification Issues Arising with Respect to Derivatives Transactions
Rule 22e-4 requires that the liquidity classification and review requirements cover each
of the fund’s investments, including derivatives transactions, and that a fund take into account
relevant market, trading, and investment-specific considerations in classifying the liquidity of its
investments. 453 The rule also states that for derivatives transactions that a fund has classified as
moderately liquid investments, less liquid investments, and illiquid investments, the fund must
identify the percentage of its highly liquid investments that are segregated to cover, or pledged to
satisfy margin requirements in connection with, derivatives transactions in each of these
classification categories. 454 A fund also will be required to disclose these percentages on its
Form N-PORT filings. 455 We believe a fund’s disclosure of this percentage will permit the
Commission and its staff to understand what percentage of a fund’s highly liquid investment

in order to cover the fund’s obligations under its derivatives transactions, rule 22e-4 assumes that a fund
would not segregate any of its assets identified as illiquid investments to cover its derivatives transactions.

minimum is composed of encumbered assets, and will allow the public to better understand that a
certain percentage of a fund’s highly liquid investments may not be immediately available for
liquidity risk management purposes. The final rule does not require the fund to determine or
disclose the percentage of the fund’s moderately liquid investments or less liquid investments
that the fund has segregated to cover, or pledged in connection with, its derivatives transactions,
because we understand that funds are less likely to post moderately or less liquid investments as
margin or collateral. We also expect that investors and others will find most valuable
information regarding the extent to which the fund’s highly liquid investments are segregated or
pledged in connection with derivatives transactions because understanding that percentage may
give investors a better understanding of whether such assets are truly available to make
redemptions.
These requirements replace the proposed requirement for a fund to consider the
“relationship of [an] asset to another portfolio asset” in classifying and reviewing the liquidity of
its portfolio assets, 456 as well as the derivatives-focused guidance that the Commission provided
in the Proposing Release regarding this proposed classification factor. 457 The Commission’s
guidance was meant to give direction to funds’ liquidity classification of derivatives transactions
and the assets that a fund may segregate to cover its obligations under these transactions. 458 As
discussed below, we are not adopting the proposed factors that a fund would have had to
consider in classifying the liquidity of its portfolio holdings, including the “relationship of [an]

asset to another portfolio asset” factor. 459 However, we are adopting new classification
provisions in rule 22e-4 that will apply to derivatives transactions 460 as well as a provision that
will address assets segregated to cover derivatives transactions 461 so that funds consistently
consider certain unique aspects of these transactions, and also to respond to commenters’
concerns stemming from the treatment of derivatives under the proposal.
In the Proposing Release, we noted that when funds enter into certain transactions that
implicate section 18 of the Investment Company Act, they generally will maintain, in a
segregated account, certain liquid assets in order to “cover” the fund’s obligation under the
transactions. 462 We applied this framework to certain financing transactions in Release 10666,
issued in 1979, 463 and also understand that funds today apply this framework to certain
derivatives, based on the guidance we provided in Release 10666 and on no-action letters issued
by our staff. 464 We explained in Release 10666 that “[a] segregated account freezes certain assets
of the investment company and renders such assets unavailable for sale or other disposition.” 465
459

Instead, we are requiring that a fund must take into account market, trading, and investment-specific
considerations in classifying the liquidity of its portfolio investments. See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(ii); see also
supra section III.C.1.b. We provide guidance below on specific factors that a fund may find appropriate to
consider in furtherance of this requirement. See infra section III.C.4.

See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(ii).

Release 10666, supra footnote 220. In December 2015, the Commission proposed a new exemptive rule,
rule 18f-4, which would permit funds to enter into derivatives transactions and financial commitment
transactions notwithstanding section 18 of the Investment Company Act, provided that the funds comply
with the conditions of the proposed rule. In proposing rule 18f-4, the Commission noted that, should the
rule be adopted, it would rescind Release 10666 and relevant staff no-action letters. See 2015 Derivatives

Investment Management (Nov. 7, 1997) (staff letter taking the position that a fund could segregate assets

145

We also stated in Release 10666 that only certain types of liquid assets should be placed in a
segregated account.
Thus, we noted in the Proposing Release that, although assets used by a fund to cover
derivatives and other transactions should be liquid when considered in isolation, when evaluating
their liquidity for purposes of proposed rule 22e-4, the fund would have to consider that they are
being used to cover other transactions and, consistent with our position in Release 10666, are
“frozen” and “unavailable for sale or other disposition.” 466 We stated that because these assets
are only available for sale to meet redemptions once the related derivatives position is disposed
of or unwound, a fund should classify the liquidity of these segregated assets using the liquidity
of the derivative instruments they are covering. We also provided guidance that, when a
formerly segregated asset is no longer segregated, a fund generally should assess, as part of the
proposed ongoing liquidity classification review requirement, whether the liquidity classification
given to the portfolio asset when it was segregated continues to be appropriate. Finally, we
noted in the Proposing Release that in addition to the liquidity of a fund’s derivatives positions
themselves, assessing a fund’s liquidity risk generally may include an evaluation of the potential
liquidity demands that may be imposed on the fund in connection with its use of derivatives,
including any variation margin or collateral calls the fund may be required to meet. 467
The Proposing Release included a request for comment on the proposed “relationship of
[an] asset to another portfolio asset” liquidity classification factor, which included asking
whether rule 22e-4 should explicitly require a fund to classify the liquidity of a position (or

by designating such assets on its books, rather than establishing a segregated account at its custodian).

portions of a position in a particular asset) used to cover a derivative position using the same
liquidity classification category as it assigned to the derivative, and whether the Commission
should provide additional guidance regarding the circumstances in which a fund should consider
the liquidity of a particular portfolio asset in relation to the liquidity of another asset. 468 Multiple
commenters raised concerns about the proposed “relationship of [an] asset to another portfolio
asset” liquidity classification factor and accompanying guidance in the Proposing Release. 469
Many stated that the Commission’s guidance as to classifying segregated assets using the
liquidity of the derivative instrument they are covering would be unworkable and would raise
costly operational burdens, because funds currently do not identify individual liquid assets to
cover specific derivatives transactions. 470 Instead, commenters noted that it is common in the
fund industry for a fund to review its outstanding obligations under its derivatives positions on a
portfolio basis and determine an aggregate amount of liquid assets that must be segregated in
connection with the transactions requiring coverage. 471 One commenter suggested that, instead
of the proposed “relationship of [an] asset to another portfolio asset” liquidity classification
factor, the Commission alternatively could require funds to assign liquidity classifications to
cover assets on an aggregate portfolio basis in amounts corresponding to the aggregate amount of
derivatives exposure in each liquidity category. 472

classification approach that it recommends, a security used specifically to cover a derivatives transaction
that cannot be unwound within seven days (and thus the derivative would be classified as “illiquid” under
the commenter’s recommended approach) also would be considered to be “illiquid” under that approach).

Some commenters also argued that the guidance provided in the proposal could make an
otherwise liquid but segregated asset appear to be less liquid than it actually is when considered
in isolation. 473 For example, if a cash equivalent security were used to cover a derivative that the
fund determined to be convertible to cash within 8-15 days, under the Commission’s guidance,
the cash equivalent also would be classified as an asset that could be converted to cash within
8-15 days. However, the fund would be able to replace the cash equivalent as a coverage asset
with another liquid asset at any time, which would immediately unencumber the cash equivalent
(but would encumber other liquid assets with the same value).
Finally, commenters generally discussed features of derivatives transactions informing
the way that their liquidity would be classified under proposed rule 22e-4. One commenter noted
that the proposal seemed to suggest that derivatives are inherently more risky and present greater
liquidity risk than other, more traditional assets. 474 This commenter maintained that, in some
situations, derivatives may be more liquid than more traditional assets. Another commenter
stated that, while the liquidity of a derivatives transaction depends on the derivative’s underlying
reference asset to some degree, its liquidity also largely stems from the needs of other market
participants for that kind of derivative. 475
The requirements in rule 22e-4 regarding the classification of a fund’s derivatives
transactions are meant to clarify and simplify the application of the classification requirements to
derivatives transactions and respond to commenters’ concerns. First, rule 22e-4 specifies that the
Schedule of Portfolio Investments that permits a fund to note whether an asset (or portion thereof) is
encumbered or linked to other assets as of the reporting date, without separately tying to or identifying a
“linked” asset).

liquidity classification and review requirements apply to each of the fund’s investment
transactions (including derivatives) and requires a fund to take into account relevant market,
trading, and investment-specific considerations in classifying derivatives’ liquidity. 476 In
addition, we have modified rule 22e-4 from the proposal to require a fund to classify each of the
fund’s portfolio investments. 477 We have made this change to clarify that the classification
requirement (and the other requirements of rule 22e-4) applies to all of a fund’s investment
positions, regardless of whether they are assets or liabilities, as the proposal intended. 478 The
proposed classification requirement, which would have required each fund to classify the
liquidity of its portfolio positions (or portions of a position in a particular asset), could
potentially have been read to exclude certain derivatives and other transactions that are classified
as liabilities on the fund’s balance sheet. 479 Final rule 22e-4 thus requires the liquidity of all

476

Rule 22e-4(b)(1)(ii). As with other portfolio investments, funds may classify derivatives transactions by
asset class, so long as the fund or its adviser does not have information about any market, trading, or
investment-specific considerations that are reasonably expected to significantly affect the liquidity
characteristics of a particular derivative that would require a different classification for that derivative.
Rule 22e-4(b)(1)(ii)(A).

477

We note that in the Proposing Release, we requested comment on whether the rule should “focus not just
on the liquidity of the fund’s assets but also more specifically and prominently on its liabilities, such as
derivatives obligations, that may affect the liquidity of the fund.” See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9,
at text following n.155.

478

We note that use of the term “investments” is consistent with other reporting requirements on Form
N-PORT, and reflects the proposal’s discussions of the classification requirement applying to all of a
fund’s portfolio positions, not just those that are assets. See, e.g., id., at section III.B. (“[W]e are proposing
new requirements for classifying and monitoring the liquidity of funds’ portfolio positions.”; “The
proposed liquidity categorization process would be in addition to the existing 15% guideline (which would
be retained, as discussed below) and would require a fund to assess the liquidity of its portfolio positions
individually, as well as the liquidity profile of the fund as a whole.” [emphasis added]). See also
Investment Company Reporting Modernization Adopting Release, supra footnote 120.

479

We note, however, that no commenters suggested that the proposal’s use of the terms “assets” and
“positions” interchangeably would lead to derivatives or other investments that are liabilities not being
subject to the rule, and that many commenters discussed the impact of the classification requirement on a
variety of derivatives and other transactions that could be liabilities. See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter
(discussing classifications of derivatives and TBA transactions); HSBC Comment Letter (noting that “[T]o
the extent that this is possible, Asset Managers should attempt to take all liabilities into account when
trying to calculate liquidity for a given fund.”). Nonetheless, to eliminate any potential confusion, we are
changing the term “assets” to “investments” throughout rule 22e-4, related reporting items and definitions

149

derivatives transactions to be classified, regardless of if they are classified as assets or liabilities
on a fund’s balance sheet, for the sake of operational simplicity, completeness (e.g., to help
reduce confusion regarding a fund’s liquidity profile as disclosed on Form N-PORT), and
because all derivatives transactions could implicate portfolio liquidity insofar as other assets are
segregated to cover these derivatives and derivatives in a liability position involve transactions
for which a fund would be required to pay fund assets to exit the transaction. 480
Besides specifying that the liquidity of a derivatives transaction must be classified taking
into account relevant market, trading, and investment-specific considerations, rule 22e-4
provides no derivatives-specific factors that a fund would have to evaluate in classifying a
derivatives transactions’ liquidity. We generally agree with commenters’ suggestions that the
liquidity of a derivatives transaction may depend on market demand for that kind of derivative,
as well as the liquidity of the derivative’s underlying reference asset. 481 Whether a derivatives
transaction is centrally cleared also could indicate that the transaction is more liquid than an
equivalent transaction that is not cleared. 482 In classifying and reviewing the liquidity of a
derivatives transaction, like classifying the liquidity of any portfolio investment, a fund should
consider the guidance factors discussed in this Release, to the extent the factors are applicable

on Form N-PORT and Form N-LIQUID.
480

See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(ii) (requiring funds to classify each of the portfolio investments, including each of the
fund’s derivatives transactions). We have made corresponding changes to each of the liquidity categories
to account for the classification of all portfolio investments (i.e., the liquidity categories under rule 22e-4 as
adopted are highly liquid investments, moderately liquid investments, less liquid investments, and illiquid
investments).

481

See supra footnotes 474-475 and accompanying text.

482

See, e.g., Deutsche Bank Research, Liquidity Is Key for the Central Clearing of Derivatives (Mar. 12,
2015), available at https://www.dbresearch.com/PROD/DBR_INTERNET_ENPROD/PROD0000000000352403/Liquidity_is_key_for_the_central_clearing_of_deriv.pdf; see also infra
footnote 552.

150

and the fund deems their consideration to be appropriate. 483 The provision in rule 22e-4 stating
that a fund may generally classify its portfolio investments according to their asset class applies
to the fund’s derivatives transactions, 484 as do the rule’s market depth provisions. 485 The
definitions of “highly liquid investment,” “moderately liquid investment,” and “less liquid
investment” that refer to the ability to convert an investment to cash or dispose of an investment
within a specified period, with respect to derivatives transactions that the fund classifies as
liabilities on its balance sheet, 486 should be read to refer to the time period in which the fund
reasonably expects to be able to exit a transaction.
Along with classifying the liquidity of each of its derivative transactions, final rule 22e-4
requires a fund to identify, for derivatives transactions that a fund has classified as moderately
liquid investments, less liquid investments, and illiquid investments, the percentage of the fund’s
highly liquid investments that are segregated to cover, or pledged to satisfy margin requirements
in connection with, the transactions in each of these classification categories. 487 When a fund’s
assets are segregated or pledged in connection with derivatives transactions, they are only
available for sale to meet redemptions once the related derivatives position is disposed of or
unwound (or if other assets are segregated or pledged in their place). Thus, even if the
segregated or pledged assets would, on their own, be considered extremely liquid, they would
effectively not be able to be used to meet redemption requests or to rebalance or otherwise adjust
a portfolio’s composition in order to manage liquidity risk. As discussed below, we believe that

151

it is important, for purposes of transparency regarding a fund’s portfolio liquidity, to provide
clarity that certain percentages of a fund’s investments may not be functionally available to meet
redemptions or for other liquidity risk management purposes. 488
We believe that requiring a fund to determine the percentage of highly liquid investments
that are segregated to cover, or pledged to satisfy margin requirements in connection with, its
derivatives transactions classified in each of the “moderately liquid,” “less liquid,” and “illiquid”
classification categories strikes an appropriate balance between providing this transparency and
reducing burdens on funds. Under this approach, a fund generally would not need to specifically
identify particular assets that are segregated or pledged to cover specific derivatives transactions,
but instead a fund will calculate the percentage of highly liquid investments segregated or
pledged to cover derivatives transactions that include derivatives transactions classified in each
of the other three classification categories. For purposes of calculating these percentages, a fund
that has segregated or pledged non-highly liquid investments as well as highly liquid investments
to cover derivatives transactions, should first use segregated or pledged assets that are highly
liquid investments to cover derivatives transactions classified in the three lower liquidity
classification categories. 489 This approach should promote consistency and comparability across
funds. In the absence of such an instruction, some funds might instead take the opposite
approach, and assume that segregated non-highly liquid investments first cover these less liquid
derivatives transactions, creating inconsistencies between funds.
The approach in the final rule responds to commenters’ concerns that funds rarely
488

See infra section III.C.6.

489

See note to rule 22e-4(b)(1)(ii)(C). However, if a fund has specifically identified individual assets that are
not highly liquid investments as being segregated to cover such derivatives transactions, the fund may
match those specific segregated assets to specific derivatives transactions and need not assume that
segregated highly liquid assets cover those derivatives.

152

identify and segregate a specific liquid asset against an individual derivative on a one-for-one
relationship, 490 and would reduce burdens that could result if the Commission’s liquidity
classification rules were to require a fund to do so. It also responds to commenters’ concerns
that linking the liquidity of specific segregated assets to the liquidity of a fund’s derivatives
transactions could understate the liquidity of those segregated assets, since a fund may be able to
readily substitute another liquid asset for the segregated asset. 491 However, the Commission’s
approach also would provide the basis for needed transparency for the Commission, its staff, and
the public into the way that a fund’s segregated or pledged assets may affect the fund’s overall
portfolio liquidity. Rule 22e-4, which requires a fund only to determine percentages of
segregated or pledged assets comprising the fund’s highly liquid investments, reflects our belief
that this transparency is especially important with respect to funds’ highly liquid investments.
As noted above, a fund’s disclosure of percentages of its highly liquid investments that are
segregated or pledged assets would permit the Commission and its staff to understand what
percentage of a fund’s highly liquid investment minimum is composed of encumbered assets,
and would allow the public to better understand that a certain percentage of a fund’s highly
liquid investments may not be immediately available for liquidity risk management purposes.
While a fund will not need to identify which of its particular assets are segregated in
connection with particular derivatives transactions, it will need to identify the percentage of its
highly liquid investments that are segregated or pledged with respect to derivatives transactions
classified in each of the moderately liquid, less liquid, and illiquid classification categories. We
recognize that these requirements will likely entail additional evaluation of the liquidity character
490

See supra footnote 470 and accompanying text.

491

See supra footnote 473 and accompanying paragraph. We note, however, that the ability to substitute may
not improve the overall liquidity of the portfolio.

153

of a fund’s segregated assets compared to what a fund might do today as part of its current asset
segregation procedures. 492 We believe these burdens are justified, however, by the important
transparency benefits of identifying the percentages of highly liquid investments that are
segregated or pledged assets.
We also note that these burdens are further reduced because under the rule a fund need
not identify the percentage of segregated or pledged assets covering derivatives that are highly
liquid investments, or the percentage of segregated or pledged assets that are moderately liquid
investments or less liquid investments. 493 A fund would be permitted to exclude its derivatives
transactions that are classified as highly liquid investments in determining the percentages of
highly liquid investments that are segregated or pledged assets since the fund could dispose of or
exit these derivatives transactions within three business days and the segregated or pledged
assets also would be available to the fund for liquidity risk management purposes within three
business days. Furthermore, as described in the preceding paragraph, the rule’s requirement to
identify the percentages of a fund’s highly liquid investments that are also segregated or pledged
assets reflects our belief that asset segregation or margin transparency is most important with
respect to a fund’s highly liquid investments.
4. Guidance on Liquidity Classification Factors
Unlike rule 22e-4 as proposed, final rule 22e-4 does not include an enumerated list of
factors that a fund would be specifically required to consider in classifying and reviewing the
liquidity of its portfolio investments. The rule instead generally requires a fund to take into
account “relevant market, trading, and investment-specific considerations” in classifying and
492

See infra section IV.C.1.

493

See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(ii)(C).

154

reviewing its portfolio investments’ liquidity. 494 In contrast, under the proposed rule a fund
would have been required to take the following nine factors into account, to the extent
applicable, when classifying the liquidity of each portfolio position in a particular asset:
•

Existence of an active market for the asset, including whether the asset is listed on an
exchange, as well as the number, diversity, and quality of market participants;

•

Frequency of trades or quotes for the asset and average daily trading volume of the asset
(regardless of whether the asset is a security traded on an exchange);

•

Volatility of trading prices for the asset;

•

Bid-ask spreads for the asset;

•

Whether the asset has a relatively standardized and simple structure;

•

For fixed income securities, maturity and date of issue;

•

Restrictions on trading of the asset and limitations on transfer of the asset;

•

The size of the fund’s position in the asset relative to the asset’s average daily trading
volume and, as applicable, the number of units of the asset outstanding; and

•

Relationship of the asset to another portfolio asset. 495
The Proposing Release requested comment generally on whether the Commission should

codify a list of liquidity classification factors (as discussed above) 496 and also requested
comments relating to the usefulness of the proposed factors generally, as well as specific
comments on the proposed factors. 497 With respect to the general usefulness of the proposed

155

factors, multiple commenters suggested that the proposed factors would be largely informative in
assessing assets’ relative liquidity, 498 but others advised that the proposed factors would not be
useful in assisting fund management in making liquidity determinations. 499 Some who objected
to the proposed factors argued that their usefulness would be limited by the fact that they would
be based on backward-looking data and thus may not reflect future conditions. 500 Some
commenters also argued that some of the proposed factors (e.g., frequency of trades or quotes for
an asset and average daily trading volume of an asset) are generally more appropriate for
assessing the liquidity of exchange-traded securities than securities that are traded
over-the-counter (“OTC”) and that evaluating certain OTC securities using the proposed factors
may make these securities appear to be less liquid than they actually are. 501 For example,
multiple commenters contended that certain fixed income securities tend to trade infrequently on
any given day, but these securities’ liquidity is nevertheless quite high because a fund would
generally be able to sell them fairly quickly. 502 As discussed specifically below, commenters
also expressed more granular concerns about certain of the proposed factors (specifically,
frequency of trades or quotes for an asset, trading price volatility, position size, and relationship
of an asset to another portfolio asset 503).

Letter.

503

For a discussion of commenters’ concerns about this proposed factor in the context of derivatives
transactions, see supra section III.C.3.c.

156

As discussed above, we are not codifying the proposed factors in part because we
understand that certain factors would be more informative to some funds than others, depending
on the fund’s investment strategy and liquidity risk profile. We also are concerned that codifying
the factors, particularly if applied in a “check-the-box” fashion, could lead funds to adopt
classification processes that do not reflect the extent of a fund’s ability to sell its portfolio
investments to meet redemptions within a given time period without a market impact, or do not
otherwise result in an accurate picture of a fund’s liquidity profile. 504 However, we continue to
believe that the proposed classification factors could be useful and relevant as aspects of the
general market, trading, and investment-specific considerations that a fund must take into
account under the final rule. Thus, in this section III.C.4, we discuss each of the factors that
funds could consider in evaluating portfolio investments’ liquidity characteristics and managing
liquidity risk. 505 Based on staff outreach across the fund industry, we understand that certain of

Commenters also expressed concerns about this proposed factor in the context of assets used for hedging or
risk mitigation purposes. In the Proposing Release, we stated that, when a fund purchases an asset (a
“hedging asset”) in order to hedge or mitigate the risks associated with another asset (a “hedged asset”), the
fund should consider the liquidity of the hedged asset when evaluating the liquidity of the hedging asset.
Commenters stated that current industry practice often involves hedging aggregate portfolio exposures, not
specific securities. See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter I; Milliman Comment Letter; Oppenheimer Comment
Letter; T. Rowe Comment Letter. These commenters argued that the Commission’s guidance instructing a
fund to classify the liquidity of hedging assets in consideration of the hedged asset’s liquidity classification
would therefore be unworkable and would raise costly operational burdens, because funds do not currently
link hedging assets and hedged assets on a one-for-one basis.
Unlike in the context of derivatives transactions, in which we have stated that a fund must segregate assets
to cover derivatives transactions, and this renders the segregated assets “frozen” and “unavailable for sale
or other disposition” (see supra footnote 465 and accompanying text), we have not previously stated that
purchasing assets with the intent to hedge or mitigate the risks associated with another asset makes those
hedging assets unavailable for sale. We thus do not view the linkages between hedging and hedged assets
to be directly analogous with the linkages between derivatives transactions and assets segregated to cover
those derivatives transactions, and we are not stating in this Release the guidance we included in the
Proposing Release regarding the proposed “relationship of an asset to another portfolio asset” in the context
of assets used for hedging or risk mitigation purposes.
504

Cf. supra paragraph accompanying footnote 322.

505

Our discussion of factors that could be considered by funds does not include the proposed “relationship of
[an] asset to another portfolio asset” factor because guidance on this factor, as discussed above, has been
replaced by requirements in rule 22e-4 regarding classification issues that arise with respect to derivatives

157

these factors reflect certain common considerations that funds often take into account in
evaluating their portfolio investments’ liquidity. 506 Moreover, as discussed above, multiple
commenters stated that the proposed rule included factors that, largely, are useful for assessing a
fund’s assets’ relative liquidity. 507 For example, some commenters agreed that factors such as
those incorporated in the proposal are generally relevant considerations to use when evaluating
asset liquidity and would help promote effective liquidity risk assessments, 508 and that portfolio
assets’ liquidity should be evaluated using a variety of inputs such as those that the proposed
factors represent. 509 Some suggested that the Commission discuss the factors as guidance
accompanying its adoption of rule 22e-4. 510 Overall, we believe this approach provides
flexibility that should facilitate meaningful liquidity analyses, and encourages funds to consider
relevant information.
We acknowledge, as stated by some commenters, that certain of these factors may
involve consideration of backward-looking data and thus may not account for ways in which
changing market conditions could affect the liquidity of certain asset classes or investments. 511
But we believe analyzing past data, while considering how that data may change in the future, is
an inherent aspect of all risk management and does not render such analysis fruitless. In
addition, the review requirements embedded in the classification framework, when combined
transactions. See supra footnotes 456-461 and accompanying text; see also supra footnote 503 (discussing
this proposed factor in the context of assets used for hedging or risk mitigation purposes).

with the liquidity risk assessment requirement to consider portfolio liquidity during normal and
reasonably foreseeable stressed periods, further responds to this critique. We also are cognizant
that, for certain fixed income or other OTC assets or asset classes, certain of the proposed
liquidity classification factors, if considered standing alone, may appear to make these assets or
classes to appear less liquid than they actually are. In the guidance below, we discuss special
concerns that may be relevant to funds’ consideration of the liquidity characteristics of fixed
income or other OTC assets. 512
As discussed above, a fund generally is permitted to classify the liquidity of its portfolio
investments according to their asset class. Thus, a fund may wish to consider the guidance
discussed below in assessing the general liquidity characteristics of the asset classes in which it
invests. For investments that the fund determines must be treated as an “exception” and
classified separate from their asset class, 513 the guidance provided below could assist funds in
identifying and classifying those investments that may demonstrate liquidity characteristics that
are distinct from the fund’s other portfolio holdings within that same asset class.
The guidance we provide below is not meant to cover an exhaustive list of considerations
that a fund may take into account in evaluating its portfolio investments’ liquidity. Also, we
recognize that specific liquidity concerns appropriate for consideration could vary depending on
the issuer and the particular investment. 514 Even if a fund’s liquidity classification policies and
procedures were to incorporate all of the guidance factors discussed below, a fund may decide
that it is appropriate to focus more heavily on certain factors and less on others in evaluating its

portfolio investments’ liquidity.
In the following sections, we discuss certain factors that a fund could consider in
assessing the liquidity of its portfolio investments and provide guidance on specific issues
associated with each of these factors. We also discuss comments we received on the proposed
classification factors.
a. Existence of Active Market for an Asset Class or Investment; Exchange-Traded Nature of
an Asset Class or Investment
We continue to believe that the manner in which a fund may sell an asset class (or
particular portfolio investment), including whether an asset class or investment is generally listed
on an exchange, may affect the liquidity of that asset class or investment. 515 While in general,
being listed on a developed and recognized exchange may increase an investment’s liquidity, 516
we note, as certain commenters mentioned, 517 the fact that an investment is exchange-traded does
not necessarily mean that a fund would be able to sell or convert that investment to cash within a
relatively short period. 518 For example, a small-cap equity stock might be listed on an exchange
but trade quite infrequently, which would tend to decrease its relative liquidity. Conversely, as
515

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at section III.B.2.a (discussing the proposed requirement for a
fund to consider, to the extent applicable, the existence of an active market for an asset, including whether
the asset is listed on an exchange, as well as the number, diversity, and quality of market participants, in
classifying the liquidity of each portfolio position in a particular asset).

516

See, e.g., Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Basel III: The Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Liquidity
Risk Monitoring Tools (Jan. 2013), at part 1, section II.A.1, available at
http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs238.pdf; see also Nuveen FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra footnote 85
(“While securities that trade on exchanges. . . or in deep principal/over-the–counter (“OTC”) markets (e.g.,
U.S. Treasuries) are generally liquid even in stressed markets, other securities that trade on an OTC basis. .
. have faced increasing liquidity challenges in normal markets and can be subject to insufficient quality bids
in times of stress as market makers pull back their capital. This can make it not only more difficult to sell
these securities, but also to accurately value those assets that are retained.”).

517

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter I.

518

We note that in certain cases the exchange on which an investment is listed may not be the primary market
for that security. For example, we understand that certain bonds that are exchange listed trade
predominantly in the OTC markets. See, e.g., Types of Bonds, How Big Is the Market, and Who Buys?,
available at http://www.investinginbonds.com/learnmore.asp?catid=5&subcatid=18&id=174 (“[T]he vast
majority of bond transactions, even those involving exchange-listed issues, take place in [OTC] market.”).

160

commenters discuss, we agree that certain securities that are traditionally traded in OTC markets,
such as corporate bonds, may not typically be designed to be traded frequently and instead are
more often “bought and held,” but certain of these securities nevertheless may be readily saleable
without the conversion to cash (or in some cases, sale or disposition) significantly changing their
market value. 519 Additionally, securities issued (or guaranteed as to principal and interest) by the
U.S. government do not trade on exchanges, but are typically considered to be quite liquid. 520
In assessing the effect that being traded on an exchange could have on an asset class’s or
investment’s liquidity, a fund generally should evaluate how this consideration informs the
liquidity characteristics of any ETF shares in which it invests. We understand that certain funds,
particularly funds with investment strategies involving relatively less liquid portfolio securities
(such as micro-cap equity funds, high-yield bond funds, and bank loan funds), may invest a
portion of their assets in ETFs with strategies similar to the fund’s investment strategy because
they view ETF shares as having characteristics that enhance the liquidity of the fund’s
portfolio. 521 Specifically, in discussions with Commission staff, funds that invest in ETF shares

521

See, e.g., Katy Burne, Institutions Pour Cash Into Bond ETFs, Wall Street Journal (Mar. 1, 2015), available
at http://www.wsj.com/articles/institutions-pour-cash-into-bond-etfs-1425250969. Funds’ investments in
ETFs are subject to the Investment Company Act’s limitations on investments in shares issued by other
registered investment companies. See section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Act. Currently, these practices do not
concern ETMFs.
The Commission’s 2015 Request for Comment on Exchange-Traded Products requested comment on
whether investors’ expectations of the nature of the liquidity of an exchange-traded product (including an

161

have suggested that they find that these shares are more readily tradable, are less expensive to
trade, and have shorter settlement periods than other types of portfolio investments. 522 In
addition, unlike investments in cash, cash equivalents, and other highly liquid instruments, funds
also have suggested to Commission staff that investing in ETFs with the same (or a similar)
strategy as the fund’s investment strategy permits the fund to remain fully invested in assets that
reflect the fund’s investment concentrations, risks, and performance potential. 523
While we appreciate that ETFs’ exchange-traded nature could make these instruments
useful to funds in managing purchases and redemptions under certain conditions (for example,
ETFs’ settlement times could more closely reflect the time in which a fund has disclosed that it
will typically redeem fund shares), funds should consider the extent to which relying
substantially on ETFs to manage liquidity risk is appropriate. The liquidity of an ETF,
particularly in times of declining market liquidity, is limited by the liquidity of the market for the
ETF’s underlying securities and, in fact, may be impaired based on factors not directly related to
the liquidity of the underlying securities. 524 Thus, shares of an ETF whose underlying securities

ETF) holding relatively less liquid portfolio securities differ from their expectations of the liquidity of the
underlying portfolio securities. See 2015 ETP Request for Comment, supra footnote 29, at Question 49.
Commenters expressed a range of views on the question. See, e.g., Comment Letter of Vanguard on the
2015 ETP Request for Comment (Aug. 17, 2015) (stating that the disclosures made by ETFs in
prospectuses, shareholder reports, and Web sites “ensures that investors and market participants have the
necessary information to make informed investment decisions”); Comment Letter of ETF Radar on the
2015 ETP Request for Comment (Aug. 8, 2015) (stating that investor expectations of liquidity depend on
the skill of the investor); Comment Letter of Danny Reich on the 2015 ETP Request for Comment (July 2,
2015) (stating that there is a “false assumption” that underlying assets have the same liquidity as the ETP,
particularly with respect to bond ETPs).

are relatively less liquid may not be able to be counted on to provide liquidity to a fund investing
in these shares during times of stress. In the case of a significant decline in market liquidity, if
authorized participants were unwilling or unable to trade ETF shares in the primary market, and
the majority of trading took place among investors in the secondary market, the ETF’s shares
could trade continuously at a premium or a discount to the value of the ETF’s underlying
portfolio securities. This could frustrate the expectations of secondary market participants who
count on the creation and redemption process to align the prices of ETF shares and their
underlying portfolio securities. We therefore encourage funds to assess the liquidity
characteristics of an ETF’s underlying securities, as well as the characteristics of the ETF shares
themselves, in classifying the liquidity of ETF shares under rule 22e-4(b)(1)(ii).
Other Trading Mechanism Considerations
The means of trading a particular asset class or investment can affect its liquidity
regardless of whether the investment is a security traded on an exchange. For example, whether
an asset class or investment is generally traded in a bilateral transaction with a single dealer, or
through an electronic auction mechanism where a trader can simultaneously contact multiple
counterparties, can have different effects on its liquidity. 525 The liquidity effects associated with
choice of trading mechanism may differ depending on the asset class or investment being traded
and other market conditions, and therefore it is difficult to make general statements regarding the
correlation between a particular trading mechanism and the liquidity of the asset class or

(Dec. 2, 2014), available at http://www.ici.org/viewpoints/view_14_ft_etf_liquidity (stating that most of
the trading activity in bond ETF shares is done in the secondary market and not through creations and
redemptions with authorized participants).

investment being traded. For this reason, a fund may wish to consider past experience in using
different trading mechanisms to sell a certain asset class or investment.
Diversity and Quality of Market Participants
In addition, the diversity and quality of market participants for a particular asset class or
investment also could contribute to the liquidity of that asset class or investment. A fund may
wish to consider the number of market makers on both the buying and selling sides of
transactions. A fund also may wish to consider the quality of market participants purchasing and
selling a particular asset class or investment, and may wish to assess, in particular: the market
participant’s capitalization; the reliability of the market participant’s trading platform(s); and the
market participant’s experience and reputation transacting in various types of assets. We believe
that the diversity and quality of market participants may be meaningful in assessing a portfolio
investment’s liquidity because it is common for relatively liquid asset classes and investments to
have active sale or repurchase markets at all times with diverse market participants. 526 The
presence of multiple active market makers may be a sign that a market is liquid. 527 Diversity of
market participants, on both the buying and selling sides of transactions, may also be a
significant point for a fund to consider because it tends to reduce market concentration and may
facilitate a market remaining liquid during periods of stress. 528

Paper (Dec. 2002), available at http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2002/wp02232.pdf (“Liquid

after controlling for the effects of changes in volume and volatility. The spread changes are larger in
magnitude for issues with few market makers; however, even for issues with a large number of market
makers, substantial changes in quoted spreads take place.”).

164

b. Frequency of Trades or Quotes; Average Daily Trading Volume
In general, we continue to believe that a high frequency of trades or quotes for a
particular asset class or investment tends to indicate that a particular asset class or investment has
relatively high liquidity. 529 However, as many commenters raised and as discussed below, low
trading frequency and trading volume does not necessarily indicate low liquidity, particularly for
asset classes and investments that are not exchange-traded. 530 Also, we note that the frequency of
trades or quotes for a particular asset class or investment is not a perfect or complete measure of
liquidity, and a fund may wish to also consider trade size in assessing the relationship between
trade frequency and liquidity. 531 In evaluating the frequency of trades (and bid and ask quotes)
for an asset class or investment, a fund may wish to generally consider, among other relevant
factors, the number of dealers quoting prices for that asset class or investment, the number of
other potential purchasers and sellers, and dealer undertakings to make a market in the asset class
or investment.
High average trading volume also tends to be correlated with greater liquidity,
particularly for exchange-traded asset classes and investment. In general, high average daily
trading volume for a particular asset class or investment indicates a deep market for that asset
(Aug. 2007), available at http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386418107000134 (“We
examine the link between the liquidity of a firm’s stock and its ownership structure, specifically, how much
of the firm’s stock is owned by insiders and institutions, and how concentrated is their ownership. We find
that the liquidity-ownership relation is mostly driven by institutional ownership rather than insider
ownership. Importantly, liquidity is positively related to total institutional holdings but negatively related
to institutional block holdings.”).
529

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at section III.B.2.b (discussing the proposed requirement for a
fund to consider, to the extent applicable, the frequency of trades or quotes for a particular asset, as well as
the asset’s average daily trading volume (regardless of whether the asset is a security traded on an
exchange), in classifying the liquidity of each portfolio position in a particular asset).

530

See infra footnotes 536-538 and accompanying text.

531

For example, 100 trades at $100 might or might not signify greater liquidity than 50 trades at $200,
although they are likely to suggest better liquidity than one trade at $10,000. See Erik Banks, Liquidity
Risk: Managing Funding and Asset Risk (2nd ed. 2013), at 169.

165

class or investment, which in turn indicates that a fund may be able to convert its holdings in that
asset class or investment to cash without the conversion (or in some cases, sale or disposition)
significantly changing the market value. 532 Especially for exchange-traded asset classes or
investments, a fund may wish to consider the number of days of zero or very low trading volume
during the prior month, year, or other relevant period, as this could indicate particularly limited
liquidity. As one commenter suggested, and we agree, a fund may wish to consider not only the
historical average trading volume of the asset class or assets in which its invests, but also
whether trading volume is likely to change under different or stressed market conditions. 533 High
trading volume is not always indicative of available liquidity for a particular asset class or
investment, however. For example, high trading volumes might be associated with high selling
pressure on the asset class or investment, and trades at that time may have a high value impact. 534
Also, as one commenter suggested, even if a particular asset class or investment were to exhibit
high trading volume, the ability to convert the asset class or investment to cash without the

532

See id.; see also Fidelity FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra footnote 69 (“Liquidity management is
linked to portfolio managers’ attention to market risks indicated by . . . shrinking transaction volumes
which exacerbate the impact cost for additional trading”).
We note that double-counting of trades is a potential issue to consider when assessing average trading
volume. Double-counting occurs because of differences between dealer and auction markets. In a dealer
market, trades are “double-counted” because the dealer buys from person A and then sells to person B. In
an auction market, person A and B trade directly. See, e.g., Anne M. Anderson & Edward A. Dyl, Trading
Volume: NASDAQ and the NYSE, 63 FIN. ANALYSTS J. 79 (May/June 2007), available at

consider the potential daily trading volume of its portfolio assets instead of, as proposed, the average daily
trading volume of its assets).

166

conversion (or in some cases, sale or disposition) significantly changing the market value may
also depend on other factors such as investors’ appetite for risk and the perceived “safety” of
specific securities in “risk-off” flight-to-quality market conditions. 535
Multiple commenters stressed that, particularly for fixed income and other typically OTC
asset classes and assets, relatively low trading volume does not necessarily correlate with low
liquidity. For example, many commenters discussed the low turnover of the corporate bond
market, which is driven by factors such as the buy-and-hold nature of bond investing, the
distribution of an issuer’s borrowing across many different bond issues, and the fact that
portfolio managers may deem many bonds to be substitutes for one another based on common
characteristics such as issuer, sector, credit quality, and maturity. 536 Commenters argued that,
despite the relatively low turnover that is typical in the corporate bond market, these assets are
commonly considered to be readily tradable at market-clearing prices. 537 Commenters made
similar arguments about the dynamics of the municipal bond market, noting that municipal
securities’ trading volume is not normally high, particularly during stable financial periods, but
municipal securities (especially those that are investment grade) are commonly considered to be
easily saleable. 538 We generally agree with commenters’ concerns that the consideration of
trading volume as a liquidity indicator should not by itself imply that low trading volume
necessarily indicates low liquidity. Rather, it may indicate that other information needs to be
assessed to make a liquidity determination. For asset classes and investments that typically
demonstrate low trading volume, funds may wish to consider how the other liquidity

167

characteristics of those asset classes and investments, including but not limited to other guidance
factors discussed in this Release, may affect the time period and value impact associated with the
class’s or investment’s ability to be converted to cash. Analysis of capital structure and credit
quality of a particular asset class or investment, as well as bid-ask spreads and maturity/date of
issue, may be particularly useful in considering the liquidity of investments whose trading
volume is normally low.
c. Volatility of Trading Prices
We continue to believe that trading price volatility is potentially a valuable metric to
consider in evaluating an asset class’s or investment’s liquidity. 539 In general, there is an inverse
relationship between liquidity and volatility, 540 as lack of liquidity in a particular investment
tends to amplify price volatility for that asset. 541 Additionally, the Commission understands that
certain funds and fund groups have historically experienced liquidity disruptions during periods
of extreme market volatility, such as the June 2013 “taper tantrum” 542 and the October 2014

539

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at section III.B.2.c (discussing the proposed requirement for a
fund to consider, to the extent applicable, the volatility of trading prices for its portfolio assets, in
classifying the liquidity of each portfolio asset).

volatility shocks are positively and significantly correlated across stock and bond markets).

volatility forecasts.”); see also Fidelity FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra footnote 69, at 21 (“Liquidity
management is linked to portfolio managers’ attention to market risks indicated by … increasing marketand security-specific volatility.”).

542

In May 2013, Ben Bernanke, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, announced that the Federal
Reserve may start scaling back its asset purchase program—in which the Federal Reserve purchased
approximately $85 billion worth of bonds and mortgage-backed securities each month—sooner than
investors expected. This caused interests rates on fixed income products to spike, and bond prices to fall
dramatically. This market dislocation came to be known as the “taper tantrum. See Christopher Condon &
Jeff Kearns, Fed Worried About Triggering Another ‘Taper Tantrum’, Bloomberg (Oct. 8, 2014), available

168

“flash crash.” 543 As one commenter suggested, and we agree, if a fund holds asset classes or
investments that are thinly traded, the fund may wish to consider volatility of evaluated pricing
information in assessing the liquidity of those asset classes or investments. 544
d. Bid-Ask Spreads
Bid-ask spreads—the difference between bid and offer prices for a particular
investment—have historically been viewed as a useful measure for assessing the liquidity of
assets, 545 and we continue to believe that a fund may consider this factor useful in classifying the
liquidity of a particular asset class or investment. 546 The bid-ask spread of a particular
investment is related to the riskiness of that investment, as well as the length of time that a
broker-dealer believes it will have to hold the investment before selling it. 547 In general, high
bid-ask spreads for a particular asset class or investment correlate with a lack of liquidity in that
tantrum-.

financial markets experienced an unusually high level of volatility and a very rapid round-trip in prices.

significantly strained.”).

544

See Interactive Data Comment Letter (suggesting that the Commission consider replacing the proposed
“volatility of trading prices for the asset” classification factor with “volatility of traded or evaluated pricing
information,” to make this proposed factor more applicable to fixed income assets and other asset classes

asset class or investment. For example, when liquidity was significantly constricted during the
2007–2009 financial crisis, bid-ask spreads on U.S. investment grade bonds were notably
elevated. 548 However, bid-ask spreads alone do not necessarily provide a comprehensive
understanding of an investment’s liquidity. For instance, bid-ask spreads are often constrained
by the increments in which prices are quoted. 549 Additionally, as one commenter noted, bid-ask
spreads do not take into account the volume and scale of a portfolio manager’s intended buy and
sell transactions. 550
e. Standardization and Simplicity of Asset Class’s or Investment’s Structure
We continue to believe that whether an asset class or investment has a relatively
standardized and simple structure is generally relevant to a fund’s evaluation of an asset class’s
or investment’s liquidity. 551 Investments that trade OTC with terms set at issuance such as sizes,
maturities, coupons, and payment dates may be relatively more liquid compared to similarly

if those stocks were low priced.”); Hendrik Bessembinder, Tick Size, Spreads, and Liquidity: An Analysis of

market quality is more complex than the imposition of a constraint on minimum spread widths.”).

situated investments without standardized terms. Standardization can increase liquidity by
simplifying the ability to quote and trade securities, enhancing operational efficiency to execute
and settle trades, and improving secondary market transparency. Some types of OTC-traded
securities exhibit a relatively high level of standardization, such as government and agency
bonds, futures contracts, and certain swap contracts. Central clearing of certain OTC-traded
securities, which generally requires the terms of these securities to be highly standardized, has
been associated with an increase in these investments’ liquidity, as measured by factors such as
the bid-ask spreads for these investments and the number of dealers providing quotes for these
investments. 552 However, standardization alone may not be indicative of an investment’s
liquidity. For example, corporate bond issuers commonly have large numbers of bonds
outstanding, and trading can be fragmented among that universe of bonds. 553 However, as
discussed above, we understand that market participants may consider many corporate bonds to
be highly comparable and substitutable from a liquidity perspective, to the extent that they share

using information on credit default swap clearing at ICE Trust and ICE Clear Europe,” and finding that
“the introduction of central clearing is associated with a slight increase in the liquidity of a contract” (but
noting that the effects of central clearing on liquidity must be viewed in light of the fact that the central
counterparty chooses the most liquid contracts for central clearing, consistent with liquidity characteristics
being important in determining the safety and efficiency of clearing)). But see Manmohan Singh,

increases in collateral posted for the centrally cleared trades negatively affect market liquidity given that
most large banks will be reluctant to offload their positions to central counterparties).

common characteristics such as issuer, sector, credit quality, and maturity. 554
f. Maturity and Date of Issue of Fixed Income Securities
We continue to believe that, with respect to the fixed income investments a fund holds in
its portfolio, those investments’ maturity, as well as their date of issue, are significant indicators
of their liquidity. 555 In general, a fixed income asset trades most frequently in the time directly
following issuance, and its trading volume decreases in the asset’s remaining time to maturity. 556
Thus “on-the-run” securities (that is, bonds or notes of a particular maturity that were most
recently issued) tend to trade significantly more frequently than their “off-the-run” counterparts
(that is, bonds or notes issued before the most recently issued bond or note of a particular
maturity). 557 Because high trading volume generally suggests relatively high liquidity, 558 a fixed
income asset’s date of issuance and maturity, which in turn are generally correlated with the
trading volume of a fixed income asset, together are important liquidity indicators. We

555

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at section III.B.2.f (discussing the proposed requirement for a
fund to consider, with respect to fixed income assets, these assets’ maturity and date of issue when
assessing their liquidity).

http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=163139.

557

The on-the-run phenomenon refers to the fact that, in fixed income markets, securities with nearly identical
cash flows trade at different yields and with different liquidity. In particular, most recently issued (i.e.,
on-the-run) government bonds of a certain maturity are generally more liquid than previously issued (i.e.,
off-the-run or old) bonds maturing on similar dates. See, e.g., Paolo Pasquariello & Clara Vega, The onthe-run liquidity phenomenon, 92 J. OF FIN. ECON. 1-24 (Apr. 2009), available at

and off-the-run U.S. Treasury bonds and finding, among other things, that on-the-run and off-the-run
liquidity differentials are economically and statistically significant—showing that on-the-run bonds tend to
be more liquid than their off-the-run counterparts—even after controlling for certain intrinsic
characteristics of the bonds); Michael Barclay, Terrence Hendershott & Kenneth Kotz, Automation versus

understand, based on staff outreach and industry knowledge, that remaining time to maturity is a
key factor that fixed income funds commonly consider in assessing the liquidity of their portfolio
positions.
g. Restrictions on Trading; Limitations on Transfer
We continue to believe that restrictions on trading certain investments, as well as
limitations on an investment’s transfer, may adversely affect those investments’ liquidity. 559 For
example, although we are replacing existing Commission guidance on identifying illiquid assets
(including the specific factors listed in the Rule 144A Release regarding the liquidity of a rule
144A security) 560 with new regulatory requirements regarding the process for determining that
certain investments are illiquid, we believe that the restricted nature of a rule 144A security is
one factor that generally should be considered by a fund in evaluating the liquidity of a rule
144A security. 561 Regardless of whether a portfolio investment is a restricted security, it may
nevertheless be subject to other limitations on transfer. For example, for securities that are
traded in certain foreign markets, government approval may be required for the repatriation of
investment income, capital, or the proceeds of sales of securities by foreign investors. 562

fund to consider restrictions on trading and limitations on transfer in classifying the liquidity of each
portfolio asset).

561

See id. While we are withdrawing the guidance in the Rule 144A Release, including the guidance that
boards are responsible for determining if a security is liquid or illiquid, we note that the guidance factors
discussed in the Rule 144A Release are consistent with certain of the guidance factors discussed in this
Release.

footnote 520, at section II.B.3.iv (discouraging banking entities from holding a disproportionate amount of
their eligible highly qualified liquid assets in locations outside the United States where unforeseen
impediments may prevent timely repatriation of such assets during a liquidity crisis).

173

Portfolio investments furthermore may be subject to certain contractual limitations on transfer. 563
Securities subject to transfer limitations in general are less liquid than securities without such
limitations.
5. Liquidity Classification Review Requirement
Under rule 22e-4 as adopted today, a fund would be required to review its portfolio
investments’ classifications at least monthly in connection with reporting the liquidity
classification for each portfolio investment on Form N-PORT, as well as more frequently if
changes in relevant market, trading, and investment-specific considerations are reasonably
expected to materially affect one or more of its investments’ classifications. 564 A fund generally
could classify and review the liquidity classifications of its portfolio investments according to
their asset class; however, the fund must separately classify and review any investment within an
asset class if the fund or its adviser, after reasonable inquiry, has information about any market,
trading, or investment-specific considerations that are reasonably expected to significantly affect
the liquidity characteristics of that investment as compared to other securities within that asset
class. 565

transactions that require consents from borrowers or key syndicate members, and loan documents are still
negotiated written documents that require human review. As a result. . .the mechanics of loan trades and
certain trade settlement times cause funds to carefully monitor liquidity considerations surrounding loan
investments . . . . [In making such determinations, funds] typically consider factors common to general
liquidity determinations, as well as factors specific to the loan markets, which can include: (i) the legal
limitations on the transferability or sale of a loan including the requirement to obtain consents from
borrowers or syndicate agents and members prior to assignment; (ii) the existence of a trading market for
the loans and the estimated depth of the market; (iii) the frequency of trades or quotes for the loan; (iv) the
estimated length of the settlement period; and (v) the borrower’s health.”).

As discussed in the Proposing Release, the Commission has previously stated that it
“expects funds to monitor portfolio liquidity on an ongoing basis to determine whether, in light
of current circumstances, an adequate level of liquidity is being maintained.” 566 Some have
interpreted this statement to mean that the Commission does not intend for a fund to reassess the
liquidity status of individual securities on an ongoing basis, but instead to monitor whether a
fund portfolio’s overall liquidity profile is appropriate in light of its redemption obligations. 567
While we agree that a fund should monitor the liquidity of its portfolio holistically, we note that
the decreased liquidity of individual portfolio components can directly affect the ability of a fund
to meet its redemption obligations without significant dilution of remaining investors’ interests in
the fund. 568 We thus believe that specifically requiring a fund to review the classifications of its
portfolio investments made under rule 22e-4 would reduce the risk that a fund would be unable
to meet its redemption obligations without significant investor dilution.
As proposed, rule 22e-4 would have required a fund to review its liquidity classifications
on an ongoing basis. 569 Also, like the proposed classification requirement, the proposed review
requirement would have required a fund to take into account a list of specified factors, as the
fund determines applicable, in reviewing its portfolio assets’ liquidity. 570 In the Proposing
Release, we stated that a fund may wish to determine the frequency of ongoing review of

portfolio positions’ liquidity classifications based in part on the liquidity of its portfolio holdings,
as well as the timing of its portfolio acquisitions and turnover. 571 In addition, we noted in the
Proposing Release that, at a minimum, a fund would review its liquidity classifications at least
monthly in order to accurately report this information on proposed Form N-PORT. 572 Proposed
rule 22e-4 did not include provisions that would permit a fund to review its portfolio assets’
liquidity on an asset-class basis.
We sought comment in the Proposing Release about the proposed ongoing review
requirement. Several commenters suggested that the Commission adopt a general liquidity
classification review requirement, without incorporating specific factors that a fund would be
required to consider during the course of its review. 573 One commenter argued that the frequency
of the proposed review requirement was unclear and recommended that the Commission adopt
more specific standards associated with review frequency. 574 Multiple commenters expressed
concerns about the potential burden associated with an “ongoing” review requirement 575 and
suggested that these concerns could be mitigated by replacing the proposed requirement to
classify the liquidity of each portfolio position with a “top-down” requirement permitting funds
to classify their portfolio assets’ liquidity on an asset-class basis. 576
We believe that the review requirement we are adopting, together with the rule provision
specifying that a fund would generally be permitted to review its liquidity classifications with

reference to its holdings’ asset classes, advances our goal of requiring funds to appropriately reevaluate the liquidity of their portfolio holdings, while responding to commenters’ concerns. As
discussed in the Proposing Release, we understand that some funds currently may not review the
liquidity of their portfolio investments on a continuing basis after they are acquired. 577 In
particular, we understand that certain funds may initially determine that certain investments are
liquid or illiquid but will not regularly re-evaluate these initial classifications, even in light of
changing market conditions. We understand that some funds, on the other hand, currently
reassess the liquidity of their portfolio investment regularly based on market-wide developments,
as well as events affecting particular securities or asset classes. 578
Rule 22e-4 as adopted requires a fund to review its liquidity classifications at least
monthly, in connection with reporting its liquidity classifications monthly on Form N-PORT. 579
This requirement responds to the recommendation that the Commission adopt more specific
standards associated with review frequency. Moreover, in order to determine whether its
holdings are consistent with the fund’s highly liquid investment minimum, as well as the rule
22e-4 limitation on illiquid investments, a fund would have to determine whether its initial
classification determinations have changed based on market conditions or other developments.
Therefore, rule 22e-4 also includes the requirement for a fund to review its liquidity
classifications more frequently than monthly if changes in relevant market, trading, and
investment-specific considerations are reasonably expected to materially affect one or more of its

177

investment classifications. 580 For example, relevant market-wide developments could include
changes in interest rates or other macroeconomic events, market-wide volatility, market-wide
flow changes, dealer inventory or capacity changes, and extraordinary events such as natural
disasters or political upheaval. 581 Asset-class and investment-specific developments that a fund
may wish to consider include, among others, regulatory changes affecting certain asset classes
and corporate events (such as bankruptcy, default, pending restructuring, or delisting, as well as
reputational events). We believe that the rule’s requirement that a fund review its liquidity
classifications at least monthly, as well as more frequently in light of market-related and other
changes that could materially affect a fund’s investment classifications, will provide funds with
more direction as to the frequency of their classification reviews, as well as circumstances that
could lead to a classification review, than the proposed ongoing review requirement.
We believe that the review requirement we are adopting, as opposed to the proposed
ongoing review requirement, permits funds to tailor their review of liquidity classifications in
light of the liquidity character of a fund’s portfolio investments. The modifications to rule 22e-4
clarify that we do not expect a fund to constantly reassess all of its portfolio investments’
liquidity. Also, the review requirement that we are adopting would not require a fund to consider
a detailed list of specific factors in the course of conducting its liquidity classification reviews.
Instead, as discussed above, it would require a fund to take into account “relevant market,
trading, and investment-specific considerations” in reviewing its investments’ liquidity. 582
Finally, the review requirement that we are adopting, like the rule 22e-4 classification

580

581

See, e.g., 2014 Fixed Income Guidance Update, supra footnote 94.

582

See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(ii).

178

requirement, would permit a fund to generally review its portfolio investments’ liquidity
according to their asset class (provided that the fund must identify, and separately review, any
investment within an asset class that the fund determines should be reviewed separately based on
its liquidity characteristics). 583 We believe that this approach will permit funds to increase their
efficiency in classifying and reviewing portfolio investments’ liquidity.
6. Liquidity Classification Reporting and Disclosure Requirements
In connection with the liquidity classification requirement of rule 22e-4, we are requiring,
largely as proposed and with certain modifications in response to comments, a fund to report the
liquidity classification assigned to each of the fund’s portfolio investments on Form N-PORT. 584
Position-level liquidity classification information will be reported to the Commission in a
structured data format on a confidential basis rather than released every three months to the
public. 585 Under the final rules, a fund will also be required to publicly report on Form N-PORT
the aggregated percentage of its portfolio investments that falls into each of the four liquidity
classification categories outlined above. 586 This aggregate information will be disclosed to the
public only for the third month of each fiscal quarter with a 60-day delay. While we
acknowledge that liquidity classification determinations may be to some extent subjective and
583

See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(ii)(A).

584

Rather than report the liquidity classification among six categories as under the proposal, funds will be
required to report liquidity classifications among four liquidity categories, which may be based on asset
type to the extent discussed above. See Item C.7. of Form N-PORT. We have modified the numbering
convention for items within Form N-PORT from the proposal to be consistent with Form N-PORT as
adopted in the Investment Company Reporting Modernization Adopting Release.

585

See General Instruction F of Form N-PORT.

586

Item B.8.a. of Form N-PORT. We note that such reporting is designed to serve as a snapshot of a fund’s
liquidity on the last business or calendar day of the month. See rule 30b1-9 under the Investment Company
Act (requiring reporting on Form N-PORT to be current as of the last business day, or last calendar day, of
the month). Accordingly, the aggregate percentage of portfolio investments in each of the four liquidity
classification categories need not reflect pending transactions, but instead should reflect the balance of
investments in each category on the last business or calendar day of the month.

179

that such information reported on Form N-PORT may be non-standardized, we believe that, on
balance, our staff, investors, and other potential users would benefit from the information that
will be reported on Form N-PORT that currently may not be reported or disclosed by funds. We
believe that this greater transparency about liquidity at the fund-level will provide our staff,
investors, and other potential users with a helpful picture of the general liquidity characteristics
of funds and help them better understand the liquidity risks associated with a particular fund.
We also believe that this information will help investors make more informed investment
decisions.
As part of this public disclosure, a fund would publicly disclose the percentages of its
highly liquid investments that are segregated to cover, or pledged to satisfy margin requirements
in connection with, the fund’s derivatives transactions that the fund has classified in the
moderately liquid, less liquid, and illiquid investments classification categories in light of the
requirement in rule 22e-4 that the liquidity classification cover each of the fund’s derivatives
transactions, discussed above. 587 This derivatives transactions information will also be made
public for the third month of each fiscal quarter with a 60-day delay.
Most commenters opposed the proposed Form N-PORT reporting requirement, and
particularly objected to having position-level liquidity information reported on Form N-PORT
made public. 588 We believe that the additions to Form N-PORT adopted today in this Release
address many of these concerns. We discuss these additions, the comments we received on the
proposal, as well as modifications we made to the proposal in response to comments, in more

587

Item B.8.b. of Form N-PORT. This derivatives transactions reporting requirement corresponds to the
modification in rule 22e-4(b)(1)(ii)(C), discussed above.

detail below.
a. Reporting Liquidity Classification of Portfolio Investments
We proposed to require a fund to report on Form N-PORT the liquidity classification of
each of the fund’s positions (or portions of a position) in a portfolio asset using the proposed
classification system of rule 22e-4. 589 As discussed above, most commenters opposed the
proposed classification regime, and many offered varied classification alternatives for fund
liquidity risk management and reporting purposes. As discussed previously, we are today
adopting a liquidity classification requirement under rule 22e-4 based on a “days-to-cash”
framework as proposed, but with a number of modifications informed by commenter
recommendations that we believe address many commenters’ concerns about the classification
process itself.
A number of commenters supported reporting liquidity classifications to the Commission
on Form N-PORT, provided that it was not publicly disclosed. 590 For example, one commenter
expressed support for reporting position-level liquidity classifications to the Commission, noting
that the Commission should have the data it needs to monitor fund holdings and liquidity
determinations, examine potential outliers, and, if an unexpected market event occurs (e.g., the
default of a significant institution), quickly assess the potential impact on mutual funds it
supervises. 591 Another commenter expressed the belief that the proposed liquidity classifications

589

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at section III.G.2.a.

590

See, e.g., Dechert Comment Letter; Interactive Data Comment Letter; J.P. Morgan Comment Letter;
Nuveen Comment Letter. Some commenters suggested that the Commission evaluate reported
classification data for a period of time to determine whether the information is appropriate for public
disclosure. See BlackRock Comment Letter; Fidelity Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter III.

591

See J.P. Morgan Comment Letter.

181

data could be appropriate for Commission oversight purposes. 592
On the other hand, a few commenters objected to reporting liquidity classifications, as
proposed, even if such information is disclosed only to the Commission. 593 Some commenters
stated that there is limited utility in the proposed classification information for the Commission
since the information would be subjective and methodology-specific, which would lead to results
that would preclude comparisons across funds, limiting the utility of this information for the
Commission’s monitoring of industry-wide data. 594 In addition, one commenter expressed
concerns about the security of sensitive information filed with the Commission due to recent
high-profile cybersecurity breaches both in the governmental and private sectors. 595
We continue to believe that requiring funds to report the liquidity classification of their
portfolio investments is vital to our ongoing monitoring and oversight efforts. A key goal of the
rulemaking is to allow us to monitor funds’ liquidity profiles (both on a fund-by-fund basis and
across funds) over time, and respond as appropriate. Absent the required reporting on Form
N-PORT, our ability to engage in such efforts would be limited and less efficient. We believe
that the changes made to the classification system discussed above should serve to mitigate
commenters’ concerns about the difficulties of making comparisons across the industry, in light
of the reduced number of categories for classification. We recognize that there is still likely to
be variation between funds in how they classify certain asset classes and investments, and
believe that despite any variations, this liquidity information will be useful and valuable to us.

182

We will be able to identify different fund liquidity classification practices, and use that
information to gain insight into how different funds view liquidity in the market, and whether
there are any identifiable liquidity concerns. We also note that despite any concerns about
variation of practices across funds limiting comparability, we expect that the reported
information will allow us to generally monitor specific funds’ liquidity on a consistent basis
across time, and identify how their views of the liquidity of their investments change.
We believe that such information will assist us in better assessing liquidity risk in the
open-end fund industry, which can inform our policy and guidance. We also believe that this
information will assist us in monitoring for compliance with rule 22e-4 and identifying potential
outliers in fund liquidity classifications for further inquiry, as appropriate. We recognize that
liquidity classifications, similar to valuation- and pricing-related matters, inherently involve
judgment and estimations by funds. We also understand that the liquidity classification of an
asset class or investments may vary across funds depending on the facts and circumstances
relating to the funds and their trading practices. 596 We do not believe that data based on
estimations of market conditions on a fund-by-fund basis is uninformative or of limited utility
because of the information’s sometimes fund-specific, subjective nature. 597 Rather, we believe
that even with potential variances in determinations, the liquidity information reported will be
informative to the Commission. Furthermore, we believe that members of the fund industry are
generally in the best position to provide current information on the conditions of fund liquidity
596

See, e.g., Comment Letter of the Investment Company Institute on Investment Company Reporting
Modernization Release (Aug. 11, 2015) (“These [liquidity] judgments may differ among personnel and
certainly among fund complexes.”); Comment Letter of Invesco Advisers, Inc. on Investment Company
Reporting Modernization Release (Aug. 11, 2015) (“Invesco and other fund complexes could reasonably
differ in their assessments of the liquidity of a particular security, even though both complexes have a
sound method for determining liquidity and follow their own reasonable procedures.”).

597

See supra footnote 594 and accompanying text.

183

since they are in the markets every day trading securities and observe how markets are evolving
and related liquidity characteristics are changing.
In sum, we believe that the modified reporting requirements on Form N-PORT will
provide the Commission with meaningful data concerning the liquidity of portfolio investments
across the fund industry and at the same time lessen burdens on funds classifying and reporting
liquidity information (compared to the proposal). Accordingly, we are adopting the requirement
for funds to report the liquidity classification of their portfolio investments to the Commission.
b. Non-Public Disclosure of Liquidity Classification Information Reported on Form NPORT
We proposed that liquidity classification information reported on Form N-PORT at the
portfolio position level be disclosed to the public for the third month of each fiscal quarter with a
60-day delay. One commenter expressed general support for regulatory initiatives aimed at
improving transparency. 598 Several commenters expressed support for public disclosure of
liquidity information if the framework for classification was modified from the proposed sixcategory liquidity classification framework to alternative frameworks proposed by commenters
that generally measured the liquidity of portfolio positions based on asset type and included less
classification categories. 599
On the other hand, most commenters opposed the proposed public disclosure of the
liquidity classification. Some commenters expressed concerns that the value to the public of the
position-level liquidity classification information on Form N-PORT, as proposed, would be

598

See Interactive Data Comment Letter.

599

See, e.g., Charles Schwab Comment Letter; FSR Comment Letter; Nuveen Comment Letter; Vanguard
Comment Letter.

184

limited. 600 Many other commenters expressed concerns that the public disclosure of the positionlevel liquidity classification information could be potentially misleading to investors for various
reasons. For example, many commenters contended that, while the position-by-position
information reported would be subjective, the numeric days-to-settlement presentation proposed
on Form N-PORT could imply a false sense of precision of the data to fund investors. 601 Many
of these commenters also argued that providing subjective, position-level liquidity classification
information to the public could potentially result in misleading comparisons across funds, 602 with
some commenters noting that such comparisons could disadvantage certain funds over others. 603
While reports on Form N-PORT would be submitted to the Commission within 30 days after
month end, some commenters voiced concerns that the liquidity data presented on Form NPORT would be stale for the public given that the reports, as proposed, would be available every
third month of a fund’s fiscal quarter with a 60-day delay, adding to the risk of misleading
investors about the real-time state of a portfolio’s liquidity. 604
Many commenters also expressed concerns that public disclosure of the proposed
position-level liquidity classification information would ultimately harm fund shareholders and
600

See, e.g., Better Markets Comment Letter (expressing concerns that the proposal’s three-day liquid asset
minimum and 15% standard assets are determined by the fund and that the liquidity classifications reported
on Form N-PORT would be stale information for the public); Morningstar Comment Letter (also stating
concerns that the information available to the public under the proposal would be stale and expressing the
belief that investors could find it difficult to compare the liquidity characteristics of portfolios from
different funds).

the fund market for a variety of reasons. Some commenters argued that public reporting would
facilitate predatory trading practices, particularly during periods of liquidity stress, ultimately
harming fund investors. 605 Commenters expressed the belief that public reporting of liquidity
classifications at the position-level exacerbates these concerns, noting, for example, that in the
event a fund experiences a liquidity issue, public information about its portfolio-level liquidity
classifications may expose the fund to predatory trading. 606 In addition, several commenters
expressed concern that public reporting of position-level liquidity classifications could be
harmful to the fund market, arguing that such reporting would incentivize homogenized liquidity
determinations and comparative liquidity “ratings” from third-party service providers, 607 as well
as “window dressing” at period ends prior to disclosure, increasing the potential for systemic
risks in the fund industry. 608 Other commenters suggested that the Commission evaluate
reported classification data for a period of time to determine whether the information is
appropriate for public disclosure. 609
While many of these commenters objected to the proposed position-level public
disclosure of liquidity classifications, several commenters did not object to making more
aggregated portfolio-level disclosure of liquidity data available to the public. 610 These

Avenue’s troubles as other market participants knew of the holdings of the Focused Credit Fund and used

commenters suggested that, while position-level liquidity data may pose concerns as discussed
above, providing the public a portfolio-level “roll up” of the liquidity levels of the fund may
provide useful data and would be unlikely to raise the same kind of issues. 611
We recognize that the level of position-level detail necessary for the Commission and our
staff to effectively monitor fund liquidity may not be necessary for other users. We understand
that some data collectors would prefer to use information reported on Form N-PORT proposed
under the Investment Company Reporting Modernization proposal (which we are adopting
concurrently), such as monthly portfolio holdings data, rather than the classification information
proposed in the liquidity proposal. 612 Furthermore, we understand that for many investors, the
proposed specific position-level liquidity data would be likely unnecessarily detailed, and that
aggregated or “rolled up” portfolio-level information about fund liquidity may be more easily
understandable and usable. As discussed below, such aggregated information will likely result in
more user friendly and digestible portrayals of fund liquidity, and at the same time we expect
will avoid many of the potential harms suggested by commenters that might result from positionlevel disclosure to the public. Such a layered reporting and disclosure regime should allow the
Commission and investors each to access the liquidity information likely most useful for their
purposes.
We also appreciate the limitations and subjectivity of the liquidity classification process,
and thus understand the risks of investors potentially giving too much weight to a fund
manager’s individual liquidity classification choices. The classification of portfolio investments
at the position-level under the days-to-cash framework involves a number of assumptions and
611

See, e.g., Nuveen Comment Letter; T. Rowe Comment Letter.

612

See Morningstar Comment Letter.

187

methodologies that could result in classifications that vary from fund to fund. As a result, the
liquidity classification information reported for the same or similar asset classes and investments
could vary because of complex differences in methodologies and assumptions that may not be
reported on Form N-PORT nor easily explained to investors but would be available to the
Commission in inspections. 613
We appreciate the concerns raised by commenters that reporting publicly position-level
data could imply a false sense of precision about the liquidity profile of a fund and that, given the
delay in the public reporting of portfolio-level classification information (60 days after quarterend), the position-level information will likely be out of date when reviewed by investors. While
we can take these potential variances in liquidity classifications of assets into account in
evaluating and using the data for the Commission’s purposes in observing potential trends in
liquidity profiles across the fund industry, it may be more difficult to explain them to investors.
Furthermore, the Commission would receive portfolio-level classification information within 30
days of month-end, thereby increasing the utility of the classification information for
Commission purposes. We expect that providing only aggregated liquidity classification
information on the funds’ portfolio assets publicly may mitigate some of these concerns. This
level of detail should appropriately focus investors on the fund’s general liquidity profile and
general trends in fund liquidity rather than individual security-level liquidity decisions, in light of
the concerns discussed above.
Some commenters also raised concerns that public reporting of liquidity classifications at
the position level could potentially expose investors to harm, including, for example, potentially

A fund has the option of providing explanatory notes related to its filing to explain any of its
methodologies, including related assumptions, in Part E of Form N-PORT. See Instruction G to Form NPORT.

188

exposing a fund to predatory trading, particularly during periods of liquidity stress. 614 We
believe, however, that the aggregated public disclosure on Form N-PORT once each quarter with
a 60-day lag would alleviate these predatory trading concerns given that those engaged in
predatory trading would not have information about a fund’s own assessment of its liquidity
characteristics in real-time and would not have the detailed position-level information in real
time necessary to pursue such strategies.
For these reasons, we find that it is neither necessary nor appropriate in the public interest
or for the protection of investors to make liquidity classification information for each portfolio
investment publicly available. 615 We also are adopting amendments to Form N-PORT to require
a fund to publicly disclose the aggregated percentage of its portfolio assets representing each of
the four classification categories outlined in Form N-PORT and related rule 22e-4, 616 as
discussed in more detail below. We believe that providing liquidity classification data
attributable to each portfolio investment to the Commission and fund-level data to investors is an
efficient approach to present liquidity information in a manner that both satisfies the
Commission’s need for position-level liquidity data for its regulatory oversight purposes and
provides useful fund liquidity information to investors.
In addition, the Commission recognizes the importance of sound data security practices
and protocols for non-public information, including information that may be competitively
sensitive. The Commission has substantial experience with storage and use of non-public
614

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter; Cohen and Steers Comment Letter; Dechert Comment Letter; Nuveen

forms to be made available to the public, unless we find that public disclosure is neither necessary nor

N-PORT.

information reported on Form PF and delayed public disclosure of information on Form N-MFP
(although the Commission no longer delays public disclosure of reports on Form N-MFP), as
well as other non-public information that the Commission handles in its ordinary course of
business. Commission staff is carefully evaluating the data security protocols that will apply to
non-public data reported on Form N-PORT in light of the specific recommendations and
concerns raised by commenters. Drawing on its experience, the staff is working to design
controls and systems for the use and handling of Form N-PORT data in a manner that reflects the
sensitivity of the data and is consistent with the maintenance of its confidentiality. 617 In advance
of the compliance date, we expect that the staff will have reviewed the controls and systems in
place for the use and handling of non-public information reported on Form N-PORT.
c. Public Fund-Level Aggregate Liquidity Profile Reporting
As previously discussed, we are adopting, with modifications, the proposed requirement
that funds report to the Commission on a non-public basis the liquidity classification assigned to
each portfolio position on Form N-PORT. Some commenters expressed concerns that the value
to the public of the position-level liquidity classification information on Form N-PORT, as
proposed, would be limited. 618 Other commenters recommended that, as an alternative to the
proposal, the Commission make available to the public a general assessment of the liquidity of
the portfolio at the fund level, rather than the individual security level, 619 with more detailed
617

See Reporting by Investment Advisers to Private Funds and Certain Commodity Pool Operators and
Commodity Trading Advisors on Form PF, Investment Advisers Act Release No. 3308 (Oct. 31, 2011) [76
FR 71228 (Nov. 16, 2011)]. We recognize that there are differences between the N-PORT reporting
requirements and the Form PF reporting requirements, such as frequency, granularity, and registration
status, and our recognition of these differences guides our evaluation of appropriate measures for
preservation of data security for reported information.

information, including the fund’s assessment of the liquidity of each asset at the individual
security level, provided to the Commission but kept confidential. 620
We appreciate these comments and recognize that position-level liquidity classification
data, while valuable for Commission purposes, may be of limited use for everyday investors.
We find persuasive commenters’ recommendations to provide the public with a general
assessment of the liquidity of a portfolio at the fund level as an approach to provide everyday
investors useful information on fund liquidity. As a result, we are adopting amendments to Form
N-PORT to require a fund to publicly report for the third month of each fiscal quarter with a 60day delay the aggregate percentage of its portfolio representing each of the four classification
categories outlined in Form N-PORT and related rule 22e-4. 621 For purposes of this reporting
item, a fund would report the aggregate percentage of investments that are assets in each
liquidity category compared to total portfolio investments that are assets (not including
liabilities) of the fund. 622
In order to avoid misleading investors about the actual availability of highly liquid
investments to meet redemptions, a fund also will be required to publicly report on Form NPORT the percentage of its highly liquid investments that it has segregated to cover, or pledged
to satisfy margin requirements in connection with, derivatives transactions that are classified as
moderately liquid, less liquid, or illiquid investments. 623 As discussed above, we proposed to
require a fund to consider the relationship of an asset to another portfolio asset in classifying the
liquidity of its portfolio assets reported on Form N-PORT and to consider guidance that a fund

191

should classify the liquidity of assets segregated to cover derivatives obligations using the
liquidity of the derivative instruments such assets are covering. 624 One commenter suggested that
the Commission add an item to the Schedule of Portfolio Investments on Form N-PORT that
permits a fund to note whether an asset (or portion thereof) is encumbered or linked to other
assets as of the reporting date. 625 Another commenter suggested that the Commission require
funds to assign liquidity classifications to cover assets on an aggregate portfolio basis in amounts
corresponding to the aggregate amount of derivatives exposure in each liquidity category. 626
In consideration of the commenters’ recommendations, we believe that our modification
to the proposal to require a fund to report publicly the percentage of the fund’s highly liquid
investments that are segregated to cover, or pledged to satisfy margin requirements in connection
with, the fund’s derivatives transactions that are classified in each liquidity category strikes an
appropriate balance between providing investors with useful information about the impact of
derivatives coverage obligations on the percentage of a fund’s highly liquid investments and
lessening operational burdens associated with classifying investments. Since the public will only
receive asset liquidity classification information on an aggregate level and only the Commission
will receive liquidity classifications on an investment-by-investment basis, we believe that the
suggested alternative to add an item to the Schedule of Portfolio Investments on Form N-PORT
linking an asset encumbered to other assets in connection with derivatives transactions would not
be a helpful means to inform investors about the connection between derivatives obligations and
the availability of highly liquid investments to meet redemptions. We believe that without public

See Dechert Comment Letter; see also supra section III.C.3.c.

192

reporting of the percentage of a fund’s highly liquid investments that are segregated to cover, or
pledged to satisfy margin requirements in connection with, a fund’s derivatives transactions that
are not themselves highly liquid investments, the reported percentage of a fund’s highly liquid
investments could be potentially misleading to investors if a portion of highly liquid investments
are not available to meet redemptions due to derivatives transactions obligations.
Overall, we continue to believe that investors currently have limited information about
the liquidity of fund investments and would benefit from enhanced information to evaluate funds
and assess the potential for returns and risks of a particular fund. We expect that many investors
will use liquidity reporting information to better understand the liquidity risks associated with a
particular fund for purposes of making more informed investment decisions and will benefit
from aggregate information about a fund’s overall liquidity. Moreover, we believe that requiring
a fund to publicly disclose only the aggregate percentage of its portfolio assets representing each
of the four classification categories balances commenters’ concerns about certain adverse effects
that could arise from public reporting of detailed portfolio liquidity information with investors’
need for improved information about funds’ liquidity risk profiles.
d. Illiquid Investments
As discussed above, rule 22e-4, as adopted, combines a fund’s illiquid investment
determinations with the general liquidity classification framework reported on Form N-PORT. 627
In the Proposing Release, in connection with the codification of the 15% guideline that an openend fund may not invest in the aggregate more than 15% of its net assets in “illiquid securities,”
we proposed to require funds to report on Form N-PORT whether each portfolio asset is a “15%

627

See supra section III.C.2.d.

193

standard asset,” as defined under the proposal, 628 in addition to reporting the liquidity of each of
the fund’s positions (or portions of a position) in a portfolio asset using six proposed
categories. 629 One commenter opposed requiring reporting of the 15% standard asset at the
individual portfolio asset level, raising concerns that public disclosure could have adverse effects
on funds. 630 Another commenter opposed reporting of the 15% standard asset at the individual
portfolio asset level if publicly disclosed in addition to the proposed six liquidity classification
categories, stating that the distinction between the two pieces of data would make sense to
industry experts but would be confusing and potentially misleading to typical investors. 631
After considering these comments, we agree that presenting to the public liquidity
classification information and the 15% standard asset designation separately could potentially
confuse investors. As discussed in more detail in section III.C previously, we believe that it is
more appropriate to harmonize the rule 22e-4 limit on illiquid investments, referred to as 15%
standard assets under the proposal, with the rule’s broader liquidity classification requirement by
incorporating an illiquid investment category into the classification requirement. Likewise, we
believe that this harmonization should be reflected in reports on Form N-PORT. Thus, we are
adopting, modified from the proposal, an illiquid investment category into Form N-PORT that
corresponds with rule 22e-4’s broader classification requirement. 632 By doing this, a fund’s
exposure to illiquid investments may be viewed as part of the fund’s overall liquidity profile in a
more clear and concise manner. Furthermore, we are persuaded by some of the concerns raised

by commenters regarding the unintended adverse effects that public disclosure of illiquid
investment information on the portfolio position level could have on funds and fund investors.
As adopted, liquidity classification information reported on the portfolio position level will be
non-public on Form N-PORT, as discussed in more detail above.
We expect to use this information to monitor fund compliance with the prohibition of
acquiring illiquid investments if the fund would have invested more than 15% of its net assets in
illiquid investments that are assets and analyze liquidity trends in the fund industry. Overall, we
believe that maintaining this information on illiquid investments as part of the liquidity
classification information reported on Form N-PORT will provide the Commission with
meaningful data, including information regarding exposure to illiquid investments across the
fund industry.
D.

Highly Liquid Investment Minimum
Today we are adopting a requirement that each fund determine its “highly liquid

investment minimum,” or the minimum amount of the fund’s net assets that the fund invests in
highly liquid investments that are assets. 633 In determining its highly liquid investment
minimum, a fund will be required to consider the factors the fund also has to consider, as
applicable, in assessing its liquidity risk under rule 22e-4. 634 Additionally, in determining
whether a fund is meeting its highly liquid investment minimum, the fund will look only to its

633

Rule 22e-4(a)(7). Rule 22e-4(a)(7) refers to highly liquid investments that are “assets” to make clear that
when evaluating whether a fund is meeting its highly liquid investment minimum, the fund should look to
its investments with positive values. Highly liquid investments that have negative values should not be
netted against highly liquid investments that have positive values when calculating whether the fund is
meeting its highly liquid investment minimum. Thus, only highly liquid investments that have positive
values (i.e., “assets”) should be used in the numerator. Cf. infra footnote 744 (discussing the use of the
term “assets” in the 15% limit on illiquid investments).

634

Rule 22e-4(b)(1)(iii)(A)(1).

195

investments that are assets of the fund. 635 Rule 22e-4 as adopted today also requires a fund to
adopt and implement policies and procedures for responding to a shortfall in a fund’s highly
liquid investments below its highly liquid investment minimum.636 These policies and
procedures must include reporting to the fund’s board of directors, no later than the board’s next
regularly scheduled meeting, regarding any shortfall of the fund’s highly liquid investments
compared to its minimum. A fund is required to report to its board within one business day, and
submit a non-public report to the Commission, if its highly liquid investment minimum shortfall
lasts more than seven consecutive calendar days. 637 A fund’s board of directors is not normally
required to specifically approve the fund’s highly liquid investment minimum, although during a
time that a fund’s highly liquid investments are below the fund’s determined minimum level, a
fund’s highly liquid investment minimum can be changed only with board approval. 638
Additionally, a discussion of the fund’s minimum must be included in the written annual report
to the board on the adequacy and effectiveness of the fund’s liquidity risk management program.
Funds whose portfolio assets consist primarily of highly liquid investments, as well as In-Kind
ETFs, are not subject to the highly liquid investment minimum requirement. 639
As described in more detail below, this requirement is a modification of the proposed
“three-day liquid asset minimum,” which also would have required a fund to determine the
percentage of the fund’s net assets to be invested in relatively liquid assets (under the proposal,
“three-day liquid assets,” or cash and any asset convertible to cash within three business days at

a price that does not materially affect the value of that asset immediately prior to sale). 640 In
determining its three-day liquid asset minimum, the proposed rule would have required a fund to
consider the factors the fund would have to consider, as applicable, in assessing its liquidity risk
under rule 22e-4. 641 Under the proposal, a fund would have been prohibited from acquiring any
asset other than a three-day liquid asset if, after acquisition, the fund would hold fewer three-day
liquid assets than the percentage specified under its three-day liquid asset minimum.642 Also
under the proposal, a fund’s board would have had to approve the fund’s three-day liquid asset
minimum and any changes thereto. 643
The goal of the proposed three-day liquid asset minimum requirement was to increase the
likelihood that a fund would hold adequate liquid assets to meet redemption requests without
materially affecting the fund’s NAV. 644 The proposed three-day liquid asset minimum also was
intended to be structured in a way that would foster consistency in funds’ consideration of
relevant liquidity risk factors, while permitting flexibility in implementing this liquidity risk
management tool as appropriate given the diverse range of funds it would cover. 645 It was
intended to work together with other aspects of the proposed liquidity risk management program
designed to help ensure that while funds would consider the spectrum of liquidity in their
portfolios (in part through the proposed classification requirement), they would pay particular
attention to the most liquid and least liquid ends of this spectrum. 646

Many commenters agreed that a requirement for a fund to determine a minimum—or, per
some commenters’ suggestions, a target—amount of relatively liquid assets would assist funds in
effectively meeting redemption requests under a variety of market conditions. 647 Some, on the
other hand, suggested that a minimum or target requirement would not necessarily enhance a
fund’s ability to meet shareholder redemptions because the amount of liquid assets a fund may
need is dynamic and unpredictable, and in extraordinary stressed market conditions no particular
amount of liquid assets may end up being sufficient to meet redemptions. 648 Commenters also
objected to the structure of the proposed minimum requirement, particularly the fact that the
requirement would not permit a fund to acquire relatively less liquid assets if the fund were to
fall below its minimum, arguing that the requirement could actually increase shareholder
redemptions during times of stress. 649 In addition, commenters expressed concerns that the
proposed requirement could prevent funds from meeting their principal investment strategies 650
and that it could effectively prevent funds from holding or acquiring favorable, but relatively less
liquid, assets under certain circumstances, which could intensify market stress as well as
adversely affect a fund’s NAV. 651 Finally, some commenters expressed concerns about the
potential operational burdens associated with the proposed three-day liquid asset minimum
requirement. 652

Some commenters also suggested alternatives to the proposed three-day liquid asset
minimum. As discussed further below, a number of commenters suggested requiring funds to
maintain a “target” or threshold amount of certain liquid assets. 653 Other commenters suggested
requiring funds to consider whether to maintain a target amount of liquid assets 654 or to adopt
policies and procedures to address shareholder redemptions, which could include targets or
ranges. 655 As discussed below, we believe the highly liquid investment minimum requirement we
are adopting strikes an appropriate balance in promoting the benefits intended by the proposed
three-day liquid asset minimum requirement, including consistency in funds’ consideration of
certain factors relevant to their liquidity risk management procedures, while at the same time
lessening the likelihood of certain adverse consequences identified by commenters.
1. Anticipated Benefits of Highly Liquid Investment Minimum
Like the proposed three-day liquid asset requirement, we believe that the highly liquid
investment minimum requirement will increase the likelihood that a fund would be prepared to
meet redemption requests without significant dilution of remaining investors’ interests in the
fund. Some commenters noted that it is common for funds to assess how much liquidity they
may need under various market conditions in order to meet redemptions over a relatively short
time horizon and suggested that targeting a certain level of relatively liquid assets is an
appropriate way for a fund to manage its liquidity risk. 656 To the extent that a fund already aims

653

See, e.g., Invesco Comment Letter (suggesting that funds be required to maintain a “target” range of threeday and/or seven-day liquid assets); PIMCO Comment Letter (suggesting that a minimum cash target could
be established by the investment manager); BlackRock Comment Letter (suggesting that funds could be
required to take several steps to ensure an appropriate level of Tier 1 and Tier 2 assets, which could be
articulated as a range or target); Credit Suisse Comment Letter.

199

to invest a specified portion of its portfolio in relatively liquid assets, we anticipate that such
funds may already be substantially in compliance with the highly liquid investment minimum
requirement we are adopting today. More importantly, it would require those funds that do not
currently consider what an appropriate baseline level of liquidity might be to do so.
As with the proposal, we believe that the final highly liquid investment minimum
requirement will help encourage consistency in funds’ consideration of certain factors relevant to
their liquidity risk management procedures. This is an important benefit compared to some
commenters’ suggestions that funds simply be required to have policies and procedures to
address shareholder redemptions (which could include liquid asset minimums or targets), but not
to specify any particular procedures within this general requirement. 657 As with the proposal, we
believe that the approach we are adopting appropriately encourages regularity and thoroughness
in funds’ consideration of certain risk factors, while at the same time promoting flexibility in
funds’ management of this risk. Under rule 22e-4 as adopted, a fund will be able to determine its
own highly liquid investment minimum, as well as (within a fairly broad range) the assets it will
hold to satisfy its minimum. 658 We believe that the requirement we are adopting provides
important additional flexibility to funds’ liquidity risk management practices in that a fund will
be required to adopt policies and procedures, but would be permitted to design them as
appropriate to respond to shortfalls in highly liquid investments relative to the fund’s minimum.
As noted above, some commenters suggested that a minimum requirement would not
necessarily enhance funds’ ability to meet shareholder redemptions. We agree that the highly
liquid investment minimum requirement we are adopting, standing alone, may not be a sufficient
657

See supra footnote 655; see also infra section IV (discussing other reasonable alternatives to the highly
liquid investment minimum requirement).

658

See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(iii)(A)(1).

safeguard for funds to manage liquidity risk under all market conditions. However, we believe
that, together with the rest of the liquidity risk management program requirements we are
adopting, it is a central tool to help put a fund in a solid position to meet redemption requests
without significant dilution of remaining investors’ interests. The highly liquid investment
minimum requirement, together with the classification requirement and the 15% limitation on a
fund’s investments in illiquid investments that are assets, is meant to be a primary component of
a fund’s overall approach to liquidity risk management. While the classification requirement
would illustrate the spectrum of a fund’s portfolio liquidity, the highly liquid investment
minimum requirement and the 15% limitation on illiquid investments would focus the fund’s
attention on each end of that liquidity spectrum—the fund’s most liquid and least liquid
investments, respectively.
Based on a fund’s liquidity risk assessment, the fund could determine what additional
liquidity risk management tools, if any, together with the highly liquid investment minimum
requirement and the 15% limitation on illiquid investments, would best permit the fund to meet
redemptions and help prevent significant investor dilution. We also believe that the highly liquid
investment minimum requirement will be a useful liquidity risk management tool because we
understand, based on staff outreach and comments that we received on the proposal, that the
requirement we are adopting is similar to liquidity risk management strategies that many funds
currently use. 659
While certain commenters expressed concern that the proposed three-day liquid asset
minimum requirement could unduly encourage funds to use only their most liquid assets in
meeting redemptions (which commenters argued could lead to additional redemptions from
659

See supra footnote 656 and accompanying text.

201

funds in stressed periods), 660 we note that the minimum requirement—both as proposed and as
adopted—was never meant to suggest that a fund should only, or primarily, use its most liquid
investments to meet shareholder redemptions. 661 Nor is it meant, as commenters argued, to
suggest that funds should hold cash-like buffers that investors may inappropriately assume will
eliminate funds’ liquidity risk. 662 Indeed, we noted in the Proposing Release that assets eligible
for inclusion in a fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum holdings could include a broad variety
of securities, as well as cash and cash equivalents. 663 Moreover, because the final highly liquid
investment minimum requirement would not prohibit a fund from acquiring investments other
than highly liquid investments if a fund were to fall below its minimum, we believe that the final
requirement may convey more effectively than the proposal that a fund is not guaranteed to hold
a certain level of cash or highly liquid investments at all times.
As with the proposed three-day liquid asset minimum requirement, we believe an
important feature of the highly liquid investment minimum requirement we are adopting is the
flexibility it provides for a fund to determine an appropriate highly liquid investment minimum
considering its particular risk factors, as well as (within a fairly broad range) the assets it will
hold to satisfy its minimum. We acknowledge that, for certain funds that currently have
relatively less liquid portfolios, the highly liquid investment minimum requirement could cause a
fund to modify its investment strategy if, after consideration of the required factors, the fund
were to determine it is appropriate to invest in higher amounts of highly liquid investments. In

these circumstances, we believe such a modification would be appropriate. We discuss the costs
associated with any modifications to funds’ investment strategies that could result from the final
highly liquid investment minimum requirement in the Economic Analysis section below.
2. Consideration of Liquidity Risk Factors
Rule 22e-4 requires a fund to consider the liquidity risk factors set forth in the rule, as
applicable, in determining its highly liquid investment minimum.664 Under the proposed rule, a
fund likewise would have been required to consider the proposed rule’s liquidity risk assessment
factors in determining its three-day liquid asset minimum. 665 Several commenters suggested that
these factors should be guidance that funds may consider in setting a minimum or target for
relatively liquid assets, but should not be mandatory considerations a fund would be required to
assess. 666 Commenters also objected to the requirement that funds determine their three-day
liquid asset minimum based on liquidity risk under both normal and reasonably foreseeable
stressed conditions, arguing that this requirement would result in funds being forced to maintain
artificially high levels of three-day liquid assets. 667 Some commenters also discussed more
granular objections to certain of the proposed factors to be used in determining a fund’s
three-day liquid asset minimum, such as certain aspects of the proposed requirements to consider
a fund’s shareholder concentration 668 and borrowing arrangements. 669
We continue to believe it is appropriate for a fund to be required—not only permitted—to

consider a specified set of liquidity risk factors in determining its highly liquid investment
minimum. We believe requiring every fund to consider multiple aspects of its history, policies,
strategy, and operations in determining its highly liquid investment minimum will lead to a
general industry-wide baseline for the minimum requirement. However, we are making certain
modifications to the proposed liquidity risk factors, including only requiring funds to consider
applicable factors, to respond to commenters’ concerns about this aspect of the requirement.
a. Modifications to Proposed Requirement to Consider Liquidity Risk Factors
As discussed above, the liquidity risk factors we are adopting today incorporate certain
modifications to the proposed factors, 670 and thus these modifications flow through with respect
to a fund’s consideration of these factors in determining its highly liquid investment minimum.
We believe that the guidance that we provide in section III.B.2 regarding a fund’s consideration
of these factors in assessing its liquidity risk also is appropriate for a fund to take into account
when determining its highly liquid investment minimum. With the exception of the
recommendations about specific factors or guidance discussed below, we did not receive
comments on the proposed factors or the guidance provided in the Proposing Release regarding
these factors.
Some commenters recommended that the Commission confirm that funds may consider
and weigh the factors as they deem appropriate and relevant for purposes of the proposed
minimum requirement, 671 and we agree that a fund should give the most weight to the factors that
it deems most relevant for determining its highly liquid investment minimum. Moreover, to the
extent any liquidity risk assessment factor is not applicable to a particular fund, the fund would

670

See supra section III.B.2.

671

See, e.g., Oppenheimer Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter I.

204

not be required to consider that factor in determining its highly liquid investment minimum. We
have therefore added the words “as applicable” in the rule, 672 and we note that, in this context,
the phrase “as applicable” is meant to refer to those factors that are relevant to a fund’s particular
facts and circumstances. For example, a fund would not be required to consider the use of
borrowings for investment purposes, as specified under rule 22e-4(b)(1)(i)(A), if that fund does
not engage in borrowing. 673 Conversely, however, a fund that maintains borrowing sources for
investment purposes would be required to consider the use of borrowings for investment
purposes as specified under the rule. The addition of “as applicable” should help respond to
commenters’ concerns that codifying a list of required factors as a provision of the proposed
minimum requirement would “create an overly rigid structure and a one-size-fits-all approach
that may result in unnecessary focus on factors that are irrelevant to certain funds.” 674
We continue to believe that a fund should consider both normal and reasonably
foreseeable stressed conditions in determining the amount of highly liquid investments it will
hold, based on the liquidity risk assessment factors. However, in a change from the proposal, the
rule specifies that only those stressed conditions that are reasonably foreseeable during the
period until the next review of the highly liquid investment minimum (emphasis added) should be
considered when a fund determines its highly liquid investment minimum.675 As discussed
above, some commenters expressed concern that the requirement for funds to consider normal

672

See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(iii)(A)(1); see also supra footnote 192 and accompanying text.

673

See supra section III.B.2.

674

See SIFMA Comment Letter I; see also e.g., Charles Schwab Comment Letter; Oppenheimer Comment
Letter (suggesting that it is critically important that funds be afforded a certain amount of flexibility in
setting the fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum).

675

See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(iii)(A)(1); see also rule 22e-4( b)(1)(iii)(A)(2) (requiring funds to periodically review,
no less frequently than annually, the highly liquid investment minimum).

205

and reasonably foreseeable stressed conditions in determining their three-day liquid asset
minimum could suggest that all funds should hold a high level of cash or other highly liquid
assets at all times, which could in turn encourage funds to maintain portfolio liquidity levels that
are disproportionate relative to their liquidity risk. 676 We believe that requiring consideration of
only those stressed conditions that are reasonably foreseeable during the period until the next
review of the highly liquid investment minimum should address commenters’ concerns and
should help ensure that the highly liquid investment minimum requirement leads funds to hold
levels of portfolio liquidity that are appropriate in light of their reasonably anticipated liquidity
risk.
This change also responds to commenters’ concerns about perceived ambiguity in the
length of time over which the proposed rule would have required funds to forecast the effect of
stressed conditions on the liquidity risk factors. 677 Under the final rule, funds are required to
periodically review, no less frequently than annually, their highly liquid investment minimum.
Thus, the requirement to consider stressed conditions only to the extent they are reasonably
foreseeable during the period until the next review of the highly liquid investment minimum,
limits consideration of stressed conditions to whatever time frame the fund has determined for
review of its highly liquid investment minimum, but no longer than one year. We note that if a
fund encounters extremely stressed market conditions, beyond those that were reasonably
676

See supra footnote 667 and accompanying text. Commenters argued that this, in turn, could lead to
declines in fund performance, which shareholders would experience in the form of lower returns. See, e.g.,
Fidelity Comment Letter; Invesco Comment Letter; J.P. Morgan Comment Letter; Wells Fargo Comment
Letter.

677

See, e.g., MFS Comment Letter (noting that the proposal fails to indicate the period of time over which the
estimate of foreseeable redemptions is to be calculated); see also SIFMA Comment Letter I (“We do not
agree, however, that in making their Highly Liquid Asset Target determinations, funds should be required
to forecast the timing, severity or potential impact of stressed market conditions or other events affecting
the fund that have occurred in the past but for which there is no reasonable way to accurately predict their
recurrence.”).

206

foreseeable during the period until the next review of the highly liquid investment minimum, that
could increase its liquidity risk to unusual levels, the fund should consider adjusting its highly
liquid investment minimum at that time, and indeed a fund should generally review its highly
liquid investment minimum more frequently than annually if circumstances warrant.
b. Role of Liquidity Risk Factors in Determining the Highly Liquid Investment Minimum
As noted above, rule 22e-4 requires a fund to consider the liquidity risk factors set forth
in the rule, as applicable, in determining its highly liquid investment minimum. In summary, a
fund must consider, as applicable, its: (i) investment strategy and portfolio liquidity during
normal conditions, and during stressed conditions to the extent such conditions are reasonably
foreseeable during the period until the next review of the highly liquid investment minimum; (ii)
short-term and long-term cash flow projections during normal conditions, and during stressed
conditions to the extent such conditions are reasonably foreseeable during the period until the
next review of the highly liquid investment minimum; and (iii) holdings of cash and cash
equivalents, as well as borrowing arrangements and other funding sources. 678 In addition to these
factors, an ETF also must consider, as applicable: (i) the relationship between the ETF’s
portfolio liquidity and the way in which, and the prices and spreads at which, ETF shares trade,
including the efficiency of the arbitrage function and the level of active participation by market
participants (including authorized participants); and (ii) the effect of the composition of baskets
on the overall liquidity of the ETF’s portfolio. 679
With respect to a fund’s consideration of its investment strategy and portfolio liquidity in
determining its highly liquid investment minimum, we continue to believe that the less liquid a

679

Rule 22e-4(b)(1)(i)(D)-(E); rule 22e-4(b)(1)(iii)(A)(1); see also infra section III.J. (discussing liquidity risk
management program elements tailored to ETFs).

207

fund’s overall portfolio investments are, the higher a fund may want to establish its highly liquid
investment minimum. Similarly, funds with certain investment strategies that typically have had
greater volatility of flows than other investment strategies — such as alternative funds and
emerging market debt funds — would generally need highly liquid investment minimums that
are higher than funds whose strategies tend to entail less flow volatility. For funds that use
borrowings for investment purposes and derivatives, we continue to believe that, all else equal, a
fund with a leveraged strategy (e.g., a fund with leverage through bank borrowings or that has
significant fixed obligations to derivatives counterparties) generally would need a highly liquid
investment minimum that is higher than a fund that does not. 680 Similarly, when setting the
fund’s highly liquid investment minimum, we believe a fund that has or expects to have a
significant amount of highly liquid investments segregated to cover derivatives transactions or
pledged to satisfy margin requirements in connection with derivatives transactions should take
into account the fact that such segregated or pledged highly liquid investments may not be
available to meet redemptions. However, this guidance is not meant to suggest that a fund
should only, or primarily, use highly liquid investments to meet shareholder redemptions.
Rather, in the examples provided in this paragraph, we believe that holding a relatively high
level of assets that are highly liquid investments would both support a fund in meeting

680

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at paragraphs accompanying n.339. As discussed in the
Proposing Release, we believe that a leveraged fund has an increased risk that it will be unable to meet
redemptions and an increased risk of investor dilution compared to an equivalent fund with no leverage.
For example, a fund with leverage through bank borrowings may have to meet margin calls if a security the
fund provided to the bank to secure the loan declines in value. Such margin calls can render highly liquid
portfolio assets unavailable to meet investor redemptions, which can increase dilution and the risk the fund
will be unable to meet redemptions.
Similarly, a fund that has significant fixed obligations to derivatives counterparties (for example, from a
total return swap or writing credit default swaps) must pay out on these obligations when due, even if it
means selling the fund’s more liquid, high quality assets to raise cash. See, e.g., OppenheimerFunds
Release, supra footnote 223.

208

redemption requests in a manner that does not dilute non-redeeming shareholders, and assist the
fund in readjusting its portfolio as necessary to handle stressed conditions, weathering periods of
heightened volatility, and managing its obligations to derivatives counterparties.
Regarding a fund’s cash flow projections, we continue to believe that the Commission’s
cash flow guidance considerations could be useful to a fund in setting its highly liquid
investment minimum.681 We generally expect that a fund would evaluate the Commission’s
guidance on these considerations and determine whether each would be useful and relevant in
setting the fund’s highly liquid investment minimum. In addition, a fund may wish to consider
employing some form of stress testing 682 or consider specific historical redemption scenarios in
determining its highly liquid investment minimum.
Each of the cash flow guidance considerations—either standing alone, but especially
viewed in combination with one another—are potentially significant features that could
materially affect the risk of significant redemptions and thus could influence a fund’s
determination of its highly liquid investment minimum. For example, a fund with a concentrated
shareholder base has a high risk that only one or two shareholders deciding to redeem can cause
the fund to sell a significant amount of assets, which depending on the liquidity of the fund’s
portfolio and how it meets those redemptions, can dilute remaining shareholders. Similarly, a
fund whose redemption policy is to satisfy all redemptions on a next business day basis (T+1) or
that is sold through distribution channels that historically attract investors with more volatile

681

See supra section III.B.2.b. These five guidance considerations include: (i) the size, frequency, and
volatility of historical purchases and redemptions of fund shares during normal and reasonably foreseeable
stressed periods; (ii) the fund’s redemption policies; (iii) the fund’s shareholder ownership concentration;
(iv) the fund’s distribution channels; and (v) the degree of certainty associated with the fund’s short-term
and long-term cash flow projections.

682

See supra footnote 196 and accompanying text.

209

and/or unpredictable flows also should consider setting a higher minimum level for its assets that
are highly liquid investments than a fund that, all else equal, does not face these risks.
In setting a highly liquid investment minimum, a fund should consider the degree of
certainty associated with the fund’s short-term and long-term cash flow projections. Projections
may only be as good as the extent and quality of information that informs them. For example, if
a fund does not have substantial visibility into its shareholder base (e.g., because the fund’s
shares are principally sold through intermediaries that do not provide shareholder transparency)
or if a fund is uncertain about changing market conditions which are likely to materially affect
the fund’s level of net redemptions, it may make projections but be quite uncertain about the
reliability of those projections. In these circumstances, a fund should consider setting its highly
liquid investment minimum to reflect this uncertainty, for example, by providing a cushion or
multiple of its cash flow projections in the event realized net redemptions are significantly
higher.
One commenter objected that shareholder ownership concentration, which is discussed in
this Release as a guidance factor that could be used in evaluating cash flows (but in the proposal
would have been required to be considered in analyzing a fund’s cash flow projections), should
not be a determinative consideration for a fund in establishing its appropriate level of relatively
liquid assets. 683 This commenter expressed concern that “accentuating the significance of this
sub-factor in the context of new or recently launched funds, which may have a small number of
shareholders relative to more established funds, could have a severe anti-competitive effect and
create an unwarranted barrier to the introduction of new funds.” We agree that emphasizing
shareholder concentration could lead new funds to increase their holdings of relatively liquid
683

See SIFMA Comment Letter I.

210

investments. However, we note that substantial shareholder concentration, even for new or
recently launched funds, could give rise to significant liquidity risk, and thus this consideration
should not be discounted when a fund whose investor base is significantly concentrated
determines its highly liquid investment minimum.684 New or recently launched funds that have a
concentrated shareholder base should consider disclosing the risk of redemption by one or more
such shareholders in the fund’s prospectus. 685 To the extent that a new fund’s shareholder base
becomes significantly less concentrated as the fund matures, the fund may wish to take this into
consideration in reviewing its highly liquid investment minimum and adjusting it as it determines
appropriate.
With respect to a fund’s consideration of its holdings of cash and cash equivalents in
determining its highly liquid investment minimum, we continue to believe that these holdings
may provide funds with important flexibility to manage their liquidity risks. Our staff has
observed that it is relatively common for fund complexes to target a minimum amount of cash or
cash equivalent holdings in the fund, with the assumption that cash and cash equivalent holdings
would allow the fund to meet redemptions in a stressed period without realizing significant
discounts to its holdings’ carrying values when they are sold. Holding cash or cash equivalents
also could readily permit funds to rebalance or otherwise adjust a portfolio’s composition in
order to manage liquidity risk. Similarly, the availability of a line of credit or other funding
sources to meet redemptions could assist a fund in managing liquidity risk, although as discussed
684

As discussed above, a fund may also take into account the types of shareholders in the fund and whether
those shareholders share common investment goals affecting redemption frequency and timing.
Additionally, a fund may take into account other liquidity risk management tools available to it, such as
redemption fees, when determining its highly liquid investment minimum.

685

See SIFMA Comment Letter I (suggesting that the Commission encourage such prospectus disclosure).
We recognize that other factors, such as the size of a fund’s positions and the liquidity of those positions,
could impact the extent to which this risk could affect the fund.

211

below, depending on the nature of use, the use of a line of credit could raise other issues. 686 To
the extent that a fund determines that any of these considerations could indicate decreased
liquidity risk, these considerations could provide important inputs regarding the level that the
fund deems appropriate for its highly liquid investment minimum.
Certain commenters indicated that the Commission should permit a fund to reduce its
required holdings of relatively liquid assets by the amount of other sources of liquidity available
to the fund, such as a committed line of credit. 687 Under these commenters’ views, if a fund were
to determine that its highly liquid investment minimum would typically be x% of the fund’s net
assets, a fund with a committed line of credit representing y% of the fund’s net assets should be
able to reduce its highly liquid investment minimum to x% minus y% of the fund’s net assets.
We disagree with this approach for several reasons. First, we believe that a mechanical
subtraction of the amount of a credit line available to a fund from the fund’s highly liquid
investment minimum is inappropriate under circumstances in which all or part of the line of
credit is not guaranteed to be available to a fund—for example, because it is a committed line of
credit that may be shared among other members of the fund family. Even if the credit facility
was committed just to the fund, the amount ultimately available could depend on the financial
health of the institution providing the facility, as well as the terms and conditions of the facility.
Finally, as discussed in the Proposing Release, while a line of credit can facilitate a fund’s ability
to meet unexpected redemptions and can be taken into consideration when determining its highly
liquid investment minimum, we continue to believe that liquidity risk management is better

686

See infra footnote 688 and accompanying text.

687

See, e.g., Cohen & Steers Comment Letter; Oppenheimer Comment Letter.

212

conducted primarily through construction of a fund’s portfolio. 688
As with the proposed three-day liquid asset minimum requirement, a fund would be
required to maintain a written record of how its highly liquid investment minimum was
determined, including an assessment of each of the factors. 689 This would permit our
examination staff to ascertain that funds are indeed considering the required factors, as
applicable. As discussed in the Proposing Release, we continue to generally believe that it
would be extremely difficult to conclude, based on the factors that a fund would be required to
consider, that a highly liquid investment minimum of zero would be appropriate. 690
3. Highly Liquid Investment Minimum Shortfall Policies and Procedures
Under rule 22e-4, a fund will be required to adopt specific policies and procedures for
responding to a shortfall in the fund’s assets that are highly liquid investments below its highly
liquid investment minimum (for purposes of this section, a fund’s “shortfall policies and
procedures”). A fund’s shortfall policies and procedures, as described in more detail below,
must include reporting to the fund’s board of directors no later than the board’s next regularly
scheduled meeting with a brief explanation of the causes of the shortfall, the extent of the

688

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at section III.C.3; see also, e.g., HSBC Comment Letter (“The
degree to which a fund employs leverage can have a material impact on its liquidity demands, particularly
during periods of market stress. As such, attempts to model liquidity risk should incorporate an assessment
of leverage and the extent to which this might intensify liquidity demands for a given fund during different
scenarios compared to unleveraged funds.”); Nuveen FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra footnote 85
(“Funds without credit lines face the possibility of not being able to sell sufficient assets to raise cash to
fund redemption requests, or having to sell assets at significantly discounted values. To the extent that a
fund draws on a credit line to meet net redemptions (and thus temporarily leverages itself), it increases its
market risk at a time when markets are stressed. While this can be potentially beneficial to long-term
performance if the asset class recovers, it increases the risk of loss to remaining shareholders if markets
continue to weaken.”).

shortfall, and any actions taken in response. 691 Also, a fund’s shortfall policies and procedures
must include reporting within one business day to the fund’s board if a shortfall lasts more than
seven consecutive calendar days, including an explanation of how the fund plans to restore its
minimum within a reasonable period of time. 692
a. Shortfall Policies and Procedures Requirement
Rule 22e-4 as proposed did not include the requirement for a fund to adopt shortfall
policies and procedures. This requirement replaces the proposed prohibition against acquiring
any asset other than a three-day liquid asset if a fund’s holdings of three-day liquid assets were to
drop below its three-day liquid asset minimum (for purposes of this section, the “proposed
acquisition limit”). 693 As discussed above, commenters expressed concerns that the proposed
acquisition limit could have adverse effects on funds, their shareholders, and the markets in
which funds operate. Specifically, commenters cautioned that shareholder redemptions could
increase if shareholders observe that a large redemption has taken place and assume that the fund
will not be able to effectively employ its investment strategy due to the proposed prohibition on
acquiring any assets that are not three-day liquid assets. 694 Commenters suggested that this, in
turn, could incentivize shareholders to redeem quickly in times of stress, which could spark
additional redemptions from funds in stressed periods. Some commenters also argued that the
proposed acquisition limit could lead index funds to hold a level of relatively liquid assets that
causes them to deviate from the construction of their indices 695 and could cause funds that are

managed relative to a benchmark to experience higher tracking error. 696 Commenters also
maintained that the proposed acquisition limit could impair actively managed funds to the extent
that it could limit portfolio managers’ discretion to purchase assets that they believe would
maximize funds’ returns. 697
In addition, commenters argued that the proposed acquisition limit could effectively
prevent funds from holding or acquiring favorable, but relatively less liquid, assets under certain
circumstances, which could intensify market stress as well as adversely affect a fund’s NAV. 698
For example, some commenters suggested that a fund whose three-day liquid asset holdings were
to fall below its minimum could feel pressure to sell less liquid assets in order to replenish its
three-day liquid assets, which could lead to excessive sales of less liquid assets during times of
market stress that could adversely affect the fund’s NAV. 699 Relatedly, commenters suggested
that the proposed acquisition limit could produce harmful market effects if it were to
significantly increase the demand for relatively liquid assets, which could conversely decrease
demand for other asset types (making them less liquid) and exacerbate market volatility. 700
Commenters expressed concern that any “herding” behavior that could result from the proposed
acquisition limit could become especially pronounced during stressed periods. 701 Commenters
also argued that the proposed acquisition limit could prevent a fund manager from purchasing
certain investments that it views as undervalued in a downturn, when the fund’s holdings of

three-day liquid assets are at or below the fund’s minimum.702 They contended that this in turn
could reduce the fund’s universe of potential investments and ability to invest in contrarian and
countercyclical ways, 703 which could eliminate a potential pool of buyers and thus could
exacerbate an already stressed environment. 704
A significant number of commenters suggested that the Commission adopt a liquid asset
target in lieu of the proposed three-day liquid asset minimum requirement—indeed, this was the
most common alternative suggestion to the proposed three-day liquid asset minimum
requirement. 705 One primary distinction between the target requirements that commenters
recommended and the proposed three-day liquid asset minimum requirement is that a target
requirement would not prohibit a fund from acquiring certain assets if a fund’s holdings of
relatively liquid assets were to fall below the target. Instead, some commenters stated that a fund
should have a reasonable period to respond to a shortfall of relatively liquid assets below the
fund’s target, and/or that any such shortfalls must be reported to the fund’s board. 706
We continue to believe that fund shareholders’ interests are generally best served when
the percentage of a fund’s assets invested in relatively liquid investments is at (or above) the
level deemed appropriate by the fund. 707 The highly liquid investment minimum requirement we
are adopting would not prohibit a fund from acquiring assets other than highly liquid investments
when a fund’s highly liquid investments fall below its minimum. However, we believe that the

216

shortfall policies and procedures requirement we are adopting—which replaces the proposed
acquisition limit—provides flexibility while also promoting effective liquidity management
practices. We believe this requirement also responds to concerns about a flat prohibition against
purchasing certain assets when the fund’s assets that are highly liquid investments drop below a
certain level.
Additionally, we believe that the shortfall policies and procedures requirement responds
appropriately to commenters’ concerns that there could be appropriate reasons for a fund to
acquire an investment other than a highly liquid investment if a fund were to fall below its
minimum. The final highly liquid investment minimum requirement will require that funds
determine a level of assets that are highly liquid investments designed to help them manage the
fund through stressed conditions or opportunistically readjust their portfolios, while permitting a
fund’s portfolio liquidity to fall below this level when determined appropriate from a risk
management perspective or on account of extenuating circumstances. The shortfall policies and
procedures requirement, including the reporting requirement, is meant to foster discussion
among the fund’s management (and board) if its assets that are highly liquid investments fall
below the level the fund determined to be an appropriate minimum. We further believe that the
final highly liquid investment minimum requirement appropriately responds to commenters’
concerns that the proposed acquisition limit could restrict funds’ ability to meet their principal
investment strategies, to the detriment of fund investors. The final requirement provides fund
managers more leeway than the proposed requirement to structure and modify their portfolios
because—as would be the case in the target requirement commenters suggested—fund managers
would not be prevented from purchasing certain assets when a fund’s holdings of assets that are
highly liquid investments drop below its highly liquid investment minimum.
217

The highly liquid investment minimum requirement we are adopting, together with the
shortfall policies and procedures requirement, also responds to commenters’ concerns that the
proposed acquisition limit could exacerbate potential market stresses and lead to other harmful
market effects. Under the final rule, a fund that falls below its highly liquid investment
minimum would not be restricted to acquiring only highly liquid investments, if acquiring other
investments were consistent with the fund’s shortfall policies and procedures. Also, as discussed
above, the requirement that a fund determine its highly liquid investment minimum taking into
account only those stressed conditions that are reasonably foreseeable during the period until the
next review of the highly liquid investment minimum should decrease the probability that a fund
could overweight its assets that are highly liquid investments relative to its liquidity risk. This
also, in turn, should lessen demand for highly liquid investments compared to the possible
market effects of the proposed requirement.
Finally, we believe that the final highly liquid investment minimum requirement, in
conjunction with the shortfall policies and procedures requirement, will help to mitigate some of
the operational burdens that commenters argued would accompany the proposal, 708 while
continuing to advance the Commission’s goals. We note that the highly liquid investment
minimum requirement will involve monitoring a fund’s portfolio investments’ liquidity for
compliance. We recognize that this monitoring may result in operational costs, which could be
greater for funds with multiple sub-advisers to the extent that these funds would need to build or

708

See, e.g., Federated Comment Letter (suggesting that the proposed requirement could present significant
operational and technological challenges because a fund’s trade order management system would need to
maintain the liquidity classification for each security in order to accurately monitor compliance with the
fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum); ICI Comment Letter I (noting that the proposed requirement
would raise operational difficulties for funds with multiple sub-advisers because compliance would
necessitate consideration of portfolio assets’ liquidity at the fund level, and thus the proposal would require
a significant amount of coordination among sub-advisers).

otherwise implement systems to coordinate portfolio liquidity information provided by each
sub-adviser. 709 However, we expect that the operational costs associated with the final highly
liquid investment minimum requirement would be significantly less compared to the proposal,
which would have entailed the additional costs of building systems that would bar the purchase
of less liquid investments if the fund were to fall below its minimum. We understand that some
fund complexes today already track a liquid asset minimum or target, and for these funds,
operational costs associated with the final minimum requirement would only entail adjustments
to their current processes and not the costs of an entirely new systems build-out.
b. Operation of Shortfall Policies and Procedures Requirement
Rule 22e-4 provides flexibility as to the particular shortfall policies and procedures a
fund may adopt because we believe that different facts and circumstances could result in
different funds taking different approaches to address a decline in assets that are highly liquid
investments. 710 We also recognize that it may be difficult to contemplate or specify all
appropriate factors to consider (or their weighting) in advance of a shortfall, and that part of the
decision process requires an evaluation of the current stress event and a determination of whether
it is likely to persist (and for how long). Nonetheless, a fund’s shortfall policies and procedures
could specify some of the actions that a fund could consider taking to respond to a highly liquid
investment minimum shortfall under different conditions, as well as market- and fund-specific
circumstances that could shape a fund’s response to a particular shortfall occasion. For example,
the policies and procedures could outline some of the circumstances under which it could be

709

See also infra paragraph accompanying footnote 818 (discussing the coordination of liquidity risk
management efforts undertaken by various service providers, including a fund’s sub-adviser(s)).

710

For example, a fund may handle a shortfall due to changes in market conditions differently than a shortfall
due to increased redemptions.

219

appropriate for a fund to purchase assets that are not highly liquid investments, despite being
below its minimum. If, for example, the fund reasonably expected inflows in the near future
(e.g., from a retirement plan platform), it may determine it is acceptable to pursue an attractive
buying opportunity despite a decline below the fund’s highly liquid investment minimum that it
expects to be short-term. It also could be appropriate, for example, for a fund to consider selling
certain relatively less liquid holdings over a period of time and investing some of the proceeds in
highly liquid investments.
Similarly, as part of its shortfall policies and procedures, a fund could set forth how it
would set out a time frame by which it plans to bring its assets that are highly liquid investments
back up to the level of its highly liquid investment minimum. 711 If a fund encounters highly
liquid investment minimum shortfalls regularly, a fund’s liquidity risk management program
administrator, potentially together with the fund’s broader risk management function, should
consider whether the fund’s risk management policies and procedures should be modified. We
note that a fund’s shortfall policies and procedures could, but will not be required to, specify the
persons who will typically determine how, if at all, to respond to a shortfall (for example, the
person designated by the board to administer the fund’s liquidity risk management program, in
conjunction with the fund’s risk managers and portfolio managers).
As discussed below, although we are not requiring a fund’s board to specifically approve
its highly liquid investment minimum, we continue to believe that the board should play an
oversight role with respect to the minimum.712 A requirement to inform the board when a fund

711

If a fund’s highly liquid investment minimum shortfall lasts more than seven consecutive calendar days,
reporting to the fund’s board within one business day is required, including an explanation of how the fund
plans to restore its minimum within a reasonable period of time. See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(iii)(A)(3).

712

See infra section III.H.3.

220

drops below its highly liquid investment minimum, as well as the circumstances leading to the
fund’s highly liquid investment minimum shortfall and actions taken in response, will permit the
board better to understand circumstances that may give rise to heightened liquidity risk. It also
will provide important context for the board in evaluating the effectiveness of the fund’s highly
liquid investment minimum and the fund’s liquidity risk management program generally. Many
commenters suggested that the Commission should adopt a board reporting requirement when a
fund’s holdings of relatively liquid assets drop below the level that the fund has generally
targeted as appropriate. 713 Rule 22e-4 as adopted generally reflects these suggestions.
As fund boards are charged with oversight and not day-to-day management of funds’
liquidity risk, we believe that it is appropriate not to require that the fund’s board be informed
that the fund has dropped below its highly liquid investment minimum immediately when this
occurs. Thus, rule 22e-4 requires that a fund’s board be informed of a highly liquid investment
minimum shortfall at the board’s next regularly scheduled meeting. 714 If a fund were to drop
below its highly liquid investment minimum multiple times prior to the next regularly scheduled
board meeting, fund management could provide a single report to the board at that meeting
discussing each of these occurrences.
However, we believe that when a fund’s assets that are highly liquid investments are
below its minimum for an extended period of time, this could indicate especially heightened
liquidity risk, and thus under these circumstances it is appropriate to report a highly liquid

713

See, e.g., J.P. Morgan Comment Letter (suggesting a breach would necessitate a report to the board);
SIFMA I Comment Letter (suggesting a “highly liquid asset target” and noting that “[i]nstances where a
fund dipped below its target percentage [could] be reported to the fund board with an explanation from
management as to why the fund dipped below its target and any resulting impact on the fund’s liquidity risk
profile”); Invesco Comment Letter; Dechert Comment Letter.

714

See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(iii)(A)(3).

221

investment minimum shortfall to the board within a shorter time frame. We are therefore
adopting the requirement for a fund to report to its board of directors within one business day if
its shortfall lasts longer than seven consecutive calendar days. Rule 22e-4 requires that this
accelerated reporting include an explanation of how the fund plans to restore the fund’s highly
liquid investment minimum within a “reasonable” period of time. Fund management generally
should take into account the fund’s level of liquidity risk, as well as the facts and circumstances
leading to the highly liquid investment minimum shortfall, in determining a reasonable time for
returning the fund’s assets that are highly liquid investments to the fund’s minimum level.
4. Periodic Review of Highly Liquid Investment Minimum
Rule 22e-4 requires a fund to periodically review, no less frequently than annually, the
fund’s highly liquid investment minimum. 715 The proposed rule also included a periodic review
requirement with respect to the proposed three-day liquid asset minimum, but instead of an
annual minimum review requirement, the proposed rule would have required that the periodic
review be conducted at least semi-annually. 716 We requested comment on this proposed review
requirement generally, including the proposed minimum frequency of a fund’s review. We
received few comments on the proposed review requirement separate from general comments on
the proposed three-day liquid asset minimum, although we received general support for a review
requirement concerning a fund’s target level of liquid assets. 717
We continue to believe, as discussed in the Proposing Release, that a periodic review is a

716

See proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iv)(B).

717

See, e.g., Oppenheimer Comment Letter.

222

central component of the highly liquid investment minimum requirement we are adopting. 718
Although we proposed a minimum semi-annual review requirement, we are adopting a minimum
annual review requirement primarily in order to correlate the minimum period for a fund’s highly
liquid investment minimum review with the minimum period in which a fund’s board would be
required to review a written report describing the adequacy of the fund’s liquidity risk
management program, as described in more detail below. 719 The minimum annual review period
also would correlate with the requirement for a fund to review its liquidity risk periodically, but
no less frequently than annually. 720 We believe that correlating the time periods for each review
requirement in rule 22e-4 will reduce compliance burdens and mitigate potential confusion that
could arise from disparate review periods.
We also do not believe that extending the highly liquid investment minimum review
period from a minimum of semi-annually to annually will adversely affect funds or investors as a
fund generally should review its highly liquid investment minimum more frequently if
circumstances warrant. Additionally, as discussed above, a fund’s board will be regularly
informed of any highly liquid investment minimum shortfalls. Thus, the board will be aware of
any liquidity risk management issues that might warrant reconsideration of the fund’s risk
management procedures or its highly liquid investment minimum.
Like the requirement for a fund to periodically review its liquidity risk, the highly liquid
investment minimum review requirement will permit each fund to develop and adopt its own
procedures for conducting this review, taking into account the fund’s particular facts and

223

circumstances. Additionally, we believe that in developing comprehensive review procedures, a
fund should generally consider including procedures for evaluating regulatory, market-wide, and
fund-specific developments affecting the fund’s liquidity risk. A fund also may wish to adopt
procedures specifying any circumstances that would prompt more frequent review of the fund’s
highly liquid investment minimum in addition to the annual minimum review required by the
rule (as well as the process for conducting more frequent reviews). 721
5. Exclusion for Funds Primarily Holding Assets that are Highly Liquid Investments
Rule 22e-4, as adopted, excludes a fund that primarily holds assets that are highly liquid
investments (a “primarily highly liquid fund”) from the requirements to determine and review a
highly liquid investment minimum, and to adopt shortfall policies and procedures. 722 We sought
comment in the Proposing Release about whether we should exclude certain funds from the
proposed three-day liquid asset minimum, such as funds that only invest in three-day liquid
assets. Commenters argued that a requirement for a fund to determine a minimum portion of
assets that it will invest in relatively liquid assets is not suitable for funds that primarily invest in
highly liquid investment classes, given that a significant portion of the fund’s portfolio would be
composed of such assets, and thus the benefits associated with the three-day liquid asset
minimum requirement would not justify the burdens. 723 After considering these comments and
721

See, e.g., supra footnote 273 and accompanying paragraph; see also supra section III.D.2.a.

722

See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(iii)(A).

723

See, e.g., FSR Comment Letter (“[T]he Commission should consider alternative regulatory approaches for
index funds that seek to track the performance of indices that are comprised of highly liquid assets….”);
Dechert Comment Letter (citing Statement on Open-End Fund Liquidity Risk Management Programs and
Swing Pricing, Commissioner Daniel M. Gallagher, Securities and Exchange Commission (Sept. 22, 2015)
(“Furthermore, for funds that invest solely in assets that can be settled in three days or less – for example, a
fund that limits its investments to equity securities of S&P 500 companies – the ‘three-day bucket’ has no
functional value. Requiring such a fund to set its three-day bucket – whether it be at 1%, or 20% or even
90% – would be a meaningless exercise given that the entire portfolio would be comprised of assets settled
in three days or less.”)).

224

reevaluating the costs and benefits of the proposal, we agree that a primarily highly liquid fund
should not be required to determine and review a highly liquid investment minimum, or adopt
shortfall policies and procedures. We agree with commenters that the benefits associated with
these requirements as applied to primarily highly liquid funds would not justify the associated
burdens. 724
Under rule 22e-4, a fund whose portfolio consists primarily of assets that are highly
liquid investments would be excluded from the highly liquid investment minimum
requirement. 725 Thus, we anticipate that a primarily highly liquid fund would address in its
liquidity risk management program how it determines that it primarily holds assets that are
highly liquid investments, including, for example, how it defines “primarily.” 726 If a fund were
to modify its investment strategy or encounter strategy “drift” such that it no longer primarily
held assets that were highly liquid investments, it would be required to adopt and review a highly
liquid investment minimum, as well as adopt and implement policies and procedures for
responding to a shortfall of the fund’s assets that are highly liquid investments below its
minimum. We therefore believe that if a fund’s investment strategy is such that it cannot
generally be predicted whether the fund would primarily hold assets that are highly liquid
investments (for example, if the strategy were to entail a significant amount of volatility in terms
of the fund’s portfolio liquidity), it would be difficult for the fund’s management to conclude that
724

For more discussion about the costs and burdens associated with the highly liquid investment minimum
requirement, see infra section IV.C.

725

See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(iii)(A). Money market funds and In-Kind ETFs also would be excluded from the
highly liquid investment minimum requirement. See rule 22e-4(a)(5) (defining “fund,” for purposes of the
rule as excluding money market funds and In-Kind ETFs).

726

As noted by commenters, a highly liquid index fund would be one example of a fund whose portfolio
consists primarily (in the case of these index funds, almost entirely) of assets that are highly liquid
investments. See supra footnote 723. In our view, if a fund held less than 50% of its assets in highly liquid
investments it would be unlikely to qualify as “primarily” holding assets that are highly liquid investments.

225

the fund should appropriately be excluded from the highly liquid investment minimum
requirement.
For purposes of determining whether a fund primarily holds assets that are highly liquid
investments, a fund must exclude from its calculations the percentage of the fund’s assets that are
highly liquid investments that it has segregated to cover derivatives transactions that the fund has
classified as moderately liquid investments, less liquid investments, and illiquid investments, or
pledged to satisfy margin requirements in connection with those derivatives transactions, as
determined pursuant to rule 22e-4(b)(1)(ii)(C). 727 As discussed above, when a fund’s assets are
segregated or pledged in connection with derivatives transactions, they may not be immediately
available for liquidity risk management purposes. 728 Thus, a fund whose assets that are highly
liquid investments that are segregated or pledged in connection with derivatives transactions may
not have the same level of liquidity risk management flexibility as a fund whose assets are highly
liquid investments that are not similarly segregated or pledged. While we believe that the
benefits associated with the highly liquid investment minimum requirements as applied to
primarily highly liquid funds would not justify associated burdens, 729 we believe that this
consideration is appropriate only to the extent a fund primarily holds assets that are highly liquid
investments that are not segregated or pledged in connection with derivatives transactions. As an
extreme example, if a fund were to hold only assets that were highly liquid investments that were

727

Rule 22e-4(b)(1)(iii)(B). As described above, a fund would be permitted to exclude its derivatives
transactions that are classified as highly liquid investments in determining the percentage of highly liquid
investments that are segregated or pledged assets because, since the fund could dispose of or exit these
derivatives transactions within three business days, the associated segregated or pledged assets also would
be available to the fund for liquidity risk management purposes within three business days. See supra text
following footnote 493.

728

See supra section III.C.3.c.

729

See supra footnote 724 and accompanying text.

226

segregated or pledged in connection with derivatives transactions and that were not themselves
classified as highly liquid investments, none of its assets that were highly liquid investments
would be available to meet redemptions or otherwise manage liquidity risk. Thus, we believe
that such fund’s assets that were highly liquid investments would likely not be commensurate
with its liquidity risk profile as determined with reference to the liquidity risk factors it would be
required to consider under rule 22e-4. 730
6. Highly Liquid Investment Minimum Reporting and Disclosure Requirements
We proposed to amend Form N-PORT to add a new item that would require each fund to
disclose its three-day liquid asset minimum, as such term was proposed to be defined in proposed
rule 22e-4. One commenter supported reporting the three-day liquid asset minimum in a
structured data format to the public as proposed. 731 Certain other commenters supported
reporting the three-day liquid asset minimum in a structured data format as proposed but to the
Commission only. 732 One commenter did not support public disclosure of a fund’s three-day
liquid asset minimum, as proposed, but said it would support public disclosure of a fund’s threeday liquid asset minimum if the Commission adopted a recommended alternative to such
definition. 733
Some commenters, however, opposed public disclosure of both the three-day liquid asset
minimum as proposed and recommended alternatives to the three-day liquid asset minimum.

730

See supra section III.D.2 (discussing the rule 22e-4 requirement for a fund to consider certain liquidity risk
factors in determining its highly liquid investment minimum).

program will be particularly helpful to investors, as will disclosure of a fund’s overall liquidity picture and
a fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum).

732

See, e.g., CFA Comment Letter; Voya Comment Letter.

733

See Vanguard Comment Letter.

227

Commenters expressed concerns that public disclosure could be misleading to investors, arguing
that any minimum reported on Form N-PORT would be subjective, presented without context,
and may not reflect a fund’s actual portfolio management approach at the time the data is being
relied upon by investors. 734 Other commenters contended that public disclosure could interfere
with a fund’s investment strategy and promote unwarranted, and potentially destabilizing,
redemption activity by fund shareholders, especially during times of stress. 735 One commenter
stated that public disclosure of a liquidity minimum would also give undue emphasis to a single
element of a fund’s liquidity risk management program and could potentially encourage third
parties to use a single numerical figure as a basis for comparing funds, further encouraging
undue reliance on the liquidity minimum figure by investors. 736 Certain other commenters
expressed concern that public disclosure could potentially expose a fund to predatory trading
activity if the fund is seen as vulnerable to liquidity risks or is under stress. 737 In addition, one
commenter contended that comparisons of three-day liquid asset minimums could result in
competitive pressures for relatively uniform minimums among funds with similar investment
strategies, ultimately harming fund investors. 738
We are persuaded by some of the concerns expressed by commenters regarding the
potential risks to funds and fund investors of public reporting of a fund’s three-day liquid asset
minimum, as proposed, or any alternative formulation, including a fund’s highly liquid
investment minimum, as adopted today. In response to comments, we are adopting amendments

Comment Letter.

to require a fund to report its highly liquid investment minimum on Form N-PORT to the
Commission on a non-public basis. 739 We believe that the requirement that a fund report to its
board when the fund’s assets that are highly liquid investments fall below the fund’s highly
liquid investment minimum, discussed above, is a more appropriate tool to assist fund boards in
their oversight of fund liquidity risks, thereby ultimately protecting shareholder interests in the
fund. 740
In light of the changes we are making to the way the highly liquid investment minimum
is established, the final modifications to Form N-PORT require that if a fund’s minimum has
changed during the reporting period, any prior minimums established by the fund during the
reporting period also be reported. 741 Because, as discussed previously, we are not requiring the
fund’s board to approve changes to the highly liquid asset minimum, we believe it is important
that any changes to the minimum during a reporting period be included in Form N-PORT to help
mitigate the possibility of window dressing a fund’s highly liquid asset minimum at the end of
the reporting period, and allow us to monitor for changes to a fund’s minimum. In addition,
considering the changes we have made to the way the minimum works from the proposal, and
consistent with the board and Commission reporting requirements we are adopting relating to
shortfalls of a fund’s minimum, the final amendments to Form N-PORT also require that if a
fund is below its minimum during the reporting period, a fund needs to report the number of days
it is below its minimum during the reporting period. 742 We believe that this reporting
requirement will enhance our monitoring of fund’s compliance with the minimum and the board

and Commission reporting requirements contained elsewhere in rule 22e-4. These additional
reporting requirements also would be non-public, for the same reasons discussed above.
Overall, we believe that such board oversight together with confidential reporting to the
Commission is a regulatory approach that balances commenters’ concerns about certain adverse
effects that could arise from public reporting of liquid investment minimums with the need for
enhanced investor protections and meaningful information for Commission regulatory oversight
responsibilities. We believe that it is neither necessary nor appropriate in the public interest or
for the protection of investors to make information regarding a fund’s highly liquid investment
minimum publicly available at this time. 743
E.

Limitation on Funds’ Illiquid Investments
Rule 22e-4 includes a limit on a fund’s ability to acquire illiquid investments.

Specifically, the rule prohibits a fund from acquiring any illiquid investment if, immediately
after the acquisition, the fund would have invested more than 15% of its net assets in illiquid
investments that are assets. 744 The rule’s 15% limit on funds’ illiquid investments applies to all
funds (including In-Kind ETFs). 745 Additionally, as discussed below, a fund will be required to
notify its board, and confidentially the Commission, when its illiquid investments that are assets
exceed 15% of its net assets. Moreover, the person(s) designated to administer the liquidity risk

743

See section 45 of the Act, which provides, in summary, that the information contained in any report or other
document filed with the Commission pursuant to the Act shall be made available to the public, unless by
rules and regulations upon its own motion, or by order upon application, the Commission finds that public
disclosure is “neither necessary nor appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.”

744

Rule 22e-4(b)(1)(iv). Rule 22e-4(b)(1)(iv) refers to investments that are “assets” to make clear that the
15% limit on illiquid investments applies to investments with positive values. Illiquid investments that
have negative values should not be netted against illiquid investments that have positive values when
calculating compliance with the 15% limit. Thus, only illiquid investments that have positive values (i.e.,
“assets”) should be used in the numerator.

745

See id.; see also rule 22e-4(a)(5) and (9) (defining the terms “fund” and “In-Kind ETF” for purposes of the
rule).

230

management program must explain in a report to the board the extent and causes of the
occurrence, and how the fund plans to bring its illiquid investments that are assets to or below
15% of its net assets within a reasonable period of time. 746 If the amount of the fund’s illiquid
investments that are assets is still above 15% of its net assets 30 days from the occurrence (and at
each consecutive 30 day period thereafter), the board of directors, including a majority of its
independent directors, 747 must assess whether the plan presented to it continues to be in the best
interest of the fund.
The limitation on funds’ illiquid investments is similar to the limitation on “15% standard
assets” in proposed rule 22e-4, 748 in that both requirements would limit the acquisition of assets
that cannot be sold or disposed of within seven days. However, there are several key differences
between the proposed and adopted requirements. Specifically, the proposed rule would have had
a fund identify 15% standard assets in a process separate from the requirement to classify
portfolio assets’ liquidity, whereas rule 22e-4 as adopted today generally incorporates
classification of portfolio investments as illiquid into the process for classifying the liquidity of a
fund’s portfolio investments generally. As discussed in sections III.C.1.b and III.C.3.b above, a
746

Rule 22e-4(b)(1)(iv)(A).

747

“Independent directors” as used herein refers to directors who are not “interested persons” of a fund or InKind ETF, as applicable, as that term is defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act.

748

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at section III.C.4. Under the proposed rule, “15% standard asset”
was defined as “an asset that may not be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business within seven
calendar days at approximately the value ascribed to it by the fund.” Proposed rule 22e-4(a)(4). For
purposes of this definition, a fund would not have needed to consider the size of the fund’s position in the
asset or the number of days associated with receipt of proceeds of sale or disposition of the asset. Id.
We note that, as proposed, the text of rule 22e-4 would have limited the acquisition of 15% standard assets
if, immediately after the acquisition, the fund would have invested more than 15% of its total assets (as
opposed to net assets) in 15% standard assets. See proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iv)(D). This reference to
“total assets” in the proposed rule text was intended to read “net assets,” as was evident in the discussion of
this rule provision in Proposing Release, section III.C.4 (and elsewhere in the Proposing Release), which
consistently discussed the provision as limiting a fund’s acquisition of 15% standard assets if, immediately
after the acquisition, the fund would have invested more than 15% of its net assets in 15% standard assets.
Rule 22e-4 as adopted refers to “net assets” instead of “total assets.”

231

fund is required to take into account “relevant market, trading, and investment-specific
considerations,” and also is required to consider market depth, in classifying an investment as
illiquid. Also as discussed above in section III.C.2.d, rule 22e-4 incorporates a modified value
impact standard in the definition of “illiquid investment” from the value impact standard
reflected in the proposed definition of “15% standard asset.”
The majority of commenters supported the codification of the Commission’s 15%
guideline as proposed. Many commenters stated that the 15% guideline is an important investor
protection measure and posited that the guideline has proven to be a highly effective safeguard
against liquidity risk. 749 One commenter specifically noted that assets of open-end funds should
be predominantly liquid and replacing the guideline with a formal regulatory mandate would
promote investor protection. 750 Another commenter viewed the 15% guideline as a clear
safeguard against liquidity risk that has the benefits of simplicity, clarity, and easy
administration. 751 One commenter stated that setting reasonable controls on, and monitoring the
use of, illiquid asset classes to ensure that they do not compromise the liquidity offered to
investors within the fund is an important element of properly managing open-end funds. 752
Finally, one commenter suggested that the proposed codification of the 15% guideline would
both increase the likelihood that funds hold adequate liquid assets to meet redemption requests
without significant dilution and increase the likelihood that a fund’s portfolio is not concentrated

in assets whose liquidity is limited.753
In addition, several commenters supported a limit on the amount of illiquid assets that
can be held by a fund generally, but suggested alternatives to how the 15% standard would
operate or the proposed definition of 15% standard assets. 754 In fact, most commenters who
expressed concerns regarding the proposed 15% limit did so in the context of suggesting
alternatives to the proposal or the proposed definition of “15% standard asset.” Multiple
commenters who discussed the proposed limit suggested that the Commission should harmonize
its codification of the existing 15% guideline with the proposed requirement for a fund to
classify the liquidity of its portfolio assets generally (i.e., they suggested that illiquid assets be
the least liquid classification category). 755 Some commenters suggested that any limit on illiquid
assets should not just limit the acquisition of illiquid assets, but also should require the fund to
adjust its portfolio if it exceeds the 15% limit. 756 Finally, some commenters suggested that a
fund be required to notify its board and the Commission if it exceeds the 15% limit. 757 All other
comments on the proposed limit were comments regarding the definition of “15% standard
asset” and are discussed above in section III.C.2.d.
We agree with commenters who stated that codifying a limit on funds’ illiquid
investments should be a central element of managing open-end funds’ liquidity risk, which in
753

See CRMC Comment Letter.

754

See, e.g., AFR Comment Letter; Blackrock Comment Letter; Keefer Comment Letter; Wahh Comment
Letter. In general, the comments we received on the 15% standard did not specifically address the amount
of the limit; cf. footnote 761 and accompanying text.

Comment Letter.

See, e.g., Fidelity Comment Letter; Keefer Comment Letter; Wahh Comment Letter. But see HSBC
Comment Letter (arguing that imposing a fixed time period in which holdings above the 15% threshold
must be divested would not be appropriate because it may force sales at depressed prices to the detriment of
investors).

turn would further the protection of investors. While we believe that the highly liquid
investment minimum requirement will increase the likelihood that each fund holds adequate
liquid assets to meet redemption requests without significant dilution of remaining investors’
interests in the fund, the limit on illiquid investments also should increase the likelihood that a
fund’s portfolio is not concentrated in investments whose liquidity is extremely limited, and thus
will serve as an across-the-board limit on fund illiquidity. As discussed above, the Commission
and staff have in the past provided guidance in connection with the 15% guideline. Today we
are withdrawing this guidance along with the 15% guideline and replacing it with new
requirements for determining that an investment is illiquid, as well as new guidance in this
Release regarding these requirements. We believe that the limit on illiquid investments that are
assets that we are adopting, together with the new definition of “illiquid investments” that
encompasses additional elements for determining that an investment is illiquid, 758 provides a
more comprehensive framework for funds to evaluate the liquidity of their investments.
We also agree, as discussed in more detail in section III.C.2.d above, that it is appropriate
to harmonize the rule 22e-4 limit on illiquid investments with the rule’s broader liquidity
classification requirement by incorporating an illiquid investment category into the classification
requirement. We believe that this harmonization will reduce confusion that could arise if we
were to adopt requirements for identifying illiquid investments that differed from the
requirements for classifying the liquidity of investments that are not illiquid. 759 Additionally, we
believe the harmonization responds to commenter concerns that, in practice, many funds believe
very few of their portfolio investments are subject to the 15% limit on illiquid securities, since
758

See supra section III.C.2.d.

234

funds will be required to take into account “relevant market, trading, and investment-specific
considerations” in identifying illiquid investments and incorporate market depth considerations
as part of the rule’s liquidity classification requirement. 760 A fund also will be required to
consider a modified value impact standard in determining if an investment is illiquid, which as
discussed above, we believe will help funds make more accurate liquidity assessments,
particularly for asset classes or investments that are subject to intra-day price volatility.
One commenter suggested that, if the Commission adopts requirements that would
expand the set of assets that is subject to the 15% limit on illiquid assets, it could consider
extending the limit beyond 15%, or extending the time-to-sale period associated with the
definition of “illiquid asset” beyond seven days, in order to limit market disruptions. 761 We have
considered this suggestion and have decided that it is not necessary. 762 We continue to believe
that 15% is an appropriate limit on illiquid investments that are assets. The compliance period
we are adopting for rule 22e-4 will permit funds to come into compliance with the revised 15%
illiquid investment limit while minimizing market disruptions. 763
In the proposal, we requested comment as to whether we should require a fund to divest
its assets in excess of the 15% limit or whether we should limit the time period in which a fund
can exceed the 15% limit. As noted above, some commenters suggested that the 15% limit
should be a maintenance test, rather than an acquisition test, requiring the fund to adjust its
portfolio if it exceeds the 15% limit. 764 Another commenter argued that imposing a fixed time

762

As noted above, no other commenters specifically addressed the amount of the limit.

235

period in which holdings above the 15% threshold must be divested would not be appropriate
because it may force sales at depressed prices to the detriment of investors. 765 In addition, one
commenter noted the importance of ensuring oversight once a fund breaches the 15% limit and
that efforts are made to reduce the fund’s illiquid asset holdings (when possible). 766
We believe that requiring a fund to divest illiquid investments if the fund’s holdings of
illiquid investments that are assets exceed 15% of net assets—which, as suggested by a
commenter, could result in the fund needing to sell the illiquid investments at prices that
incorporate a significant discount to the investments’ stated value, or even at fire sale prices—
could adversely affect shareholders and could potentially negate the liquidity risk management
benefits of the illiquid investment limit. Therefore, under the final rule, a fund will be prohibited
from acquiring any illiquid investment if, immediately after the acquisition, its illiquid
investments that are assets would exceed 15% of its net assets. 767
We further believe, however, that a fund should not be permitted to exceed the 15% limit
on illiquid investments for an extended period of time without board oversight. Therefore,
because we believe that if a fund’s illiquid investments that are assets exceed the 15% limit it
could indicate that the fund is encountering harmful liquidity pressures, the final rule requires, as
suggested by commenters, 768 that a fund promptly report such occurrence to its board and the
765

See HSBC Comment Letter.

766

See BlackRock Comment Letter; cf. PIMCO Comment Letter (suggesting that, with respect to the proposed
three day liquid asset minimum, if a fund breaches the minimum, its manager should be afforded a
reasonable period of time to reposition the portfolio).

767

We recognize that some index funds currently implement their strategies by using a full replication
technique – i.e., by investing in all of the component securities of an index. To the extent an index tracked
by an index fund would require a fund using a full replication technique to invest more than 15% of its net
assets in illiquid investments that are assets, such fund could not make those investments and would need to
consider whether it should continue to seek to track the performance of such index or whether it should use
a different investment technique, such as sampling, to track the index.

768

See supra footnote 757.

236

Commission.769 Specifically, the final rule requires funds that hold more than 15% of their net
assets in illiquid investments that are assets to report such an occurrence to their boards of
directors within one business day, including an explanation of the extent and causes of the
occurrence and how they plan to bring their illiquid investments that are assets to or below 15%
of their net assets within a reasonable period of time. 770 We also anticipate that if a fund exceeds
the 15% limit on illiquid investments that are assets at any point during the year, the written
report to the board of directors regarding the adequacy and effectiveness of the liquidity risk
management program would discuss the breach of the limit and, if the fund is still breaching the
15% limit at the time of the report, the plan to bring the fund’s illiquid investments that are assets
to or below 15% of its net assets within a reasonable period of time. 771 In addition, if the amount
of the fund’s illiquid investments that are assets is still above 15% of its net assets 30 days from
the occurrence (and at each consecutive 30 day period thereafter), the fund’s board of directors,
including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the fund, must assess whether
the plan presented to it, as described above, continues to be in the best interest of the fund or in
kind ETF. 772 We believe these requirements appropriately balance our concerns regarding the
overall liquidity of the fund’s portfolio with the potential adverse effects that the forced sale of
illiquid investments could have on a fund and its shareholders. These requirements should not
result in funds selling their illiquid investments at fire sale prices or at inopportune times because
such a sale would likely not be in the best interests of a fund and its shareholders. However, we

believe that board oversight is important when a fund’s illiquid investments exceed 15% of its
net assets for an extended period of time.
We acknowledge that requiring a board assessment of the appropriateness of the fund’s
plan to decrease its level of illiquid investments every 30 days a fund holds illiquid assets in
excess of 15% of its net assets may impose burdens on boards and funds. Nonetheless, we
believe that such a requirement is appropriate in light of the serious consequences that can result
when a fund’s liquidity becomes impaired or further deteriorates, particularly for extended
periods of time. 773 We expect that this requirement will appropriately focus boards and funds on
resolving liquidity impairments in a reasonable period of time and in the best interests of the
fund and its shareholders. In light of the risks attendant in holding larger proportions of illiquid
investments, we believe it is important that the board is provided sufficient information and
regular updates so that it can make an informed judgment. Accordingly, we believe this periodic
reassessment requirement in the rule is appropriate.
Additionally, as discussed in section III.M.2 below, a fund will be required to
confidentially notify the Commission when its illiquid investments that are assets exceed 15% of
its net assets. As discussed below, reporting of this information will assist Commission staff in
its monitoring efforts of liquidity, including monitoring not only the reporting fund but also
funds that may have comparable characteristics to the reporting fund and may be similarly
affected by market events. The percentage of the fund’s holdings invested in illiquid
investments that are assets also will be disclosed on Form N-PORT to the public on a quarterly
basis, with a 60-day delay, as discussed in section III.C.6 above, which will lead to increased
transparency of the fund’s profile regarding holdings of illiquid investments at particular points

Policies and Procedures Regarding Redemptions in Kind
Many funds reserve the right to redeem their shares in-kind instead of with cash. 774

Mutual funds that reserve the right to redeem in kind may use such redemptions to manage
liquidity risk under exceptional circumstances. 775 While many funds disclose that they have
reserved the right to redeem in kind, most funds often consider redemptions in kind to be a last
resort or emergency measure, and thus many do not have specific policies or procedures in place
governing such in-kind redemptions. 776 Like the proposal, the final rule requires a fund that
engages in or reserves the right to engage in in-kind redemptions to adopt and implement written
policies and procedures regarding in-kind redemptions as part of the management of its liquidity
risk. 777 These policies and procedures generally should address the process for redeeming in
kind, as well as the circumstances under which the fund would consider redeeming in kind.
Multiple commenters welcomed efforts by the Commission to facilitate funds’ ability to
use redemptions in kind and stated that they considered redemptions in kind an important
774

See, e.g., Rule 18f-1 and Form N-18F-1 Adopting Release, supra footnote 24 (stating that the definition of
“redeemable security” in section 2(a)(32) of the Investment Company Act “has traditionally been
interpreted as giving the issuer the option of redeeming its securities in cash or in kind.”).

775

See Karen Damato, ‘Redemptions in Kind’ Become Effective for Tax Management, Wall Street Journal
(Mar. 10, 1999), available at http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB921028092685519084 (“‘Redemptions in
kind’ are typically viewed by fund managers as an emergency measure, a step they could take to meet
massive redemptions in the midst of a market meltdown.”). Besides using in-kind redemptions as an
emergency measure to manage liquidity risk, funds may also use in-kind redemptions for other reasons.
For example, funds may wish to redeem certain investors (particularly, large, institutional investors) in
kind, because in-kind redemptions could have a lower tax impact on the fund than selling portfolio
securities in order to pay redemptions in cash. This, in turn, could benefit the remaining shareholders in the
fund. See, e.g., id. (“If a fund has to sell appreciated stocks to pay a redeeming shareholder, it realizes
capital gains. Unless the fund has offsetting capital losses, those gains are distributed as taxable income to
all remaining fund holders. By contrast, when funds distribute stocks from their portfolios, there is no tax
event for the continuing holders.”).

liquidity risk management tool for allocating the cost of selling securities to meet redemptions to
redeeming investors. 778 These commenters also generally agreed that as part of a fund’s
management of its liquidity risk, a fund should adopt and implement written policies and
procedures regarding in-kind redemptions. 779 Commenters noted that there are often logistical
issues associated with paying in-kind redemptions, and that this limits the availability of in-kind
redemptions under many circumstances. 780 Commenters also noted that some shareholders are
generally unable or unwilling to receive in-kind redemptions, which may limit its utility. 781
These commenters agreed that requiring funds to implement policies and procedures on in-kind
redemptions in advance would promote a focus on addressing any legal or operations issues
before the fund’s use of redemptions in kind, thus making such redemptions a more practical and
effective liquidity management tool. 782
Commenters also suggested that the Commission provide guidance on the appropriate use
of in-kind redemptions for funds. 783 We expect that effective fund policies and procedures on inkind redemptions would contemplate a variety of issues and circumstances. Well-designed
policies and procedures would likely address the particular circumstances in which a fund might
employ in-kind redemptions, for example, detailing whether a fund would use in-kind

redemptions at all times, or only under stress, and what types of events may lead the fund to use
them. Such policies and procedures would also likely address whether a fund would use in-kind
redemptions for all redemption requests or only for requests over a certain size. 784
Funds may also wish to consider having policies and procedures that address the ability
of investors to receive in-kind redemptions, potentially including different procedures for
different shareholder types. For example, the policies and procedures might provide that retail
shareholders (who may not be operationally equipped to receive in-kind redemptions) may be
provided cash redemptions, but that institutional investors who may be able to receive such
securities, would be paid out in-kind under certain circumstances. These procedures may also
consider whether holdings through omnibus accounts pose any unique issues that should be
addressed. Well-designed policies and procedures would likely also address potential
operational issues with providing in-kind redemptions to various kinds of investors, and plan out
methods for addressing such operational issues. These might include notifying large
shareholders that may be subject to redemptions in kind and setting up securities transfer
processes for those shareholders in advance.
Effective policies and procedures would also likely address how the fund would
determine which securities it would use in an in-kind redemption (for example would it use
illiquid or restricted securities), or whether it plans to redeem securities in kind as a pro rata ratio
of the fund’s securities holdings, or whether it would redeem in a non-pro rata manner. For a
fund that redeems pro rata, policies and procedures might address how the fund plans in-kind
redemptions of odd lots or small lots of securities, and if a fund were to do such odd lot

One commenter suggested that fund sponsors should consider redemptions in kind if withdrawal requests
exceed a certain percentage of a fund’s total assets. See BlackRock Comment Letter.

transactions, how to process such transactions. They may also consider how they would
accomplish in-kind redemptions of illiquid securities or securities that have restrictions on their
transferability, and the extent to which these securities would not be redeemed in kind.
If a fund chooses not to redeem in a pro rata manner, effective policies and procedures
would likely address that securities redeemed are selected and distributed in a manner that is fair
and does not disadvantage either the redeeming shareholder or the remaining investors in the
fund. We caution that if a fund redeems an investor’s interests in a fund by transferring an
unrepresentative set of securities to the investor, this may raise questions of shareholder
discrimination and unfairness (as well as potentially cherry picking and favoritism), which
should be addressed in the fund’s policies and procedures. For example, policies and procedures
could address how to ensure that any securities that are redeemed in kind in a non-pro rata
manner are valued properly, to ensure that the securities transferred represent the proportionate
share of the fund NAV. 785 They might also address how the fund would determine that
shareholders are treated fairly, and are not redeemed with securities the fund deems undesirable
or securities that have significant tax consequences. Relatedly, the policies and procedures may
also address how the fund evaluates the tax consequences to the fund and the redeeming
shareholder of distributing certain securities, for example, whether distributing certain securities
that have significant capital gains or losses built in would have inequitable results.
Because the management and personnel capacity of funds facing heavy redemptions and
other liquidity stresses will likely be strained as funds attempt to manage these pressures, the
Commission believes that requiring funds to have policies and procedures dictating how fund’s
785

See section 2(a)(32) (definition of redeemable security). Such a transaction may have significant negative
consequences to the redeeming recipient, particularly if the security provided was fair valued improperly,
was restricted, or was in other ways impaired.

242

will implement in-kind redemptions will increase the likelihood that in-kind redemptions will be
a feasible risk management tool, and may address any potential fund or shareholder inequities.
Accordingly, we are adopting this requirement largely as proposed. 786
G.

Cross-Trades
Today, under rule 17a-7, funds may make certain affiliated securities transactions

between funds and certain affiliates (“cross trades”), provided they meet certain protective
conditions. 787 _bookmark41 Rule 17a-7 includes conditions that limit the portfolio assets that
may be cross-traded, and, as discussed below, cross-trades involving certain less liquid assets
may not be eligible to rely on the rule. As discussed in the Proposing Release, some funds
may consider engaging in cross-trades to be a useful liquidity risk management tool. Crosstrading can benefit funds and their shareholders by allowing funds that are mutually
interested in a securities transaction that is consistent with the investment strategies of each
fund to conduct the transaction without incurring transaction costs and without generating a
market impact. 788 However, cross-trades also have significant potential for abuse. For
example, as the Commission has previously stated, “an unscrupulous investment adviser
might ‘dump’ undesirable securities on a registered investment company or transfer desirable
786

The rule text has been slightly modified to make clear that redemption in kind policies and procedures must
address not just how the fund will engage in redemptions in kind, but also when it will do so. Rule 22e4(b)(1)(v).

787

Section 17 of the Act restricts transactions between an “affiliated person of a registered investment
company or an affiliated person of such affiliated person” and that investment company—for example,
transactions between a fund and another fund managed by the same adviser. A fund must therefore obtain
exemptive relief from the Commission before entering into purchase or sale transactions with an affiliated
fund, or execute such transactions subject to the provisions of rule 17a-7 under the Investment Company
Act (permitting purchase and sale transactions among affiliated funds and other accounts, under certain
circumstances).

788

As noted above, rule 17a-7 requires that each cross-trade be consistent with the policy of each fund
participating in the transaction and that no brokerage commissions, fees or other remuneration be paid in
connection with the transaction. Because cross-trades are conducted privately between funds, they are not
transparent to market trading reporting systems and thus are unlikely to generate a market impact.

243

securities from a registered investment company to another more favored advisory client in
the complex. Moreover the transaction could be effected at a price which is disadvantageous
to the registered investment company.” 789 Cross-trade transactions also may be inconsistent
with the investment objectives, investment strategies, or risk profiles of participating
investment companies and other advisory clients. 790
Accordingly, rule 17a-7 requires that any cross-trades satisfy certain conditions
designed to prevent such abuses, including the requirement that market quotations be readily
available for each traded security and that if the security is only traded over the counter, the
cross-trade be conducted at the average of the highest current independent bid and lowest
current independent offer determined on the basis of reasonable inquiry. 791 _bookmark44 In
requiring market quotations for cross-traded securities, the Commission has stated that
“[r]eliance upon such market quotations provides an independent basis for determining that
the terms of the transaction are fair and reasonable to each participating investment company
or other advisory client and do not involve overreaching.” 792 Rule 17a-7 also requires that a
cross-trade transaction be “consistent with the policy of each registered investment company

790

A fund that provided a non-pro rata distribution of cash, securities or other property to a shareholder that
owns 5% or more of the fund and/or gives any election to the shareholder about which assets to receive
may also raise affiliated transaction concerns under section 17(a) and rule 17a-5, as such a transaction
would fall outside the exemption provided by rule 17a-5 and thus might be viewed as a sale to or purchase
from the fund by an affiliated person.

available because these conditions increase the potential for abuse through cross-trades. See id.

and separate series of a registered investment company participating in the transaction, as
recited in its registration statement and reports filed under the Act.” 793_bookmark45
We noted in the Proposing Release that less liquid assets are less likely to satisfy
rule 17a-7 than highly liquid investments. 794 Some commenters expressed concern that this
assertion would prohibit funds from, or create a presumption against, cross-trading any
assets deemed less liquid, 795 or directly incorporate liquidity classification decisions into rule
17a-7 eligibility determinations. 796 One commenter, disagreeing with the assertion that less
liquid assets are less likely to satisfy rule 17a-7 than highly liquid assets, stated “a less
actively traded security may be less liquid, but nonetheless have readily available market
quotations, and a fund may determine that independent bid and offer prices are available in
the market. The relative illiquidity of the security itself will not alone be determinative of
whether prices are available for Rule 17a-7 purposes.” 797
We note that less liquid assets, by definition, are less likely to trade in highly active
markets that produce readily available market quotations, which may make it more difficult
to ensure that the terms of a cross-trade transaction are fair and reasonable to each
participating investment company or other advisory client and do not involve overreaching.
As one commenter noted, “rule 17a-7 broadly requires the availability of accurate valuation
information with respect to any security proposed to be traded from one adviser-directed

account to another. This effectively requires such securities to be relatively liquid.” 798
Moreover, the absence of highly active markets for less liquid assets may exacerbate the
concern discussed above relating to “dumping” undesirable securities, because limited
markets for such assets indicates that there are fewer alternate options for disposing of the
assets. Similarly, the absence of highly active markets for less liquid assets may exacerbate
the concern relating to a transfer of assets that is inconsistent with the investment objective,
investment strategies, or risk profile of each participating investment company or other
advisory client.
We agree that an assessment of an asset’s liquidity, without more, would not determine
whether the asset is eligible for a cross-trade transaction under rule 17a-7. However, as noted
above, we believe that any assets used in a cross-trade transaction should be scrutinized to
ensure that they satisfy all of rule 17a-7’s requirements. Due to the particular risks associated
with cross-trading less liquid assets, it may be prudent for advisers to subject less liquid assets
to careful review (and potentially even a heightened review compared to other more liquid
assets) before engaging in such transactions.
We note that cross trading also implicates a fund’s adviser’s duty to seek best execution
for each fund or other advisory client, as well as its duty of loyalty to each fund or other
advisory client. 799_bookmark47 An adviser should not cause funds or other clients to enter
into a cross-trade unless doing so would be in the best interests of each fund or other client

798

See id.

799

See, e.g., In re Western Asset Management Co., Investment Company Act Release No. 30893 (Jan. 27,
2014) (settled action) (stating that the adviser to funds and other advisory clients engaging in cross-trading
“has a fiduciary duty of loyalty to its clients and also must seek to obtain best execution for both its buying
and selling clients” and finding that the adviser aided and abetted and caused violations of section 17(a) and
violated Advisers Act section 206).

246

participating in the transaction. Advisers should be particularly sensitive to the possibility of
heightened conflicts when one or both of the clients is experiencing stress at the time of
consideration of a cross trade.
Under rule 38a-1, a fund’s compliance policies and procedures related to rule 17a-7
generally should contemplate how the fund meets the rule’s requirements with regard to less
liquid assets. For example, as part of these policies and procedures, a fund might consider
conducting a review of less liquid assets before cross-trading them to ensure that “market
quotations are readily available,” that a “current market price” is available, that the
transaction is in line with each participating investment company’s or other advisory
client’s investment objective, investment strategies and risk profile, and that the cross-trade
satisfies all other requirements set forth in rule 17a-7. Reasonably designed policies and
procedures thus would likely specifically address how a fund would determine that such
less liquid securities are appropriately used when meeting the requirements of rule 17a-7.
The specific review of a less liquid asset would likely vary depending on the characteristics
of the market or markets in which the asset transacts, the characteristics of the asset itself,
and the nature of the funds potentially involved in the cross trade.
In crafting policies and procedures reasonably designed to address the particular risks
of cross-trading less liquid assets, a fund could consider specifying the sources of the readily
available market quotations to be used to value the assets and establish specific criteria for
determining whether market quotations are current and readily available, and include potential
back-up sources if the primary sources are not available. Funds should consider including in
their policies and procedures periodic reviews of the continuing appropriateness of those
sources of readily available market quotations.
247

In addition, a fund’s policies and procedures might also provide for assessing the
quality of quotations provided by dealers. The quality of dealer quotations may vary
depending upon, among other things, the extent to which a dealer makes a market in or retains
an inventory in the particular security, or in similar securities, such that the dealer maintains
an awareness of changes in market factors affecting the value of the security. 800 “Indications
of interest” and “accommodation quotes,” may not necessarily reflect the current market
values of the securities and thus are not “market quotations” or “market values” for the
purposes of rule 17a-7. 801
In addition, reasonably designed policies and procedures likely would also include
compliance monitoring to help ensure that the investment objective, investment strategies and
risk profile of each participating investment company or other advisory client are scrutinized
in conjunction with the characteristics of any cross-traded asset to evaluate whether the asset
transfer is not in line with any objective or strategy or inappropriately shifts risk from one
investment company or other advisory client to another. Whether a cross-trade is in the best
interest of an investment company or other client purchasing an asset may depend, in part, on
the relative liquidity of the purchaser’s existing portfolio assets and the level of redemptions
that may be reasonably anticipated by the purchaser.
800

Dealers do not necessarily purport to provide quotations for securities that reflect their current market
values. Some dealers may provide only “indications of interest,” i.e., non-firm expressions of interest to
trade that do not constitute quotations or “accommodation quotes”. See, e.g., Regulation NMS, Securities
Exchange Act Release No. 49325 (Feb. 26, 2004) [69 FR 11126 (Mar. 9, 2004)], at n.257. Cf. Rules
600(b)(8) and (62) under Regulation NMS [17 CFR 242.600(b)(8) and 242.600(b)(62)] (defining “bid or
offer” as “the bid price or the offer price communicated by a member of a national securities exchange or
member of a national securities association to any broker or dealer, or to any customer, at which it is
willing to buy or sell one or more round lots of an NMS security, as either principal or agent, but shall not
include indications of interest,” and defining “quotation” as “a bid or an offer”).

801

available market quotations. See 2014 Money Market Fund Reform Adopting Release, supra footnote 43,

H.

Board Approval and Designation of Program Administrative Responsibilities
Directors, and particularly independent directors, play a critical role in overseeing fund

operations, although they generally may delegate day-to-day management to a fund’s adviser. 802
As discussed below, we are adopting as proposed the requirement for a fund’s board of directors
to approve the investment adviser, officer, or officers who are responsible for administering the
program and to approve the fund’s written liquidity risk management program. However, in a
change from the proposal, the board will not be required to specifically approve the fund’s highly
liquid investment minimum (except in the limited circumstances that a fund below its minimum
seeks to change it) or to approve material changes to the program. Instead, similar to rule 38a-1,
the board will be required to review, no less than annually, a written report prepared by the
investment adviser, officer, or officers designated to administer the liquidity risk management
program that describes a review of the program’s adequacy and effectiveness, including, if
applicable, the operation of the highly liquid investment minimum, and any material changes to
the program. 803 As discussed in detail below, the final rule retains a role for the board in
overseeing the fund’s liquidity risk management program, but in response to commenters,
eliminates certain of the more specific and detailed approval requirements.
We believe the role of the board under the rule is one of general oversight, and consistent
with that obligation we expect that directors will exercise their reasonable business judgment in
overseeing the program on behalf of the fund’s investors. As discussed in the Proposing

802

See Investment Trusts and Investment Companies: Hearings on H.R. 10065 Before a Subcomm. of the
House Comm. on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 112 (1940) at 109 (describing the
board as an “independent check” on management); Burks v. Lasker, 441 U.S. 471, 484 (1979) (citing
Tannenbaum v. Zeller, 552 F.2d 402, 406 (2d. Cir. 1979)) (describing independent directors as
“independent watchdogs”).

Release, directors may satisfy their obligations with respect to this initial approval by reviewing
summaries of the liquidity risk management program prepared by the fund’s investment adviser,
officer, or officers administering the program, legal counsel, or other persons familiar with the
liquidity risk management program. 804 The summaries should familiarize directors with the
salient features of the program and provide them with an understanding of how the liquidity risk
management program addresses the required assessment of the fund’s liquidity risk.
Many commenters expressed general support for board oversight of the liquidity risk
management program, although several objected to certain of the board’s specific responsibilities
required under the rule, in particular their approval of the three-day highly liquid asset minimum
and of material changes to the program. 805 Given the board of directors’ historical oversight role,
the Commission continues to believe it is appropriate to require a fund’s board to oversee the
fund’s liquidity risk management program. The rule’s requirements are designed to facilitate the
board’s oversight of the adequacy and effectiveness of the fund’s liquidity risk management
program.
Several commenters asked that the final rule include an express standard of care (i.e., the
business judgment rule) to which the Commission would hold a fund’s board accountable in this
area. 806 One commenter requested that the final rule provide fund boards with a safe harbor in
approving specific elements of the program and clarification that a board is not required to

also NYC Bar Comment Letter (suggesting codifying a good-faith, reasonable, business judgment
standard). One commenter also suggested that the proposed requirement of keeping records of the board’s
determination related to the factors considered when approving the three-day liquid asset minimum is not
appropriate in light of the board’s historical role. T. Rowe Comment Letter. We note that as discussed
below, the board will not specifically approve the highly liquid investment minimum, thereby addressing
the commenters’ concerns about keeping records of the factors used in the board’s determination.

consider all of the enumerated factors (specifically, any non-applicable factors) when setting and
adjusting the three-day liquid asset minimum.807 We believe that the changes made to the board
oversight role from the proposal should largely address the commenters’ concerns. In addition,
we believe that the board oversight role here is substantially similar to its role and
responsibilities in other contexts under the Investment Company Act, and that providing a
different standard of care for board action here would not be appropriate. 808
1. Designation of Administrative Responsibilities to Fund Investment Adviser,
Officer, or Officers
We are adopting substantially as proposed the requirements that the fund’s board of
directors approve the designation of the fund’s investment adviser, officer, or officers (which
could not be solely portfolio managers of the fund) responsible for administering the fund’s
liquidity risk management program. 809 We are also adopting, substantially as proposed, the
requirement that the administrator of the program provide the board with a written report on the
adequacy of the fund’s liquidity risk management program, including the highly liquid
investment minimum, and the effectiveness of its implementation, at least annually. 810 The
Commission continues to believe this approach properly tasks the person(s) who are in a position
to manage the fund’s liquidity risks on a real-time basis with responsibility for administration of
the liquidity risk management program. Designating the fund’s investment adviser, officer, or
officers responsible for the administration of the fund’s liquidity risk management program,

See rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iii). We note that a fund’s sub-adviser could be designated as the administrator of the
program if appropriate.

251

subject to board approval, is consistent with the way the Commission understands most funds
manage liquidity. 811
We received little comment on this aspect of the proposal. A few commenters agreed
with the proposal that the board’s responsibilities should include approval of the program’s
administrator. 812 We continue to believe that requiring that the board approve the designation of
the administrator of the liquidity risk program is an important step in board oversight of the
program. We believe that having the board approve the administrator should help enhance board
oversight of the program and allow for boards to better understand who is responsible for
administering it.
One commenter argued that portfolio managers should administer the program,
contending that liquidity risk management requires investment skills and swiftness during stress
to manage redemptions. 813 This commenter believed that if a program administrator were
independent from portfolio management, then liquidity assessment might become divorced from
the investment process, which the commenter argued would be disadvantageous to the fund and
investors. We agree that portfolio management provides valuable input into the liquidity risk
management process. However, we are concerned that if only portfolio managers run the
program, the program might not be administered with sufficient independence to accomplish the
goal of managing the risk of the fund’s liquidity. We believe that a fund generally should
consider the extent of influence portfolio managers may have on administration of the program,

811

See American Bar Association, Fund Director’s Guidebook, Federal Regulation Of Securities Committee,
(4th ed. 2015), at 82 (“Determining the liquidity of a security is primarily an investment decision that is
delegated to the investment adviser, but directors may establish guidelines and standards for determining
liquidity.”).

and seek to provide independent voices and administration of the program as a check on any
potential conflicts of interest to the extent appropriate. However, as the proposal noted, although
the fund’s portfolio managers cannot be solely responsible for administering the program, the
administrator of the program might wish to consult with the fund’s portfolio manager, traders,
risk managers, and others as necessary or appropriate in administering a fund’s liquidity risk
management program. 814 Portfolio managers may also be a part of any committee or group
designated to administer the program, if more than one person is so designated. The
Commission understands that some funds currently employ a dedicated risk management officer
who consults with the fund’s portfolio management team. One commenter noted, and we agree,
that portfolio managers should provide day-to-day management of funds, with an additional
layer of oversight provided by the risk and compliance framework. 815 After review of the
comments received, we continue to believe that requiring the officer or officers responsible for
administering the fund’s liquidity risk management program not to be solely portfolio managers
strikes the appropriate balance between independence and expertise.
The Commission recognizes that, in certain circumstances, a fund’s service providers
might assist a fund and its investment adviser by providing information relevant to a fund’s
assessing and managing liquidity risk. 816 We note, however, that the primary parties responsible
for a fund’s liquidity risk management are the fund itself and any parties to whom the fund has
delegated responsibility for administering the fund’s liquidity risk management program.
One commenter requested further guidance on what responsibilities the administrator

816

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at section III.D.3.

253

could delegate and to what extent the administrator could rely upon third parties. 817 The
Proposing Release provided two examples of when a fund’s service providers could assist a fund
and its investment adviser in monitoring factors relevant to a fund’s liquidity risk and managing
the fund’s liquidity risk: third parties could provide data relevant to assessing fund flows, and a
sub-adviser necessarily would be responsible for investing a fund’s assets in accordance with the
fund’s three-day liquid asset minimum and any other liquidity-related portfolio requirements
adopted by the fund. 818 As proposed, the final rules require a fund to oversee any liquidity risk
monitoring or risk management activities undertaken by the fund’s service providers. We
encourage the fund to communicate regularly with its service providers as a part of its oversight
and to coordinate the liquidity risk management efforts undertaken by various parties.
2.

Oversight of the Liquidity Risk Management Program

Under the final rule, a fund will be required to obtain initial approval of its written
liquidity risk management program from the fund’s board of directors, including a majority of its
independent directors. 819 Additionally, the fund’s board will be required to review a written
report from the administrator of the fund’s liquidity risk management program, provided no less
frequently than annually, that addresses the operation of the program and assesses its adequacy
and effectiveness of implementation. 820 In a change from the proposal, a fund will not be
required to obtain approval of any material changes to the fund’s liquidity risk management
program from the fund’s board of directors, but instead such material changes will be described

See rule 22e-4(b)(2)(i).

820

As noted above, more frequent reports to the board may be appropriate in certain circumstances. See supra
footnote 771.

254

in the report. 821
Commenters raised concerns that the proposed rule imposed management responsibilities
on the fund’s board of directors and suggested that the Commission clarify that the board’s role
is to provide oversight through approval of policies and procedures, whereas management’s role
is to devise the specific details of the program. 822 Commenters contended that the final rule
should mirror rule 38a-1, requiring fund managers to explain material changes to the program
(including changes to the three-day liquid asset minimum) in an annual report to the board, not to
submit those changes for prior board approval. 823 These commenters felt that a requirement to
discuss material changes to the liquidity risk management program in an annual update to the
fund’s board would strike an appropriate balance between allowing the fund manager the
flexibility to make changes to liquidity risk management as market conditions might require,
while also keeping the fund’s board informed. 824
We agree with commenters that requiring funds to obtain approval from fund boards
before making material changes to a liquidity risk management program risks the program
becoming stale and outdated as market changes occur, and is not consistent with the approach
taken under rule 38a-1. Accordingly, the final rule does not require prior approval of material
changes to the fund’s liquidity risk management program from the fund’s board of directors.
However, under the final rule, the board is still required to approve the program initially and to
provide oversight of it, as well as review a report on the adequacy and effectiveness of the
821

See rule 22e-4(b)(2).

255

program’s implementation, which must include a description of any material changes made to
the program during the period. We believe that this oversight role is consistent with the board’s
historical responsibilities with respect to overseeing fund operations.
3. Oversight of the Highly Liquid Investment Minimum
In a change from the proposal, under the final rule, boards will not be required to approve
the highly liquid investment minimum, nor approve changes to it, except in the limited
circumstances where a fund seeks to change the minimum while the fund is below the preestablished minimum. Commenters argued that because liquidity risk management, including
management of three day-liquid assets, is both technical and fact-intensive and often requires
day-to-day judgments, fund managers should develop and administer the program, subject to
board review. 825 Commenters were concerned that the requirement for a fund to obtain board
approval for setting and changing the three-day minimum may cause delay that might harm fund
shareholders. 826 For example, one commenter argued that requiring board approval, which might
be difficult to obtain on a timely basis, could cause a fund to stand idle as market conditions
changed, missing opportunities as board approval was sought. 827
We agree with commenters that requiring boards to approve the highly liquid investment
minimum may reduce its utility, as the minimum may need to be revised on a more timely basis
so that it can best reflect the liquidity management needs of the fund under current market
conditions. In addition, we understand commenters’ concerns that requiring mutual fund boards
to make day-to-day determinations regarding the minimum amount of cash or liquid assets the
825

Comment Letter.

256

fund should hold may lead to a more detailed managerial role for the board.
However, in the limited circumstances where the program administrator seeks to change
the fund’s highly liquid investment minimum while the fund is below the pre-established
minimum, the final rules require the board to approve such a change. In the absence of such a
requirement, the administrator could simply change the minimum if the fund dropped below it,
avoiding the accountability of the board approval requirements as well as reducing the
minimum’s utility as a liquidity risk management tool. The final rule also requires the board to
receive a report whenever the fund falls below its highly liquid investment minimum at its next
regularly scheduled meeting and a report of such a shortfall if the fund is below its highly liquid
investment minimum for more than 7 consecutive calendar days, within one business day
thereafter. The Commission believes these requirements properly balance the ability of funds to
move quickly in response to shifting environments with the boards’ oversight of the liquidity risk
management program.
4. Oversight of Illiquid Investment Limit
In a change from the proposal, the final rule will also require that a fund board be
informed within one business day if the fund’s holdings of illiquid investments exceed 15% of its
net assets. In the proposal, we requested comment as to whether additional aspects of a fund’s
liquidity management program should be reported to a fund’s board. For the reasons discussed
in the section on Form N-LIQUID, if a fund’s holdings of illiquid investments exceed 15% for
any reason (for example, if a fund experiences net redemptions leading to increased holdings of
illiquid investments) it may raise significant concerns regarding the fund’s management of its
liquidity and ability to continue to meet its redemption obligations. Accordingly, we believe that
such an event should be reported to the board immediately, as it may have significant impacts on
257

the ability of the fund to meet its redemption obligations, and may compromise its liquidity risk
management.
As discussed in the section on Form N-LIQUID below, a number of commenters also
expressed support for the addition of an early warning notification provision, under which funds
would be required to notify the Commission (or take other action) when illiquid investments held
at the end of a business day exceed 15% of net assets and continue to exceed 15% of net assets
three business days after the threshold was first exceeded. 828 As discussed in the section on Form
N-LIQUID, we are adopting a requirement that a fund report to the Commission within one
business day if the fund’s holdings of illiquid investments exceed 15% percent of its net assets.
One commenter suggested that such a requirement would impose greater discipline on the
oversight of fund holdings of illiquid assets, and that a fund would likely consult with the fund
board in developing how to proceed in response. 829 We agree, and believe that if a fund were to
file Form N-LIQUID because the fund’s holdings of illiquid investments exceeded 15% of its net
assets, a fund board should be informed, and should be informed quickly, so that the board can
provide oversight as the fund determines how to address the level of illiquidity in the fund’s
portfolio. Accordingly, as a complement to this new N-LIQUID requirement, the final rules
require that if a fund’s holdings of illiquid investments exceed 15% of its net assets, the fund
board be informed of that fact within one business day after the occurrence, with an explanation
of the extent and causes of the occurrence and how the fund plans to bring its illiquid
investments that are assets to or below 15% of its net assets within a reasonable period of time.

828

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter III; SIFMA Comment Letter III (noting that this early warning notification
could respond to concerns raised by the Third Avenue Fund liquidation); see also Third Avenue Temporary
Order, supra footnote 12.

I.

Recordkeeping Requirements
Under the final rules, and as we proposed, each fund will be required to maintain a

written copy of the policies and procedures adopted as part of its liquidity risk management
program for five years, in an easily accessible place. 830 Additionally, each fund will be required
to maintain copies of any materials provided to its board in connection with the board’s initial
approval of the fund’s liquidity risk management program, and copies of written reports provided
to the board on the adequacy of the fund’s liquidity risk management program, including the
fund’s highly liquid investment minimum, and the effectiveness of its implementation for at least
five years after the end of the fiscal year in which the documents were provided to the board, the
first two years in an easily accessible place. 831 In a change from the proposal, funds would also
need to keep records of any materials provided to the board related to the fund dropping below
its highly liquid investment minimum. As with the proposal, the final rules also require each
fund to keep a written record of how its highly liquid investment minimum, and any adjustments
thereto, were determined, including the fund’s assessment and periodic review of its liquidity
risk for a period of not less than five years, the first two years in an easily accessible place,
following the determination of, and each change to, the fund’s highly liquid investment
minimum.832
One commenter found the recordkeeping requirements consistent with similar
recordkeeping requirements that funds are currently required to maintain. 833 The recordkeeping

830

See rule 22e-4(b)(3)(i). These policies and procedures would include any shortfall policies and procedures
adopted by a fund. See id.

requirement is designed to provide our examination staff with a basis to evaluate a fund’s
compliance with the requirements of rule 22e-4. We also anticipate that these records would
assist our staff in identifying weaknesses in a fund’s liquidity risk management. The five-year
retention period is also consistent with the period provided in rule 38a-1(d) under the Act. We
believe consistency in these retention periods is appropriate because funds currently have
compliance program-related recordkeeping procedures in place incorporating a five-year
retention period, which we believe lessen the compliance burden to funds, compared to choosing
a different retention period, such as the six-year recordkeeping retention period under rule 31a-2
of the Act.
The Commission continues to believe that the rule appropriately balances recordkeepingrelated burdens on funds and our examination staff’s ability to evaluate a fund’s liquidity risk
management program in light of the requirements of rule 22e-4. We are therefore adopting this
aspect of the rule substantially as proposed.
J.

ETFs
We are adopting certain tailored liquidity risk management program requirements for

ETFs. 834 In assessing, managing, and periodically reviewing its liquidity risk, an ETF will be
required to consider certain additional factors, as applicable, that take into account its unique
operation, as discussed further below. 835 Like all funds, each ETF also will be required to limit
its investments in illiquid investments to no more than 15% of its net assets and obtain certain

834

References to ETFs in this section are to both in-kind and other open-end ETFs, but not UIT ETFs (which
are not subject to the liquidity risk management program requirements), except where specifically indicated
otherwise. See infra section III.K for a discussion of limited liquidity review requirements for principal
underwriters and depositors of UITs.

board approvals regarding the program. Certain ETFs that qualify as “In-Kind ETFs,” 836
(generally ETFs that redeem shares in kind except to a de minimis extent and that publish their
holdings daily) however, will not be required to classify their portfolio investments or comply
with the highly liquid investment minimum requirement. 837 We believe these adjusted program
requirements recognize and appropriately require management of the unique liquidity risks found
in ETFs, and in particular In-Kind ETFs.
A number of commenters on the proposal highlighted how ETFs differ from mutual
funds, and stated in particular that In-Kind ETFs do not present the same type of liquidity risks
as other funds. 838 These commenters suggested that the Commission: (i) exempt either ETFs or
In-Kind ETFs entirely from proposed rule 22e-4; 839 (ii) exempt either ETFs or In-Kind ETFs
from certain requirements of proposed rule 22e-4 (notably the portfolio liquidity classification
and three-day liquid asset requirements); 840 or (iii) develop a more tailored liquidity risk

836

References to “In-Kind ETFs” include both ETFs and ETMFs that meet the requirements in rule 22e4(a)(9)) (defining an “In-Kind ETF”). See infra footnote 851 and accompanying text (discussing a
requirement that ETFs report their status as an “In-Kind ETF,” when applicable, on Form N-CEN).

837

ETFs that redeem in cash, or that do not qualify otherwise as “In-Kind ETFs” (as defined in rule 22e4(a)(9)) will be subject to the full set of liquidity risk management program elements, including the
classification and highly liquid investment minimum requirements. See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(i)-(iii).
Throughout the discussion of liquidity risk management programs in this Release, references to “funds”
include ETFs that redeem in cash, except where specifically indicated otherwise.

exemption for In-Kind ETFs from the three-day liquid asset requirements); BlackRock Comment Letter
(stating that the days-to-cash framework in the portfolio liquidity classification requirements is irrelevant
for ETFs and suggesting an exemption for at least In-Kind ETFs from the three-day liquid asset
requirements).

261

management program applicable to ETFs. 841
As noted above, we believe that ETFs, like mutual funds, face liquidity risks. 842 But we
agree that In-Kind ETFs have different liquidity risks than funds (including ETFs) that redeem in
cash. This is particularly the case because the redeeming shareholder (i.e., authorized participant
or its customer), rather than the ETF, typically will bear the direct costs associated with its
liquidity needs, given that if that authorized participant (or its customer) wants cash, it must sell
the in-kind assets and bear the costs of doing so. Therefore, after further analysis, including
carefully considering the comments received, we are adopting tailored liquidity risk management
program requirements for ETFs as discussed further below.
We decline to exempt all ETFs from the rule entirely, because we believe ETFs that
redeem more than a de minimis amount in cash can have substantially similar liquidity risks as
mutual funds, and we believe that all ETFs have certain unique additional risks discussed below.
In addition, while we agree that the classification and highly liquid investment minimum
components of the liquidity risk management program we are adopting for other funds are not
necessary for In-Kind ETFs, we believe that In-Kind ETFs must maintain sufficient liquidity and
assess liquidity-related risks that could affect their shareholders. In this regard, the liquidity of
an ETF’s portfolio positions is a factor that may contribute to the bid-ask spread, the effective
functioning of the ETF’s arbitrage mechanism and the ETF’s shares trading at a price that is at or
close to NAV. 843 For example, if an ETF holds illiquid or less liquid investments, this will be

841

See BlackRock Comment Letter; FSR Comment Letter.

842

We note, as discussed previously, that ETFs will be subject to the requirement to implement an overall
liquidity risk management program, including the requirement that the fund determine whether its
investment strategy is appropriate for an open-end fund.

843

By this we mean that, and we generally expect that, each day and over time an ETF’s shares will trade at or
close to the ETF’s intraday value. See 2015 ETP Request for Comment, supra footnote 29 (“When

262

reflected in the redemption basket transferred to a redeeming authorized participant (or its
customer), which might result in a liquidity cost to the authorized participant (or its customer or
other market participants). This increased cost could alter the authorized participant’s decisions
regarding exactly when or whether to create or redeem the ETF’s creation units, possibly
resulting in the ETF trading at increased spreads and/or a price that deviates significantly from
its NAV and ultimately adversely impacting the ETF’s investors.
Over the years, the Commission and staff have explored the structural and operational
differences between ETFs (including those that redeem in kind) and other open-end funds (that
redeem in cash), solicited public comment, including on issues related to the potential effects of
illiquidity on the operation of ETFs and evaluated the trading of ETFs in times of market
stress. 844 In 2015, the Commission solicited public comment on topics related to the listing and
trading of exchange-traded investment products (“ETPs”) on national securities exchanges and
sales of these products by broker-dealers. 845 Of relevance here, the Commission sought comment
on all aspects of the arbitrage mechanism for ETPs (including ETFs), including what
characteristics of an ETP would facilitate or hinder the alignment of secondary market share
providing exemptive or no-action relief under the Exchange Act, the Commission and its staff have
analyzed and relied upon the representations from ETP issuers regarding the continuing existence of
effective and efficient arbitrage to help ensure that the secondary market prices of ETP Securities do not
vary substantially from the value of their underlying portfolio or reference assets.”); infra footnote 857.
Because an ETF does not determine its NAV in real time throughout the trading day, in assessing whether
this expectation is met, one looks to the difference between the ETF shares’ closing market price and the
ETF’s end-of-day net asset value (i.e., its “premium” or “discount”). See 2015 ETP Request for Comment,
supra footnote 29. With regard to ETMFs, as noted in the Proposing Release, ETMF market makers would
not engage in the same kind of arbitrage as ETF market makers because all trading prices of ETMF shares
are linked to NAV. See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at n.458.

prices with the value of the underlying portfolio reference assets and how arbitrage mechanisms
work in the case of ETPs with less-liquid underlying or reference assets. The questions posed in
this Release, as well as the comments received, demonstrate the importance of assessing liquidity
risks and liquidity needs for all ETFs, including In-Kind ETFs. We considered the comments
received on the 2015 ETP Request for Comment in formulating the proposed rule and the final
rule we are adopting today.
1. Definitions
Under the final rule, all ETFs must consider certain additional liquidity risk assessment
factors, if applicable, but only In-Kind ETFs will be excluded from the classification and highly
liquid investment minimum requirements. 846 We are defining an exchange-traded fund or “ETF”
as “an open-end management investment company (or series or class thereof), the shares of
which are listed and traded on a national securities exchange, and that has formed and operates
under an exemptive order under the Act granted by the Commission or in reliance on an
exemptive rule adopted by the Commission.” 847 We are defining an “In-Kind ETF” to mean an
ETF that meets redemptions through in-kind transfers of securities, positions, and assets other
than a de minimis amount of cash and that publishes its portfolio holdings daily. 848 The
846

We note that an in-kind ETF may not be able to avail itself of the tailored liquidity risk management
program where the in-kind ETF operates as a class of a fund that also has mutual fund classes. In such a
case, for example, the liquidity classification requirement would apply to the entire portfolio, thus applying
to both in-kind ETFs and other funds (e.g., mutual funds). UITs, including ETFs structured as UITs, will
not be subject to the majority of the liquidity risk management program requirements. See supra section
III.A.2.d and infra section III.K (discussing rule 22e-4(c), that requires, on or before the date of initial
deposit of portfolio securities into a registered UIT (including ETF UITs), the principal underwriter or
depositor to determine that the portion of the illiquid investments that the UIT holds or will hold at the date
of deposit that are assets is consistent with the redeemable nature of the securities it issues and maintain a
record of that determination for the life of the UIT and for five years thereafter).

847

See rule 22e-4(a)(4). We note that this definition is substantially the same as the definition of ETF that we
had proposed as amendments to rule 22c-1. We also note that this definition is substantially the same as
the definition in Form N-1A.

848

See rule 22e-4(a)(9). Cash means cash held in U.S. dollars, and would not include, for example, cash

264

definition of “In-Kind ETF” is intended to distinguish this type of ETF, which, as described
throughout this Release, has a unique structure and raises different liquidity risks than other
open-end funds (that in most cases redeem shares in cash). As discussed below, we believe that
this definition of an In-Kind ETF facilitates this distinction by limiting an ETF’s redemption
basket to in-kind securities and other assets, and no more than a de minimis amount of cash. In
addition, the definition requires that an In-Kind ETF publish the ETF’s holdings daily. 849 This
daily publishing of ETF holdings (or “daily transparency”) is a condition of many of our ETF
orders, and we understand that even for ETFs not subject to that condition, most provide this
daily transparency as a matter of course. 850 We believe that requiring this daily transparency will
permit the sophisticated authorized participants that directly interact with the ETF to effectively
evaluate the liquidity of the ETF’s holdings. We also note that we are requiring an ETF to report
publicly to the Commission on Form N-CEN its designation as an In-Kind ETF as defined in the
final rule so that there is clarity on which ETFs meet this definition and are thus subject to the
tailored liquidity risk management program. 851
Consistent with our exemptive orders, we recognize that there may be circumstances

equivalents or foreign currency.
849

Today, such daily publishing of ETF holdings involves posting on the ETF’s website on each day that the
national securities exchange on which the fund’s shares are listed is open for business, before
commencement of trading of fund shares on the exchange, the identities and quantities of the securities,
assets or other positions held by the fund, or its respective master fund, that will form the basis for the
fund’s calculation of net asset value at the end of the business day.

850

See, e.g., Foreside ETF Trust, et al., Investment Company Act Release No. 32284 (Sep. 26, 2016) [81 FR
68079 (Oct. 3, 2016)] (notice of application). We note that ETMFs are not required to provide such daily
transparency under their orders, and thus would need to choose to provide such daily transparency if they
wished to take advantage if this provision.

851

See Item E.5 of Form N-CEN (“Is the Fund an ‘In-Kind Exchange-Traded Fund’ as defined in rule 22e-4
under the Act?”). In addition, ETFs (including In-Kind ETFs) will be required to report on Form N-CEN
the average percentage value of creation units purchased and redeemed both with in-kind securities and
assets and with cash, during the reporting period. See Investment Company Reporting Modernization
Adopting Release, supra footnote 120.

265

under which an In-Kind ETF may use cash to meet redemptions (in addition to securities and
other non-cash assets). For example, today an ETF that typically redeems in-kind may use cash
to: (i) make up any difference between the NAV attributable to a creation unit and the aggregate
market value of the creation basket exchanged for the creation unit (generally referred to as the
“balancing amount” in an ETF’s exemptive order); (ii) correspond to uninvested cash in the
fund’s portfolio (which, to the extent that this amount of cash equals the fund’s cash position in
the portfolio, would be an “in-kind” redemption); or (iii) substitute for a portfolio position or
asset that is not eligible to be transferred in kind (e.g., a derivative instrument that, pursuant to
contract, is not transferrable). 852 By their nature, “balancing amounts” are small amounts and
thus would be de minimis. Accordingly, there are a number of reasons, including those described
above, why an In-Kind ETF may find it prudent or necessary to use a de minimis amount of cash
to meet redemptions. However, if an In-Kind ETF were to use more than a de minimis amount
of cash (as determined in accordance with its written policies and procedures) to meet
redemptions (for any of the reasons discussed above or otherwise), it would not qualify as an InKind ETF and would need to comply with the liquidity risk management program requirements
applicable to other ETFs. 853 By way of example, an ETF that normally redeems in-kind, but
delivers all cash to a single authorized participant that elects to receive cash, would not be an
ETF that uses a de minimis amount of cash. However, depending on the circumstances, an ETF

852

We note that depending on the size of the position being substituted for, such a transaction may not always
be de minimis, and thus the ETF may no longer be eligible to qualify for this provision.

853

In-Kind ETFs are subject to rule 22e-4, including the obligation to establish written policies and procedures
for a liquidity risk management program. As part of these written policies and procedures, we would
expect that an In-Kind ETF would determine the amount of cash and the types of transactions that it will
treat as de minimis. If for any reason, an In-Kind ETF was not able to meet redemptions with more than a
de minimis amount of cash consistent with those policies and procedures, such a fund would no longer
qualify as an In-Kind ETF and would thus no longer be eligible to rely on this provision. See rule 22e4(b)(1)(ii).

266

that delivers cash only on one occasion may be able to conclude that it qualifies as an In-Kind
ETF in later years if such circumstances are not repeated.
An In-Kind ETF generally should describe in its written policies and procedures for its
liquidity risk management program, 854 to the extent applicable, how the fund analyzes the ability
of the ETF to redeem in-kind in all market conditions such that it is unlikely to suddenly fail to
continue to qualify for this exception to the classification and highly liquid investment minimum
requirements, the circumstances in which the In-Kind ETF may use a de minimis amount of cash
to meet a redemption, and what amount of cash would qualify as such. As part of its policies and
procedures, an In-Kind ETF generally should also describe how the ETF will manage and/or
approve any portion of a redemption that is paid in cash and document the ETF’s determination
that such a cash amount is de minimis. In making these determinations, an In-Kind ETF may
consider, if applicable: (i) the amount (both in dollars and as a percentage of the entire
redemption basket) and frequency with which cash is used to meet redemptions; and (ii) the
circumstances and rationale for using cash to meet redemptions.
As discussed above, in-kind redemptions mitigate certain liquidity risks, but only to the
extent that the fund can use in-kind redemptions. This factor is particularly important for an InKind ETF because such a fund may only include in its redemption basket a de minimis amount of
cash if it wants to qualify for the exclusion from the classification and highly liquid investment
minimum requirements. If, for example, market conditions change and the fund can no longer
meet redemptions without more than a de minimis amount of cash, the fund would no longer
qualify as an In-Kind ETF. As a result, the ETF would be required to comply with additional

Rule 22e-4 requires that an In-Kind ETF adopt and implement a written liquidity risk management program
reasonably designed to assess and manage the fund’s liquidity risk. See rule 22e-4(b).

267

requirements under its liquidity risk management program (including liquidity portfolio
classifications and highly liquid investment minimum).
2. Tailored Program Elements for ETFs
By adopting certain tailored liquidity risk management program requirements for ETFs,
we recognize, consistent with comments received, that both ETFs that redeem in cash and InKind ETFs present unique liquidity risks as compared to other funds. Some of these unique risks
were not specifically addressed in the generally applicable liquidity risk management program as
proposed, while still other aspects of the general program were less applicable to the actual
operation of In-Kind ETFs, particularly those that offer daily transparency of holdings. Our final
rule is designed to address both issues. Accordingly, an ETF will be required to adopt and
implement a tailored liquidity risk management program that has the unique elements discussed
below, in addition to the elements discussed elsewhere in this Release.
Liquidity Risk Assessment
An ETF, like other open-end funds, will be required to assess and manage the fund’s
“liquidity risk”—defined as the risk that a fund could not meet requests to redeem shares issued
by the fund without significant dilution of remaining investors’ interests in the fund. 855 As
discussed above, we believe that this definition, modified from the proposal as informed by
commenter input, is appropriate for all open-end funds, whether the fund redeems in cash or in
kind and whether the fund is a mutual fund or an ETF. 856
Illiquidity in an ETF’s portfolio or its basket assets can adversely impact investors by

855

See rule 22e-4(a)(11) (defining liquidity risk); rule 22e-4(b) (requiring each fund and in-kind ETF to adopt
and implement a written liquidity risk management program).

856

See supra section III.B.1 for a discussion of the definition of liquidity risk, including comments received
and modifications made from the proposal.

268

imposing costs on market participants that could then potentially be reflected in a widening of
the bid-ask spread of the ETF shares. This widening could result in shareholders transacting in
an ETF’s shares at market prices that do not maintain a “close tie” to the NAV per share of the
ETF. As we have previously stated, a close tie between ETF share market prices and the ETF’s
NAV per share is important because section 22(d) and rule 22c-1 under the Act are designed to
require that all fund shareholders be treated equitably. 857 In addition, declining liquidity in an
ETF’s portfolio also could affect a market maker’s ability or willingness to make a market in the
product because arbitrage opportunities would be more difficult to evaluate. 858 This, in turn,
could affect the liquidity of the ETF shares, making it difficult for market participants to price,
trade and hedge.
Under the final rule, ETFs will be required to assess, manage, and periodically review the
fund’s liquidity risk and needs, taking into account, as applicable, the liquidity risk factors for all
funds (as modified from the proposal) discussed previously. 859 ETFs also must consider the
following additional factors, as applicable, that are specific to the structure and operation of
ETFs:
857

See generally H.R. REP. NO. 2639, 76th Cong., 3d Sess., 8 (1940). See also Investment Trusts and
Investment Companies: Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission, H.R. Doc. No. 279, 76th
Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 3, at 860-874 (1939); Spruce ETF Trust, et al., Investment Company Act Release No.
31301 (Oct. 21, 2014) [79 FR 63964 (Oct. 27, 2014)] (notice of application) (to the extent that investors
would have to exit at a price substantially below the NAV of the ETF, this would be “contrary to the
foundational principle underlying section 22(d) and rule 22c-1 under the Act that all shareholders be treated
equitably when buying and selling their fund shares”); Precidian ETFs Trust, et al., Investment Company
Act Release No. 31300 (Oct. 21, 2014) [79 FR 63971 (Oct. 27, 2014)] (notice of application) (“A close tie
between market price and NAV per share of the ETF is the foundation for why the prices at which retail
investors buy and sell ETF shares are similar to the prices at which Authorized Participants are able to buy
and redeem shares directly from the ETF at NAV. This close tie between prices paid by retail investors and
Authorized Participants is important because section 22(d) and rule 22c-1 under the Act are designed to
require that all fund shareholders be treated equitably when buying and selling their fund shares.”).

859

See supra section III.B.2 (discussing the factors as proposed and how the factors have been amended in the
final rule to address commenter concerns). We recognize that not all of these factors may be applicable to
all ETFs (and that some mutual funds would not need to consider certain factors relevant only to ETFs).

269

•

The relationship between the ETF’s portfolio liquidity and the way in which, and the
prices and spreads at which, ETF shares trade, including the efficiency of the
arbitrage function and the level of active participation by market participants
(including authorized participants); 860 and

•

The effect of the composition of baskets on the overall liquidity of the ETF’s
portfolio.

We considered, in establishing these factors, comments received on the Proposing Release and
the 2015 ETP Request for Comment, as well as the unique structure and operation of ETFs. We
discuss these factors in more detail below. As we noted with regard to other open-end funds, the
list of liquidity risk assessment factors for ETFs is not meant to be exhaustive. Rather, an ETF
generally should incorporate other considerations in assessing its liquidity risk that it considers
appropriate.
ETF Trading - Arbitrage Function and Level of Activity of Market Participants
As discussed above, the ETF structure permits only authorized participants to purchase or
redeem shares from an ETF and to transact in the ETF’s shares at the NAV per share. The
combination of the creation and redemption process with secondary market trading in ETF
shares provides arbitrage opportunities that, if effective, keep the market price of the ETF’s
shares at or close to the NAV per share of the ETF. 861 If an ETF has a significant amount of
illiquid securities in its portfolio, market participants may find it more difficult to evaluate

860

We note that this factor will not be applicable to ETMFs to the same extent it applies to ETFs. ETMF
market makers will not engage in the same kind of arbitrage as ETF market makers and will assume no
intraday market risk with their positions in ETMF shares as all trading prices are linked to NAV. See
ETMF Notice, supra at note 31 at n.21 and accompanying text.

861

We recognize that an ETF is not as likely as a mutual fund to sell or in-kind transfer its portfolio holdings
in order to meet redemptions because an authorized participant generally will not seek to create or redeem a
basket with the ETF until there is a sufficient deviation between the ETF shares’ market price and the
ETF’s NAV. As discussed previously, ETMF market makers would not engage in the same kind of
arbitrage as ETF market makers because all trading prices of ETMF shares are linked to NAV. See supra
footnote 836.

270

opportunities and ultimately participate in the arbitrage process (because of challenges in pricing,
trading, and hedging their exposure to the ETF). If the arbitrage function fails to operate
efficiently, investors could buy and sell the ETF shares at prices that are not at or close to the
NAV per share of the ETF, which may raise concerns relating to section 22(d) of and rule 22c-1
under the Act regarding whether all fund shareholders (authorized participants and retail
investors) are being treated equitably. 862 We discussed in the Proposing Release how the
effective functioning of this arbitrage mechanism has been pivotal to the operation of ETFs (and
to the Commission’s approval of exemptions that allow their operation) and how the liquidity of
the ETF’s portfolio positions is a factor that contributes to the effective functioning of this
arbitrage mechanism. 863
Commenters to the 2015 ETP Request for Comment also highlighted the importance of
portfolio liquidity on the efficiency of the ETF arbitrage mechanism. During an extraordinary
period of market volatility on August 24, 2015 (“the August 24th Market Events”), for example,
many ETFs traded at prices materially different from the NAV of the funds’ underlying portfolio
assets. 864 One commenter on the 2015 ETP Request for Comment, in observing the August 24th
Market Events, noted that there are many reasons an ETF may trade at a substantial difference
from the NAV of its underlying constituent stocks, including a lack of liquidity in the ETF
constituents and a lack of liquidity in the ETF shares themselves. 865 Another commenter
suggested that, where the market for an underlying asset is illiquid, no amount of arbitrage will

271

be sufficient to equalize market discrepancies between underlying assets and the fund’s price,
especially during times of market stress. 866 In addition, the level of active participation by
market participants, including market makers and authorized participants, in the trading of ETF
shares is important to the way in which, and the prices and spreads at which, shares trade. As
one commenter on the 2015 ETP Request for Comment noted, the more authorized participants
that are active in the market, the more opportunities there are to trade and provide liquidity. 867
For these reasons, we are requiring that an ETF consider the relationship between the liquidity of
its portfolio and the arbitrage function in assessing its liquidity risk (where applicable).
Basket Composition
In-Kind ETFs create and redeem using baskets of securities and other assets. These
baskets may be highly correlated to the ETF’s overall portfolio. As we noted in the Proposing
Release, the composition of the basket can affect the liquidity of the ETF’s portfolio. 868 For
example, an ETF whose basket does not reflect a pro rata share of the fund’s portfolio may alter
the liquidity profile of the ETF’s portfolio and may adversely affect the fund’s future ability to
meet cash redemptions or mitigate shareholder dilution. 869 We recognize that certain market
incentives exist to mitigate the likelihood of significant or frequent divergence between an ETF’s
basket and the fund’s portfolio. For example, if an ETF’s basket is not correlated with the fund’s
portfolio, the ETF likely will develop a higher tracking error. Nonetheless, such divergence may

Under limited circumstances, an index ETF’s redemption basket also may differ from the portfolio deposit
made by the authorized participant.

272

occur, with potentially adverse consequences to the remaining shareholders in the fund.
Accordingly, we are requiring an ETF to consider the effect of its basket composition on the
fund’s overall portfolio liquidity (even if an ETF’s creation and redemption baskets reflect a pro
rata share of the ETF’s portfolio). 870
A few commenters also suggested that increasing ETF basket flexibility and eliminating
the two percent limitation on redemption fees for ETFs would help enhance ETF liquidity and
the orderly and efficient operation of the arbitrage function. 871 We are not addressing these
issues here because they are beyond the scope of this rulemaking.
Portfolio Liquidity Classification
Under the final rule, an open-end fund (other than an In-Kind ETF) will be required to
classify each of the fund’s portfolio investments (generally by asset class) into one of four
categories: highly liquid investments; moderately liquid investments; less liquid investments;
and illiquid investments. A number of commenters noted, as the Commission recognized in the
Proposing Release and as we reiterate above, that an open-end fund (including an open-end ETF)
that redeems in cash has a different nature of liquidity risk than an ETF that redeems through inkind transfers of securities, positions, and other assets. 872
We note, for example, that when a mutual fund experiences daily net redemptions, the
870

One commenter on the 2015 ETP Request for Comment, discussing the potential effects of basket
composition on an ETF’s overall liquidity, noted that an ETF whose basket reflects a pro rata share of the
ETF’s portfolio will have a larger number of securities in the basket, with the size of each individual
position potentially being smaller. This commenter suggested that, as a result: (i) the smaller lots can be
more difficult for an authorized participant to trade efficiently, thereby increasing the bid/ask spreads of the
ETF; and (ii) the pro rata basket is more likely to include less liquid or even illiquid securities that an ETF
not subject to the pro rata requirement can exclude. See Comment Letter of Charles Schwab & Co. on the
on 2015 ETP Request for Comment (Aug. 17, 2015), available at https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-1115/s71115-28.pdf.

273

fund will likely be required to sell its portfolio holdings in order to generate cash to meet
redemptions. To the extent that a fund must sell a less liquid security in order to generate the
cash proceeds required, there is enhanced liquidity risk—that is, risk that a fund cannot meet
redemptions without significant dilution of remaining investors. Therefore, we believe that it is
appropriate for such a fund to assess its liquidity risk by analyzing the amount of time it will
take, in current market conditions, to convert its portfolio assets (without the conversion (or in
some cases, sale or disposition) significantly changing the market value of the investments).
As discussed above, an In-Kind ETF’s liquidity risk is different from the liquidity risk of
a fund that generally meets redemptions in cash. Rather than liquidity risk affecting investors
directly in their ability to receive cash redemption proceeds, illiquidity in an ETF’s portfolio or
its basket assets can adversely impact investors by contributing to a widening of the bid-ask
spread of the ETF shares. This widening could result in shareholders transacting in an ETF’s
shares at market prices that do not maintain a “close tie” to the NAV per share of the ETF. The
declining liquidity in an ETF’s portfolio also could affect the arbitrage function related to the
ETF, as discussed above.
Despite our concern about the specific liquidity-related risks in ETFs described above,
we view the liquidity classification information for In-Kind ETFs as less necessary for the
Commission, investors, and other potential users of this information because, unlike for mutual
funds, the daily identity and weightings of ETF portfolio holdings are well known to authorized
participants and other ETF liquidity providers, and would be required to be disclosed daily under
our final rules to qualify for the exemption from the classification requirement. 873 Authorized
873

See rule 22e-4(a)(9). See also, Precidian ETFs Trust, et al., Investment Company Act Release No. 31300
(Oct. 21, 2014) [79 FR 63971 (Oct. 27, 2014)] (notice of application) (“The Commission therefore has
granted such exemptive relief to date only to those actively managed ETFs that have provided daily

274

participants are the only shareholders that are permitted to transact with the ETF at NAV, and
these sophisticated broker-dealers are more likely to be able to readily discern the ETF’s
liquidity profile from this daily portfolio information.
We continue to believe that it is important that an In-Kind ETF maintain sufficient
liquidity in its portfolio. Accordingly, the final rule requires that an In-Kind ETF, in assessing
liquidity risk, take into account certain factors that are more tailored to the way in which such
funds operate and the resulting liquidity risks. For example, those factors include considering
the relationship between portfolio liquidity and the arbitrage function, as well as the effect of the
composition of in-kind baskets on the overall liquidity of the fund’s portfolio. However, given
the more limited utility of this classification information for the reasons described above, and
considering the burdens of tracking and reporting it to us, we do not believe that it is appropriate
to require an In-Kind ETF to classify its portfolio investments into liquidity categories based on
a “days-to-cash” framework and report that information to the Commission. 874

transparency of their portfolio holdings.”). The identity and weightings of the constituents of affiliated
indices are required by exemptive application condition to be made publicly available on a daily basis. See,
e.g., Columbia ETF Trust I, et. al., Investment Company Act Release No. 32134 (May 31, 2016) (order)
(related application with conditions available at:
https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1233991/000119312516578039/d194333d40appa.htm). The
identity and weightings of the constituents of non-affiliated indexes are not required to be made publicly
available on a daily basis. However, because: (1) these index compositions are generally broadly available
to liquidity providers either publicly, by subscription or by license; and (2) index-based ETFs publish their
purchase and redemption baskets daily, and those baskets generally are tracking baskets that represent
either a pro rata replication of the index or a sampling of the index, authorized participants and other ETF
liquidity providers should nonetheless be able to determine the liquidity profile of a non-affiliated, indexbased ETF on a daily basis. Unlike ETFs, ETMF are only required to provide the same disclosure about
the identity and weightings of their portfolio holdings as mutual funds.
874

In the Proposing Release, we proposed to apply the portfolio liquidity classification requirement to openend ETFs (in addition to other open-end funds), in part, because, ETFs permit authorized participants to
redeem in cash (even if these funds typically redeem in kind). See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at
n. 129 and accompanying text. Accordingly, we determined that it was appropriate to require that all ETFs
classify their portfolio liquidity by assessing the fund’s ability to convert portfolio positions into cash. The
final rule, however, establishes a more tailored regulatory regime for In-Kind ETFs, that, by definition, do
not meet redemptions through more than a de minimis amount of cash. Thus, under the final rule, we do
not believe it is necessary to require that In-Kind ETFs be subject to the portfolio liquidity classification

275

Highly Liquid Investment Minimum
Under the final rule, an open-end fund (other than an In-Kind ETF) will be required to
determine a percentage of the fund’s net assets that it will invest in assets that are highly liquid
investments. The fund will determine its highly liquid investment minimum using the first
category in the liquidity classification requirement (i.e., cash and assets convertible into cash
within three business days). The fund also will be required to take certain actions when the
fund’s highly liquid investments fall below its minimum. 875
In determining to adopt a highly liquid investment minimum for certain open-end funds,
we considered comments received on proposed rule 22e-4, which would have required a “threeday liquid asset minimum.” 876 Multiple commenters suggested that the concept of a three-day
liquid asset minimum does not take into account the unique structural aspects of ETFs. 877 One
commenter suggested that the concept of “convertible into cash within three business days” has
little relevance to an ETF that does not liquidate securities to meet cash redemptions. 878
Consistent with the comments received, we are not requiring that an In-Kind ETF adopt a
highly liquid investment minimum. First, an open-end fund will be required to establish its
highly liquid investment minimum using its “highly liquid investment” portfolio classification.
As discussed earlier, we have determined that it is not necessary to require that an In-Kind ETF
classify its portfolio liquidity (e.g., into “highly liquid investment,” or “moderately liquid
investment”). The portfolio liquidity classifications incorporate a “convertible to cash” concept
requirement (which is based on a “days-to-cash” or “days-to-sell” framework).

276

that is generally not relevant for an In-Kind ETF (except in managing cash holdings to no greater
than a de minimis amount of cash). Because the highly liquid investment minimum incorporates
the same “convertible to cash” concept as the portfolio liquidity classifications (which, for the
reasons discussed above, we are not requiring for In-Kind ETFs), we do not believe it is
appropriate to require that an In-Kind ETF establish a highly liquid investment minimum.
Second, the highly liquid investment minimum, as discussed above, is intended to
increase the likelihood that an open-end fund meets redemption requests without significant
dilution of remaining investors. Open-end funds that redeem in cash and In-Kind ETFs operate
differently, and therefore evaluate liquidity risk differently. We believe, for example, that it is
necessary for an open-end fund that meets redemptions in cash (including an ETF) to manage its
liquidity risk by establishing a minimum amount of highly liquid investments that, as defined in
the final rule, are quickly convertible to cash (within 3 business days). In this way, the highly
liquid investment minimum increases the likelihood that the fund will be able to meet
redemption requests in cash without significant dilution of remaining investors. Conversely, we
believe, for example, that it is more appropriate for an In-Kind ETF that meets redemptions
through in-kind transfers of securities, positions, and other assets (and no more than a de minimis
amount of cash) to, among other things, assess its liquidity risk through consideration of the
factors we have discussed above (e.g., assessing the relationship between portfolio liquidity and
the arbitrage function). For these reasons, we are excluding In-Kind ETFs from the highly liquid
investment minimum requirement in rule 22e-4.
We discussed above the requirement that funds (including ETFs) other than In-Kind

277

ETFs establish a highly liquid investment minimum. 879 One commenter noted that the three-day
liquid asset minimum might increase tracking error, or force an ETF to either violate the terms of
its exemptive order, 880 or refuse in-kind purchase requests from authorized participants, thus
interfering with the arbitrage mechanism that keeps ETF market prices close to their underlying
NAV. 881 An ETF that does not qualify as an In-Kind ETF necessarily meets redemptions
through more than a de minimis amount of cash. For the reasons discussed above, we believe
that it is appropriate to require a fund that meets redemptions, at least partially in cash, to comply
with the liquidity classification and highly liquid investment minimum requirements. 882 With
regard to tracking error, an ETF with an index-based strategy, like other open-end funds, needs
to balance its implementation of its investment strategy with the need for appropriate liquidity
risk management given its obligation to meet redemptions without significant dilution. We
recognize that this balancing may result in tracking error, and such a fund may wish to address
and manage this risk through appropriately designed policies and procedures. This concern,
along with the concerns regarding potentially violating an exemptive order, or refusing an inkind purchase request from an authorized participant, are also mitigated by the additional
flexibility provided for in the final rule. Under the final rule (as compared with the proposal), a
fund that breaches its highly liquid investment minimum will be subject to certain board
reporting requirements, but will not be barred from purchasing non-conforming assets (as would

See supra section III.D.

address potentially adverse situations, including tracking error, that may arise as a result of
complying with the highly liquid investment minimum.
K.

Limitation on Unit Investment Trusts’ Investments in Illiquid Investments
As noted above, the proposed scope of rule 22e-4 did not include UITs, although we

requested comment on whether UITs should be included within its scope, and whether we should
include specific limitations on UIT’s holdings of illiquid assets at inception. 884 As adopted
today, UITs remain excluded from the rule’s liquidity risk management program requirements.
However, as suggested by some commenters, we are now requiring a limited liquidity review for
UITs. Under the final rules, the UIT’s principal underwriter or depositor must determine, on or
before the initial deposit of portfolio securities into the UIT, that the portion of the illiquid
investments that the UIT holds or will hold at the date of deposit that are assets is consistent with
the redeemable nature of the securities it issues. 885
As discussed in detail in the Proposing Release, most UITs serve as separate account
vehicles used to fund variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts, 886 and these UITs
essentially function as pass-through vehicles, investing principally in securities of one or more
open-end investment companies that would be subject to rule 22e-4. 887 Also, UITs are not

See supra section III.D.

884

See supra section III.A.2.d; Proposing Release, supra footnote 9 at section III.A.3 and comment requests
following n 156 (“alternatively, should we require UITs to meet certain minimum liquidity requirements at
the time of deposit of the securities…”).

885

See rule 22e-4(c). The rule also requires UITs to maintain a record of that determination for the life of the
UIT and for five years thereafter. See also Rule 144A Release supra footnote 37at n.61 (discussing
liquidity requirements for UITs prior to the adoption of rule 22e-4).

886

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at n.139 and accompanying text. We currently estimate that
approximately 92.9% of UITs serve as separate account vehicles (based on data as of December 31, 2015).

887

See id., at nn.139-140 and accompanying text.

279

actively managed, and thus certain provisions of rule 22e-4 that require a fund’s board to
approve and oversee the fund’s liquidity risk management program and the fund’s adviser,
officer, or officers to administer it are inapposite to the management structure of a UIT. 888
Several commenters argued (in the context of ETFs organized as UITs) that UITs may be
subject to liquidity risk comparable to other funds. 889 As discussed previously, in recognition of
the different unmanaged organizational structure of UITs, we continue to believe that including
UITs within the scope of rule 22e-4’s liquidity risk management program requirements (or even
the tailored program requirements for ETFs that redeem in kind) would not be feasible.
However, we recognize that UITs may in some circumstances be subject to liquidity risk
(particularly where the UIT is not a pass-through vehicle and the sponsor does not maintain an
active secondary market for UIT shares) as investor redemption requests may lead to dissipation
of UIT assets, forcing a UIT to sell securities that it holds to meet redemptions.
Accordingly, today we are adopting a limited liquidity review requirement for UITs to
require that a UIT’s principal underwriter or depositor determine upon initial deposit of a
registered UIT that the level of illiquid investments it will hold is consistent with the redeemable
nature of the securities it issues. 890 Though commenters focused their discussion on UITs that
are ETFs, we believe it is appropriate for the principal underwriter or depositor of any registered
888

See id., at nn.141-143 and accompanying text.

889

See Anonymous Comment Letter I; BlackRock Comment Letter. One of these commenters also observed
that, while there are few ETFs that are UITs, some of the largest ETFs in the world (by volume/value
traded) are UIT ETFs, and thus any liquidity risks faced by these UIT ETFs could lead to significant
adverse market consequences. The commenter also expressed concern that excluding UIT ETFs from the
scope of rule 22e-4 may prompt more ETF sponsors to structure ETFs as UITs rather than open-end funds
to avoid being subject to the liquidity risk management program requirement. See Anonymous Comment
Letter I. We recognize the risks of excluding UIT’s from 22e-4, and thus are adopting the liquidity review
requirement discussed in this section, as a tailored approach that fits the unique unmanaged structure of
UITs, including ETFs that are structured as UITs. (ETMFs are not structured as UITs because, as they are
structured today, they are actively managed and thus cannot operate as UITs.)

890

See supra footnote 885 and accompanying text.

280

UIT to conduct the initial liquidity assessment described above on or before the date of the initial
deposit of securities into the UIT. The securities that the UIT is expected to hold should be
examined so that they are consistent with the ability of a UIT to issue redeemable securities,
much as an open-end fund will be required to evaluate whether its investment strategy and the
securities it holds is appropriate for an open-end fund under the final liquidity risk management
program. 891 Though UITs are not actively managed and do not have a board of directors,
corporate officers, or an investment adviser to render advice during the life of the trust, making
active liquidity risk management inapposite to the management structure of a UIT, we believe
that this requirement of a tailored, one-time, initial liquidity risk management requirement for
UITs is in line with the unmanaged structure of a UIT and its liquidity risk. 892
We expect that this initial review requirement would in many respects be similar to the
process for determining whether a fund’s holding of illiquid investments is consistent with rule
22e-4’s 15% limitation on illiquid investments, taking into account the unique structure and
purpose of UITs. If a UIT were to hold or planned to hold more than 15% of its investments in
illiquid investments at the time of initial deposit, such a level of illiquid investments is unlikely
to be consistent with the nature of the redeemable securities it issues. Thus, if a UIT planned to
hold significant amounts of illiquid securities (in excess of 15%), its principal underwriter or
depositor would be unlikely to be able to make the determination that its investment’s liquidity is
consistent with its issuance of redeemable securities.
891

As noted above, all UITs are subject to the requirements of section 22(e) and therefore must meet
redemptions within seven days. See also section 4(2).

892

With regard to UITs structured as ETFs in particular, we agree with commenters’ concerns that UIT ETFs’
liquidity risks may be comparable to those faced by other ETFs and that the relatively large size of certain
UIT ETFs could lead to significant market consequences if these UIT ETFs were to encounter liquidity
issues. However, because UIT ETFs are unmanaged and must fully replicate their underlying indices, we
believe that a one-time determination regarding liquidity concerns at the commencement of the offering of
a registered UIT is the appropriate manner to mitigate such concerns.

281

Due to the unmanaged structure of UITs and the fixed nature of their portfolios, it would
be inconsistent with their structure and portfolios to require UITs to re-evaluate the securities
they hold based on their liquidity characteristics and change their investments accordingly over
time. Therefore, the requirement only applies at the time of the UIT’s creation. Although this is
a one-time determination at the time of the UIT’s initial deposit, it should take into account the
planned structure of the UIT’s holdings. In particular, if the UIT tracks an index, the
determination should consider the index design and whether the index design is likely to lead to
the UIT holding an amount of illiquid assets that is inconsistent with the redeemable nature of
the securities it issues.
As discussed above, because of the unmanaged nature of an UIT, we recognize that
depending on its particular circumstances, after initial deposit, an UIT might potentially hold a
higher level of illiquid investments due to redemptions or changes in the liquidity of the
investments it holds. Nonetheless, we expect that the requirement for the depositor or principal
underwriter to determine that the liquidity of the investments the UIT holds is consistent with the
nature of the redeemable securities it issues at the time of initial deposit should help enhance UIT
liquidity.

Disclosure and Reporting Requirements Regarding Liquidity Risk and Liquidity
Risk Management
Receiving relevant information about the operations of a fund and its principal

investment risks is important to investors in choosing the appropriate fund for their risk
tolerances. Investors in open-end funds generally expect funds to pay redemption proceeds
promptly following their redemption requests based, in part, on representations made by funds in
their disclosure documents. Currently, funds are not expressly required to disclose how they
manage the liquidity of their investments, and limited information is available regarding fund
282

liquidity and whether the liquidity of a fund’s portfolio securities corresponds with its anticipated
liquidity needs.
We are adopting, substantially as proposed with some modifications in response to
comment, amendments to Form N-1A that will require a fund to further describe its procedures
for redeeming the fund’s shares including the number of days following receipt of shareholder
redemption requests in which the fund typically expects to pay redemption proceeds to
redeeming shareholders and the methods the fund typically uses to meet redemption requests,
including whether those methods are used regularly or only in stressed market conditions. 893 We
also are adopting an amendment to General Instruction A of Form N-1A to conform the
definition of “exchange-traded fund” to the definition of ETF adopted today in connection with
rule 22e-4 and the adoption of Form N-CEN in the Investment Company Reporting
Modernization Adopting Release. 894
In addition, we are adopting new Form N-LIQUID to incorporate information that would
have previously been reported on Form N-PORT under the proposal concerning a fund’s
investments in illiquid investments, but with some modifications in response to comments.
Under this new reporting form, a fund is required to notify the Commission when more than 15%
of the fund’s net assets are, or become, illiquid investments that are assets as defined in rule 22e4 and report information about the investments affected. 895 A fund also is required to report on
Form N-LIQUID if the fund’s illiquid investments that are assets previously exceeded 15% of
net assets and the fund determines that its illiquid investments that are assets have changed to be

893

See Items 11(c)(7) and (c)(8) of Form N-1A.

894

See infra footnote 906.

895

See Part A and Part B of Form N-LIQUID.

283

less than or equal to 15% of net assets. 896 In addition, under the new form, a fund is required to
notify the Commission if the fund’s holdings in highly liquid investments that are assets fall
below the fund’s highly liquid investment minimum for more than 7 consecutive calendar
days. 897 Information reported on Form N-LIQUID will be non-public.
We are adopting, as proposed, the requirement that a fund report on Form N-CEN
information regarding the use of lines of credit, interfund lending, and interfund borrowing. 898 In
addition, we are adopting a new requirement that a fund report on Form N-CEN whether the
fund is an “In-Kind Exchange-Traded Fund” as defined in rule 22e-4. 899
Many commenters expressed general support for enhanced disclosures regarding fund
liquidity risk management practices. 900 Some commenters noted that understanding the liquidity
dynamics of an investment strategy employed by a fund would be beneficial to investors 901 and
that enhanced information could assist the Commission in its role as the primary regulator of
investment companies and help investors make more informed investing decisions by providing
more transparency into fund investment practices. 902 Other commenters expressed concerns with

896

See Part C of Form N-LIQUID.

897

See Part D of Form N-LIQUID.

898

See Item C.20 of Form N-CEN. In the Proposing Release, we also proposed to add to Form N-CEN a
requirement for funds to report whether the fund required that an authorized participant post collateral to
the fund or any of its designated service providers in connection with the purchase or redemption of fund
shares during the reporting period. See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at section III.G.3.a. We are
adopting this requirement in the Investment Company Reporting Modernization Adopting Release. See

specific disclosure and reporting requirements outlined in the proposal, which are discussed in
detail below.
1. Amendments to Form N-1A
Form N-1A is used by open-end funds, including money market funds and ETFs, to
register under the Investment Company Act and to register offerings of their securities under the
Securities Act. We are adopting, substantially as proposed, amendments to Form N-1A that will
require a fund to further describe its procedures for redeeming the fund’s shares including the
number of days following receipt of shareholder redemption requests in which the fund typically
expects to pay redemption proceeds to redeeming shareholders. 903 A fund also will be required
to describe the methods the fund typically expects to use to meet redemption requests in stressed
and non-stressed market conditions. 904 Funds will not be required, however, to file as exhibits to
their registration statements credit agreements as we proposed. We note that these amendments
will apply to all open-end funds, including money market funds and ETFs. 905
In addition, we are adopting an amendment to General Instruction A of Form N-1A to
conform the definition of “exchange-traded fund,” which currently defines an ETF to mean, in
part, a fund or class, “the shares of which are traded on a national securities exchange” to the
definition of ETF adopted today in connection with rule 22e-4 and the adoption of Form NPORT and Form N-CEN in the Investment Company Reporting Modernization Adopting
Release, which both define an ETF, in part, to mean a fund or class, “the shares of which are

listed and traded on a national securities exchange.” 906
Many commenters generally supported enhancing prospectus disclosure requirements, 907
noting, for example, that enhanced disclosures will improve shareholder and market participant
knowledge regarding fund redemption procedures and liquidity risk management. 908 Several
commenters expressed concerns with the proposed requirements to disclose the number of days
or the methods in which a fund will pay redemption proceeds 909 and include lines of credit
agreements as exhibits to the fund registration statement. 910 We discuss the comments received
in response to the proposal, as well as the amendments to Form N-1A and modifications to the
proposal, in more detail below.

906

See General Instructions A of Form N-1A (emphasis added) and General Instruction E of Form N-CEN.
See also Investment Company Reporting Modernization Adopting Release, supra footnote 120. For
purposes of reporting on proposed Form N-CEN, we proposed to define (i) “exchange-traded fund” as an
open-end management investment company (or series or class thereof) or UIT, the shares of which are
listed and traded on a national securities exchange at market prices, and that has formed and operates under
an exemptive order under the Investment Company Act granted by the Commission or in reliance on an
exemptive rule under the Act adopted by the Commission and (ii) “exchange-traded managed fund” as an
open-end management investment company (or series or class thereof) or UIT, the shares of which are
listed and traded on a national securities exchange at NAV-based prices, and that has formed and operates
under an exemptive order under the Investment Company Act granted by the Commission or in reliance on
an exemptive rule under the Act adopted by the Commission. See Investment Company Reporting
Modernization, Investment Company Act Release No. 31610 (May 20, 2015) [80 FR 33590 (June 12,
2015)] (“Investment Company Reporting Modernization Proposing Release”), at n.446 and accompanying
text. In the Investment Company Reporting Modernization Proposing Release, we requested comment on
whether the definitions of the type of funds listed in proposed Form N-CEN were appropriate and if any
different definitions should be used. We did not receive any comments on the proposed definitions of ETF
and ETMF in proposed Form N-CEN, and are adopting the definitions of ETF and ETMF, as proposed.

a. Timing of the Redemption of Fund Shares
Form N-1A requires funds to describe their procedures for redeeming fund shares. 911
Disclosure regarding other important redemption information, such as the timing of payment of
redemption proceeds to fund shareholders, varies across funds as today there are no specific
requirements for this disclosure under the form. Some funds disclose that they will redeem
shares at a price based on the next calculation of net asset value after the order is placed but may
delay payment for up to seven days (consistent with section 22(e) of the Act), and others provide
no specific time periods for the payment. Some funds disclose differences in the timing of
payment of redemption proceeds based on the distribution channel or payment method through
which the fund shares are redeemed, while others do not.
We proposed amendments to Item 11 of Form N-1A that would require a fund to disclose
the number of days in which the fund would pay redemption proceeds to redeeming
shareholders. 912 Under the proposal, if the number of days in which the fund would pay
redemption proceeds differed by distribution channel, the fund also would be required to disclose
the number of days for each distribution channel. 913 We also proposed amendments to Item 11
that would require a fund to disclose the methods that the fund uses to meet redemption

911

See Item 11(c) of Form N-1A, which requires a fund to describe procedures for redeeming fund shares,
including (1) any restrictions on redemptions; (2) any redemption charges; (3) if the fund has reserved the
right to redeem in kind; (4) any procedure that a shareholder can use to sell fund shares to the fund or its
underwriter through a broker-dealer (noting any charges that may be imposed for such service); (5) the
circumstances under which the fund may redeem shares automatically without action by the shareholder in
accounts below a certain number or value of shares; (6) the circumstances under which the fund may delay
honoring a request for redemption for a certain time after a shareholder’s investment; and (7) any
restrictions on, or costs associated with, transferring shares held in street name accounts.

requests. 914 Under the proposal, funds would have been required to disclose whether they use the
methods regularly to meet redemptions or only in stressed market conditions.
Some commenters expressed general support for these new disclosure requirements under
the proposal, stating that this information will improve shareholder and market participant
knowledge regarding fund redemption procedures and liquidity risk management 915 and provide
meaningful information about the general time taken to meet redemptions and the fund’s
approaches to liquidity risk management. 916
Some commenters also expressed concerns with the proposed requirement that funds
disclose the number of days in which a fund will pay redemption proceeds for each distribution
channel, stating that the disclosure could present undue complexity to the prospectus and may
lead to shareholder confusion. 917 In addition, commenters argued that a fund does not always
have a direct contractual relationship with the ultimate beneficial owners of its shares, as there
are often multiple intermediaries between the mutual fund and its shareholder, and that a fund is
not in the best position to disclose to its shareholders a precise timeframe in which an
intermediary will transmit the proceeds of a shareholder’s redemption. 918
We understand that in most cases, the distribution channel through which a shareholder
transacts in fund shares is unlikely to have a material effect on the timing of the payment of
redemption proceeds, but instead that the choice of method of payment of redemption proceeds

916

See ICI Comment Letter I.

See, e.g., Fidelity Comment Letter. See also e.g., Federated Comment Letter (stating that distribution
channel level disclosure is unnecessary and could present undue complexity in prospectus if there are minor
deviations).

918

See Fidelity Comment Letter.

288

will have the most significant effect on when an investor receives proceeds. For example, we
understand that the industry’s central fund transaction processing utility (the NSCC), typically
debits or credits the cash accounts of users of the utility (such as funds or their transfer agents on
one side of the transaction, and intermediaries on behalf of beneficial owners, on the other side
of the transaction) regarding net purchase or redemption activities in shares of a fund on T+1
(and to a lesser extent with respect to certain funds on T+3). Such intermediary users of the
utility would in turn update their account records, including the beneficial owner’s activity, on
that date regardless of the type of book entry securities, account structure, or intermediary that
the beneficial owner holds through. However, if the beneficial owner wishes to receive
remittance of redemption proceeds via check (for example, instead of reinvesting them in another
investment), it may take a certain number of days for the intermediary (or fund, as applicable) to
process and mail the check to the customer. Accordingly, in a change from the proposal, the
final form amendments do not require disclosure on timing of redemption proceeds based on
distribution channel, but instead only require a fund to disclose typical expected payout times
based on the payment method chosen by the investor (e.g., check, wire, automated clearing
house). 919
Thus, under the final amendments, if the number of days a fund expects to pay
redemption proceeds differs by method of payment (e.g., check, wire, automated clearing house),
then the fund is required to disclose the typical number of days or estimated range of days that
the fund expects it will take to pay out redemption proceeds for each method used. 920 This
requirement focuses on disclosing when the fund expects to make the payment, not when the
919

See Item 11(c)(7) of Form N-1A.

920

See id. (emphasis added).

289

shareholder should expect to receive the proceeds, because receipt of proceeds is unlikely to be
in the fund’s control (for example, a fund cannot predict how long a mailed check will take to
arrive). We believe narrowing the disclosure requirement to the effects of payment methods
rather than the effects of all types of distribution channels addresses comments. We also believe
that this modification will increase the quality of information provided to fund shareholders
about the timing of their redemption proceeds and, at the same time, reduce the likelihood that
disclosures regarding such timing will be overly granular and complex for investors and overly
burdensome for registrants. 921
Other commenters expressed concerns about specific aspects of the proposed disclosure
amendments. For example, some commenters stated that requiring funds to disclose the number
of days in which the fund will pay redemption proceeds to redeeming shareholders would
pressure funds to disclose shorter redemption payment periods, thereby limiting funds from
exercising discretion in stressed markets. 922 Other commenters opposed a requirement to
disclose the number of days or methods used to pay redemption proceeds, 923 arguing, for
example, that the disclosure requirement would inappropriately limit the flexibility of a fund to
meet redemptions to timing and methods previously disclosed in its prospectus 924 or would cause
generic disclosures because of the variety of methods available to funds to meet redemptions. 925
One commenter recommended that the Commission narrow the scope of the amendments to only

921

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, section III.G.1.a.

922

See FSR Comment Letter; NYC Bar Comment Letter.

923

Comment Letter.

925

See Federated Comment Letter.

290

the “typical” number of days, methods, and funding sources used for meeting redemption
requests. 926
In consideration of these comments, and in a modification to the proposal, we are
adopting amendments to Item 11 of Form N-1A to require a fund to disclose the number of days
following receipt of shareholder redemption requests in which the fund typically expects to pay
redemption proceeds to redeeming shareholders, 927 rather than the number of days in which the
fund will pay redemption proceeds as proposed. Funds may wish to consider also disclosing
whether payment of redemption proceeds may take longer than the number of days that the fund
typically expects and may take up to seven days as provided in the Investment Company Act.
We appreciate commenters’ concerns, and believe that this adjustment to the language in
Form N-1A will give funds flexibility to provide disclosures about redemption procedures that
do not inappropriately limit a fund’s ability to meet redemptions to the exact timing previously
disclosed in its prospectus. We continue to believe that requiring this disclosure will inform the
public about a critical aspect of a shareholder’s relationship with a fund – when the shareholder
can expect redemption proceeds. Funds generally should disclose timing that reflects their actual
operational procedures for meeting redemption rather than generic disclosures about fund
redemptions, regardless of what other funds in the industry may disclose. We continue to
believe that it is in the public interest to inform investors on the timing of when fund
shareholders should expect redemption proceeds. We believe that this disclosure requirement
will also enhance consistency in fund disclosures regarding the timing in which a fund will pay

926

See ICI Comment Letter I.

927

See Item 11(c)(7) of Form N-1A (emphasis added).

291

redemption proceeds, thereby improving the information provided to shareholders and the ability
of investors to compare redemption procedures across funds.
b. Methods Used to Meet Shareholder Redemption Obligations
As noted above, some commenters opposed a requirement to disclose the methods used
(and number of days) to pay redemption proceeds, arguing, for example, that the disclosure
requirement would inappropriately limit the flexibility of a fund to meet redemptions to timing
and methods previously disclosed in its prospectus or would cause generic disclosures because of
the variety of methods available to funds to meet redemptions. 928 Some commenters generally
opposed requirements for funds to disclose the methods used to meet redemption requests,
stating, for example, that it does not serve a purpose for investors to know precisely how the
fund meets their redemption requests – so long as they receive their redemption proceeds within
the period prescribed by regulation. 929 As noted above, one commenter suggested that we narrow
the scope of the disclosure requirement to only the “typical” methods funds use for meeting
redemption requests. 930
In light of these comments, in a modification to the proposal, we are adopting
amendments to Item 11 of Form N-1A to require a fund to disclose the methods that the fund
typically expects to use to meet redemption requests, and whether those methods are used
regularly, or only in stressed market conditions. 931 We believe requiring that the description of
the procedures for redeeming fund shares include a description of the methods a fund typically

Comment Letter.

931

292

expects to use to meet redemption requests will improve disclosure about another critical aspect
of a shareholder’s relationship with a fund – how a shareholder can expect to receive redemption
proceeds. We appreciate the concerns expressed by commenters and believe that the modified
language in the form provides some needed flexibility for funds while at the same time providing
investors with improved information concerning redemption procedures. Furthermore, this
disclosure requirement will increase consistency in fund disclosure documents regarding fund
redemption practices and improve the comparability of such information across funds. Absent
this amendment, disclosures concerning the methods funds use to pay redemption proceeds will
continue to vary across funds.
We believe that requiring specific disclosure on the methods a fund uses to pay
redemption proceeds could improve investor knowledge on how a fund manages liquidity and its
redemption obligations to shareholders. At the foundation of the prospectus disclosure
framework is the provision to all investors of user-friendly information that is key to an
investment decision. 932 Additionally, given the increase in open-end funds pursuing alternative
and fixed income strategies with varied liquidity risks, 933 the sources of liquidity and methods
used to meet shareholder redemptions are key information that investors need.
Methods to meet redemption obligations may include, for example, sales of portfolio
assets, holdings of cash or cash equivalents, the use of lines of credit and/or interfund lending,
and in-kind redemptions. 934 Funds may also use redemption fees to help mitigate dilution and
address transaction costs associated with shareholder activity. We also believe that requiring this

Investment Companies, Investment Company Act Release No. 28584 (Jan. 13, 2009) [74 FR 4546 (Jan. 26,
2009)] (“N-1A Release”), at section I.

933

See supra section II.C.1.

934

See supra footnote 686 and accompanying text.

293

disclosure could encourage funds to consider their operations and ensure that the methods they
may use to meet shareholder redemption obligations in normal and reasonably foreseeable
stressed markets are viable.
As noted above, Form N-1A requires funds to disclose whether they reserve the right to
redeem their shares in kind instead of in cash and to describe the procedures for such
redemptions. 935 As proposed, we are amending Form N-1A to incorporate this disclosure
requirement into Item 11(c)(8) discussed above. We understand that the use of in-kind
redemptions (outside of the ETF context) historically has been rare and that many funds reserve
the right to redeem in kind only as a tool to manage liquidity risk under emergency
circumstances or to manage the redemption activity of a fund’s large institutional investors. 936
We also are aware that there are often logistical issues associated with redemptions in kind and
that these issues can limit the availability of in-kind redemptions as a practical matter. A fund
should consider whether adding relevant detail to its disclosure regarding in-kind redemptions,
including, for example, whether redemptions in kind will be pro-rata slices of the fund’s
portfolio or individual securities or a representative basket of securities, or revising its disclosure
if the fund would be practically limited in its ability to redeem its shares in kind, would provide
more accurate information to investors.
One commenter expressed concerns that the proposed additional disclosure requirements
in Form N-1A runs against the Commission’s goal of clear and concise, user-friendly

935

See Item 11(c)(3) of Form N-1A.

936

See supra section III.J. We note that funds also have the ability to redeem in kind, subject to the limitations
under rule 18f-1 under the Act for funds that have made an election under the rule. An 18f-1 election
commits a fund to pay in cash all requests for redemption by any shareholder of record, limited in amount
with respect to each shareholder during any 90-day period to the lesser of $250,000 or 1% of the fund’s net
asset value at the beginning of the period.

294

disclosures. 937 We believe that the amendments adopted today in this Release, including specific
modifications in response to commenters, respond appropriately to this commenter’s concern and
are designed to provide disclosures to investors with key information in a clear, concise, and
understandable manner. We believe that investors in an open-end fund should have information
on how the fund expects to meet redemptions and in what time period they expect to pay
redemption proceeds.

We also proposed to amend Item 28 of Form N-1A to require a fund to file as an exhibit
to its registration statement any agreements related to lines of credit for the benefit of the fund to
increase Commission, investor, and market participant knowledge concerning the arrangements
funds have made in order to strengthen their ability to meet shareholder redemption requests and
manage liquidity risk and the terms of those arrangements. 938 In light of concerns expressed by
commenters, we are not adopting amendments to Form N-1A to require the filing of credit
agreements as exhibits to a fund’s registration agreement.
Many commenters objected to the credit agreements exhibit requirement, 939 with some
arguing, for example, that credit agreements are often extremely lengthy documents that are not
user-friendly, 940 the disclosure of which would be unnecessary in light of the lines of credit
reporting requirements in Form N-CEN as well as information concerning lines of credit

937

See Federated Comment Letter.

938

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at section III.G.1 (where we also proposed to include an
instruction related to credit agreements noting that the specific fees paid in connection with the credit
agreements need not be disclosed in the exhibit filed with the Commission to preserve the confidentiality of
this information).

Comment Letter.

disclosed in a fund’s statement of additional information and financial statements. 941 Other
commenters expressed concern that public disclosure of line of credit agreements in a fund’s
registration statement could ultimately harm fund shareholders, noting that public disclosure
could (1) disrupt and weaken a fund’s ability to negotiate credit terms; 942 (2) make public
proprietary and competitive information (e.g., certain representations and warranties) that lenders
and funds may wish to keep confidential and are not easily redacted; 943 and (3) ultimately
discourage lending banks from granting lending terms to funds out of a concern that terms
granted would become standard in other lending agreements. 944
Rather than include line of credit agreements as exhibits, other commenters suggested
including a narrative discussion of lines of credit information, similar to the data required to be
disclosed in Form N-CEN, in a fund’s statement of additional information. 945 Some commenters
did not oppose requiring the filing of line of credit agreements as an exhibit to a fund’s
registration statement if, in addition to redacting fees as proposed, certain other portions of the
agreement were permitted to be redacted. 946
We find the concerns expressed by commenters persuasive and have determined to not
adopt this amendment to Form N-1A. We acknowledge that credit agreements can be lengthy,
complex documents that may be of limited value to retail investors and that the information
provided in the proposed exhibits could be, in part, duplicative of information provided in a

fund’s statement of additional information and financial statements. We believe that requiring
funds to report the use of lines of credit in response to reporting requirements in Form N-CEN is
an appropriate means to increase Commission, investor, and market participant knowledge
concerning the arrangements funds have made in order to strengthen their ability to meet
shareholder redemption requests and manage liquidity risk and the terms of those arrangements.
d. Additional Disclosure Requirements
Some commenters recommended that the Commission require additional disclosures in a
fund’s registration statement about a fund’s specific liquidity risk management policies and
procedures 947 and the market impact costs associated with redemption activity. 948 For example,
one commenter recommended requiring a fund to disclose a narrative of its liquidity risk
management program in its statement of additional information as well as a statement in the fund
prospectus about the liquidity risk appetite of each fund. 949 Another commenter expressed
support for the Commission requiring funds to include a discussion of their liquidity risk
management policies and procedures, similar to what is currently required on Form N-1A for
policies and procedures regarding proxy voting (Items 17 and 27) and valuation procedures (Item
23), among others. 950 In addition, one commenter recommended that we consider requiring a
fund to also disclose the level of “position concentration” that is appropriate for the fund in terms
of portfolio liquidity in light of the fund’s investment strategy and investor profile. 951 While
another commenter recommended that, at a minimum, funds be required to provide disclosures

947

See J.P. Morgan Comment Letter.

951

See BlackRock Comment Letter.

297

noting the possibility of suspending redemptions and how the fund will handle redemption
requests in that situation. 952
We support commenters’ goals of providing useful information about a fund’s liquidity
risk management practices to investors but also remain committed to encouraging statutory
prospectuses that are simple, clear, and useful to investors 953 and registration statements that
provide useful information, rather than boilerplate legal representations. In the interest of
balancing these two goals, we are adopting the proposed amendments to Form N-1A
substantially as proposed without including these specific additional disclosure requirements
suggested by commenters in the text of the form. We note, however, that nothing in Form N-1A
prohibits disclosures about the features of a fund’s liquidity risk management program where
relevant to understanding disclosures under existing reporting requirements.
2. New Form N-LIQUID
We are also adopting a new requirement that open-end investment companies, including
In-Kind ETFs to the extent applicable 954 but not including money market funds (i.e., registrants),
file on a non-public basis a current report to the Commission on new Form N-LIQUID when
certain significant events related to a fund’s liquidity occur. 955 This requirement will be
implemented through our adoption of new rule 30b1-10, which requires funds to file a report on
new Form N-LIQUID in certain circumstances. The content of this report is similar to the

952

See CFA Comment Letter.

953

See N-1A Release, supra footnote 932.

954

As discussed below, some of the events required to be reported on Form N-LIQUID are in connection with
the breach of a fund’s highly liquid investment minimum. See Part D of Form N-LIQUID. Because InKind ETFs are not subject to the highly liquid investment minimum requirement under rule 22e-4(b)(1)(iii),
they would not be subject to this Part D reporting requirement on Form N-LIQUID.

955

See rule 30b1-10.

298

information that we proposed to be reported on Form N-PORT under the proposal concerning a
fund’s investments in illiquid assets, but with some modifications in response to comments. A
report on Form N-LIQUID is required to be filed, as applicable, within one business day of the
occurrence of one or more of the events specified in the form. 956 Form N-LIQUID will be nonpublic. For the same reasons discussed previously regarding our determination to keep
information regarding a fund’s highly liquid investment minimum and specific position level
disclosure of illiquid investments non-public, we find that it is neither necessary nor appropriate
in the public interest or for the protection of investors to make the information filed on Form NLIQUID publicly available. 957
First, a registrant is required to file Form N-LIQUID within one business day when more
than 15% of its net assets are, or become, illiquid investments that are assets as defined in rule
22e-4. 958 If this occurs, the registrant will be required to report on Form N-LIQUID general
information about the registrant as well as (1) the date(s) of the event, (2) the current percentage
of the registrant’s net assets that are illiquid investments that are assets, and (3) identification
information about the illiquid investments. 959
Second, if a registrant whose illiquid investments that are assets previously exceeded
15% of net assets determines that its holdings in illiquid investments that are assets have changed

956

Form N-LIQUID will also require a fund to report the following general information: (1) the date of the
report; (2) the registrant’s central index key (“CIK”) number; (3) the EDGAR series identifier; (4) the
Securities Act file number; and (v) the name, email address, and telephone number of the person authorized
to receive information and respond to questions about the filing. See Part A of Form N-LIQUID.

957

See supra footnote 615 and accompanying text and footnote 743 and accompanying text. Section 45(a) of
the Investment Company Act requires information in reports filed with the Commission pursuant to the
Investment Company Act to be made available to the public, unless we find that public disclosure is neither
necessary nor appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.

958

See Part A and Part B of Form N-LIQUID.

959

See Items A.1 - A.5 and Items B.1 - B.3 of Form N-LIQUID.

299

to be less than or equal to 15% of the registrant’s net assets, then the registrant also is required to
report within one business day (1) the date(s) on which its illiquid investments that are assets fell
to or below 15% of net assets and (2) the current percentage of the registrant’s net assets that are
illiquid investments that are assets. 960
Lastly, a registrant also is required to notify the Commission on Form N-LIQUID within
one business day if its holdings in highly liquid investments that are assets fall to or below the
registrant’s highly liquid investment minimum for more than 7 consecutive calendar days. 961 If
this occurs, a fund is required to report the date(s) on which the fund’s holdings in liquid
investments that are assets fell below the fund’s highly liquid investment minimum.962
As discussed above, we are modifying the 15% standard asset-reporting requirement
originally proposed by incorporating this information into the fourth “illiquid investment”
classification category reported on Form N-PORT. 963 Under the proposal, Form N-PORT would
have required a fund to report, for each portfolio asset, whether the asset is a 15% standard asset
in order to allow our staff and other interested parties to track the extent that funds are holding
15% standard assets and to discern the nature of those holdings and assist these groups in
tracking the fund’s exposure to liquidity risk. 964
Some commenters recommended that the Commission require more detailed reporting
data from funds that hold a larger percentage of securities that are less liquid or illiquid and that
funds should notify the Commission more promptly than the Form N-PORT filing deadline when

a fund’s illiquid assets exceed 15% of net assets, or if the fund otherwise encounters indications
of increased liquidity risk. 965 Other commenters expressed support for the addition of an early
warning notification provision, under which funds would be required to notify the Commission
when illiquid assets held at the end of a business day exceed 15% of net assets and continue to
exceed 15% of net assets three business days after the threshold was first exceeded. 966 Another
commenter expressed the belief that the sheer scale of Americans’ reliance on open-end funds as
an investment instrument and the potential for systemic contagion that arises when funds
confront liquidity challenges must inform any consideration of the Commission’s proposal. 967 In
the commenter’s view, the reporting requirements under the proposal with underlying factorbased analysis was largely discretionary and lacked mandatory requirements, and thereby failed
to adequately account for the potential systemic threat to the nation’s financial stability posed by
liquidity risk. 968
We appreciate the concerns and suggestions raised by commenters and agree that the
Commission should be notified promptly when a fund encounters indications of increased
liquidity risk and believe that new Form N-LIQUID addresses some concerns expressed by
commenters that certain liquidity events that could affect the liquidity of a particular fund and/or
indicate potential liquidity risks across the fund industry require particular attention by
Commission staff. Pursuant to Part B of Form N-LIQUID, registrants will now be required to

965

See, e.g., Charles Schwab Comment Letter (noting that this proposed approach could be similar to the
Commission’s 2015 Derivatives Proposing Release, which has proposed to enhance requirements for funds
whose aggregate exposure to derivatives exceeds 50% of its net assets); see also, e.g., SIFMA Comment
Letter III.

See id.

301

report to the Commission within one business day of when their percentage of illiquid
investments that are assets exceeds (and subsequently falls to or below) 15% of their net
assets. 969 Providing this information more promptly than monthly reporting on Form N-PORT,
as proposed, will be the “early warning notification” that some commenters recommended 970 and
will inform the Commission of potential liquidity stress events at the earliest possible juncture.
Similarly, requiring a registrant to report when its holdings in highly liquid investments that are
assets fall below the registrant’s highly liquid investment minimum will add to this early warning
system and ensure the Commission is made aware of such breaches promptly, rather than later in
reports filed on Form N-PORT. 971 We believe that the information reported on Form N-LIQUID
will assist Commission staff in its monitoring efforts of liquidity, including monitoring of not
only the reporting fund but also funds that may have comparable characteristics to the reporting
fund and could be similarly affected by market events.
Form N-LIQUID also includes general filing and reporting instructions, as well as
definitions of specific terms referenced in the form. 972 These instructions and definitions are intended
to provide clarity to funds and to assist them in filing reports on Form N-LIQUID.

3. Amendments to Form N-CEN
We proposed several reporting items under Part C of Form N-CEN to allow the
Commission and other users to track certain liquidity risk management practices that we expect
funds to use on a less frequent basis than the day-to-day portfolio construction techniques

302

captured by Form N-PORT. 973 We are adopting these reporting requirements substantially as
proposed. Where we have received comments on specific reporting requirements, we discuss
them in more detail below.
a. Lines of Credit, Interfund Lending, and Interfund Borrowing
We are adopting, largely as proposed, but with a modification in response to comment,
the requirement in Form N-CEN that a management company report information regarding the
use of lines of credit, interfund lending, and interfund borrowing. 974 Several commenters
expressed general support for these reporting requirements on Form N-CEN. 975 In a modification
to the proposal, if a fund reports that it has access to a line of credit, for each line of credit the
fund will be required to report whether the line of credit is a committed or uncommitted line of
credit. 976 The fund will be required to report information concerning the size of the line of credit
in U.S. dollars, the name of the institution(s) with which the fund has the line of credit, and
whether the line of credit is for that fund alone or is shared among multiple funds. 977 If the line
of credit is shared among multiple funds, the fund is required to disclose the names and SEC File
numbers of the other funds (including any series) that may use the line of credit. 978 If the fund
responds affirmatively to having available a line of credit, the fund is required to disclose

973

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at section III.G.3.

974

See Item C.20 of Form N-CEN. We have modified the numbering convention for items within Form NCEN from the proposal to be consistent with Form N-CEN as adopted in the Investment Company
Reporting Modernization Adopting Release and to clarify that responses regarding lines of credit, interfund
lending, and interfund borrowing should apply to each line of credit or loan, as applicable.

See Item C.20.a.iv.1 of Form N-CEN. Under Form N-CEN, “SEC File number” means the number
assigned to an entity by the Commission when that entity registered with the Commission in the capacity in
which it is named in Form N-CEN. See General Instruction E to Form N-CEN.

303

whether it drew on the line of credit during the reporting period. 979 If the fund drew on that line
of credit during the reporting period, the fund is required to disclose the average dollar amount
outstanding when the line of credit was in use and the number of days that line of credit was in
use. 980
The Proposing Release included a request for comment on whether funds should be
required to report information on uncommitted lines of credit on Form N-CEN. 981 In general, a
committed line of credit represents a bank’s obligation, in exchange for a fee, to make a loan to a
fund subject to specified conditions. For uncommitted or standby lines of credit, however, a
bank indicates a willingness, but no obligation, to lend to a fund. 982 As one commenter noted,
funds may have certain tools like lines of credit from banks for temporary liquidity management
purposes “when more typical means (e.g., use of new or existing cash or sales of portfolio
holdings) are unavailable or otherwise sub-optimal.” 983 One commenter suggested that funds
report the availability of uncommitted lines of credit in addition to committed lines of credit in
Form N-CEN. 984
In consideration of these comments, we are including in Form N-CEN a requirement for
funds to report the availability and use of committed and uncommitted lines of credit. 985 We
believe that this information will allow our staff and other potential users to assess what sources
of external liquidity are available to funds and to what extent funds rely on dedicated external

sources of liquidity, rather than relying on the liquidity of fund portfolio investments alone, for
liquidity risk management. In addition, we believe that if funds make substantial use of
uncommitted lines of credit, the reporting of that reliance could flag potential vulnerabilities in a
fund or the fund industry, particularly in the event of a market crisis when uncommitted lines of
credit might become unavailable. Furthermore, having funds report information on lines of
credit will also allow monitoring of whether lines of credit are concentrated in particular
financial institutions.
We are adopting, as proposed, the requirement that a fund report whether it engaged in
interfund lending or interfund borrowing during the reporting period, and, if so, the average
amount of the interfund loan when the loan was outstanding and the number of days that the
interfund loan was outstanding. 986 This information will provide some transparency regarding
the extent to which funds use interfund lending or interfund borrowing. We understand that one
reason that funds have sought exemptive relief to engage in interfund lending and borrowing is
to meet redemption obligations if necessary. 987
b. Additional Information Concerning ETFs
In a modification to the proposal, we are requiring that each ETF that complies with rule
22e-4 as an “In-Kind ETF” under the rule, identify itself accordingly in reports on Form
N-CEN. 988 As discussed above, we are adopting certain tailored liquidity risk management
program requirements for ETFs, and certain ETFs that qualify as In-Kind ETFs will not be
required to classify their portfolio investments or comply with the highly liquid investment
986

See Items C.20.b and c of Form N-CEN.

987

For example, we understand that funds may engage in interfund lending and borrowing to pay out
redemption proceeds same-day or T+1 while the fund awaits proceeds from sales of non-traded securities.

988

See Item E.5 of Form N-CEN; see also supra section III.J regarding the definition and treatment of “InKind ETFs” under rule 22e-4.

305

minimum requirement of rule 22e-4. 989 We believe that the In-Kind ETF information reported on
Form N-CEN will be helpful in understanding the volume of ETFs that identify as In-Kind ETFs
and thus are not required to classify their portfolio investments or comply with the highly liquid
investment minimum requirement of rule 22e-4. 990
4. Safe Harbors
Some commenters suggested that the Commission should include a safe harbor and/or
protection from liability as part of the final rule for proposed liquidity-related disclosures. 991 One
commenter recommended that the Commission provide a safe harbor for “forward-looking
statements” given the speculative nature of the proposed disclosures. 992 Another commenter
recommended that the Commission implement measures to shield from liability funds that in
good faith make forward-looking assessments of liquidity at either the asset or portfolio level
that subsequently turn out to materially differ from actual liquidity. 993 One commenter further
suggested that the Commission should include a provision stating that funds and their affiliates
will not face liability for errors in classification or otherwise in implementing their liquidity risk
management programs, and related reports and (if applicable) disclosures, unless (i) the error is
material and (ii) the fund or affiliate acted knowingly or recklessly. Commenters argued that any
safe harbor provision should also make clear that funds and managers would not face liability for
violation of rule 22e-4 based on second-guessing, either by the Commission or by fund
shareholders, of the design of the liquidity risk management program. 994 One commenter
expressed concern that, even if a safe harbor provision were established that protected funds and

989

Id.

990

ETFs that redeem in cash, or that do not qualify otherwise as “In-Kind ETFs” (as defined in rule 22e4(a)(9)) will be subject to the full set of liquidity risk management program elements, including the
classification and highly liquid investment minimum requirements. See rule 22e-4(b)(1)(i)-(iii).

306

directors from Commission enforcement actions, funds and directors could still be subject to
private litigation. 995 We decline to provide such a safe harbor.
M.

Effective and Compliance Dates

We are adopting the following effective and compliance dates, as set forth below.
1. Liquidity Risk Management Program
The compliance date for our liquidity risk management program requirement is
December 1, 2018 for larger entities, and June 1, 2019 for smaller entities. Thus all registered
open-end management investment companies, including open-end ETFs, that are not smaller
entities, will be required to adopt and implement a written liquidity risk management program,
approved by a fund’s board of directors on December 1, 2018, while smaller entities will be
required to do so six months later, on June 1, 2019. 996
In the Proposing Release, the Commission stated that it expected to provide a tiered set of
compliance dates based on asset size. 997 The Commission expected that 18 months after the
991

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter I; LSTA Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter II; T. Rowe Comment
Letter.

992

See FSR Comment Letter.

993

See ICI Comment Letter I (noting that the Commission has precedent for using its authority to shield from
potential liability certain forward-looking information that registrants are required to provide (see, e.g., rule
175 under the Securities Act; rule 3b-6 under the Exchange Act; Item 303(c) of Reg. S-K; and Disclosure
in Management’s Discussion and Analysis about Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate
Contractual Obligations, Securities Act Release No. 33-8182 (Feb. 5, 2003) (regarding MD&A
disclosures)).

994

See SIFMA Comment Letter II.

995

See Federated Comment Letter.

996

The compliance date in the section applies to rule 22e-4, rule 30b1-10, and Form N-LIQUID.

997

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at section III.H. Specifically, for larger entities – namely, funds
that together with other investment companies in the same “group of related investment companies” have
net assets of $1 billion or more as of the end of the most recent fiscal year – the Commission proposed a
compliance date of 18 months after the effective date to comply with the Proposed Rule. For smaller
entities (i.e., funds that together with other investment companies in the same “group of related investment
companies” have net assets of less than $1 billion as of the end of the most recent fiscal year), the proposal
provided for an extra 12 months (or 30 months after the effective date) to comply with proposed rule 22e-4.

307

effective date would provide an adequate period of time for larger entities to prepare internal
processes, policies, and procedures and implement liquidity risk management programs that
would meet the requirements of the rule. 998 We believed that smaller entities would benefit from
having an additional 12 months to establish and implement a written liquidity risk management
program. 999
Most of the commenters who discussed the proposed liquidity risk management program
compliance date(s) opposed tiered compliance and requested at least 30 months to comply.
Some argued larger funds would need at least 30 months to comply because of their size: more
funds and a greater number and variety of investments to classify would require more time. 1000
Others cited operational limitations: a need of adequate time for 1) all funds to properly prepare
processes, policies and procedures; 2) managers to adjust operations and develop reporting
capabilities; and 3) mutual fund boards to review, approve, and implement the program. 1001 The
only commenter that supported tiered compliance requested lengthier compliance dates for both
larger and smaller entities. 1002
After evaluating the comments received, we believe that larger entities would benefit
from an additional period of time to come into compliance with the rules over the 18 months that
was proposed. Therefore, we are providing an additional 6 months for these entities, for a total
of 24 months (i.e., December 1, 2018) to come into compliance. We continue to believe that
smaller entities may face additional or different challenges in coming into compliance with the

308

rules quickly, and are therefore providing an extended compliance period of a total of 30 months
(i.e., June 1, 2019) for such smaller entities.
2. Amendments to Form N-1A, Form N-PORT, and Form N-CEN
In the Proposing Release, the Commission expected to require all initial registration
statements on Form N-1A, and all post-effective amendments that are annual updates to effective
registration statements on Form N-1A, filed six months or more after the effective date, to
comply with the proposed amendments to Form N-1A. 1003 Few commenters discussed the Form
N-1A amendments. One commenter agreed that 6 months was sufficient to comply with the
amendments; 1004 another commenter requested 30 months to comply. 1005 Because we do not
expect that funds will require significant amounts of time to prepare these additional
disclosures, 1006 we are adopting a compliance date for our amendments to Form N-1A of June 1,
2017. This will provide a six month compliance period for these amendments, as proposed.
Similar to the tiered compliance dates for the liquidity classification requirements
(discussed above), we are providing a tiered set of compliance dates based on asset size for the
additions to Form N-PORT and Form N-CEN. 1007 In the Proposing Release, for larger entities,
we expected that 18 months would provide an adequate period of time for funds, intermediaries,
and other service providers to conduct the requisite operational changes to their systems and to
establish internal processes to prepare, validate, and file reports containing the additional
information requested by the proposed amendments to Form N-PORT. Further, we believed that

1006

1007

Id.

309

smaller entities would benefit from extra time to comply and from the lessons learned by larger
investment companies during the adoption period for Form N-PORT. For Form N-CEN, we
proposed a compliance date of 18 months after the effective date to comply with the new
reporting requirements. 1008 We expected that 18 months would provide an adequate period of
time for funds, intermediaries, and other service providers to conduct the requisite operational
changes to their systems and to establish internal processes to prepare, validate, and file reports
containing the additional information requested by the proposed amendments to Form N-CEN.
Multiple commenters, restating their concerns about operational limitations, requested 30 months
for all entities to comply with the Form N-PORT and Form N-CEN amendments. 1009
As discussed above, we are persuaded that larger entities would benefit from extra time
to comply and are therefore providing a compliance date of December 1, 2018 for larger entities
to come into compliance with the additional liquidity-related reporting requirements of Form NPORT and Form N-CEN. This will result in larger funds filing their first reports with additional
liquidity-related information on Form N-PORT, reflecting data as of December 31, no later than
January 31. For smaller entities, the compliance date will be June 1, 2019. This will provide
smaller entities an additional six months to comply with the new liquidity-related reporting
requirements.

risk management program, and to require new disclosures regarding liquidity risk and liquidity
risk management (collectively, the “final liquidity regulations”). Because of the significant
diversity in liquidity risk management practices that we have observed in the fund industry, there
exists the need for enhanced comprehensive baseline regulations instead of only guidance for
fund liquidity risk management. In summary, and as discussed in greater detail in section III
above, the final liquidity regulations include the following:
o New rule 22e-4 will require that each fund stablish a written liquidity risk management
program. A fund’s liquidity risk management program broadly requires a fund to assess,
manage and review the fund’s liquidity risk; to classify the liquidity of each of the fund’s
portfolio investments; to determine a highly liquid investment minimum (except for
funds that hold primarily highly liquid investments); and to limit illiquid investments to
15% of fund investments. The final rule also provides for a tailored program for all ETFs,
but offers some exemptions for In-Kind ETFs. Finally, the rule requires for board
oversight of the liquidity risk management program.
o Amendments to Form N-1A and additional elements of new Form N-PORT and Form
N-CEN will require enhanced fund disclosure and reporting regarding position liquidity
and shareholder redemption practices. New Form N-LIQUID will require more prompt,
non-public notification to the Commission when a fund’s holdings of assets that are
illiquid investments exceed 15% of net assets, or when a fund’s holdings of highly liquid
investments that are assets fall below the fund’s highly liquid investment minimum for
more than 7 consecutive calendar days.
The Commission is sensitive to the economic effects of the final liquidity regulations,
including the benefits and costs as well as the effects on efficiency, competition, and capital
311

formation. The economic effects are discussed below in the context of the primary goals of the
final liquidity regulations.
2. Primary Goals
The primary goals of the final liquidity regulations are to promote investor protection by
reducing the risk that funds will be unable to meet their redemption obligations, elevate the
overall quality of liquidity risk management across the fund industry, increase transparency of
funds’ liquidity risks and risk management practices, and mitigate potential dilution of nontransacting shareholders’ interests. Funds are not currently subject to requirements under the
federal securities laws or Commission rules that specifically require them to maintain a
minimum level of portfolio liquidity (with the exception of money market funds), and follow
Commission guidelines (not rules) that generally limit their investment in illiquid assets. 1010
Additionally, a fund today is only subject to limited disclosure requirements concerning the
fund’s liquidity risk and risk management. 1011 As discussed in the Proposing Release, staff
outreach has shown that funds today engage in a variety of different practices—ranging from
comprehensive and rigorous to minimal and basic—for assessing the liquidity of their portfolios,
managing liquidity risk, and disclosing information about their liquidity risk, redemption
practices, and liquidity risk management practices to investors. 1012 We believe that the enhanced
requirements for funds’ assessment, management, and disclosure of liquidity risk and enhanced
limits on illiquid investment holdings could decrease the chance that funds would be unable to
meet their redemption obligations and mitigate potential dilution of non-redeeming shareholders’

interests.
The final liquidity regulations are also intended to lessen the possibility of early
redemption incentives (and investor dilution) created by insufficient liquidity risk management,
as well as the possibility that investors’ share value will be diluted by costs incurred by a fund as
a result of other investors’ purchase or redemption activity. When a fund experiences significant
redemption requests, it may sell portfolio securities or borrow funds in order to obtain sufficient
cash to meet redemptions. 1013 However, sales of a fund’s portfolio investments conducted in
order to meet shareholder redemptions could result in significant adverse consequences to
non-redeeming shareholders when a fund fails to adequately manage liquidity. For example, if a
fund sells portfolio investments under unfavorable circumstances, this could create dilution for
non-redeeming shareholders. 1014 Funds also may borrow from a bank or use interfund lending
facilities to meet redemption requests, but there are costs (such as interest rates) associated with
such borrowings. Both selling of portfolio investments and borrowing to meet redemption
requests could cause funds to incur costs that would be borne mainly by non-redeeming
shareholders. 1015 These factors could result in dilution of the value of non-redeeming
shareholders’ interests in a fund, 1016 which could create incentives for early redemptions in times
of liquidity stress, and result in further dilution of non-redeeming shareholders’ interests. 1017
There also is a potential for adverse effects on the markets when open-end funds fail to
adequately manage liquidity. For example, the sale of less liquid portfolio investments at

discounted or even fire sale prices when a fund is facing redemption pressures can produce
significant negative price pressure on those investments and correlated investments, which can
impact other investors holding these investments and may transmit stress to other funds or
portions of the markets. 1018 For reasons discussed in detail below, we believe that the liquidity
risk management program requirement, including the enhanced restrictions on holdings of assets
that are illiquid investments, should mitigate the risk of potential shareholder dilution and
decrease the incentive for early redemption in times of liquidity stress.
Finally, the final liquidity regulations are meant to address recent industry developments
that have underscored the significance of funds’ liquidity risk management practices. In recent
years, there has been significant growth in the assets managed by funds with strategies that focus
on holding relatively less liquid investments, such as fixed income funds (including emerging
market debt funds), open-end funds with alternative strategies, and emerging market equity
funds. 1019 There also has been considerable growth in assets managed by funds that exhibit
characteristics that could give rise to increased liquidity risk, such as relatively high investor
flow volatility. 1020 Additionally, as discussed in detail above, standard fund redemption and
securities settlement periods have tended to become significantly shorter over the last several
decades, which has caused funds to satisfy redemption requests within relatively short time
periods (e.g., within T+3, T+2, and next-day periods). 1021 But while fund redemption periods
have become shorter, certain funds, for example, certain bank loan funds and emerging market

debt funds, have increased their holdings of portfolio securities with relatively long settlement
periods, which could result in a liquidity mismatch between when a fund plans or is required to
pay redeeming shareholders, and when any asset sales that the fund has executed in order to pay
redemptions will settle. 1022 Collectively, these industry trends have emphasized the importance
of effective liquidity risk management among funds and enhanced disclosure regarding liquidity
risk and risk management.
B.

Economic Baseline
The final liquidity regulations will affect all funds and their investors, investment

advisers and other service providers, all issuers of the portfolio securities in which funds invest,
and other market participants potentially affected by fund and investor behavior. The economic
baseline of the final liquidity regulations includes funds’ current practices regarding liquidity risk
management and liquidity risk disclosure, as well as the economic attributes of funds that affect
their portfolio liquidity and liquidity risk. These economic attributes include industry-wide
trends regarding funds’ liquidity and liquidity risk management, as well as industry
developments highlighting the importance of robust liquidity risk management by funds.
1. Funds’ Current Practices Regarding Liquidity Risk Management and Liquidity
Risk Disclosure
a. Funds’ Current Liquidity Risk Management Requirements and Practices
Under section 22(e) of the Investment Company Act, a registered investment company is
required to make payment to shareholders for redeemable securities tendered for redemption
within seven days of their tender. 1023 In addition to the seven-day redemption requirement in
1022

See supra footnotes 104, 105, 377, and 378 and accompanying text.

1023

See section 22(e) of the Act. Section 22(e) of the Act provides, in part, that no registered investment
company shall suspend the right of redemption or postpone the date of payment upon redemption of any
redeemable security in accordance with its terms for more than seven days after tender of the security

315

section 22(e), registered investment companies that are sold through broker-dealers are required
as a practical matter to meet redemption requests within three business days because
broker-dealers are subject to rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, which establishes a three-day
(T+3) settlement period for purchases and sales of securities (other than certain types of
securities exempted by the rule) effected by a broker or a dealer, unless a different settlement
period is expressly agreed to by the parties at the time of the transaction. Furthermore, rule
22c-1 under the Act, the “forward pricing” rule, requires funds, their principal underwriters, and
dealers to sell and redeem fund shares at a price based on the current NAV next computed after
receipt of an order to purchase or redeem fund shares, even though cash proceeds from purchases
may be invested or fund investments may be sold in subsequent days in order to satisfy purchase
requests or meet redemption obligations.
With the exception of money market funds subject to rule 2a-7 under the Act, the
Commission has not promulgated rules requiring open-end funds to hold a minimum level of
liquid investments. 1024 The Commission historically has taken the position that open-end funds
should maintain a high degree of portfolio liquidity to ensure that their portfolio securities and
other assets can be sold and the proceeds used to satisfy redemptions in a timely manner in order
to comply with section 22(e) and their other obligations. 1025 The Commission also has stated that
open-end funds have a “general responsibility to maintain a level of portfolio liquidity that is
appropriate under the circumstances,” and to engage in ongoing portfolio liquidity monitoring to
determine whether an adequate level of portfolio liquidity is being maintained in light of the

absent specified unusual circumstances.

316

fund’s redemption obligations. 1026 Open-end funds are also required by rule 38a-1 under the Act
to adopt and implement written compliance policies and procedures reasonably designed to
prevent violations of the federal securities laws, including policies and procedures that provide
for the oversight of compliance by certain of the fund’s service providers, and such policies and
procedures should be appropriately tailored to reflect each fund’s particular compliance risks; the
rule also requires board approval and review of the service providers’ compliance policies and
procedures. 1027 An open-end fund that holds a significant portion of its assets in securities with
long settlement periods or with infrequent trading, or an open-end fund that represents it will pay
redemptions in fewer than seven days, for instance, may be subject to relatively greater liquidity
risks than other open-end funds.
Additionally, long-standing Commission guidelines generally limit an open-end fund’s
aggregate investment in “illiquid assets” to no more than 15% of the fund’s net assets (the “15%
guideline”). 1028 Under the 15% guideline, a portfolio security or other asset is considered illiquid
if it cannot be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business within seven days at
approximately the value at which the fund has valued the investment. 1029 The 15% guideline has
generally limited funds’ exposure to particular types of securities that cannot be sold within
seven days and that the Commission and staff have indicated may be illiquid, depending on the
facts and circumstances. Depositors of UITs are currently required to consider which of their
restricted securities are illiquid. 1030

As noted in the Proposing Release, staff outreach has shown that funds currently employ
a diversity of practices with respect to assessing portfolio investments’ liquidity, as well as
managing liquidity risk. Section II.D.3 above provides an overview of these practices, which
include, among others: assessing the ability to sell particular investments within various time
periods, taking into account relevant market, trading, and other factors; monitoring initial
liquidity determinations for portfolio investments (and modifying these determinations, as
appropriate); holding certain amounts of the fund’s portfolio in highly liquid investments or cash
equivalents; establishing committed back-up lines of credit or interfund lending facilities; and
conducting stress testing relating to the extent the fund has liquid investments to cover possible
levels of redemptions. 1031 Some commenters indicated that they view in-kind redemptions as an
important liquidity risk management tool. 1032 Another commenter noted that ETFs are often used
to help manage liquidity risk because they can allow funds to maintain market exposure while
ensuring sufficient liquidity. 1033 As noted in the Proposing Release, the staff has observed that
some of the funds with relatively more thorough liquidity risk management practices have
appeared to be able to meet periods of high redemptions without significantly altering the risk
profile of the fund or materially affecting the fund’s performance, and thus with few dilutive
impacts. It therefore appears that these funds have generally aligned their portfolio liquidity with
adoption of rule 22e-4).
1031

ability to meet redemptions over certain periods); BlackRock FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra
footnote 85 (discussing several overarching principles that provide the foundation for a prudent market
liquidity risk management framework for collective investment vehicles, including an independent risk
management function, compliance checks to ensure portfolio holdings do not exceed regulatory limits, a
risk management function that is independent from portfolio management, and measuring levels of liquid
assets into “tiers of liquidity”); Invesco FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra footnote 248, at 11

their liquidity needs, and that their liquidity risk management permits them to efficiently meet
redemption requests. Other funds, however, employ portfolio investment liquidity assessment
and liquidity risk management practices that are substantially less rigorous. 1034 As discussed
above in section II.D.3, some funds do not take different market conditions into account when
evaluating portfolio investment liquidity, and do not conduct ongoing liquidity monitoring.
Likewise, some funds do not have independent oversight of their liquidity risk management
outside of the portfolio management process. As a result, funds’ procedures for assessing the
liquidity of their portfolio securities, as well as the comprehensiveness and independence of their
liquidity risk management, vary significantly.
A fund may meet redemption requests in a variety of ways, including by using cash,
borrowing under a line of credit, or by selling portfolio investments. The fund’s portfolio
liquidity as well as its value will be affected by the choice of which investments are sold.
Subsequent portfolio transactions after redemptions are met will also affect portfolio liquidity
and value. For example, a fund facing a large redemption request might lessen the impact on
portfolio value of selling investments by selling the most liquid portion of the portfolio or using
some of its cash or a line of credit. 1035 That choice benefits non-redeeming investors by
minimizing transaction costs and the loss in fund value due to the price impact of selling, but it
also could increase the liquidity risk of the fund portfolio and the fund may incur transaction
costs if it subsequently engages in portfolio transactions such as rebalancing towards its previous
1034

See infra section IV.C.1.b, where the potential consequences of less rigorous liquidity risk management are
discussed in the context of risk management program benefits.

1035

We note that in some instances, selling only the most liquid investments to meet a large redemption could
be inconsistent with the fund’s investment mandate. For example, if a fund’s investment mandate required
it to hold a certain percentage of its portfolio in equities, the fund might not be able to sell a large portion of
its equity holdings to meet redemption requests and still hold the required percentage of its portfolio in
equities.

319

portfolio allocation. 1036 If the fund instead were to sell a “strip” of the portfolio (i.e., a crosssection or representative selection of the fund’s portfolio investments), the immediate impact on
fund value may be greater, but the liquidity of the fund portfolio would be unchanged as a result
of the sale. Funds also could choose to meet redemptions by selling a range of investments in
between their most liquid, on one end of the spectrum, and a perfect pro rata strip of
investments, on the other end of the spectrum. 1037 All of the above ways by which a fund may
meet redemptions potentially occur in conjunction with other strategic portfolio management
decisions, such as opportunistically paring back or eliminating holdings in a particular
investment or sector while meeting redemptions.
Staff analysis of the impact of large redemptions on U.S. equity fund portfolio liquidity is
consistent with the hypothesis that the average U.S. equity fund does not sell a strip of its
portfolio investments to meet large redemptions, but instead appears—based on changes in
funds’ portfolio liquidity following net outflows—to disproportionately sell the more liquid
portion of its portfolio for this purpose. 1038 Similarly, staff analysis shows that after a U.S.
municipal bond fund encounters net outflows, the typical U.S. municipal bond fund will
experience an increase in its holdings of municipal bonds (and a decrease in its holdings of cash

1036

See, e.g., supra footnote 71 (discussing recent circumstances in which, during a year of heavy redemptions
that caused a high yield bond fund’s assets to shrink 33% in this period, the fund’s holdings of lower
quality bonds grew to 47% of assets, from 35% before the redemptions).

1037

Mutual Funds (May 6, 2016) (unpublished working paper), available at
http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2776829. The study presents preliminary evidence
consistent with the notion that corporate bond funds tend to sell proportional “strips” of their portfolios
during periods of high market volatility and disproportionately sell more liquid assets during periods of
lower market volatility.

and cash equivalents), potentially decreasing the fund’s overall portfolio liquidity. 1039
b. Funds’ Current Liquidity Risk Disclosure Requirements and Practices
Items 4 and 9 of Form N-1A require a fund to disclose the principal risks of investing in
the fund. 1040 A fund currently must disclose the risks to which the fund’s portfolio as a whole is
expected to be subject and the circumstances reasonably likely to adversely affect the fund’s
NAV, yield, or total return. 1041 Some funds currently disclose that liquidity risk is a principal risk
of investing in the fund, but often do so in a generic way.
Item 11 of Form N-1A requires a fund to describe its procedure for redeeming fund
shares, including restrictions on redemptions, any redemption charges, and whether the fund has
reserved the right to redeem in kind. 1042 Disclosure regarding other redemption information, such
as the timing of payment of redemption proceeds to fund shareholders, varies across funds as
there are currently no specific requirements for this disclosure. Some funds disclose that they
will redeem shares within a specific number of days after receiving a redemption request, other
funds disclose that they will honor such requests within seven days (as required by section 22(e)
of the Act), and others provide no specific time periods. Additionally, some funds disclose
differences in the timing of payment of redemption proceeds based on the payment method by
which the fund shares are redeemed, while others do not.
Funds are not currently required to disclose information about the liquidity of their
portfolio investments. However, some funds voluntarily disclose in their registration statements
any specific limitations applicable to the fund’s investment in 15% guideline assets, as well as

types of assets considered by the fund to be subject to the 15% guideline.
Form N-1A does not currently require funds to disclose information about liquidity risk
management practices such as the establishment (or use) of committed back-up lines of credit. A
fund is, however, required to disclose information regarding the amount and terms of unused
lines of credit for short-term financing, as well as information regarding related party
transactions in its financial statements or notes thereto. 1043
2. Fund Industry Developments Regarding Funds’ Liquidity Risk Management
a. Overview
Below we discuss the size and growth of the U.S. fund industry generally, as well as the
growth of various investment strategies within the industry. We show that the fund industry has
grown significantly in the past two decades, and during this period, funds with international
strategies, fixed income funds, and funds with alternative strategies have grown particularly
quickly. We also determine the types of funds that demonstrate notably volatile and
unpredictable flows. Because volatility and predictability in a fund’s flows can affect the extent
to which the fund is able to meet expected and reasonably foreseeable redemption requests
without diluting the interests of fund shareholders, assessing trends regarding these factors can
provide information about sectors of the fund industry that could be particularly susceptible to
liquidity risk.
While we believe that these trends are relevant from the perspective of addressing
potential liquidity risk in the fund industry (and in funds’ underlying portfolio investments), we
emphasize that liquidity risk is not confined to certain types of funds or investment strategies.
Although we recognize that certain fund characteristics could make a fund relatively more prone
1043

See 210.5-02.19(b) and 210.4-08(k) of Regulation S-X.

322

to liquidity risk, we believe that all types of funds entail liquidity risk to some extent. 1044 Thus,
while in this section we discuss certain types of funds and strategies that are generally considered
to exhibit increased liquidity risk, we are not asserting that only these types of funds and
strategies involve liquidity risk, or that a fund of the type and with the strategy discussed below
necessarily demonstrates greater liquidity risk than a fund that does not have these same
characteristics.
b. Size and Growth of the U.S. Fund Industry and Various Investment Strategies Within the
Industry
Open-end funds and ETFs manage a significant and growing amount of assets in U.S.
financial markets. As of the end of 2015, there were 10,633 open-end funds (excluding money
market funds, but including ETFs), as compared to 5,279 at the end of 1996. 1045 The assets of
these funds were approximately $15.0 trillion in 2015, having grown from about $2.63 trillion in
1996. 1046 Within these figures, the number of ETFs and ETFs’ assets have increased notably in
the past decade. There were 1,594 ETFs in 2015, as opposed to a mere 119 in 2003, and ETFs’
assets have increased from $151 billion in 2003 to $2.1 trillion in 2015.1047
U.S. equity funds represent the greatest percentage of U.S. open-end fund industry
assets. 1048 Open-end U.S. equity funds, excluding ETFs, money market funds and variable
annuities, held 44.7% of U.S. fund industry assets as of the end of 2015. The investment
strategies with the next-highest percentages of U.S. fund industry assets are foreign equity funds
1044

See supra section III.A.2.

1045

See 2016 ICI Fact Book, supra footnote 11, at 22, 176, 183. Specifically, as of the end of 2015, there were
9,039 open-end mutual funds (including funds that invest in other funds) and 1,594 ETFs. There were
approximately 50 ETFs that invest in other ETFs, which are not included in our figures.

(16.7%), general bond funds (13.2%), and mixed strategy funds (12.3%). 1049 Funds with
alternative strategies 1050 only represent a small percentage of the U.S. fund industry assets, but as
discussed below, the number of alternative strategy funds and the assets of this sector have
grown considerably in recent years. 1051
While the overall growth rate of funds’ assets has been generally high (about 7.2% per
year, between the years 2000 and 2015 1052), it has varied significantly by investment strategy. 1053
U.S. equity funds’ assets grew substantially in terms of dollars from the end of 2000 to 2015, 1054
but this sector’s assets as a percentage of total U.S. fund industry assets decreased from about
65% to about 45% during that same period. 1055 Like U.S. equity funds, the assets of U.S.
corporate bond funds, government bond funds, and municipal bond funds also increased in terms
of dollars from 2000 to 2015, but each of these sectors’ assets as a percentage of the fund
industry decreased during this period. 1056 On the other hand, the assets of foreign equity funds,

securities funds, and flexible portfolio funds.

Alternative funds are funds that seek total returns through the use of alternative investment strategies,
including but not limited to equity market neutral, long/short equity, global macro, event driven, credit

Id. U.S. corporate bond funds held about $95 billion at the end of 2015, as opposed to $66 billion in 2000;
these funds’ assets as a percentage of the U.S. fund industry decreased from 1.5% in 2000 to 0.8% in 2015.
U.S. government bond funds held about $174 billion at the end of 2015, as opposed to $91 billion in 2000;
these funds’ assets as a percentage of the U.S. fund industry decreased from 2.1% in 2000 to 1.4% in 2015.
U.S. municipal bond funds held about $592 billion at the end of 2015, as opposed to $278 billion in 2000;
these funds’ assets as a percentage of the U.S. fund industry decreased from 6.3% in 2000 to 4.7% in 2015.

general bond funds, and foreign bond funds increased steadily and substantially as a percentage
of the fund industry over the same period. 1057 For example, foreign equity funds increased
steadily from 10.6% of total industry assets in 2000 to 16.7% in 2015. And within these three
investment strategies, certain investment subclasses (emerging market debt and emerging market
equity) have grown particularly quickly from 2000 to 2015. 1058 The overall growth rate of funds’
assets between the years 2000 and 2015 was greater for index funds (12.3%) than actively
managed funds (4.9%). 1059
The assets of funds with alternative strategies 1060 also have grown rapidly in recent years.
From 2005 to 2015, the assets of alternative strategy funds grew from $366 million to $310
billion, and from the end of 2011 to the end of 2013, the assets of alternative strategy funds grew
by an average rate of almost 80% each year. However, as discussed above, funds with
alternative strategies remain a relatively small portion of the U.S. fund industry as a percentage
of total assets. 1061

1057

Id. Foreign equity funds held about $2.1 trillion in 2015, as opposed to $465 billion in 2000. U.S. general
bond funds held about $1.7 trillion at the end of 2015, as opposed to $240 billion in 2000; these funds’
assets as a percentage of the U.S. fund industry increased from 5.4% in 2000 to 13.2% in 2015. Foreign
bond funds held about $244 billion at the end of 2015, as opposed to $19 billion in 2000; these funds’
assets as a percentage of the U.S. fund industry increased from 0.4% in 2000 to 1.9% in 2015.

1058

DERA Study, supra footnote 95, at 9. Emerging market debt and emerging market equity funds held about
$289 billion at the end of 2015, as opposed to $20 billion in 2000. The assets of emerging market debt
funds and emerging market equity funds grew by an average of 18.1% and 19.8%, respectively, each year

c. Significance of Fund Industry Developments
The industry developments discussed above are notable for several reasons. The growth
of funds generally over the past few decades demonstrates that investors have increasingly come
to rely on investments in funds to meet their financial needs. 1062 These trends also demonstrate
growth in particular types of funds that may entail increased liquidity risk. In particular, there
has been significant growth in high-yield bond funds, emerging market debt funds, and funds
with alternative strategies. Commissioners and Commission staff have previously spoken about
the need to focus on potential liquidity risks relating to fixed income assets and fixed income
funds, 1063 and within this sector, funds that invest in high-yield bonds could be subject to greater
liquidity risk as they invest in lower-rated bonds that tend to be less liquid than investment grade
fixed income securities. 1064 Emerging market debt funds may invest in relatively illiquid
securities with lengthy settlement periods. 1065 Likewise, funds with alternative strategies may
hold portfolio investments that are relatively illiquid. 1066 Moreover, Commission staff

1064

The Commission and Commission staff have cautioned that high yield securities may be considered to be
illiquid, depending on the facts and circumstances. See Interval Fund Proposing Release, supra footnote
41; see also SEC Investor Bulletin, What Are High-Yield Corporate Bonds?, SEC Pub. No. 150 (June
2013), available at http://www.sec.gov/investor/alerts/ib_high-yield.pdf (noting that high-yield bonds may
be subject to more liquidity risk than, for example, investment-grade bonds). But see Who Owns the
Assets?, supra footnote 378 (discussing the liquidity characteristics of high-yield bond funds in depth, and
noting that these funds have weathered multiple market environments, and are generally managed with
multiple sources of liquidity).

1065

See, e.g., supra footnote 377 and accompanying text (discussing the settlement cycles associated with
transactions in certain foreign securities); see also Reuters, Fitch: Close Look at EM Corporate Bond
Trading Reveals Liquidity Risks (Apr. 16, 2015), available at

supra footnote 378 (discussing the liquidity characteristics of emerging market debt funds in depth, and
noting that these funds tend to hold a portion of their assets in developed market government bonds
(providing further liquidity), generally establish limits on less liquid issuers, and generally maintain
allocations to cash for liquidity and rebalancing purposes).

326

economists have found that both foreign bond funds (including emerging market debt funds) and
alternative strategy funds have historically experienced relatively more volatile and
unpredictable flows than the average mutual fund, 1067 which could increase these funds’ liquidity
risks by making it more likely that a fund may need to sell portfolio investments in a manner that
creates a market impact in order to pay redeeming shareholders.
One commenter has argued that flow volatility, which staff economists have used as a
measure of liquidity risk, does not necessarily translate into liquidity risk. 1068 In this
commenter’s view, for example, a fund with volatile but predictable flows may have less
liquidity risk than a fund with less volatile but less predictable flows. Likewise, a U.S. equity
fund could have much greater flow volatility than a foreign bond mutual fund without having
greater liquidity risk because the equity fund’s assets are more liquid. However, differences in
average flow volatility between fund categories persist after accounting for predictability, and
the analysis suggests that changes in flow volatility may influence the management of fund
liquidity. 1069 Flow volatility is not the sole determinant of liquidity risk for a fund, but it is an
important determinant, which makes it useful in helping understand differences in potential
liquidity risk within and between fund categories.
The same commenter has also suggested that the same approach of measuring liquidity
risk does not consider the usage of derivatives in managing volatile flows, noting that they are
often more liquid than their underlying assets. 1070 We acknowledge that derivatives could play a
role in managing fund flows. As is the case for corporate bond holding data, data on fund

C.

Benefits and Costs, and Effects on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital
Formation
Taking into account the goals of the final liquidity regulations and the economic baseline,

as discussed above, this section discusses the benefits and costs of the final liquidity regulations,
as well as the potential effects of the final liquidity regulations on efficiency, competition, and
capital formation. This section also discusses reasonable alternatives to rule 22e-4 and the
disclosure and reporting requirements regarding funds’ liquidity risk and liquidity risk
management.
1. Rule 22e-4
a. Summary of Rule 22e-4’s Requirements
Rule 22e-4 will require each fund to establish a written liquidity risk management
program. The rule specifies that a fund’s liquidity risk management program shall include the
following required program elements: (i) assessment, management, and periodic review of the
fund’s liquidity risk; (ii) classification of the liquidity of each of the fund’s portfolio investments
based on asset class, so long as the fund or its adviser does not have information about any
market, trading, or investment-specific considerations that are reasonably expected to
significantly affect the liquidity characteristics of an investment that would suggest a different
classification for that investment; 1071 (iii) determining and periodically reviewing a highly liquid
investment minimum and adopting and implementing policies and procedures for responding to a
shortfall of the fund’s assets that are highly liquid investments below its highly liquid investment

1071

Rule 22e-4 (b)(1)(ii)

328

minimum; (iv) prohibiting the fund’s acquisition of “illiquid investments” (that is, any
investment that the fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market
conditions in seven calendar days or less without the sale or disposition significantly changing
the market value of the investment) if, following the acquisition, the fund would hold more than
15% of its net assets in assets that are illiquid investments; (v) requiring a fund whose illiquid
investments that are assets exceed 15% of its net assets to conduct certain board reporting; and
(vi) for funds that engage in, or reserve the right to engage in, redemptions in kind, establishing
policies and procedures regarding how and when it will engage in such redemptions in kind. 1072
A fund’s board, including a majority of the fund’s independent directors, will be required to
provide general oversight of the fund’s liquidity risk management program, but the board would
not have to approve the fund’s highly liquid investment minimum.1073 The fund will be required
to designate the fund’s adviser or officer(s) responsible for administering the program, and such
designation is required to be approved by the fund’s board of directors. 1074 The fund’s board will
also be required to review, at least annually, a written report prepared by the fund’s investment
adviser or officer(s) administering the liquidity risk management program reviewing the
adequacy and effectiveness of the implementation of the fund’s liquidity risk management
program, including the fund’s highly liquid investment minimum, and the effectiveness of its
implementation. 1075
Rule 22e-4 also includes certain recordkeeping requirements. A fund will be required to
keep a written copy of its liquidity risk management policies and procedures, as well as copies of

Proposed rule 22e-4(b)(2)(iv).

any materials provided to the fund’s board in connection with the approval of the initial liquidity
risk management program and annual board reporting requirement. 1076 A fund will also be
required to keep a written record of how its highly liquid investment minimum, and any
adjustments thereto, were determined. 1077
In addition, two types of funds are subject to tailored requirements by the final rule.
First, funds that primarily hold highly liquid assets do not have to establish a highly liquid
investment minimum as part of their liquidity risk management programs. 1078 Second, ETFs are
required to assess and manage liquidity risk with respect to certain additional factors tailored to
the specific risks of ETFs. 1079 However, an ETF that meets the final rule’s definition of an “InKind ETF” is not required to establish a highly liquid investment minimum or to classify its
individual portfolio holdings. 1080
In addition to the special treatment of In-Kind ETFs and primarily highly liquid funds,
the final rules differ from the proposed version in several ways that may have economic
consequences: (1) it integrates the definition of illiquid investments subject to the 15% illiquid
investment limit as a part of the portfolio classification process, requiring the consideration of
market, trading, and investment-specific factors and market depth in determining whether an
investment is illiquid, as well as the periodic review of this assessment at least monthly; (2) it
reduces the number of categories used to classify portfolio investment liquidity from six to four
and requires fewer long-term liquidity projections; (3) it simplifies portfolio position

classification by allowing them to be based on asset classes, with customized exceptions for
individual positions where necessary; 1081 (4) it does not prohibit the acquisition of less liquid
investments if a fund goes below its highly liquid investment minimum, but instead requires that
a fund report to its board if it goes below its highly liquid investment minimum, and, if the
shortfall lasts more than 7 consecutive calendar days, also requires reporting to the Commission;
(5) it requires that a fund’s board approve and annually review a report concerning its liquidity
risk management program, but generally does not require the board to approve the highly liquid
investment minimum (except in some circumstances) or material changes to these programs; (6)
it requires that a fund assess its liquidity risk with respect to several factors, where applicable, in
both stressed and normal market conditions, whether its strategy is appropriate for an open-ended
fund, and whether its strategy involves a concentrated portfolio or large positions in particular
issuers; 1082 (7) it requires that principal underwriters or depositors of UITs to determine, on or
before the date of the initial deposit of portfolio securities into a UIT, that the portion of the
illiquid investments that the UIT holds or will hold at the date of deposit that are assets is
consistent with the redeemable nature of the securities that it issues; and (8) requires that In-Kind
ETFs offer daily transparency by posting on the ETF’s website on each day that the national
securities exchange on which the fund’s shares are listed is open for business, before
commencement of trading of fund shares on the exchange, the identities and quantities of the
securities, assets or other positions held by the fund, or its respective master fund, that will form
the basis for the fund’s calculation of net asset value at the end of the business day.

Rule 22e-4(b)(1)(iii)(A)-(C).

331

b. Benefits
Rule 22e-4, as adopted, should produce the same broad benefits for current and potential
fund investors as discussed in the proposal. Where appropriate, we discuss below any changes in
these benefits due to differences between the proposed and final rules. Specifically, the liquidity
risk management program requirements are likely to improve investor protection by decreasing
the chance that some funds may be unable to meet their redemption obligations, would meet such
obligations by diluting the fund’s shares, or would meet such obligations through methods that
would have other adverse impacts on non-redeeming investors (e.g., increased risk exposure and
decreased liquidity). To the extent that some funds do not currently meet the liquidity risk
management standards required by the rule—either by meeting the rule’s minimum baseline
requirements for fund assessment and management of liquidity risk or via alternative liquidity
risk management approaches—investor protection will be enhanced by imposing these minimum
requirements on funds.
We believe that the liquidity risk management program requirement should promote
improved alignment of the liquidity of the fund’s portfolio with the fund’s expected (and
reasonably foreseeable) levels of redemptions. As discussed above, rule 22e-4 will require each
fund to classify the liquidity of its portfolio investments in assessing its liquidity risk, and to
determine a highly liquid investment minimum to increase the likelihood that the fund will hold
adequate liquid investments to meet redemption requests without significant dilution. Each fund
will have flexibility to determine the particular investments that it holds in connection with its
highly liquid investment minimum. Assets eligible for inclusion in a fund’s highly liquid
investment minimum could include a broad variety of securities, as well as cash and cash
equivalents. While one fund may conclude that it is appropriate to hold a significant portion of
332

its assets that are highly liquid investments in cash and cash equivalents, another could decide it
is appropriate to hold assets that are convertible to cash within longer periods (but not exceeding
three business days) as the majority of its highly liquid investments. The highly liquid
investment minimum requirement should allow funds to continue to meet a wide variety of
investors’ investment needs by obliging funds to maintain appropriate liquidity in their
portfolios. The proposed rule would have required funds to set a firm three-day liquid asset
minimum, prohibiting the acquisition of relatively less liquid assets until a fund was back above
its minimum, instead of allowing them to operate below the minimum with board notification, so
the final rule should mitigate any unfavorable market effects related to the systematic purchase
or sale of investments once a strict minimum was exceeded. In extreme cases—for example, if
investments that the fund sought to purchase were trading at fire sale prices due to a market
event—a fund could go below its minimum to trade opportunistically. However, that might
cause the fund to operate below its highly liquid investment minimum for more than 7
consecutive calendar days, requiring reporting to the fund’s board and the Commission within
one business day, so funds may be hesitant to take advantage of attractive market prices when
they are close to their minimum under the final rule. The ability to deviate from the minimum
for up to 7 consecutive calendar days with required reporting at the next regular board meeting,
or for longer periods provided the fund reports to the board and the Commission, could also
reduce the likelihood that funds set artificially low minimums, which would be less protective of
investors than a minimum with some flexibility built in such as the one we are adopting. The
limitation on the acquisition of assets that are illiquid investments to no more than 15% of net
assets, along with the corresponding enhancements to how investment illiquidity is assessed,
complements the highly liquid investment minimum requirement by increasing the likelihood
333

that a fund’s portfolio is not overly concentrated in investments whose liquidity is limited.
Furthermore, the additional board reporting requirements triggered when a fund’s illiquid
investments that are assets exceed 15% of net assets decreases the likelihood that a fund’s
portfolio is overly concentrated in investments classified as illiquid for an extended period of
time without board oversight.
We believe that the rule also will decrease the probability that a fund will need to meet
redemption requests through activities that can materially affect the fund’s NAV or risk profile
or dilute the interests of fund shareholders. For example, when a fund is insufficiently liquid or
does not effectively manage liquidity and is faced with significant redemptions, or both, it may
be forced to sell portfolio investments under unfavorable circumstances, which could create
significant negative price pressure on those investments. 1083 This, in turn, could disadvantage
non-redeeming shareholders by decreasing the value of those shareholders’ interests in the
fund. 1084 Even if a fund were to sell the most liquid portion of its portfolio to meet redemption
requests, which would minimize the loss in fund value due to the price impact of selling, these
asset sales could decrease the liquidity of the fund portfolio, potentially creating increased
liquidity risk for non-redeeming shareholders. As discussed above, staff analysis is consistent
with the hypothesis that U.S. equity funds may disproportionally sell more liquid assets,
especially when facing significant outflows, as opposed to selling a pro rata “strip” of the fund’s
portfolio assets, which minimizes price impact on a fund in the short term, but ultimately
decreases the liquidity of the fund’s portfolio. 1085 Short-term borrowings by a fund to meet
1083

See Coval & Stafford, supra footnote 86 (discussing how mutual fund fire sales impact asset prices).

1084

While the impact of fire sales on asset prices may be short lived in some instances, Coval and Stafford
show that the impact of fire sales can often take many months to dissipate. Id.

1085

See supra footnote 1038 and accompanying text.

334

redemption requests could also disadvantage non-redeeming shareholders by leveraging the
fund, which requires the fund to pay interest on the borrowed funds (although, in some instances,
the costs of borrowing may be less than the costs of selling assets to meet redemptions) and
magnifies any gains or losses to non-redeeming shareholders. Moreover, the costs of borrowing
(that is, the costs associated with maintaining a committed line of credit, as well as interest
expenses associated with drawing on a credit line) could be passed on to fund shareholders in the
form of fund operating expenses, which adversely affect a fund’s NAV. To the extent that the
program requirement results in liquidity risk assessment and management that enhance funds’
ability to meet redemption obligations, it will be less likely that a fund takes actions to pay
redemptions that cause dilution or have other adverse impacts on non-redeeming shareholders.
The potential negative consequences of asset sales undertaken to pay fund redemptions
could create early redemption incentives in times of liquidity stress, or a “first-mover
advantage.” 1086 For example, academic studies have suggested that an incentive exists for market
participants to front-run trades conducted by a fund in response to significant changes in fund
flows. 1087 This suggests that sophisticated fund investors could anticipate that significant fund
outflows could lead a fund to conduct trades that would disadvantage non-redeeming
shareholders, which could create an incentive to redeem ahead of such trades. If investors’
redemptions are motivated by a first-mover advantage, this could lead to increasing levels of
redemptions, and as the level of outflows from a fund increases, the incentive to redeem also

1086

See supra footnote 85 and accompanying text (discussing the possibility of a first-mover advantage with
respect to the timing of shareholder redemption from funds, but also arguments that such a first-mover
advantage does not exist in funds, as well as arguments that even if incentives to redeem ahead of other
shareholders do exist, this does not necessarily imply that investors will in fact redeem en masse in times of
market stress).

1087

See Coval & Stafford, supra footnote 86; Dyakov & Verbeek, supra footnote 86.

335

increases. Any negative effects on non-redeeming shareholders thus could be magnified by a
first-mover advantage to the extent that this dynamic produces growing redemptions and
decreasing portfolio liquidity. The first-mover advantage is more commonly discussed with
respect to money market funds, especially institutional prime money market funds that operated
under a fixed NAV prior to the 2014 reform (that will become effective October 14, 2016), but
the incentives that have been argued to create the first-mover advantage among those funds could
in theory exist (in possibly weaker form) among other open-end funds. We agree with
commenters that the empirical support for the existence of a first-mover advantage is not
conclusive and that the mutual fund industry has been able to successfully navigate periods of
historical market stress. 1088 While we understand that fund investors may not have historically
been motivated to redeem on account of a perceived (or actual) first-mover advantage during
previous periods of stress, we cannot predict how investors may behave in the future. To the
extent that economic incentives exist to redeem fund shares prematurely, such redemptions could
lead to investor dilution as discussed above, and the possibility of protecting against this
potential dilution could be one benefit of rule 22e-4.
The program requirement aims to promote a minimum baseline for liquidity risk
management in the fund industry. This should promote investor protection by elevating the
overall quality of liquidity risk management across the fund industry, reducing the likelihood that
funds will meet redemption obligations only through activities that could significantly dilute

1088

fund shareholders’ redemptions are largely driven by other concerns rather than a theoretical first-mover
advantage).

336

shareholders or adversely affect fund risk profiles. Shareholders in funds that already engage in
strong liquidity risk management practices may be less likely to benefit from the program
requirement, or may benefit less, than shareholders in funds that do not employ equally rigorous
practices. We cannot quantify the total benefits to fund operations and investor protection that
we discuss above, but to the extent that staff outreach has noted that some funds currently have
no (or very limited) formal liquidity risk management programs in place, rule 22e-4 would
enhance current liquidity risk management practices.
Finally, to the extent that the program requirement results in funds less frequently
needing to sell portfolio investments in unfavorable market conditions in order to meet
redemptions, the requirement also could lower potential spillover risks that funds could pose to
the financial markets generally. If, as a result of the program requirement, a fund was prepared
to meet redemption requests in other ways, the rule could decrease the risk that the fund might
indirectly transmit stress to other market sectors and participants. The rule should help ensure
that all funds, not just those with liquidity risk management practices currently in place, operate
in a manner that lessens the chance of spillover risks. We are unable to quantify this potential
benefit because we cannot predict the extent to which funds would enhance their current liquidity
risk management practices as a result of rule 22e-4, or predict the precise circumstances that
could entail negative spillover effects in light of less-comprehensive liquidity risk management
by funds. 1089
Commenters generally did not disagree with the benefits of the proposed rule, with any
exceptions noted in the above discussion of rule 22e-4’s benefits. As discussed above, the final

1089

The ability of the Commission to perform such analysis is limited by difficulties in both gathering data
about funds’ liquidity risk management practices and quantifying such data.

337

rule differs from the proposal in several key respects, but it largely preserves the proposed rule’s
benefits. First, funds that primarily hold assets that are highly liquid investments are not
required to establish a highly liquid investment minimum, so any benefits that might have
accrued to shareholders of these funds under the proposed rule may be diminished. However,
these funds are less likely to be exposed to the liquidity risks discussed above to the same degree
as other funds, so any loss in benefits should be negligible and is likely to be less than the costs
of establishing a minimum. Similarly, In-Kind ETFs are exempt from certain aspects of the final
rule, because the benefits of those aspects of the final rule would have been insignificant for InKind ETFs. The final rule instead achieves benefits with respect to ETFs by replacing these lessapposite requirements with new tailored requirements for ETFs that are designed to promote the
proper management of ETF liquidity, focused on preventing the arbitrage mechanism that keeps
ETFs priced properly from being adversely impacted by a lack of liquidity. In addition, the new
requirement for daily transparency will permit the sophisticated authorized participants that
directly interact with the ETF to effectively evaluate the liquidity of the ETF’s holdings. Since
nearly all In-Kind ETFs already provide daily transparency as a matter of course, we believe no
additional costs arise for In-Kind ETFs. 1090
Second, modifications to the proposal allow funds to classify portfolio investments via
assignments to asset classes as a default, but require them to classify specific investments
separately if they merit special attention, 1091 which preserves the benefits of investment liquidity
1090

We note that ETMFs are not required to provide such daily transparency under their orders, and thus would
need to choose to provide such daily transparency if they wished to take advantage if this provision.
Choosing to take advantage of this provision is within the discretion of ETFs that could potentially qualify
as In-Kind. As discussed in the PRA section below, we estimate that not all ETFs would qualify as In-kind,
either because of their use of cash for redemptions or because of their choice not to provide daily
transparency of holdings.

1091

See supra footnote 1064 and accompanying text.

338

classification without imposing the additional cost of individually classifying each portfolio
position in all cases. Third, the rule’s simplification of classification categories from six to four,
with shorter-term horizons, still provides a reasonably nuanced view of a fund portfolio’s
position-level liquidity while responding to commenters’ concerns that the proposed rule’s more
detailed classification would have required too much precision at long-term horizons and would
not accurately reflect a fund’s actual liquidity profile. Fourth, the final rule should preserve the
benefits of board oversight of a fund’s liquidity risk management program without requiring that
board members approve the highly liquid investment minimum (except in certain circumstances).
The modifications to the board’s role make the board’s involvement in the liquidity risk
management more consistent with the board’s historical duty to provide oversight (instead of
day-to-day management).
Changes to the final rule could also provide additional benefits relative to the proposal.
While the final rule clarifies that the factors a fund should consider in devising a liquidity risk
management program may be considered as appropriate, it also requires that funds consider two
additional factors—whether a given strategy is appropriate in an open-ended fund or involves a
concentrated portfolio or concentrated positions in particular issuers—which could improve the
risk management program’s effectiveness for funds that do not already consider these factors.
The final rule also more precisely specifies criteria for both the initial and ongoing assessment of
whether investments should be classified as illiquid under the 15% illiquid investment limit by
tying it to the same criteria used in assigning investments to other liquidity categories (including
considering relevant market, trading, and investment-specific considerations, and market depth),
which should reduce a firm’s compliance burdens relative to the proposed rule while at the same
time providing a more precise picture of how exposed to illiquid investments a given fund is.
339

Finally, while UITs were not subject to rule 22e-4 under the proposal, the final rule requires that
the principal underwriter or depositor of a UIT will be required to determine, on or before the
date of the initial deposit of portfolio securities into the UIT, that the portion of illiquid
investments the UIT holds or will hold at the date of deposit that are assets is consistent with the
redeemable nature of the securities it issues. This enhancement of the final rule over the
proposal could benefit investors by reducing the likelihood that a UIT could be created that holds
an excessive amount of illiquid securities, which in turn would reduce the liquidity risk
associated with UITs.
c. Costs
One-Time and Ongoing Costs Associated With Program Establishment and
Implementation
Funds will incur one-time costs to establish and implement a liquidity risk management
program in compliance with rule 22e-4, as well as ongoing program-related costs. As discussed
above, funds today employ a range of different practices, with varying levels of quality, for
assessing the liquidity of their portfolio investments and managing fund liquidity risk.
Accordingly, funds whose practices regarding portfolio investment liquidity classification and
liquidity risk assessment and management most closely align with the liquidity risk management
program requirements would incur relatively lower costs to comply with rule 22e-4. Funds
whose practices for classifying the liquidity of their portfolio investments and for assessing and
managing liquidity risk are less thorough or not closely aligned with the rule, on the other hand,
may incur relatively higher initial compliance costs.
Some commenters suggested that the estimates of costs in the rule proposal were
significantly understated and that the true costs of compliance with the rule requirements would

340

likely exceed the expected benefits. 1092 Another commenter suggested that costs were
underestimated because other fund systems would also have to be modified to ensure compliance
with the entirety of the requirements of the rule. 1093 For example, if funds are required to
maintain or target a certain level of fund liquidity, then the trade order management system
would have to be modified to ensure accurate monitoring of such limitations. We have revised
the discussion of costs to both reflect new information on the potential costs of compliance and
changes in the rule that are designed to lessen the potential costs. Specifically, we use estimates
provided by commenters to approximate costs for each fund complex under the proposed rule
and then qualitatively discuss how changes to the proposed rule affect these estimates. Because
most changes to the final rule reduce requirements for some segment of funds relative to the
proposal, the estimates below can generally be considered an upper bound on fund costs except
where explicitly noted.
Staff estimates of the one-time costs in the proposal, which ranged from $1.3 million to
$2.25 million per fund complex, were partly based on estimates from another Commission
rulemaking. 1094 Some commenters expressed concern about the calculation of this estimate
because it was based on assumptions driven by analysis performed with respect to money market
fund reform. 1095 While some of the large scale system modifications required by rule 22e-4 will
be similar to those required for money market funds due to regulatory reform, and we attempted

to adjust our estimates for differences between the two rules, one commenter suggested that the
process of classifying portfolio assets was more akin to a fund’s costs in analyzing the value of
its assets. 1096 We acknowledge that could be an informative approach to estimating costs, but
absent concrete estimates associated with that approach, which the commenter did not provide,
we have updated our estimates based on the limited quantitative information available from
commenters. 1097 One commenter estimated that there would be $2 million in initial
implementation costs and more than $650,000 in annual recurring costs for automating a
classification process that would have to manage 63,000 different portfolio positions.1098
Another commenter estimated the costs of building a system to classify the liquidity of its
investments, which is not currently commercially available, in the millions of dollars to manage
their 44,000 different portfolio positions. 1099 We use the former as a basis for our analysis
because it is comparable in magnitude to the latter. 1100 Because there are likely to be economies
of scale in developing the policies, procedures, and systems required to comply with rule 22e-4,
we approximate the cost per fund complex by assuming fixed costs constitute 30% of the
commenter’s estimates, and extrapolate using the number of funds per complex to scale variable

As in the proposal, the estimates assume that each fund would not bear all of the costs (particularly, the
costs of systems modification) on an individual basis, but instead that these costs would likely be allocated
among the multiple users of the systems, that is, each of the members of a fund complex. Accordingly, we
expect that, in general, funds within large fund complexes would incur fewer costs on a per fund basis than
funds within smaller fund complexes, due to economies of scale in allocating costs among a group of users.

We estimate that there were 146 funds in the second commenter’s fund complex as of December 31, 2015,
which implies an estimated cost of approximately $4 million using our estimation procedure, in line with
the commenter’s statement that its cost would be “in the millions.” See supra footnote 1094 for discussion
of the estimation procedure.

costs up or down. 1101 In addition, because the process of classifying assets under the proposal
would likely constitute a majority of a fund’s costs, we assume the classification process
constitutes approximately 75% of a fund’s cost of complying with proposed rule 22e-4. This
method results in one-time costs for funds under the proposed rule that range from approximately
$0.8 million to $10.2 million, that the average cost per fund complex is $1 million, and the
aggregate cost is approximately $855 million. The estimated range of costs using this approach
is wider than our approach in the proposal, but the estimated aggregate cost is lower than our
initial estimate of $1.3 billion. While these estimates would change if we varied our assumption
that fixed costs comprise 30% of the commenter’s estimate—for example, increasing this
percentage would compress the range of costs and the aggregate may increase or decrease—they
are of the same order of magnitude as our estimates in the proposal.
These estimated one-time costs are attributable to the following activities, as applicable
to each of the funds within the complex: (i) developing policies and procedures relating to each
of the required program elements, 1102 and the related recordkeeping requirements of the rule; (ii)

1101

We use CRSP U.S. Mutual Fund Database to obtain the number of funds for each complex. As of
December 31, 2015, there were 7551 mutual funds (excluding money market funds and annuities), 1484
ETFs (excluding non-40-act ETFs, ETNs, and Commodity ETFs), and 847 fund complexes (334 of them
with only one fund). The commenter, Invesco, consisted of 87 funds as of that date, and we assume the
fixed cost component of their estimate is $0.6 million (30% of $2 million). The remaining $1.4 million is
assumed to be a variable cost that scales linearly with the number of funds. To arrive at a total cost of 22e4, each of these estimates is scaled so that the classification process constitutes 75% of the total costs of
proposed rule 22e-4.

1102

Specifically, a fund would be required, where applicable, to establish policies and procedures relating to: (i)
assessment, management, and periodic review of the fund’s liquidity risk; (ii) classification of the liquidity
of each of the fund’s portfolio investments, as well as at-least-monthly reviews of the fund’s liquidity
classifications; (iii) the requirements to determine and periodically review a highly liquid investment
minimum, and to adopt and implement policies and procedures for responding to a shortfall of the fund’s
highly liquid investments below its highly liquid investment minimum; (iv) the requirement to limit the
fund’s acquisition of illiquid investments over 15% of the fund’s net assets; and (v) for funds that engage
in, or reserve the right to engage in, redemptions in kind, the requirement to establish policies and
procedures regarding how it will engage in such redemptions in kind. The final rule also provides for a
tailored program for ETFs that redeem in kind, excluding them from the classification and highly liquid
investment minimum requirements, but requiring them to consider additional factors as part of their

343

planning, coding, testing, and installing any system modifications relating to each of the required
program elements; (iii) integrating and implementing policies and procedures relating to each of
the required program elements (including classifying the liquidity of each of the fund’s portfolio
investments pursuant to rule 22e-4(b)(1)(ii)), as well as the recordkeeping requirements of the
rule; (iv) preparing training materials and administering training sessions for staff in affected
areas; and (v) costs associated with educating the fund’s board and obtaining approval of the
program. These activities are likely to cut across many different functional groups within a fund
or fund complex, including legal, compliance, risk, portfolio management, accounting, and
technology staff. To the extent that some of the systems needed to support the required program
elements are developed by third parties, fund complexes may be able to implement their liquidity
risk management programs for less than our estimated cost of developing these programs
themselves, but the final rule emphasizes that it is ultimately each fund’s responsibility to
classify its positions, so these potential cost reductions may be limited. For example, we
understand that third parties have already developed programs that include certain market,
trading, and investment-specific factors which could be useful in classifying the liquidity of
portfolio investments, and are currently available for purchase. 1103
We have also revised our estimates of the ongoing costs of complying with rule 22e-4
using the same approach and based on the same commenter’s estimate as above for one-time

liquidity risk assessment and management that reflect potential liquidity-related concerns that could arise
from the structure and operation of ETFs. The final rule also provides an exclusion from the highly-liquid
investment minimum requirement for funds that primarily hold highly liquid investments. The rule also
provides for board oversight of the liquidity risk management program.
1103

See supra footnote 323 and accompanying text (discussing Commission guidance on a fund’s use of
third-party service providers to obtain data to inform or supplement its consideration of the liquidity
classification factors). We understand, based on staff outreach, that annual costs to subscribe to the
liquidity classification services provided by third-party data and analytics providers currently range from
$50,000 - $500,000.

344

costs. While our analysis in the proposal assumed ongoing costs ranged from 10% to 25% of the
one-time costs resulting from the rule, we’ve reduced the low end of the range to 5% to reflect
changes from the Proposing Release, discussed below, that should lower some funds’
compliance burdens, and increased the high end of the range to 32.5% to reflect the commenter’s
estimate that ongoing costs for their fund under the proposed rule would be $0.65 million
(compared to one-time costs of $2 million). We again extrapolate from the commenter’s
estimate as above to arrive at a minimum and maximum cost estimate for each fund, which
implies a range of ongoing costs across all funds of $40,000 to $3.3 million per fund complex.
These costs are attributable to the following activities, as applicable to each of the funds within
the complex: (i) classification of the liquidity of each of the fund’s portfolio investments, as well
as at-least-monthly reviews of the fund’s liquidity classifications (rule 22e-4(b)(1)(ii)); (ii)
periodic review of the fund’s liquidity risk (rule 22e-4(b)(1)(i)); (iii) periodic review of the
adequacy of the fund’s highly liquid investment minimum (rule 22e-4(b)(1)(iii)(A)(2)); (iv)
systems maintenance; (v) additional staff training; (vi) approval, annual review, and general
oversight by the board of the fund’s liquidity risk management program (rule 22e-4(b)(2)); and
(viii) recordkeeping relating to the fund’s liquidity risk management program (rule
22e-4(b)(3)). 1104 Relative to the proposed rule, the final rule reduces the responsibilities of a
fund’s board, which is not required to approve the fund’s highly liquid investment minimum or
material changes to the fund’s liquidity risk management program, which should reduce the
board-related costs embedded in the above estimates of rule 22e-4’s one-time and ongoing costs.

1104

As discussed in greater detail below, we anticipate that, depending on the personnel (and/or third-party
service providers) involved in the activities associated with administering a liquidity risk management
program, certain of the estimated ongoing costs associated with these activities could be borne by the fund,
and others could be borne by the adviser.

345

The original classification scheme would have mandated significant micro-level analysis
of instruments not currently conducted by fund advisers according to many commenters. 1105
Such an analysis would have required entirely new systems for many fund complexes and would
have required funds to incur significant expenses (especially for smaller fund complexes). 1106
The new classification system lowers the potential costs of compliance with the liquidity
classification requirement by (i) reducing the number of classification categories reduced from
six to four, (ii) only requiring “days-to-cash” estimates out to 7 days, (iii) allowing funds to
generally classify based on asset class (subject to an exception process), (iv) changing the
process for considering position size to reduce complexity, and (v) simplifying the classification
factors to be considered into a single requirement that funds consider market, trading, and
investment-specific data when classifying an investment. As a whole, these changes should
lower the potential costs of compliance with the classification requirement relative to the
proposal estimates above without significantly reducing the potential benefits of the requirement.
Specifically with respect to position size, commenters argued that evaluating “days-tocash” was inherently biased against large funds and could lead to “plain vanilla” funds that
generally invest in only highly-liquid securities (e.g., S&P 500 funds) being classified as highly
illiquid if they manage a large amount of assets. 1107 The rule now only requires a fund to
determine whether trading varying portions of a position in a particular portfolio investment or
asset class, in sizes that the fund reasonably anticipates trading, is reasonably expected to
significantly affect its liquidity. This change should prevent large “plain vanilla” funds from

appearing to be very illiquid under the classification scheme while still maintaining the idea that
position size is an important consideration in the evaluation of liquidity. Relative to the
proposed rule, this should reduce the costs associated with determining how position size affects
the number of days required to liquidate an investment and eliminate the cost of classifying
separate portions of a position into separate liquidity buckets.
The classification process has also been revised in response to commenter concerns about
the need to evaluate whether an investment can be sold for cash without materially affecting the
security’s price, which investors could interpret as an indication that they can redeem out of
funds at a known or protected NAV. 1108 One commenter expressed concern that if investors were
given estimates of liquidity that are speculative or stale, or both, which might fail to predict
liquidity with accuracy during periods of market stress, then funds could be potentially subject to
significant litigation costs. 1109 The value impact component of the rule has been modified so that
determinations of market impact can be based on a reasonable expectation that an investment can
be converted to cash (or in some cases, sold or disposed of) without the conversion (or in some
cases, sale or disposition) significantly changing the market value, rather than a price “that does
not materially affect the value of that asset immediately prior to sale.” This modification in the
definition should relieve funds of the need to develop precise security-by-security expectations
of forward looking liquidity while still emphasizing the need to consider the potential market
impact of buying or selling an investment, reducing compliance costs relative to the proposed
rule.
Commenters also expressed concern about the use of third-party vendors in the process of
1108

347

liquidity classification. 1110 If only a few vendors were able to provide the necessary data, such
data would likely cause significant expenses for the funds, and those expenses would likely be
passed on, at least in part, to fund investors through higher fees. Another commenter suggested
that the cost of third-party liquidity data should be included in any estimate of the potential costs
of the classification system because of the strong likelihood that all funds would need to
subscribe to a third-party vendor to ensure compliance with the rule. 1111 As discussed in the
proposal, we believe outsourcing program functions to vendors should, if anything, reduce
compliance costs, and we noted that liquidity classification services already exist.1112 In addition,
our updated estimate of costs above is based on a large investment manager’s estimate of
constructing an internal system from scratch, so we would expect the cost of a vendor-based
solution, which would be partially amortized across all of its clients, to be lower. The changes
made to the classification system from the proposal could also lessen the costs associated with
third-party vendors relative to the proposed rule. In particular, to the extent that requiring less
precision via fewer classification categories and shorter time horizons, allowing funds to
generally classify according to asset class (subject to an exception process), and requiring a
simpler position size evaluation criterion reduce the scope and intensity of the investment
classification process, funds may not rely as much on vendors to comply with the rule, and
vendors themselves may experience reduced costs in developing programs, leading to lower
prices if they pass on some of the savings to funds.
If all funds use a small number of third-party vendors, there could be other indirect, but

potentially large, costs. According to one commenter, the vendors could become de facto
liquidity “rating agencies” and their “upgrades” and “downgrades” of asset liquidity could have
systemic effects on the market. 1113 For example, if a vendor were to remove a widely-held
investment from the highly liquid investment category, then many funds could simultaneously
attempt to sell that investment, which could harm both fund investors and the wider market.
Given the data limitations and difficulties in estimating liquidity for many less liquid
investments, that potential effect might be driven by error-prone modeling instead of true
changes in liquidity. We emphasize above that while third-party products can serve as a useful
input to the classification process, it is the fund’s responsibility to determine the liquidity of each
investment, which should lessen the potential for systemic issues by reducing fund reliance on
third-party vendors and allowing more of the necessary liquidity analysis to be performed within
each fund complex. 1114
Several additional components of the final rule will affect costs relative to the proposal.
First, by excluding any fund that primarily holds assets that are highly liquid investments from
the requirement to have a highly liquid investment minimum, the final rule avoids imposing any
potential costs related to the minimum on some funds that would benefit less from having a
minimum. It is possible that some funds that do not qualify as primarily highly liquid funds will
incur the costs of establishing a minimum without a significant benefit. Second, whereas funds
may currently use back-office operations to limit their acquisition of illiquid assets under exiting
Commission guidelines, the final rule’s enhanced illiquid investment standard may require funds
to incur direct costs associated with a shift of these operations to other business functions (we
1113

See ICI Comment Letter II.

1114

See supra section III.C.1.b. (providing guidance on the appropriate use of data vendors).

349

also discuss indirect costs associated with the enhanced illiquid investment limit below). 1115
Third, the final rule does not require In-Kind ETFs to establish a highly liquid investment
minimum or classify the liquidity of their portfolios, which will reduce their costs relative to
other funds, but it also requires them—as it does all ETFs—to consider several additional factors
as part of their liquidity risk programs, which may increase their implementation costs. Finally,
principal underwriters or depositors of UITs, which had no liquidity risk requirements under the
proposed rule, will now have to incur a one-time cost on or before the date of the initial deposit
of the portfolio securities into the UITs to assess whether the amount of illiquid investments they
expect the UITs to hold is compatible with the redeemable nature of the securities they issue.
This cost should be comparable in magnitude to incurring a fraction of the ongoing costs of an
open-ended fund under rule 22e-4 because it involves an analysis that is similar to complying
with the rule’s 15% illiquid investment limit without having to establish all of the systems and
processes that are required to perform that task on a continuing basis. Assuming that this activity
accounts for 20% of an open-ended fund’s ongoing costs, we estimate that it would cost a UIT
$8,000 to $52,000, and note that it will only be incurred by UITs that are launched after the
rule’s compliance date. 1116 UITs are already required to consider which of their restricted
securities are illiquid, so this estimate should be considered an upper bound on the costs imposed
on UITs by the rule. Finally, the rule’s provision requiring board oversight when a fund’s
holding of illiquid assets exceed 15% of its net assets may impose additional costs on the fund to

1115

See supra section III.C.4.a.

1116

These figures are based on the same comment letter used to estimate one-time and ongoing costs for openended funds. We assume the costs associated with launching a UIT under rule 22e-4 are equivalent to 20%
of the ongoing costs of a one fund complex. Under the assumptions above that ongoing costs for openended funds are 5% to 32.5% of their initial costs, fund complexes with one fund have estimated ongoing
costs of approximately $40,000 to $260,000. Multiplying that range by 20% produces the UIT estimate.

350

hold a special board meeting, including the cost of preparing materials for the board’s
deliberation, the cost of board members’ time, as well as the cost of consultations with outside
counsel.
Depending on the personnel (and/or third-party service providers) involved with respect
to the activities associated with establishing and implementing a liquidity risk management
program, certain of the estimated one-time costs could be borne by the fund, and others could be
borne by the fund’s adviser or other service providers. This cost allocation would be dependent
on the facts and circumstances of a particular fund’s liquidity risk management program, and
thus we cannot specify the extent to which the estimated costs would typically be allocated to the
fund as opposed to the adviser. Estimated costs that are allocated to the fund would likely be
borne by fund shareholders in the form of fund operating expenses.
Certain elements of the program requirement may entail marked variability in related
compliance costs, depending on a fund’s particular circumstances and sources of potential
liquidity risk. The process of classifying the liquidity of each of a fund’s portfolio investments
could give rise to varying costs depending on the fund’s particular investment strategy. For
example, a U.S. large cap equity fund would likely incur relatively few costs to obtain the data
necessary to classify its portfolio positions, specifically given that, relative to the proposed rule,
the final rule allows such a fund to generally classify its positions based on asset classes (subject
to an exception process). On the other hand, funds that hold investments for which relevant
market, trading, and other investment-specific data is less readily available, for which a general
asset-class-based classification is more difficult to apply, or funds that require more exceptions
to their asset-class-based classification would incur relatively greater costs associated with the
classification of their portfolio positions’ liquidity. In addition, funds with multiple sub-advisers
351

may incur relatively more costs to coordinate the process of classifying position liquidity as well
as monitoring whether the fund is compliant with its highly liquid investment minimum and the
15% illiquid investment limit.
Certain factors that the rule’s guidance suggests a fund should consider in assessing its
liquidity risk also could entail relatively greater costs, depending on the fund’s circumstances.
For instance, a fund with a relatively short operating history could incur greater costs in
assessing the fund’s cash flow projections than a similarly situated fund with a relatively long
operating history. This is because the newer fund could find it appropriate to assess redemption
activity in similar funds during normal and stressed periods (to predict its future cash flow
patterns), which could entail additional costs to gather and analyze relevant data about these
comparison funds. Also, a fund whose shares are held largely through omnibus accounts may
wish to periodically request shareholder information from financial intermediaries in order to
determine how the fund’s ownership concentration may affect its cash flow projections. These
data requests, and related analyses, could cause a fund to incur costs that another fund, whose
shares are largely held directly, would not. A fund that deems it appropriate to establish and
implement additional liquidity risk management policies and procedures beyond those
specifically required under the rule also would incur additional related costs. While we
recognize that, as described above, the costs to establish and implement a liquidity risk
management program in compliance with rule 22e-4 will depend to some degree on the level of
liquidity risk facing the fund, we are unable to quantify the various ways in which a fund’s
individual risks and circumstances could affect the costs associated with establishing a liquidity
risk management program.
Commenters suggested that the proposed three-day liquid asset minimum requirement
352

could have had a number of unintended consequences. As discussed above, if third-party
vendors become de facto “rating agencies” for liquidity, then a liquidity minimum could force
many funds to sell the same investments simultaneously after a liquidity “downgrade,” which
could have a systemic impact on funds and the overall market. 1117 Similarly, if a fund were
forced into predictable trading behavior during a market downturn because of the highly liquid
investment minimum requirement, the liquidity and performance of that fund would be
negatively impacted. 1118 It is possible that the proposed three-day liquid asset minimum
requirements could have created these types of unintended consequences by prohibiting a fund
from acquiring less liquid assets if it was below its three-day liquid asset minimum, but the final
rule does not include this prohibition. Instead, as discussed above, a fund is only required to
report to its board and, possibly, the Commission when it is below its highly liquid investment
minimum. This requirement should provide fund management the flexibility to avoid forced,
predictable trading behavior while maintaining the emphasis on effective liquidity risk
management the minimum is designed to provide. While fund liquidity may vary more under
this approach, the reporting requirements surrounding any shortfall, including a requirement to
provide the fund’s board with an explanation of how the fund plans to restore its minimum if a
shortfall lasts more than 7 consecutive calendar days, should help provide oversight to prevent a
fund from continually failing to meet its liquidity minimum. As a whole, this approach should
result in lower costs for funds compared to the proposed three-day liquid asset minimum and,
because we anticipate that lengthy breaches of the minimum will be relatively rare, it should not
significantly decrease the benefits of having a highly liquid investment minimum.
1117

ICI Comment Letter II.

353

One commenter suggested that investor choice could be negatively impacted because of
the implementation and on-going costs of the liquidity risk management program. 1119 The
commenter asserted that the costs could overwhelm small fund complexes and force them to
either cease operations or consolidate with a larger complex. 1120 Most of the changes made to the
rule since its proposal—exclusions for funds that primarily hold assets that are highly liquid
investments and In-Kind ETFs, a reduction in the number of investment classification categories,
and the ability to generally classify investments based on asset classes (subject to an exception
process)—should decrease the estimated implementation and on-going costs compared to the
proposal. Yet it remains possible that some fund complexes will still find the costs burdensome.
While investor choice may be harmed if a fund is closed because the costs of the rule are
burdensome, remaining funds will be better positioned to avoid the negative consequences of
inadequate liquidity management if that fund exited because it was unable to provide a minimum
acceptable baseline of liquidity. To the extent that there are funds that are currently able to
provide effective liquidity risk management, but would be forced to cease operations because of
the costs of complying with the rule (even after changes from the proposal that increase
flexibility and decrease implementation and on-going costs), investor choice may be negatively
affected.
A fund may incur costs if it reallocates its portfolio to correspond with its initial or
subsequently modified highly liquid investment minimum, or if the rule’s definition of an illiquid
investment results in the fund holding more than 15% of its net assets in assets that are illiquid
investments. While we are unable to anticipate how many funds may reallocate their portfolios
1119

Charles Schwab Comment Letter.

1120

Id.

354

for these two reasons, or the extent of such reallocation by any fund that does so, we anticipate
that the transaction-related costs of any such reallocation will not be significant for most funds.
This is because some funds may not need to reallocate their portfolios at all to correspond with
their highly liquid investment minimum or the 15% illiquid investment limit, and those that do so
would be able to gradually adjust their portfolios in order to buy and sell portfolio positions
during times that are financially advantageous given the delayed compliance date. Thus, while a
fund may reallocate its portfolio to comply with its highly liquid investment minimum and the
15% illiquid investment limit by the time of the compliance date, a fund would not be required to
conduct transactions in portfolio investments in any particular timeframe prior to the compliance
date. If a fund wishes to reallocate its portfolio by the compliance date, we anticipate that the
compliance date would provide sufficient time to do so with relatively few associated transaction
costs. Along with the transaction-related costs associated with any portfolio reallocation, we
recognize that this reallocation in turn could affect the performance and/or risk profiles of funds
that modify their composition, which in turn could result in costs associated with decreased
investment options available to investors and any changes to the market for relatively less liquid
investments; these costs are discussed below. Finally, it is worth noting that, because the rule
excludes both In-Kind ETFs and funds that primarily hold assets that are highly liquid
investments from the requirement of having a highly liquid investment minimum, these funds
will not incur any of the costs associated with transactions, reduced fund performance, or altered
risk profiles associated with a minimum, though they will still incur these costs as they apply to
the rule’s 15% illiquid investment limit.
Potential for Decreased Investment Options and Adverse Effects
We recognize that the rule requires a fund to determine the liquidity profile of its current
355

portfolio and evaluate its potential liquidity needs, which could result in a fund concluding that
its current portfolio lacks sufficient liquidity. This could lead a fund to modify its portfolio
composition to meet its appropriate highly liquid investment minimum (e.g., one commenter
stated that funds may decrease their holdings of long-term municipal bonds) or to comply with
the more specific 15% illiquid investment limit. 1121 The rule could therefore result in certain
funds increasing their investments in relatively more liquid investments or altering the way in
which their portfolios are managed, which in turn could affect the performance, tracking error,
and/or risk profiles of these funds. 1122 This is most likely to affect funds that currently hold
investments with relatively lower liquidity. Such modifications to funds’ portfolio compositions
could in turn decrease certain investment options available to investors or reduce investor
returns. However, because these portfolio composition shifts are most likely to occur if a fund
needs to adjust its existing liquidity level to comply with the rule, we anticipate that the potential
for decreased yield is most likely to affect funds currently holding portfolios whose liquidity
levels have the potential to create redemption-related liquidity risk for fund investors. Thus, the
potential for decreased investment options for certain investors, and any related decrease in
investment yield, has the potential offsetting benefit of decreased liquidity risk in the funds in
which these investors hold shares. However, there could be other reasons funds may choose to
invest in more liquid investments as a result of the rule even if this reallocation is not required,
including the possibility that they do not want to appear less liquid than their peer funds in their
publicly disclosed liquidity profile, or because increased disclosure requirements regarding the

1121

1122

See, e.g., supra footnote 767 (discussing how index funds that use full replication strategies might need to
move towards other techniques for tracking an index if full replication requires them to exceed the 15%
illiquid asset limit).

356

timing of a fund’s redemption payments may result in funds holding more liquid investments. 1123
We cannot quantify the number of funds that would need to significantly modify their
portfolios’ risk profile as a result of the rule because we lack the information necessary to
provide a reasonable estimate. Such an estimate would depend on the number of funds that
might need to modify their current portfolio composition as a result of the rule, as well as the
availability of relatively liquid investments that can act as adequate substitutes to existing
investments for those affected funds. We are unable to quantify the total potential costs
discussed in this section because: (1) we cannot anticipate the highly liquid investment minimum
that each fund would determine to be appropriate based on its liquidity risk or the extent to
which fund holdings exceed the rule’s more specific 15% illiquid investment limit relative to the
current 15% guideline; (2) we cannot determine what relatively more liquid investments funds
would purchase as substitutes; (3) we are unable to estimate the resulting changes to funds’
yields and risk profiles, nor how investors would react to these changes. In-Kind ETFs and
funds that primarily hold assets that are highly liquid investments will not be subject to the
highly liquid investment minimum, so this may reduce the aggregate costs associated with
decreased investment options relative to the proposed rule. Commenters did not specifically
object to our assessment of the rule’s impact on investment options in the proposed rule.
Market for Relatively Less Liquid Investments
As discussed above, the rule could result in certain funds increasing their investments in
relatively more liquid investments, which would effectively mean that these funds would
decrease their investments in relatively less liquid investments. If funds decrease their
investments in relatively less liquid investments, the market for those investments could become
1123

See infra section IV.c.2.a (discussing the effects of the rule’s disclosure requirements).

357

even less liquid. This could discourage new issuances of similar investments and decrease the
liquidity of relatively less liquid investments that are still outstanding. The impact of decreased
investment by funds in relatively less liquid markets will depend on how much current
investment in those markets is driven by the funds, which varies between markets. Further, these
market effects could be partially offset if other opportunistic investors with greater capacity to
hold less liquid investments are attracted to the market by any lower prices for these investments
that result if funds decrease their holdings of less liquid investments. 1124 In addition, if the rule
leads funds to better assess the liquidity risk associated with certain investments, any decrease in
the prices of these investments could reflect more efficient pricing of the investments (that is,
risk would be better reflected in asset prices than it is currently). Because funds currently are not
required to report or disclose information concerning the liquidity of their investments, and
because we cannot anticipate the highly liquid investment minimum that each fund would
determine to be appropriate based on its liquidity risk or the extent to which the more specific
15% illiquid investment limit will apply to current fund holdings, it is difficult to predict the
extent to which the rule could lead funds to modify their portfolio holdings, or whether such
modifications would discourage the issuance of certain investment. As a result, we cannot
quantify the potential costs discussed in this section. Commenters did not specifically object to
our assessment of the costs related to decreased investment in illiquid assets in the proposed rule.
d. Effects on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation
The liquidity risk management program requirement would require a fund to assess its
1124

Relatively less liquid investments have a higher expected return compared to relatively more liquid
investments, thereby compensating longer-term investors for holding relatively less liquid investments. See

liquidity risk and to determine its highly liquid investment minimum based on this risk
assessment. For funds that do not already engage in liquidity risk management practices that
meet the rule’s requirements, the requirements should improve the alignment between fund
portfolio liquidity and fund liquidity needs. This improved alignment could enhance funds’
ability to meet redemptions in a manner that mitigates potential dilution of shareholders’
interests, and thus this improved alignment could be viewed as increasing efficiency to the extent
that dilution is perceived as a drag on the ability of a fund’s NAV to reflect the performance of
its portfolio. Additionally, the requirement for each fund to classify the liquidity of its portfolio
investments and publicly report the aggregated percentage of its portfolio assigned to each of the
four classifications categories could increase allocative efficiency by assisting investors in
making investment choices that better match their risk tolerances. However, this potential
efficiency gain will only hold to the extent that these portfolio-level classification aggregates,
which are based on non-public subjective assessments of investment liquidity, are comparable
across funds. Furthermore, this potential efficiency gain will only be achieved if this
classification sufficiently contrasts the tradeoff between portfolio liquidity and performance
across funds.
By enhancing funds’ liquidity risk assessment and risk management, the program
requirement also could promote pricing efficiency in the sense that it could decrease the
likelihood that a fund would be forced to sell portfolio investments under unfavorable
circumstances in order to meet redemptions, potentially creating significant negative price
pressure on those investments. If a fund’s asset sales were to cause temporary changes in market
prices unrelated to an investment’s fundamentals, this could create a temporary pricing
inefficiency. By decreasing the likelihood that these types of price movements would occur, the
359

program requirement could decrease pricing inefficiency. However, the program requirement
could negatively affect the efficient pricing of investments with lower liquidity if it indirectly
discourages funds from investing in them (for example, if a fund were to decrease its holdings in
investments that have lower liquidity if it determines, as a result of the fund’s liquidity risk
assessment, that its appropriate highly liquid investment minimum or the more specific 15%
illiquid investment limit do not correspond with the fund’s current portfolio composition). But
as discussed above, this market effect could be partially offset if other investors are incentivized
to buy relatively less liquid investments on account of any lower prices for these investments that
result if funds decrease their holdings of these investments. 1125 Alternatively, any price decreases
experienced as a result of decreased mutual fund investment could be considered efficient price
adjustments given the reduction in liquidity of the investments.
If the liquidity risk management program requirement results in a material decrease in
funds’ investment in relatively less liquid investments, competition for these investments would
initially be negatively affected. Under this scenario, the relatively less liquid investments in
which funds formerly would have invested may become less liquid, since the number of current
or potential market participants would be reduced. However, because this reduction in demand
and liquidity results in larger illiquidity discounts and higher expected returns, some investors
might become willing to invest in these assets, which in turn would partially offset the initial
reduction in competition. As a corollary, if the liquidity risk management program requirement
results in a material increase in funds’ investment in highly liquid investments, competition for
these investments would be positively affected. However, as funds increase their investments,
the liquidity of those investments should increase and their liquidity premium decrease, which in
1125

See supra section IV.C.1.c.

360

turn could lead some investors to reduce their demand for these investments, partially offsetting
the initial increase in competition. Relative to the proposal, the competitive effects of fund
demand for highly liquid investments relative to lower liquidity investments should, if anything,
be reduced because the rule only requires a fund to consider stressed conditions that are
reasonably foreseeable in determining its minimum.
The size of a fund, or the family of funds to which a fund belongs, could have certain
competitive effects with respect to the fund’s implementation of its liquidity risk management
program. If there are economies of scale in creating and administering multiple liquidity risk
management programs, funds in large families would have a competitive advantage. For a fund
in a smaller complex, however, a greater portion of the fund’s (and/or adviser’s 1126) resources
may be needed to create and administer a liquidity risk management program, which may
increase barriers to entry in the fund industry, and lead to an adverse effect on competition. The
size of a fund family also could produce competitive advantages or disadvantages with respect to
a fund’s use of products developed by third parties to assist in classifying the liquidity of their
portfolio investments, or to assess the fund’s liquidity risk. Funds in a large complex also could
receive relatively more favorable pricing for third-party liquidity risk management tools, if the
fund complex were to purchase discounted bulk services from the developer or receive
relationship-based pricing discounts. To the extent that they choose to use liquidity risk
management tools such as committed lines of credit and interfund lending, 1127 funds in larger
complexes likewise could receive more favorable rates on committed lines of credit than funds in
smaller complexes, and could have opportunities to establish interfund lending arrangements
1126

See supra footnote 446 and accompanying text.

1127

See supra footnote 258 and accompanying text (discussing and providing guidance on the use of these
tools).

361

more easily than funds in smaller complexes.
Any changes in certain investments’ or asset classes’ liquidity that could indirectly result
from the liquidity risk management program requirement (for example, as discussed above, if the
number of buyers and sellers for certain investments becomes significantly reduced as a result of
the program requirement) could also affect capital formation among issuers of these investments.
Because lower asset liquidity implies higher illiquidity premiums and larger asset price discounts
some firms and other issuers of securities could be discouraged from issuing new securities in
asset classes that are associated with lower liquidity. If changes in liquidity are not equal across
all asset classes, firms and other entities may begin to shift their capital structure (e.g., begin to
issue equity instead of debt) or to change the terms of certain securities that they issue in order to
increase their liquidity (e.g., by standardizing the terms of certain debt securities, or modifying
the securities’ terms to promote electronic trading). 1128
Commenters did not specifically object to our assessment of the proposed rule’s effects
on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. With the exception of the potential efficiency
changes due to modifications reflected in the adoption of a highly liquid investment minimum
and the more specific 15% illiquid investment limit discussed above, our assessment of the final
rule’s effects largely corresponds with those of the proposed rule.
e. Reasonable Alternatives
The Commission considered various alternatives to the individual elements of rule 22e-4.
Those alternatives are outlined above in the sections discussing the rule elements. 1129 The
following discussion addresses economically significant alternatives to rule 22e-4, which involve

broader issues than the more granular alternatives to the individual rule elements discussed
above.
Liquidity Risk Management Program and Scope
The Commission considered, but ultimately decided against, excluding certain types of
funds from rule 22e-4. 1130 For example, the rule could have carved out funds with investment
strategies that historically have entailed relatively little liquidity risk, or funds with relatively low
asset levels. We are not excluding any subset of open-end funds, other than money market
funds, from the scope of the rule, although we have tailored the rule for certain kinds of
investment companies that present different liquidity risks (In-Kind ETFs, funds that primarily
hold assets that are highly liquid investments, and UITs). Some funds with investment strategies
that historically have involved little liquidity risk invest in assets that have lower liquidity, or in
more liquid assets that can experience episodes of lower liquidity. 1131 To the extent that these
types of investments create potential liquidity risk for a fund, excluding funds with investment
strategies that have historically involved little liquidity risk could expose investors to more
potential liquidity risk than they would face under the rule. Furthermore, investors in small
funds could suffer from insufficient liquidity risk management just as investors in larger funds
could. Indeed, staff analysis suggests that funds with relatively low total assets can experience
greater flow volatility, including more volatility in unexpected flows, than funds with higher
assets, which could indicate increased liquidity risk. 1132 The program requirement permits a fund
to customize and calibrate its liquidity risk management program to reflect the liquidity risks that

it typically faces (and that it could face in stressed market conditions). This flexibility is meant
to result in programs whose scope, and related costs and burdens beyond the fixed cost of
establishing a minimum liquidity risk management program, are appropriate to manage the
actual liquidity risks facing a particular fund. For example, funds that primarily hold assets that
are highly liquid investments are not required to adopt a highly liquid investment minimum
because any benefits associated with this requirement as applied to these funds are less likely to
justify the associated burdens.
Instead of adopting rule 22e-4, the Commission could issue guidance surrounding the
assessment and management of liquidity risk, which would give funds more flexibility in
managing liquidity risk and could reduce costs relative to the requirements of the rule. However,
on account of the significant diversity in liquidity risk management practices that we have
observed in the fund industry, we believe that the need exists for an enhanced comprehensive
baseline requirement instead of only guidance for fund liquidity risk management.
Commenters suggested the rule could have also taken a purely principles-based approach
instead of a prescriptive approach. 1133 The final rule is not a purely prescriptive rule; while it
does specify certain standards, it provides funds with a substantial degree of flexibility in
implementing those standards. That said, a purely principles-based approach that specified few
or no requirements could give funds more flexibility in tailoring risk management programs to
their needs and could reduce compliance costs, but it would be less certain to create a
comprehensive baseline for fund liquidity risk management, which in turn would diminish the

364

comparability (and thus the value) of information reported to the Commission and to the public
about funds’ liquidity. Under a purely principles-based approach, an investor with investments
in multiple funds would be aware that those funds are all generally required to manage liquidity
risk, but may not have sufficient clarity about how each of the funds may have chosen to
interpret and implement general principles so as to permit the investor to understand how this
variation across funds affects the liquidity risk to which the investor is exposed. Finally, funds
are not prohibited from developing or maintaining their own, tailored risk management programs
to the extent that they are supplemental to the baseline that the Commission’s program requires.
The Commission considered proposing liquidity requirements similar to those imposed
on money market funds—that is, the requirement to hold a specified minimum level of highly
liquid investment holdings, and the ability to impose redemption fees and gates. 1134 The
requirements imposed on money market funds, and the tools available to these funds to manage
heavy redemptions, are specifically tailored to the assets held by money market funds and the
behavior of money market fund investors. 1135 Imposing similar regulatory requirements on funds
that are not money market funds would ignore significant differences between money market
funds and other funds. We discuss the costs and benefits of requiring funds to hold a specified
minimum level of highly liquid investments below (similar to the portfolio liquidity requirements
applicable to money market funds). With respect to redemption fees, funds are already permitted
to use them under existing regulations (up to a maximum fee of two percent), although those fees
are largely used by certain funds to recoup costs incurred as a result of excessive short-term
trading of mutual fund shares, rather than mitigating dilution arising from shareholder
1134

See supra footnotes 153-155 and accompanying text.

1135

See 2014 Money Market Fund Reform Adopting Release, supra footnote 43, at section II.

365

transaction activity generally, and are viewed as unpopular with investors and intermediaries.
Redemption gates would allow funds to limit the potential dilution shareholders face in
circumstances where they face extreme redemptions, but they would also impose constraints on
shareholders’ access to their assets in those situations, and commenters were not in favor of
extending rule 22e-3 to permit funds to make broader use of suspensions of redemptions. 1136 In
addition, funds that are not money market funds have not demonstrated the same risk of
significant redemptions during times of market stress that money market funds may face and
which redemption gates are meant to prevent, implying that the benefits of gates are less
applicable to funds that are not money market funds. 1137
Classifying Portfolio Investment Liquidity
The Commission considered multiple alternatives to the rule’s requirement that funds
classify the liquidity of their portfolio investments, which establishes one component of a
uniform baseline for fund liquidity risk management. As discussed above, commenters raised
three primary structural alternatives to the proposed classification requirement: (i) a
“principles-based” liquidity classification approach, where each fund would have to classify the
liquidity of its portfolio assets, but the Commission would not require any specific classification
scheme; 1138 (ii) a simplified version of the proposed classification system, with fewer
classification categories based on shorter time projections than the proposal; 1139 and (iii) an
approach with new classification categories based on qualitative distinctions in the market- and
1136

See ICI Comment Letter I.

1137

See 2014 Money Market Fund Reform Adopting Release, supra footnote 43, at section III.A.1.

See, e.g., AIMA Comment Letter; LSTA Comment Letter; Street Comment Letter; Wellington Comment
Letter.

1139

See, e.g., Eaton Vance Comment Letter I; Interactive Data Comment Letter; Markit Comment Letter; Wells
Fargo Comment Letter. Commenters generally suggested three, four, or five classification categories.

366

trading-related characteristics of different asset classes under different market conditions, which
generally would rely on the Commission mapping different asset classes to each of these new
classification categories. 1140
A purely principles-based approach to classifying assets, as suggested by several
commenters, would have the benefit of allowing each fund to tailor its classification scheme to
the liquidity factors most relevant to the assets it invests in rather than imposing a one-size-fitsall approach that may be less applicable to some funds. However, as discussed above, this
approach would not provide a uniform methodology for funds’ liquidity assessment procedures
and would not promote reasonably comparable reporting to the Commission and disclosure to
the public about funds’ portfolio liquidity. 1141 Instead, also as discussed above, we are largely
adopting commenters’ suggested approach of reducing the number of liquidity classifications
from six to four. 1142
The Commission considered but is not adopting commenters’ alternative of having the
Commission establish a fixed classification schema to which all funds must adhere—for
example, an enumeration of asset classes and a mapping of those classes to a liquidity
classification. 1143 This approach would have the benefit of producing liquidity classifications
that are objectively comparable across funds, but the Commission may not be able to respond as

1140

See, e.g., BlackRock Comment Letter; MFS Comment Letter; Nuveen Comment Letter; CSRC Comment
Letter.

1141

See supra section III.C.6.

1142

The Commission also could have, as described in the Proposing Release, required funds to classify each
portfolio position as “liquid” or “illiquid,” but commenters did not support such an alternative, and we
continue to believe that a two-category approach would be insufficiently nuanced to capture the full
spectrum of portfolio position liquidity. See also supra section III.C.1.a for a more detailed discussion of
commenter suggestions with respect to the number of liquidity classification categories.

1143

For examples suggesting this approach see, e.g., AFR Comment Letter; BlackRock Comment Letter; SRC
Comment Letter.

367

quickly as market participants to dynamic market conditions that might necessitate changes to
asset class liquidity classifications, and would be unable to account for determinants of
investment liquidity that are fund-specific.
Relatedly, some commenters also suggested classification categories based on
alternatives to the “days-to-cash” criterion of the proposed and final rule, including, in whole or
in part, on the fraction of average daily trading volume (“ADTV”) that each position size
corresponds to, the expected behavior of bid-ask spreads in a given asset, or more qualitative
liquidity buckets (e.g., “converted to cash quickly under most circumstances”). 1144 Some of these
more specific criteria may be appropriate for particular assets (e.g., ADTV is a reasonable
measure for exchange-traded securities), but do not apply to all assets (e.g., bid-ask spreads are
not readily available for some asset classes). Also, more qualitative criteria make it more
difficult to compare classifications across funds relative to the “days-to-cash” approach in the
final rule.
Highly Liquid Investment Minimum
The final rules require funds that do not primarily hold assets that are highly liquid
investments to establish a highly liquid investment minimum as part of their liquidity risk
management program and provides some flexibility by not prohibiting the acquisition of less
liquid investments, but instead requiring a fund to report to the board and, in some cases, the
Commission if it goes below its minimum. The first type of alternative the Commission
considered with respect to this requirement concerns which investments satisfy a minimum,
which could have varied along a spectrum from more liquid (e.g., only cash would qualify as a

1144

See Nuveen Comment Letter; BlackRock Comment Letter; Dodge & Cox Comment Letter; SIFMA
Comment Letter I.

368

highly liquid investment) to less liquid (e.g., investments reasonably expected to convert to cash
in the 7-day timeframe associated with open-ended fund redemption and settlement requirements
would qualify). While there are various marginal benefits and costs associated with defining
investments that satisfy the minimum at points along that spectrum—for example, cash is more
liquid but does not provide any yield—the final rule aligns the definition of what investments are
subject to the minimum with the definition of the first (most liquid) category of investments in
the liquidity risk management program’s liquidity classification requirement. 1145 This
consistency in treatment means that fund advisers, investors, and the Commission can focus on a
smaller number of clearly-defined concepts when broadly evaluating fund liquidity.
The Commission also considered whether to make the highly liquid investment minimum
purely a target instead of a minimum. The proposed rule would have precluded funds from
acquiring less liquid investments anytime they were below their highly liquid investment
minimum. Commenters suggested this could lead to several potential costs, as discussed above
regarding the rule’s costs and benefits, including the possibility that it could lead to herding
behavior among funds. 1146 Some commenters instead suggested that a target or range be used
instead of a minimum, which could provide funds more flexibility in returning to their target
without incurring unnecessary trading costs, as well as the ability to trade more opportunistically
during periods of market stress. 1147 However, a target might have been interpreted as an

1145

See the Proposing Release, supra footnote 9 at n.730 and associated text for a further discussion of cash
and “seven day liquid assets” as alternatives for a minimum. We did not receive explicit comments on the
merits of which types of investments should satisfy a minimum.

1146

For example, any market event that increases the value of the less liquid portion of many funds’ portfolios
could place them below the minimum, and could indirectly result in some funds selling less liquid
investments at the same time to bring their allocations back in line with their minimums.

1147

For comments discussing the costs and benefits of a target vs. a minimum, see, e.g., Blackrock Comment
Letter; Federated Comment Letter; Invesco Comment Letter; PIMCO Comment Letter.

369

“average” level of highly liquid investments funds should hold and, without further requirements
such as board reporting, may not have provided a sufficient incentive to fund managers to ensure
that the percentage of a fund’s investments invested in relatively liquid investments is at (or
above) the level deemed appropriate by the fund. The final rules strike a balance: funds are not
prohibited from acquiring less liquid investments if they go below their highly liquid investment
minimum, but they must report any shortfall to their boards (and the Commission where
required). This should reduce concerns regarding herding behavior, 1148 but does make it more
burdensome for a fund to buy any assets that are not highly liquid investments opportunistically
if the fund is at or below its highly liquid investment minimum, insofar as funds may not want to
trigger their reporting obligation to their board, the Commission, or both.
Some commenters were generally opposed to a highly liquid investment minimum,1149
and the final rule could have excluded this requirement altogether. Doing so would still require
that funds manage liquidity risk appropriately but would provide even more flexibility in how
that is achieved. However, the highly liquid investment minimum requires funds to directly
consider the assets they need to have on hand to meet redemptions in a flexible manner to reduce
dilution that may result from forced sales, and funds have flexibility in setting a minimum that is
appropriate to the needs of their fund as well as adjusting the minimum dynamically to adapt to
changing market conditions. 1150 We note that the final rule does not require funds that primarily

1148

For example, if an asset ceased to be a highly liquid investment, it could indirectly lead funds to sell that
asset in order to meet their minimum. Coordinated selling could produce further downward pressure on the
value of the investment. Some funds could be interested in purchasing such an investment if they viewed it
to be undervalued and thus good for fund investors — which could also help counteract the downward
pricing pressure caused by funds exiting their positions — but if such a purchase would cause them to
violate their minimum, it would have been prohibited under the proposed rule.

1149

See, e.g., Invesco Comment Letter; Blackrock Comment Letter.

1150

See supra footnote 638 and accompanying text.

370

hold assets that are highly liquid investments to establish a minimum.
The Commission also considered requiring a uniform highly liquid investment minimum
for all funds. This alternative approach would have the advantage of being simple for investors
to understand, easy for funds to apply, and simple for our examination staff to verify. However,
this alternative would fail to account for notable differences between funds with respect to
investment strategy, fund flow patterns, and other characteristics that contribute to funds’
liquidity risk, which in turn would make it reasonable for funds’ portfolios to have varying
liquidity profiles. We believe that the fund-specific highly liquid investment minimum
requirement will promote alignment of a fund’s liquidity needs with the liquidity of fund
investments, while still permitting funds reasonable flexibility in implementation. In light of the
significant diversity within the fund industry, we believe that flexibility is appropriate to help
minimize the potential costs to investors of the requirement. This approach still includes
elements that will help our staff to assess whether funds are holding an appropriate level of assets
that are highly liquid investments. Each fund will be required to maintain a written record of
how its highly liquid investment minimum was determined, as well as copies of materials
submitted to the fund’s board in connection with the highly liquid investment minimum.1151 One
benefit of a Commission-determined uniform highly liquid investment minimum would be to
ensure that funds do not set their minimum at an artificially low level (e.g., 0) that is divorced
from their liquidity risk. We believe that the requirement for a fund to consider certain specified
factors in determining its minimum, as well as the recordkeeping and board review requirements
discussed above, will help promote funds’ establishing realistic minimums, and discourage
inappropriately low or zero minimums.
1151

See proposed rule 22e-4(c)(2)-(3).

371

Instead of requiring funds to determine and invest their assets in compliance with a
highly liquid investment minimum, we could require funds to conduct stress tests of their own
design assessing the extent to which the fund has a level of highly liquid investments necessary
to cover possible levels of redemptions. This would have the benefit of granting a fund
flexibility in determining whether its portfolio liquidity profile is appropriate given its liquidity
needs. However, because the quality and comprehensiveness of funds’ liquidity risk
management currently varies significantly, we believe that requiring funds to have a highly
liquid investment minimum is important in reducing the risk that funds will be unable to meet
their redemption obligations, in minimizing dilution, and in elevating the overall quality of
liquidity risk management across the fund industry. Also, we believe that it would be difficult to
determine, depending on the level of discretion a fund would have in developing stress scenarios,
whether these scenarios would accurately depict liquidity risk and lead funds to determine the
appropriate level of portfolio liquidity they should hold. For example, if a fund’s liquidity needs
were generally high during normal periods, but were not correspondingly extreme during stress
events, basing this fund’s portfolio liquidity on the results of stress testing alone could cause a
fund to hold too little liquidity during non-stressed periods. Therefore, we do not believe that a
general stress testing requirement would be an adequate substitute for the highly liquid
investment minimum requirement.
15% Illiquid Investment Limit
Instead of the adopted illiquid investment definition, the Commission could have codified
a definition of illiquid investments that reflects the current 15% guideline. This approach would
have had the benefit of already being accepted and understood by the industry, and would have
entailed few additional implementation costs for funds. However, it would not have been
372

harmonized with the rule’s requirements with respect to other liquidity classifications,
particularly the requirement that funds review at least monthly whether their investments are
illiquid with respect to relevant market, trading, and investment-specific factors, and also
incorporate market depth considerations into this process. 1152 To the extent that the rule’s
liquidity classification requirement results in funds more accurately assessing the amount of
illiquid investments in their portfolios, funds may improve on their liquidity risk management
under the rule as adopted than under a codification of the 15% guideline.
f. Comments on the DERA Study
We received substantial comments on the DERA Study from one commenter. The
Commission has carefully considered these comments and adjusted our analysis where
appropriate. In terms of broader concerns, the commenter suggested that the analysis in the
DERA Study does not provide a strong basis for the specifics of the rule. 1153 For example, the
commenter asserts that the DERA Study’s analysis does not provide a justification for funds
sorting their assets into six liquidity categories and does not apply this classification in the
DERA Study. The DERA Study’s analysis was not designed to justify each policy choice made
in the rule. Rather, the analysis in the DERA Study makes certain findings and reports certain
empirical results designed to inform the Commission more generally about the current state of
fund liquidity.
With respect to the proposal’s interpretation of the DERA Study’s results, the commenter
expressed the concern that the results in the DERA Study provide only indirect evidence on the
selling behavior of funds in response to redemptions. While a direct test would be preferable,
1152

See supra sections III.C.1.b and III.C.3.b.

1153

ICI Comment Letter II.

373

such a test would require data on both daily fund flows and fund daily transactions, neither of
which are available in sufficient detail for analysis. The commenter states that the DERA Study
itself only shows that fund liquidity tends to decrease following outflows and that other
endogenous factors, such as broad changes in market conditions due to macroeconomic events,
could be causing changes in both fund liquidity and fund flows. 1154 To demonstrate its concerns
about endogeneity, the commenter uses a vector autoregression (VAR) to present evidence that a
proxy for market returns causes changes to both the Amihud liquidity of the S&P 500 and net
U.S. equity mutual fund flows in a manner consistent with its alternative hypothesis that a fund’s
average Amihud liquidity may decrease due to an increase in market volatility rather than
because of fund managers’ trading behavior. 1155 The analysis performed in the DERA Study
does control for broad changes in market liquidity at the fund class-level. 1156 To the extent that
broad market effects drive variation in fund liquidity within a fund class in a way that is also
correlated with fund flows, we acknowledge the commenter’s concern about endogeneity and
have modified our interpretation in the discussion above, but we also note that there is anecdotal
evidence that supports this interpretation. 1157 With respect to the Amihud liquidity measure used
in the study, the commenter states that the DERA Study’s conclusion that a “10% outflow
increases the impact of selling $10 million of the asset-weighted average equity portfolio holding
by 11 basis points” is a key result supporting the proposal’s hypothesis that funds sell their more

1154

1156

DERA Study, supra footnote 95, at 43-44. The model includes Lipper class fixed effects, year-quarter fixed
effects, and interactions of those fixed effects. The year-quarter and interaction fixed effects should capture
any broad changes in liquidity within different fund styles over time, which could be related to
macroeconomic events.

1157

See, e.g., supra footnote 71.

374

liquid assets first to meet redemptions. We disagree that the specific economic interpretation of
the Amihud measure cited by the commenter is necessary to support the hypothesis that funds
tend to sell their more liquid assets: to the extent that the Amihud measure reflects the liquidity
of underlying fund assets, a decline in the average Amihud liquidity of a fund’s portfolio is
consistent with the fund disproportionately selling its more liquid assets.
The commenter concludes that the analysis in the DERA Study does not demonstrate that
funds are managing portfolios and redemptions in a manner that harms the interests of nonredeeming shareholders. 1158 We acknowledge that the analysis does not establish a direct link
between redemptions and quantifiable harm to non-redeeming shareholders; as discussed above,
it was designed to inform the Commission more generally about the current state of fund
liquidity. The commenter also states the DERA Study’s finding that municipal bond funds hold
less cash following redemptions implies that a 40% outflow would be required to deplete the
average municipal bond fund’s cash holdings. We acknowledge the commenter’s interpretation
of the analysis, but note that the results do not imply that all municipal bond funds would
necessarily require outflows of a similar magnitude to deplete a significant portion of their cash
holdings.
The commenter makes several statements regarding results related to the volatility of
fund flows. First, the commenter provides evidence that flow volatility declines with fund size,
notes that the DERA Study’s use of simple averages to calculate average flow volatility in a
given fund category overstates the highly volatile flows of small funds, and shows that assetweighted flow volatility measures are significantly smaller for all fund categories. 1159 We
1158

ICI Comment Letter II.

1159

ICI Comment Letter II.

375

acknowledge that the simple average will overstate smaller funds relative to an asset-weighted
average, but the opposite view holds too: asset-weighted averages will understate flow volatility
for small funds, and the rule is concerned with the potential liquidity risk problems at all funds.
The commenter also states that the relatively higher flow volatility of alternative funds may
simply be attributable to the fact that they are generally smaller in size (because small funds
generally tend to have more volatile flows as a percentage of their assets) and that, as they have
grown, the volatility of their flows has, if anything, decreased. We acknowledge that the flow
volatility of alternative funds may be a function of their smaller size, but also note that small
funds are also subject to the rule and that other fund categories, such as foreign bond funds,
exhibit higher flow volatility despite being relatively larger in size. The commenter also notes
that, as the DERA Study acknowledged, the predictability of fund flows is likely understated.
The purpose of analyzing the predictability of flows in the analysis was to determine, using a
simple model of fund flows, the extent which flow volatility was predictable and whether, after
accounting for predictability, the unexpected component of flow volatility varied across fund
types in the same way as total flow volatility. While fund managers may be able to predict a
larger fraction of flow volatility, the evidence in the DERA Study supports the notion that
unexpected flow volatility varies proportionally with total flow volatility, and the relative
ranking of unexpected flow volatility by fund type is not likely to change with a better model of
flows. The commenter also states that the DERA Study provides evidence that funds already
successfully manage volatile flows. 1160 The proposal acknowledged that this evidence supports
the view that funds do manage volatile flows by holding larger amounts of cash and liquid assets,
and this evidence provides support for the rule’s inclusion of flow volatility as a factor for funds
1160

ICI Comment Letter II.

376

to consider when managing risk. 1161 Finally, the commenter points out that, while the DERA
Study finds smaller funds have more volatile flows, small funds may find it easier to trade assets
with minimal price effects. We agree that small funds may have less price impact, but note that
any fixed trading costs incurred via smaller trades will involve larger proportional trading costs.
The commenter also provides evidence on the relationship between fund flows and
holdings of short-term assets for alternative strategy and high-yield bond funds. It finds no
relationship between the two, asserting that the lack of a relationship shows funds are not
systematically selling short-term assets to meet redemptions. However, this result is at the
aggregate level, and does not necessarily preclude a relationship between the two quantities at
the fund level for some funds. It also provides a fund-level analysis across high-yield bond
funds in 5 separate months and also does not find a relationship between the two in four of the
months. In one of the months, it does find statistically significant evidence that a decrease in
short-term assets is associated with outflows, consistent with the DERA Study’s finding. The
commenter’s inability to find a relationship is not evidence that there is no relationship per se: it
is possible the commenter’s test simply had low statistical power. To the extent that the
commenter’s evidence does support the claim that funds do not sell short-term assets in response
to fund flows, the DERA Study used a different measure of liquidity and did not claim any
evidence found using another measure, such as the short-term asset ratio used by the commenter,
would produce the same result. More specifically, while funds may not sell their most liquid
investments (which would be reflected in the short-term asset ratio used by the commenter), they
could still be disproportionately selling their more liquid investments.
With respect to the liquidity measure used in the DERA Study, the commenter points out
1161

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at n.631 and accompanying discussion.

377

that it only uses a single measure of market liquidity (Amihud illiquidity) and claims that the
measure is not sufficient to support the interpretations the proposal draws from the study. 1162 We
acknowledge that the use of alternative measures could alter some of the results and
interpretations in the DERA Study, but also emphasize that the DERA Study was intended to
generally inform the Commission about the current state of fund liquidity, not to justify each
policy choice made in the rule.
The commenter stated that the academic studies used in support of the DERA Study and
the proposal are either (1) theoretical and ignore important institutional details or (2) based on
empirical fund-level results which by their design cannot provide any commentary on marketwide concerns. With respect to the theoretical study cited in the proposal, it shows one
mechanism by which mutual fund shareholders may have a first-mover incentive using a
simplified model of the world for tractability; it is possible that in a model which captures more
institutional details as proposed by the commenter—taxes, longer investor horizons, and
reinvestment risk—this incentive is reduced or eliminated, but we are not aware of any other
studies that reach such a conclusion. With respect to any empirical studies, the primary goal of
the rule is to improve the fund-level management of liquidity and redemptions, which makes the
cited fund-level academic studies relevant for the discussion. The commenter also points out
that one of the empirical studies (Coval and Stafford), which provides evidence of negative price
pressure due to forced selling by mutual funds, also states that the ex-ante probability of an
equity mutual fund being affected by this risk is small because less than one percent of stocks are
affected in a given quarter. The proposal did not claim that forced selling by mutual funds was a
pervasive phenomenon, but did highlight that it is a possible risk that funds and their
1162

2. Disclosure and Reporting Requirements Regarding Liquidity Risk and Liquidity
Risk Management
a. Disclosure and Reporting Requirements
We are adopting amendments to Form N-1A as well as adopting new items to Form NPORT, Form N-CEN, and adopting Form N-LIQUID, to enhance fund disclosure and reporting
regarding liquidity and redemption practices. Specifically, amendments to Form N-1A will
require a fund to disclose: (i) the number of days in which the fund typically expects to pay
redemption proceeds to redeeming shareholders 1163 and (ii) the methods the fund typically
expects to use to meet redemption requests in stressed and non-stressed market conditions. 1164
New items on Form N-PORT will require a fund to confidentially disclose monthly: (i)
the fund’s highly liquid investment minimum and the number of days a fund’s holdings in assets
that are highly liquid investments fell below that minimum during a given reporting period; 1165
(ii) the liquidity classification of each investment as determined pursuant to rule 22e-4(b)(2)(i)
including the determination of whether the investment qualifies as an illiquid investment, and
(iii) the percentage of the fund’s highly liquid investments that the fund has segregated to cover,
or pledged to satisfy margin requirements in connection with, derivatives transactions in each of
the other liquidity classification categories. 1166 Once per quarter, funds will be required to
publicly disclose (with a 60-day delay): (i) the aggregated percentage of their portfolios invested
in each of the four liquidity classification categories, but funds will not be required to publicly

disclose the liquidity classification of each individual position; 1167 and (ii) the percentage of the
fund’s highly liquid investments that it has segregated to cover, or pledged to satisfy margin
requirements in connection with, derivatives transactions in each of other liquidity classification
categories. 1168
New items on Form N-CEN will require a fund to disclose certain information regarding
the use of committed lines of credit and interfund borrowing and lending. 1169 We have also
adopted a new item on Form N-CEN that will require an ETF to report whether it qualifies as an
In-Kind ETF. 1170
The final form amendments differ from the proposal in several ways that may have
potential economic consequences. In response to commenters’ suggestions, the rule does not
require funds to file credit agreements as part of Form N-1A. While Form N-PORT requires
funds to report position-level liquidity classifications to the Commission, these classifications
will not be publicly released. Instead, a fund will only be required to publicly disclose the
aggregate percentage of the fund’s holdings invested in each of the four liquidity classification
categories and the percentage in each of the four liquidity classification categories of the fund’s
highly liquid investments that are segregated to cover derivatives transactions. The adopted rule
also incorporates commenters’ suggestions that the Commission be notified more quickly if a
fund’s assets that are illiquid investments exceed 15% of its net assets by requiring funds to file
Form N-LIQUID indicating such a breach immediately after it occurs. With respect to the highly
liquid investment minimum, a fund is required to report any decline below the minimum that

1170

Item E.5 of Form N-CEN.

380

lasts more than 7 consecutive calendar days to the Commission by filing Form N-LIQUID,
whereas the proposal would have required that a fund not purchase less liquid investments while
below its minimum. Any significant economic effects of these changes are discussed below.
b. Benefits
The disclosure and reporting requirements will promote investor protection by improving
the availability of information regarding funds’ liquidity risks and risk management practices, as
well as funds’ redemption practices. As discussed above, funds’ disclosures to shareholders
regarding their redemption practices are currently varied in content and comprehensiveness. 1171
To the extent that the requirement for funds to disclose the number of days in which the fund will
pay redemption proceeds to redeeming shareholders fosters competition among funds to
minimize the timing of redemptions, and assuming funds are able to meet redemptions in the
time advertised, such competition could potentially be to the benefit of investors. Relative to the
proposal, final Form N-1A requires that funds disclose estimated payment times for each
payment method, which should reduce any potential investor confusion associated with the
complexity of estimates based on funds’ distribution channels under the proposal. 1172
While some funds voluntarily include disclosure regarding fund limitations on illiquid
asset holdings that track the 15% guideline, a fund is not currently required to disclose
information about the liquidity of its portfolio investments. In light of the relatively few
disclosure requirements regarding funds’ liquidity risks, liquidity risk management practices, and
redemption practices, as well as the current inconsistency in funds’ liquidity-related disclosures,
we believe that the disclosure and reporting requirements would increase shareholders’ and the

1171

See supra section III.G.1.a.

1172

See Fidelity Comment Letter.

381

Commission’s understanding of particular funds’ liquidity-related risks and redemption policies.
This in turn should assist investors in making investment choices that better match their risk
tolerances.
We note that, while Form N-PORT and Form N-CEN are designed primarily to assist the
Commission and its staff, we believe that the information in these forms (including the
liquidity-related information to be included in these forms) also will be valuable to investors and
other potential users. 1173 In particular, we believe that both sophisticated institutional investors
and third-party users that provide services to retail investors may find the publically disclosed
liquidity-related information to be useful. And we believe that individual investors could benefit
indirectly from the information collected on reports on Form N-PORT through analyses prepared
by third-party service providers.
The liquidity-related information that funds will be required to provide on Form N-PORT
and Form N-CEN will enhance investor protection by improving the Commission’s ability to
monitor funds’ liquidity using relevant and targeted data. This monitoring will permit us to
analyze liquidity trends in individual funds, and, to the extent that liquidity profiles are
comparable across funds, among certain types of funds and the fund industry as a whole, as well
as to better understand funds’ liquidity risk management practices. As discussed in our release
adopting rules and forms to modernize investment company reporting, the information we
receive on these reports will facilitate the oversight of funds and will assist the Commission, as
the primary regulator of such funds, to better effectuate its mission to protect investors, maintain
fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation. 1174 Some commenters
1173

382

supported the reporting of asset-level liquidity classifications if such information was only
provided to the Commission (i.e., made non-public), 1175 although some did object to the
disclosure regardless of whether or not it was made public. 1176
Form N-LIQUID will complement rule 22e-4’s enhanced focus on the limits on illiquid
investments and the highly liquid investment minimum discussed above by requiring reporting to
the SEC every time: (1) a fund’s assets that are illiquid investments exceed 15% of its net assets
(as well as additional reporting when the fund’s assets that are illiquid investments fall back to or
below 15% of its net assets); and (2) a fund’s investments in highly liquid investments that are
assets fall below its highly liquid investment minimum for more than 7 consecutive calendar
days. This enhanced reporting could produce significant benefits. For example, the SEC’s
market monitoring capacity could be enhanced, in that multiple close-in-time filings by similar
types of funds may be an indication of market stress in a market segment. Similarly, multiple
close-in-time filings by the same fund may be an indication that the fund is failing to adequately
manage its liquidity.
Form N-PORT as adopted does not require that the asset-level liquidity classifications be
publicly disclosed in order to address commenter concerns about the potential costs of such
disclosure (which are discussed in the costs section below). This change reduces some of the
proposal’s potential public disclosure benefits. Under the proposal, investors—by their own
efforts or via third-party products—could have compared how assets were classified according to
different funds’ subjective approaches and resolved discrepancies across funds to arrive at more

directly comparable fund liquidity profiles. Under the form as adopted, a fund will publicly
disclose a new aggregate liquidity profile by reporting the percentage of its portfolio assigned to
each of the four liquidity classification categories on Form N-PORT. This will provide a useful
snapshot of fund liquidity to investors and will increase the amount of information available to
investors about fund liquidity, but this snapshot may not be as informative as liquidity profiles
under the proposed rule. The final form requires funds to confidentially report their investment
liquidity classifications to the Commission via Form N-PORT. This maintains a major benefit of
the proposal, allowing the Commission to monitor funds’ liquidity levels and take action when
significant aberrations are discovered.
Similarly, the final form amendments do not require the public disclosure of a fund’s
highly liquid investment minimum in order to address commenter concerns, but it is not likely
that this change will significantly reduce the benefits of reporting this minimum: the primary
investor protection benefit of reporting the minimum via Form N-PORT is to encourage funds’
holding of highly liquid investments that correspond to the liquidity risks of their strategies. By
confidentially reporting the minimum, a fund will give the Commission the capability to monitor
whether the minimum is an outlier relative to other funds with similar investment strategies. The
oversight role of the fund’s board under rule 22e-4 is yet another safeguard in this respect.
Finally, Form N-PORT’s requirement that funds disclose the percentage of the fund’s
highly liquid investments that it has segregated to cover or pledged to satisfy margin
requirements in connection with derivatives transactions that are classified as moderately liquid
investments, less liquid investments, and illiquid investments, should more accurately reflect the
amount of highly liquid investments that are available to manage a fund’s liquidity risk. For
example, without such a disclosure, investors might assume a fund whose highly liquid
384

investments are all segregated to cover derivatives positions that are not highly liquid is better
prepared to handle redemption requests than it actually is.
Because we cannot predict the extent to which the requirements will enhance investors’
awareness of funds’ portfolio liquidity and liquidity risk, influence investors’ investments in
certain funds, or increase the Commission’s ability to protect investors, we are unable to quantify
the potential benefits discussed in this section.
c. Costs
Funds will incur one-time and ongoing annual costs to comply with the disclosure and
reporting requirements regarding liquidity and shareholder redemption practices. Commenters’
responses to the estimates of these costs are discussed in the PRA discussion below, and we have
updated all estimates in this section to reflect changes in the PRA. 1177
We estimate that the one-time costs to comply with the amendments to Form N-1A will
be approximately $324 per fund (plus printing costs). 1178 We estimate that each fund will incur
an ongoing cost associated with compliance with the amendments to Form N-1A of
approximately $81 each year to review and update the disclosure regarding redemptions.
The amendments to Form N-PORT will require funds to report on Form N-PORT the
liquidity classification of each portfolio investment, and we estimate that the average one-time
compliance costs associated with this reporting will be $15,576 per fund. 1179 Furthermore, we

1177

See infra section V.

1178

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 1 (1 hour to update registration statement disclosure
about redemption procedures) x $324 (blended rate for a compliance attorney ($340) and a senior
programmer ($308)) = $324. This figure incorporates the costs we estimated for each fund to update its
registration statement to include the required disclosure about: (i) the number of days in which the fund
will pay redemption proceeds to redeeming shareholders; and (ii) the methods the fund uses to meet
redemption requests in stressed and non-stressed market conditions. The costs associated with these
activities are all paperwork-related costs and are discussed in more detail infra at section V.F.

1179

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (i) project planning and systems design (24 hours x

385

estimate that 9,347 funds will be required to file, on a monthly basis, additional information on
Form N-PORT as a result of the amendments. 1180 Assuming that 35% of funds (3,271 funds) will
choose to license a software solution to file reports on Form N-PORT in house, 1181 we estimate
an upper bound on the initial annual costs to file the additional information associated with the
amendments for funds choosing this option of $783 per fund 1182 with annual ongoing costs of
$261 per fund. 1183 We further assume that 65% of funds (6,076 funds) will choose to retain a
third-party service provider to provide data aggregation and validation services as part of the

$264 (hourly rate for a senior systems analyst) = $6,336) and (ii) systems modification integration, testing,
installation and deployment (30 hours x $308 (hourly rate for a senior programmer) = $9,240). $6,336 +
$9,240 = $15,576. Estimates for drafting, integrating, implementing policies and procedures are addressed
in the discussion of rule 22e-4. This figure incorporates the costs that we estimated associated with
preparing the section of the fund’s report on Form N-PORT that will incorporate the information that will
be required under Item C.7. The costs associated with these activities are all paperwork-related costs and
are discussed in more detail infra at section V.E. As discussed in section V.E infra, we believe that any
external annual costs associated with filing Form N-PORT will be only incrementally affected by
compliance with Item C.7 of Form N-PORT, and thus Item C.7 does not affect our previous estimates of
these costs.
1180

There were 10,633 open-end funds (excluding money market funds, and including ETFs) as of the end of
2015. See 2016 ICI Fact Book, supra footnote 11, at 22, 176, 183. As discussed in note 1253, infra, we
assume that 75% of ETFs, or 1,196 ETFs, will identify as In-Kind ETFs, which are exempt from the
classification requirement, thereby reducing the total number of funds filing classification information to
9,347.

1181

This assumption tracks the assumption made in the Investment Company Reporting Modernization
Adopting Release that 35% of funds will choose to license a software solution to file reports on Form
N-PORT. See Investment Company Reporting Modernization Adopting Release, supra footnote 120.

1182

This estimate is based upon the following calculations: $783 in internal costs = ($783 = 3 hours x $261
(blended hourly rate for senior programmer ($308), senior database administrator ($312), financial
reporting manager ($266), senior accountant ($192), intermediate accountant ($157), senior portfolio
manager ($306), and compliance manager ($283)). We do not anticipate any change to external annual
costs as a result of the amendments. See infra at section V.E. The hourly wage figures in this and
subsequent footnotes are from SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry
2013, modified by Commission staff to account for an 1800-hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to
account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead.

1183

This estimate is based upon the following calculations: $261 in internal costs ($261 = 1 hour x $261
(blended hourly rate for senior programmer ($308), senior database administrator ($312), financial
reporting manager ($266), senior accountant ($192), intermediate accountant ($157), senior portfolio
manager ($306), and compliance manager ($283)). We do not anticipate any change to external annual
costs as a result of the amendments. See infra at section V.E.

preparation and filing of reports on Form N-PORT, 1184 and we estimate an upper bound on the
initial costs to file the additional information associated with the amendments for funds choosing
this option of $1,044 per fund 1185 with annual ongoing costs of $131 per fund. 1186
Likewise, compliance with the amendments to Form N-CEN will involve ongoing costs
as well as one-time costs. We estimate that 10,633 funds will be required to file responses on
Form N-CEN as a result of the amendments to the form. We estimate that the one-time and
ongoing annual compliance costs associated with providing additional responses to Form N-CEN
as a result of the amendments will be approximately $162 per fund. 1187
Based on these estimates, staff further estimates that the total one-time costs to comply
with the disclosure and reporting requirements will be approximately $55 million for all funds
that would file reports on Form N-PORT in house 1188 and approximately $103 million for all

1184

This assumption tracks the assumptions made in the Investment Company Reporting Modernization
Adopting Release that 65% of funds will choose to retain a third-party service provider to provide data
aggregation and validation services as part of the preparation and filing of reports on Form N-PORT. See
Investment Company Reporting Modernization Adopting Release, supra footnote 120.

1185

This estimate is based upon the following calculations: $1,044 in internal costs ($1,044 = 4 hours x $261
(blended hourly rate for senior programmer ($308), senior database administrator ($312), financial
reporting manager ($266), senior accountant ($192), intermediate accountant ($157), senior portfolio
manager ($306), and compliance manager ($283)). We do not anticipate any change to external annual
costs as a result of the amendments.

1186

This estimate is based upon the following calculations: $130.5 in internal costs ($130.5 = (0.5 hours x $261
(blended hourly rate for senior programmer ($308), senior database administrator ($312), financial
reporting manager ($266), senior accountant ($192), intermediate accountant ($157), senior portfolio
manager ($306), and compliance manager ($283)). We do not anticipate any change to external annual
costs as a result of the amendments.

1187

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 0.5 hour x $324 (blended hourly rate for a compliance
attorney ($340) and a senior programmer ($308)) = $162. This figure incorporates the costs that we
estimated associated with preparing the section of the fund’s report on Form N-CEN that will incorporate
the information that will be required under Item C.20. We do not estimate any additional costs in
connection with proposed Item E.5 of Form N-CEN because the new item only requires a yes or no
response. We do not estimate any change to the external costs associated with Form N-CEN. The costs
associated with these activities are all paperwork-related costs and are discussed in more detail infra at
section V.E.

1188

This estimate assumes that 35% of funds (3,271 funds) would choose to file reports on proposed Form
N-PORT in house (see infra section V.D) and is based on the following calculation: 3,271 funds x $16,845

387

funds that will use a third-party service provider to prepare and file reports on Form N-PORT. 1189
In addition, staff estimates that the total ongoing annual costs associated with the disclosure and
reporting requirements would be approximately $1.6 million for all funds that file reports on
Form N-PORT in house 1190 and approximately $2.3 million for all funds that use a third-party
service provider to prepare and file reports on Form N-PORT. 1191
Commenters expressed concern that it was not appropriate to require public disclosure of
liquidity classifications by position via Form N-PORT, arguing that reporting position-level
liquidity classifications creates significant costs which outweigh the potential benefits. For
example, they suggested this disclosure could create potential litigation exposures, create
investor confusion surrounding the perceived precision of the classifications, stifle innovation in
liquidity risk management, or facilitate predatory trading and/or first-mover incentives,
particularly during times of stress. 1192 We agree that funds could have encountered costs related
to the above concerns if they were required to follow the disclosure regime contemplated in the
original proposal. While investors already have access to fund portfolio positions, to the extent
that position-level liquidity classifications could have been valuable to professional traders,
predatory trading opportunities could have increased under the proposal. The final form
mitigates these costs by requiring that a fund’s most competitively-sensitive information—its

($324 + $15,576 + $783 + $162) = $55,099,995.
1189

This estimate assumes that 65% of funds (6,076) would choose to file reports on proposed Form N-PORT
with the assistance of third-party service providers (see infra section V.D) and is based on the following
calculation: 6,076 funds x $17,106 ($324 + $15,576 + $1,044 + $ 162) = $103,850,526.

1190

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 3,271 funds x $502.63 ($79.63 + $261 + $162) =
$1,644,102.73.

1191

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 6,071 funds x $372.63 ($79.63 + $131 + $162) =
$2,262,236.73

individual position liquidity classifications—be filed confidentially with the Commission.
The costs of the adopted form amendments differ from the proposal in several ways.
First, as discussed above, the Form N-PORT only requires that funds publicly disclose an
aggregate liquidity profile, which should significantly mitigate many of the potential costs
associated with the potential front running of mutual funds by sophisticated investors. Second,
Form N-PORT requires a fund to disclose the percentage of the fund’s highly liquid investments
that it has segregated to cover or pledged to satisfy margin requirements in connection with
derivatives transactions that are classified as moderately liquid investments, less liquid
investments, and illiquid investments. By contrast, the proposed rules required a fund to pair
each segregated asset with the derivative it was covering. The final rule’s approach should lower
costs relative to the proposal. We also are not requiring funds to file credit agreements as
exhibits to Form N-1A. Many commenters objected to the proposed requirement to file line of
credit agreements 1193 with some arguing that such filings would be unnecessary because lines of
credit are often already disclosed under existing requirements of Form N-1A, in a fund’s
statement of additional information, in footnotes to fund financial statements, and potentially in
Form N-CEN. 1194 In addition, commenters stated that public disclosure of line of credit
agreements could (1) weaken their ability to negotiate credit terms; 1195 (2) make public
proprietary and competitive information; 1196 and (3) discourage lending banks from granting
certain lending terms to funds (out of a concern that terms granted would become standard in

other lending agreements). 1197 Removing the requirement to file credit agreements as exhibits to
Form N-1A should, if anything, lead to a reduction in the costs associated with filing that form,
vis-à-vis the proposed rule.
The requirement to file Form N-LIQUID in three circumstances — if more than 15% of a
fund’s net assets are, or become, illiquid investments that are assets; if the fund’s illiquid
investments that are assets previously exceeded 15% of net assets and the fund determines that
its illiquid investments that are assets have changed to be less than or equal to 15% of net assets;
or if a fund’s holdings in highly liquid investments that are assets fall below the fund’s highly
liquid investment minimum for more than 7 consecutive calendar days — may impose small
incremental costs on funds. The adopted rule’s liquidity risk management framework should
help encourage funds to avoid exceeding the 15% illiquid investment limit, but in cases where
they must file Form N-LIQUID, there will be incidental costs associated with filing the form
itself. There will be similar incidental costs associated with filing Form N-LIQUID should a
fund breach its highly liquid investment minimum for more than 7 consecutive calendar days.
We estimate these costs as $1,745 per filing, and estimate the total number of filings to be
roughly 90 per year, for an aggregate cost of $157,050. 1198 Finally, any potential indirect costs
associated with filing the form, such as spillover effects or investor flight due to a breach, should
be limited because Form N-LIQUID filings will not be publicly disclosed. Because Form NLIQUID filings will be triggered by events that are part of a fund’s periodic review of its
investment classifications under rule 22e-4, the monitoring costs associated with Form NLIQUID are included in our estimates of the compliance costs for rule 22e-4 above.

d. Effects on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation
We believe the final rules’ disclosure requirements could increase informational
efficiency by providing additional information about the aggregate liquidity profile of funds’
portfolios to investors and third-party service providers. To the extent that aggregate liquidity
profiles—the percentages a fund holds in each of the four liquidity classification categories—are
comparable across funds, this could assist investors in evaluating the risks associated with certain
funds, which could increase allocative efficiency by assisting investors in making more informed
investment choices that better match their risk tolerances. However, because each fund has
discretion in how it defines both the asset type and liquidity classification of its portfolio
positions, the publicly disclosed aggregation of these classifications may not be directly
comparable across funds; in this case, allocative efficiency may not be enhanced, and, if fund
liquidity profiles are misinterpreted as being comparable, efficiency could be reduced. Enhanced
disclosure regarding funds’ liquidity and liquidity risk management practices could positively
affect competition by permitting investors to choose whether to invest in certain funds based on
this information. However, if investors were to move their assets among funds as a result of the
disclosure requirements (for example, if the disclosure made clear that a certain fund was able to
generate higher returns than its peers only because of high exposures to relatively less liquid
positions, which then led investors with limited risk tolerance to move assets out of this fund),
this could negatively affect the competitive stance of certain funds.
Increased investor awareness of funds’ portfolio liquidity and liquidity risk management
practices also could promote capital formation if investors find certain funds’ liquidity profiles or
risk management practices, or both, attractive, and this awareness promotes increased investment
in these funds (assuming these investments consist of assets that were not otherwise invested in
391

the capital markets) and in turn in the assets in which the funds invest. On the other hand,
disclosure which reveals liquidity risk could negatively impact capital formation if the disclosure
causes investors to perceive that some funds pose too great an investment risk. Investors could
consequently decide not to invest in these funds or to decrease their investment in these funds. If
these foregone investments are not reinvested elsewhere in capital markets, capital formation
would be negatively affected. Conversely, to the extent that investors assume that funds
investing in relatively less liquid investments could obtain a liquidity risk premium in the form
of higher returns over some period of time, the potential for higher returns could draw certain
investors to funds investing in relatively less liquid asset classes, which could positively affect
capital formation. If investors shift their invested investments between funds based on liquidity,
there could be capital formation effects stemming from increased (or decreased) investment in
the funds’ portfolio investments, even if the total capital invested in funds remains constant. For
example, if fund investors move assets from an investment strategy that entails relatively high
liquidity risk to one whose investment strategy involves relatively low liquidity risk, less liquid
portfolio asset classes could experience an adverse impact on capital formation while the more
liquid portfolio asset classes could experience a positive impact on capital formation, although
the total capital invested in funds would remain constant.
Relative to the proposal, the final disclosure and reporting requirements do not
significantly alter our assessment of the requirements’ impact on efficiency, competition, and
capital formation. The exclusion of individual portfolio position classification from public
disclosure requirements reduces the potential efficiency and capital formation gains that might
accrue from better informed investors: position-level data could have been used (directly or via
third-party vendor applications) to construct a detailed breakdown of a fund’s liquidity profile,
392

but any public analysis is now limited to an aggregate liquidity profile for each fund to address
the concerns of commenters regarding the potential costs of disclosing position-level liquidity
data publicly. At the same time, to the extent position-level liquidity classifications could be
valuable to professional traders, requiring less public disclosure may reduce any potential
inefficiencies that could have resulted from predatory trading or front running associated with
the disclosure of individual investment classifications.
In addition, while we are also imposing a new filing requirement via Form N-LIQUID,
this form will be filed confidentially with the Commission and will only be necessary when a
fund breaches the 15% illiquid investment limit, returns to compliance with the 15% illiquid
investment limit, or breaches its highly liquid investment minimum for longer than 7 consecutive
calendar days. Requiring notice to the Commission of these events may itself provide an
incentive for funds to manage their liquidity in such a way as to avoid triggering the reporting
obligation; where a reporting obligation is triggered, Form N-LIQUID will provide the
Commission with timely information that may prompt the Commission to inquire further into the
circumstances that gave rise to the requirement to file Form N–LIQUID. As discussed above,
for example, if a number of similarly-situated funds each file a report in close temporal
proximity to one another, or if a single fund files a series of reports, such information is likely to
be of value to the Commission in taking appropriate action to protect investors, if required. If
Form N-LIQUID provides an early warning of potential fund liquidity issues that is sufficiently
timely and clear to permit Commission involvement when needed to respond to the potential for
disruptive fund closures and associated negative consequences, including fund shareholder
dilution and any spillover effects, Form N-LIQUID could enhance efficiency to the extent that
negative price pressure on investments due to fire sales is avoided and, to the extent mutual fund
393

investors associate this with lower liquidity risk in the mutual fund industry, Form N-LIQUID
may promote capital formation.
e. Reasonable Alternatives
The following discussion addresses significant alternatives to the disclosure and reporting
requirements. More detailed alternatives to the individual elements of the requirements are
discussed in detail above. 1199
The Commission considered requiring each fund to disclose information about the
liquidity of its portfolio positions in the fund’s prospectus or on the fund’s website, in addition to
in reports filed on Form N-PORT. For example, we could have required a fund to disclose its
highly liquid investment minimum, or the percentage of the fund’s portfolio invested in each of
the liquidity categories specified under rule 22e-4(b)(2)(i), in its prospectus or on its website.
This additional disclosure could further increase transparency with respect to funds’ portfolio
liquidity and liquidity-related risks. But this additional disclosure could inappropriately
emphasize risks relating to a fund’s portfolio liquidity over other significant risks associated with
an investment in the fund. In addition, funds are not precluded from voluntarily disclosing any
of the information contained in the rule’s required disclosure forms on their websites, so it is
likely more efficient to allow investor demand for this information to drive whether or not funds
publicly disclose this information of their own volition.
Conversely, the Commission also considered both limiting and expanding the
enhancements to funds’ liquidity-related disclosures on Form N-PORT. As discussed above, we
are sensitive to the possibility that any amendments to the form could facilitate front-running,
predatory trading, and other activities that could be detrimental to a fund and its investors. We
1199

See supra sections III.G.1.a, III.G.1.b, III.G.2.d, and III.G.3.c.

394

likewise carefully considered costs and benefits with respect to the new liquidity-related
disclosures required under Form N-PORT and concluded that these disclosures appropriately
balance related costs with the benefits that could arise from the ability of the Commission, and
members of the public, to monitor and analyze the liquidity of individual funds, as well as
liquidity trends within the fund industry.
In response to the proposal, which would have required that certain position-level data be
reported publicly (albeit with a 60 day delay) commenters suggested that the Commission
require (1) no reporting of any kind, or (2) no public disclosure, in light of potential negative
competitive effects of public reporting and the limited benefits of stale data in understanding
current fund liquidity levels. 1200 The Commission considered these alternatives, but rejected the
first alternative because it would have provided no useful information to investors to permit them
to better understand their funds’ liquidity profiles, and no useful information to the Commission
to enable the Commission to better monitor funds’ liquidity. With regard to the second
alternative, providing no information to investors would have the same defect of not permitting
investors the opportunity to assess and make investment decisions based on better information
about funds’ liquidity. However, recognizing commenters’ concern about voluminous, stale
data, the final form provides investors with aggregated information — the percentage of the
funds’ portfolio falling into each of the four liquidity categories — and reserves the more
detailed data for confidential submission to the Commission. We believe the approach in the
final form strikes an appropriate balance, by mitigating many of the concerns expressed by
commenters while preserving significant benefits for investors (both directly, and through the
Commission’s improved ability to monitor funds).

PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT ANALYSIS
A.

Introduction
New rule 22e-4 contains “collections of information” within the meaning of the

Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”). 1201 In addition, the amendments to Form N-1A will
impact the collections of information burden under those rules and form. The new reporting
requirements on Form N-CEN and Form N-PORT will impact the collections of information
burdens associated with these forms described in the Investment Company Reporting
Modernization Adopting Release. 1202 New rule 30b1-10 and new Form N-LIQUID also contain a
collection of information within the meaning of the PRA. 1203
The titles for the existing collections of information are: “Form N-1A under the
Securities Act of 1933 and under the Investment Company Act of 1940, Registration Statement
of Open-End Management Investment Companies” (OMB Control No. 3235-0307). In the
Investment Company Reporting Modernization Adopting Release, we submitted new collections
of information for Form N-CEN and Form N-PORT. 1204 The titles for these new collections of
information are: “Form N-CEN Under the Investment Company Act, Annual Report for
Registered Investment Companies” and “Form N-PORT Under the Investment Company Act,
Monthly Portfolio Investments Report.”
We are submitting new collections of information for new rule 22e-4, new rule 30b1-10,
and new Form N-LIQUID under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The titles for these new
collections of information will be: “Rule 22e-4 Under the Investment Company Act of 1940,

submitting these collections of information to the OMB for review in accordance with 44 U.S.C.
3507(d) and 5 CFR 1320.11. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not
required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid control
number.
The Commission is adopting new rule 22e-4, new rule 30b1-10, new Form N-LIQUID,
and amendments to Form N-1A. The Commission also is adopting new items to Form N-CEN
and Form N-PORT. The new rules and amendments are designed to promote effective liquidity
risk management throughout the open-end fund industry and enhance disclosure and
Commission oversight of fund liquidity and shareholder redemption practices. We discuss
below the collection of information burdens associated with these reforms. In the Proposing
Release, the Commission solicited comment on the collection of information requirements and
the accuracy of the Commission’s statements in the Proposing Release.
B.

Rule 22e-4
Rule 22e-4 requires a “fund” and an In-Kind ETF, each within the meaning of rule 22e-

4, 1205 to establish a written liquidity risk management program that is reasonably designed to
assess and manage the fund’s or In-Kind ETF’s liquidity risk. This program includes policies
and procedures that incorporate certain program elements, including: (i) for funds, the
1205

The term “funds” is defined under rule 22e-4(a)(4) to mean an open-end management investment company
that is registered or required to be registered under section 8 of the Act and includes a separate series of
such an investment company, but does not include a registered open-end management investment company
that is regulated as a money market fund under § 270.2a-7 or an In-Kind ETF, as defined under rule 22e4(a)(9).

397

classification of the liquidity of a fund’s portfolio positions; (ii) for funds and In-Kind ETFs, the
assessment, management, and periodic review of liquidity risk (with such review occurring no
less frequently than annually); (iii) for funds that do not primarily hold assets that are highly
liquid investments, the determination of and periodic review of the fund’s highly liquid
investment minimum and establishment of policies and procedures for responding to a shortfall
of the fund’s highly liquid investment minimum, which includes reporting to the fund’s board of
directors; and (iv) for funds and In-Kind ETFs, the establishment of policies and procedures
regarding redemptions in kind, to the extent that the fund engages in or reserves the right to
engage in redemptions in kind. The rule also requires board approval and oversight of a fund’s
or In-Kind ETF’s liquidity risk management program and recordkeeping. Rule 22e-4 also
requires a limited liquidity review, under which a UIT’s principal underwriter or depositor
determines, on or before the date of the initial deposit of portfolio securities into the UIT, that the
portion of the illiquid investments that the UIT holds or will hold at the date of deposit that are
assets is consistent with the redeemable nature of the securities it issues and retains a record of
such determination for the life of the UIT and for five years thereafter.
The requirements under rule 22e-4 that a fund and In-Kind ETF adopt a written liquidity
risk management program, report to the board, maintain a written record of how the highly liquid
investment minimum was determined and written policies and procedures for responding to a
shortfall of the fund’s highly liquid investment minimum, which includes reporting to the fund’s
board of directors (for funds that do not primarily hold highly liquid investments), establish
written policies and procedures regarding how the fund will engage in redemptions in kind, and
retain certain other records are all collections of information under the PRA. In addition, the
requirement under rule 22e-4 that the principal underwriter or depositor of a UIT assess the
398

liquidity of the UIT on or before the date of the initial deposit of portfolio securities into the UIT
and retain a record of such determination for the life of the UIT, and for five years thereafter, is
also a collection of information under the PRA. The respondents to rule 22e-4 will be open-end
management investment companies (including, under certain circumstances, In-Kind ETFs but
excluding money market funds), and the principal underwriters or depositors of UITs under
certain circumstances.
1. Preparation of Written Liquidity Risk Management Program
We believe that some open-end funds regularly monitor the liquidity of their portfolios as
part of the portfolio management function, but they may not have written policies and procedures
regarding liquidity management. Rule 22e-4 requires funds and In-Kind ETFs to have a written
liquidity risk management program. We believe such a program will minimize dilution of
shareholder interests by promoting stronger and more effective liquidity risk management across
open-end funds and will reduce the risk that a fund or In-Kind ETF will be unable to meet
redemption obligations.
In the Proposing Release, we estimated that funds within 867 fund complexes would be
subject to rule 22e-4. 1206 Compliance with rule 22e-4 would have been mandatory for all such
funds. We further estimated that a fund complex would incur a one-time average burden of 40
hours associated with documenting the liquidity risk management programs adopted by each
fund within the complex. Under the proposal, rule 22e-4 would have required fund boards to
approve the liquidity risk management program and any material changes to the program, and we
estimated a one-time burden of nine hours per fund complex associated with fund boards’ review

1206

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at n.819 and accompanying text. This estimate excluded ETFs
and UITs. See also 2016 ICI Fact Book, supra footnote 11, at Fig. 1.8.

399

and approval of the funds’ liquidity risk management programs and preparation of board
materials. Amortized over a 3-year period, we estimated this would be an annual burden per
fund complex of about 16 hours. Accordingly, we estimated that the total burden for initial
documentation and review of funds’ written liquidity risk management program would be 42,483
hours. 1207 We also estimated that it would cost a fund complex approximately $38,791 to
document, review and initially approve these policies and procedures, for a total cost of
approximately $33,631,797. 1208
We did not receive any comments on the estimated hour and costs burdens associated
with the overall preparation of written liquidity risk management programs under rule 22e-4
discussed above. We did, however, receive comments on the costs associated with the
classification of the liquidity of a fund’s portfolio positions, which we address below in
connection with Form N-PORT. The Commission has modified the estimated increase in annual
burden hours and total time costs that will result from the new written liquidity risk management
requirements of rule 22e-4 based on certain modifications made to rule 22e-4 and updates to the
industry data figures that were utilized in the Proposing Release. Based upon our review of
industry data, we estimate that funds within 873 fund complexes would be subject to rule 22e-

1207

This estimate was based on the following calculation: (40 + 9) hours x 867 fund complexes = 42,483 hours.

1208

These estimates were based on the following calculations: 20 hours x $301 (hourly rate for a senior
portfolio manager) = $6,020; 20 hours x $455.5 (blended hourly rate for assistant general counsel ($426)
and chief compliance officer ($485)) = $9,110; 5 hours x $4,465 (hourly rate for a board of 8 directors) =
$22,325; 4 hours (for a fund attorney’s time to prepare materials for the board’s determinations) x $334
(hourly rate for a compliance attorney) = $1,336. $6,020 + $9,110 + $22,325 + $1,336 = $38,791; $38,791
x 867 fund complexes = $33,631,797. The hourly wages used are from SIFMA’s Management &
Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013, modified to account for an 1800-hour work-year and
multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead. The staff previously
estimated in 2009 that the average cost of board of director time was $4,000 per hour for the board as a
whole, based on information received from funds and their counsel. Adjusting for inflation, the staff
estimates that the current average cost of board of director time is approximately $4,465.

400

4, 1209 updated from 867 in our proposal. Compliance with rule 22e-4 will be mandatory for all
such funds and In-Kind ETFs, with certain program elements applicable to certain funds within a
fund complex based upon whether the fund is an In-Kind ETF or does not primarily hold assets
that are highly liquid investments, as noted above. We discuss mandatory compliance with rule
22e-4 with respect to principal underwriters and depositors of UITs in section V.B.5. below.
The Commission continues to estimate that a fund complex will incur a one-time average
burden of 40 hours associated with documenting the liquidity risk management programs
adopted by each fund within a fund complex. In light of the requirement that a fund subject to
the highly liquid investment minimum requirement adopt and implement policies and procedures
for responding to a shortfall of the fund’s highly liquid investment minimum, and responding to
any potential excesses of the 15% illiquid asset limit, both of which include reporting to the
fund’s board of directors, we estimate a one-time burden of 10 hours, rather than 9 hours, per
fund complex associated with fund boards’ review and approval of the funds’ liquidity risk
management programs and preparation of board materials. Amortized over a 3-year period, we
estimate this will be an annual burden per fund complex of about 16.67 hours. Accordingly, we
estimate that the total burden for initial documentation and review of funds’ written liquidity risk
management program will be 43,650 hours. 1210 We also estimate that it will cost a fund complex
approximately $41,467.5 to document, review, and initially approve these policies and
procedures, for a total cost of approximately $36,201,127.5. 1211

1209

See 2016 ICI Fact Book, supra footnote 11, at Fig. 1.8.

1210

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (40 +10) hours x 873 fund complexes = 43,650 hours.

1211

These estimates are based on the following calculations: 20 hours x $306 (hourly rate for a senior portfolio
manager) = $6,120; 20 hours x $463 (blended hourly rate for assistant general counsel ($433) and chief
compliance officer ($493)) = $9,260; 5.5 hours x $4,465 (hourly rate for a board of 8 directors) =
$24,557.5; 4.5 hours (for a fund attorney’s time to prepare materials for the board’s determinations) x $340

401

2. Reporting Regarding the Highly Liquid Investment Minimum
Rule 22e-4 requires any fund that does not primarily hold assets that are highly liquid
investments to determine a highly liquid investment minimum for the fund, which must be
reviewed at least annually, and may not be changed during any period of time that a fund’s assets
that are highly liquid investments are below the determined minimum without approval from the
fund’s board of directors. 1212 The fund’s investment adviser or officers designated to administer
the liquidity risk management program must provide a written report to the fund’s board at least
annually that describes a review of the adequacy and effectiveness of the fund’s liquidity risk
management program, including, if applicable, the operation of the highly liquid investment
minimum.1213 In addition, the fund must adopt and implement policies and procedures for
responding to a shortfall of the fund’s assets that are highly liquid investments below its highly
liquid investment minimum, which must include reporting to the fund’s board of directors with a
brief explanation of the causes of the shortfall, the extent of the shortfall, and any actions taken
in response, and, if the shortfall lasts more than 7 consecutive calendar days, an explanation of
how the fund plans to come back into compliance with its minimum within a reasonable period
of time. 1214
Similar to the highly liquid investment minimum, in the Proposing Release, we proposed
(hourly rate for a compliance attorney) = $1,530. $6,120 + $9,260 + $24,557.5 + $1,530 = $41,467.5;
$41,467.5 x 873 fund complexes = $36,201,127.5. The hourly wages used are from SIFMA’s Management
& Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013, modified by Commission staff to account for an
1800-hour work-year and inflation, and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee
benefits, and overhead. The staff previously estimated in 2009 that the average cost of board of director
time was $4,000 per hour for the board as a whole, based on information received from funds and their
counsel. Adjusting for inflation, the staff estimates that the current average cost of board of director time is
approximately $4,465.

402

that funds be required to establish a three-day liquid asset minimum as part of a fund’s liquidity
risk management program, subject to board review, and we estimated that, for each fund
complex, compliance with this reporting requirement would entail: (i) five hours of portfolio
management time, (ii) five hours of compliance time, (iii) five hours of professional legal time
and (iv) 2.5 hours of support staff time, requiring an additional 17.5 burden hours at a time cost
of approximately $5,193 per fund complex to draft the required report to the board. 1215 We
estimated that the total burden for preparation of the board report would be 15,173 hours, at an
aggregate cost of $4,502,331. 1216
We received several comments addressing, in general, the potential costs associated with
a fund establishing and implementing a liquid asset minimum. To minimize the costs of
implementing a liquid asset minimum, one commenter recommended that funds that have
demonstrated a history of investing in only three-day liquid assets be excluded from the proposed
three-day liquid asset minimum requirements and thus not incur the costs of related board
reporting requirements. 1217 Other commenters characterized the program requirements under the
proposal as a one-size-fits-all approach to liquidity risk management and expressed the belief

1215

This estimate was based on the following calculation: 5 hours x $301 (hourly rate for a senior portfolio
manager) = $1,505; 5 hours x $283 (hourly rate for compliance manager) = $1,415; 5 hours x $426 (hourly
rate for assistant general counsel) = $2,130; and 2.5 hours x $57 (hourly rate for general clerk) = $143.
$1,505 + $1,415 + $2,130 + $143 = $5,193. The hourly wages used were from SIFMA’s Management &
Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013, modified to account for an 1800-hour work-year and
multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead. The hourly wage
used for the general clerk was from SIFMA’s Office Salaries in the Securities Industry 2013, modified to
account for an 1800-hour work-year and multiplied by 2.93 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee
benefits, and overhead.
Because, under the proposal, each fund within a fund complex would be required to determine its own
three-day liquid asset minimum, this estimate assumed that the report at issue would incorporate an
assessment of the three-day liquid asset minimum for each fund within the fund complex.

1216

These estimates were based on the following calculations: 867 fund complexes x 17.5 hours = 15,173
hours; and $5,193 x 867 fund complexes = $4,502,331.

1217

See CFA Comment Letter.

403

that such requirements were expensive and unsuitable for many funds. 1218
As discussed above, the Commission has modified the proposed three-day liquid asset
minimum requirement to a highly liquid investment minimum requirement that is tailored to
apply only to funds that do not primarily hold highly liquid investments, thereby potentially
reducing the number of funds required to establish, maintain, and report a highly liquid
investment minimum. In addition, the final rule retains a role for the board in overseeing the
fund’s liquidity risk management program, but eliminates certain of the more specific and
detailed approval requirements originally proposed. 1219 Unlike the proposal, however, rule 22e-4
requires a fund that is subject to the highly liquid investment minimum requirement to also adopt
and implement policies and procedures to respond to a shortfall of assets that are highly liquid
investments below the fund’s highly liquid investment minimum, which includes reporting to the
fund’s board of directors.
In light of these modifications, we estimate that the burdens associated with board
reporting will decrease overall in comparison to the proposal due to the elimination of certain
board oversight requirements originally proposed and the potential reduction in the number of
funds that would require board oversight of a highly liquid investment minimum. Therefore, we
have modified the estimated annual burden hours and total costs that will result from the highly
liquid investment minimum requirement under rule 22e-4. 1220 We estimate that, for each fund
complex, compliance with the reporting requirement would entail: (i) 4 hours, rather than five
1218

See, e.g., Dechert Comment Letter; Federated Comment Letter.

1219

See supra section III.H.3.

1220

Under the proposal, because each fund within a fund complex would have been required to determine its
own three-day liquid asset minimum, the estimate under the proposal assumed that the report at issue would
incorporate an assessment of the three-day liquid asset minimum for each fund within the fund complex.
As adopted, rule 22e-4 only requires the assessment of the highly liquid investment minimum for funds that
do not primarily hold assets that are highly liquid investments.

404

hours, of portfolio management time; (ii) 4 hours, rather than five hours, of compliance time; (iii)
4 hours, rather than five hours, of professional legal time; and (iv) 2 hours, rather than 2.5 hours,
of support staff time, requiring an additional 14 burden hours at a time cost of approximately
$4,224 per fund complex to draft the required report to the board. 1221 We estimate that fund
complexes will have at least one fund that will be subject to the highly liquid investment
minimum requirement. Thus, we estimate that 873 fund complexes will be subject to this
requirement under rule 22e-4 and that the total burden for preparation of the board report
associated will be 12,222 hours, at an aggregate cost of $3,687,552. 1222
3. Recordkeeping
Final rule 22e-4 requires a fund or In-Kind ETF to maintain a written copy of the policies
and procedures adopted pursuant to its liquidity risk management program for five years in an
easily accessible place. 1223 The rule also requires a fund to maintain copies of materials provided
to the board in connection with its initial approval of the liquidity risk management program and
any written reports provided to the board, for at least five years, the first two years in an easily
accessible place. 1224 If applicable, a fund must also maintain a written record of how its highly
liquid investment minimum and any adjustments to the minimum were determined, as well as
1221

The estimate is based on the following calculation: 4 hours x $306 (hourly rate for a senior portfolio
manager) = $1,224; 4 hours x $288 (hourly rate for compliance manager) = $1,152; 4 hours x $433 (hourly
rate for assistant general counsel) = $1,732; and 2 hours x $58 (hourly rate for general clerk) = $116.
$1,224 + $1,152 + $1,732 + $116 = $4,224. The hourly wages used are from SIFMA’s Management &
Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013, modified by Commission staff to account for an
1800-hour work-year and inflation, and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee
benefits, and overhead. The hourly wage used for the general clerk is from SIFMA’s Office Salaries in the
Securities Industry 2013, modified by Commission staff to account for an 1800-hour work-year and
inflation, and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead.

1222

These estimates are based on the following calculations: 873 fund complexes x 14 hours =12,222 hours;
and $4,224 x 873 fund complexes = $3,687,552.

1223

See rule 22e-4(b)(4)(i).

See rule 22e-4(b)(4)(ii).

405

any reports to the board regarding a shortfall in the fund’s highly liquid investment minimum, for
five years, the first two years in an easily accessible place. 1225 The retention of these records
would be necessary to allow the staff during examinations of funds to determine whether a fund
is in compliance with the liquidity risk management program requirements.
Under the proposal, the recordkeeping requirements were substantially similar to those
being adopted. In the Proposing Release, we estimated that the burden to retain these records
would be five hours per fund complex, with 2.5 hours spent by a general clerk and 2.5 hours
spent by a senior computer operator, with an estimated time cost per fund complex of $361. 1226
We also estimated that the total burden for recordkeeping related to the liquidity risk
management program would be 4,335 hours, at an aggregate cost of $312,987. 1227
We did not receive any comments on the estimated hour and cost burdens associated with
the recordkeeping requirements of rule 22e-4. The Commission has modified the estimated
increase in annual burden hours and total time costs that will result from these requirements in
light of modifications to change those subject to the requirements to funds and In-Kind ETFs and
to require them to maintain reports to boards concerning a shortfall of the fund’s highly liquid
investment minimum and the new requirement to retain records submitted to the board related to
shortfalls of the minimum. We believe that, on an annual basis, the burden to retain records in
connection with rule 22e-4 will be four hours, rather than five hours per fund complex, with 2
hours, rather than 2.5 hours, spent by a general clerk, and 2 hours, rather than 2.5 hours, spent by
a senior computer operator, with an estimated time cost per fund complex of $292, rather than
1225

See rule 22e-4(b)(4)(iii).

1226

This estimate was based on the following calculations: 2.5 hours x $57 (hourly rate for a general clerk) =
$143; 2.5 hours x $87 (hour rate for a senior computer operator) = $218. $143 + $218 = $361.

1227

This estimate was based on the following calculations: 867 fund complexes x 5 hours = 4,335 hours. 867
fund complexes x $361 = $312,987.

406

$361, based on updated data concerning funds and fund personnel salaries. 1228 In addition, we
estimate that the total burden for recordkeeping related to the liquidity risk management program
requirement of rule 22e-4 will be 3,492 hours, rather than 4,335 hours, at an aggregate cost of
$254,916, rather than $312,987. 1229
4. Estimated Total Burden for Open-end Funds
Amortized over a three-year period, we estimate that the hour burdens and time costs
associated with rule 22e-4 for open-end funds, including the burden associated with (1) funds’
initial documentation and review of the required written liquidity risk management program, (2)
reporting to a fund’s board regarding the fund’s highly liquid investment minimum, and (3)
recordkeeping requirements will result in an average aggregate annual burden of 26,190 hours,
rather than 28,611 hours as proposed, and average aggregate time costs of $14,780,326.5, rather
than $14,431,215 as proposed. 1230 We continue to estimate that there are no external costs
associated with this collection of information.
5. UIT Liquidity Determination
As discussed above, we recognize that UITs may in some circumstances be subject to
liquidity risk (particularly where the UIT is not a pass-through vehicle and the sponsor does not
maintain an active secondary market for UIT shares). We believe that UITs may not have
written policies and procedures regarding liquidity management and are adopting a new
requirement under rule 22e-4 with respect to UITs. On or before the date of initial deposit of
1228

This estimate is based on the following calculations: 2 hours x $58 (hourly rate for a general clerk) = $116;
2 hours x $88 (hour rate for a senior computer operator) = $176. $116 + $176 = $292.

1229

This estimate is based on the following calculations: 873 fund complexes x 4 hours = 3,492 hours. 873
fund complexes x $292 = $254,916.

1230

These estimates are based on the following calculations: 43,650 hours (year 1) + (2 x 12,222 hours) (years
2 and 3) + (3 x 3,492 hours) (years 1, 2 and 3) ÷ 3 = 26,190 hours; $36,201,127.5 (year 1) + (2 x
$3,687,552) (years 2 and 3) + (3 x $254,916) (years 1, 2 and 3) ÷ 3 = $14,780,326.5.

407

portfolio securities into a registered UIT, the UIT’s principal underwriter or depositor is required
to determine that the portion of the illiquid investments that the UIT holds or will hold at the date
of deposit that are assets is consistent with the redeemable nature of the securities it issues, and
maintain a record of that determination for the life of the UIT and for five years thereafter. The
retention of these records would be necessary to allow the staff during examinations to determine
whether a UIT is in compliance with the liquidity risk assessment required under rule 22e-4.
This assessment would occur on or before the initial deposit of portfolio securities of a new UIT
and thus would only need to occur once. Maintenance of the records would be required for the
life of the UIT and for five years thereafter.
We estimate that 1615 newly registered UITs will be subject to the UIT liquidity
determination requirement under rule 22e-4 each year. 1231 Compliance with rule 22e-4(c) will be
mandatory for all principal underwriters or depositors of such UITs. We estimate that the
principal underwriter or depositor of a UIT will incur a one-time average burden of 10 hours to
document its determination that the portion of the illiquid investments that the UIT holds or will
hold at the date of deposit that are assets is consistent with the redeemable nature of the
securities it issues. Amortized over a 3 year period, we estimate this would be an annual burden
per UIT of about 3 hours. Accordingly, we estimate that the total burden for the initial
documentation and review of funds’ written liquidity risk management program would be 16,150
hours. 1232 We also estimate that it will cost the principal underwriter or depositor of a UIT
approximately $2,466 to perform and document this review, for a total cost of approximately
1231

This estimate is based upon staff review of new UIT registration statements and semi-annual reporting on
Form N-SAR filed with the Commission and Monthly Unit Investment Trust Data released by the
Investment Company Institute, available at https://www.ici.org/research/stats, for the months of January
through December of 2015.

1232

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 10 hours x 1615 new UITs = 16,150 hours.

408

$3,982,590. 1233
We estimate that the burden to retain these records will be two hours per UIT, with 1
hour spent by a general clerk and 1 hour spent by a senior computer operator, with an estimated
time cost per UIT of $146. 1234 We also estimate that the total burden for recordkeeping related to
the liquidity risk management program will be 3,230 hours, at an aggregate cost of $235,790. 1235
We estimate that there are no external costs associated with this collection of information.
C.

Form N-PORT
Today, the Commission is adopting Form N-PORT, which will require funds to report

information within thirty days after the end of each month about their monthly portfolio holdings
to the Commission in a structured data format. 1236 Preparing a report on Form N-PORT is
mandatory and a collection of information under the PRA, and the information required by Form
N-PORT will be data-tagged in XML format. Except for certain reporting items specified in the
form, responses to the reporting requirements will be kept confidential for reports filed with
respect to the first two months of each quarter; the third month of the quarter will not be kept
confidential, but made public sixty days after the quarter end.
In the Investment Company Reporting Modernization Adopting Release, we estimate
that, for the 35% of funds that would file reports on Form N-PORT in house, the per fund
1233

These estimates are based on the following calculations: 5 hours x $308 (hourly rate for a senior
programmer) = $1540; 2 hours x $463 (blended hourly rate for assistant general counsel ($433) and chief
compliance officer ($493)) = $926. $1,540 + $926 = $2,466; $2,466 x 1615 estimated new UITs =
$3,982,590. The hourly wages used are from SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the
Securities Industry 2013, modified by Commission staff to account for an 1800-hour work-year and
inflation, and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead.

1234

This estimate is based on the following calculations: 1 hour x $58 (hourly rate for a general clerk) = $58; 1
hours x $88 (hour rate for a senior computer operator) = $88. $58 + 88 = $146.

1235

This estimate is based on the following calculations: 1615 UITs x 2 hours = 3,230 hours. 1615 UITs x
$146 = $235,790.

1236

See Investment Company Reporting Modernization Adopting Release, supra footnote 120.

409

average aggregate annual hour burden will be 144 hours per fund, and the average cost to license
a third-party software solution will be $4,805 per fund per year. 1237 For the remaining 65% of
funds that would retain the services of a third party to prepare and file reports on Form N-PORT
on the fund’s behalf, we estimate that the average aggregate annual hour burden will be 125
hours per fund, and each fund will pay an average fee of $11,440 per fund per year for the
services of third-party service provider. In sum, we estimate that filing reports on Form NPORT will impose an average total annual hour burden of 144 hours on applicable funds, and all
applicable funds will incur on average, in the aggregate, external annual costs of $103,787,680,
or $9,118 per fund. 1238
Today, we are also adopting amendments to Form N-PORT concerning liquidity
information that require a fund to report information about the fund’s highly liquid investment
minimum (if applicable), 1239 the liquidity classification for each portfolio investment among four
liquidity categories (with the fourth category covering investments that qualify as “illiquid
investments” under the 15% illiquid investment limit), 1240 certain information on the percentage
of the fund’s highly liquid investments that is segregated to cover, or pledged to satisfy margin
requirements in connection with, fund’s derivatives transactions in each of the other liquidity
categories, 1241 and the aggregate percentage of the fund representing each of the four liquidity

proposal, would have been reported as a 15% standard asset in response to proposed Item C.7 of proposed

410

categories. 1242 Unlike the proposal, the amendments adopted today will not require funds to
indicate the dollar amount attributable to different classifications for different portions within a
given holding. 1243 We believe that requiring funds to report information about the liquidity of
portfolio investments will enhance the Commission’s ability to assess liquidity risk in the openend fund industry and assist in our regulatory oversight efforts. Moreover, we believe that this
information will help investors and other potential users of information on Form N-PORT better
understand the liquidity risks in funds.
1. Liquidity Classification
Under rule 22e-4(b)(1)(ii), an open-end management investment company (other than a
money market fund or an In-Kind ETF) is required as part of its liquidity risk management
program to classify the liquidity of each of its portfolio investments (including each of the fund’s
derivatives transactions) as a highly liquid investment, moderately liquid investment, less liquid
investment, or illiquid investment.
Under the proposal, all open-end funds would be required to classify portfolio assets
under a days-to-cash framework and report such classifications on Form N-PORT. 1244 In the
Proposing Release, we estimated that 8,734 funds would be required to file, on a monthly basis,
additional information on Form N-PORT as a result of the proposed amendments to N-PORT to
require funds provide additional liquidity information. 1245 We stated our expectation that funds
would incur a one-time internal burden to initially classify a fund’s portfolio securities and
1242

See Item C.7.c of Form N-PORT.

1243

See supra section III.C

1244

See id.; see also Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at section III.B.

1245

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at n.850 and accompanying text. This was based on estimates
that there were 8,734 open-end funds (excluding money market funds, and including ETFs (for purposes of
these calculations, we excluded non-1940 Act ETFs)) as of the end of 2014.

411

program existing systems to conduct the ongoing classifications and reviews required under the
proposal for reporting purposes. We estimated that each fund would incur an average one-time
burden of 54 hours at a time cost of $15,330. 1246 Amortized over a three-year period, we
estimated that this would result in an average annual hour burden of approximately 18 burden
hours and a time cost of $5,110. 1247
Many commenters expressed concerns over the operational costs associated with the
assignment of liquidity classifications and the reporting of this information on Form N-PORT.
Several commenters expressed the belief that the liquidity classification requirement could
impose significant direct costs to a fund and its shareholders (e.g., new operational systems, trade
order management systems, and other processes to handle complex classification schemes),
which commenters anticipated to be in excess of the Commission’s estimates under the
proposal. 1248 One commenter estimated that the costs associated with building a liquidity
classification system could range in the millions of dollars for fund complexes that have large
numbers of portfolio positions. 1249 Another commenter estimated $2 million in initial
implementation costs and more than $650,000 in annual recurring costs in connection with
automating the classification process for over 63,000 portfolio positions.1250 This commenter
also expressed the belief that substantial resources, including additional investment professionals
1246

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, n.851 and accompanying text. We estimated that these systems
modifications would include the following costs: (i) project planning and systems design (24 hours x $260
(hourly rate for a senior systems analyst) = $6,240) and (ii) systems modification integration, testing,
installation and deployment (30 hours x $303 (hourly rate for a senior programmer) = $9,090. $6,240 +
$9,090 = $15,330.

1247

$15,330 ÷ 3 = $5,110. See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at n.852 and accompanying text.

1248

See, e.g., CFA Comment Letter; Federated Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter; Voya Comment Letter.

combined as of December 31, 2015).

412

and compliance personnel, and additional expenses associated with third-party service providers
would increase costs associated with the classification requirement. 1251 Some commenters also
expressed concern that the costs of diverting resources and key personnel were not considered in
the Commission’s cost estimates. 1252
As discussed above, we are adopting a liquidity classification requirement under rule
22e-4 with a number of modifications to address commenters’ concerns. Unlike the proposal
which would have applied to all open-end funds, In-Kind ETFs are not subject to the
classification requirements under rule 22e-4(b)(ii). The classification categories have been
reduced from six to four and the timeframe for projections substantially reduced, with the fourth
category designated for those investments that qualify as “illiquid investments” harmonized with
the codified 15% illiquid investment limit. Furthermore, a fund may classify portfolio
investments based on asset class, rather than position-by-position, so long as the fund or its
adviser does not have information about any market, trading, or investment-specific
considerations that are reasonably expected to significantly affect the liquidity characteristics of
an investment and would suggest a different classification for that investment.
We believe that these modifications to the liquidity classification requirements will
reduce the number of funds subject to the liquidity classification requirements and will address
some of the costs commenters anticipate funds and fund shareholders would bear to establish
new operational, trade, and other systems to process and report fund liquidity classification
information. However, we recognize, as discussed above, that several commenters suggested
that implementation of liquidity classification systems would be more costly than we estimated.

413

Accordingly, we believe, on balance, that the per fund estimates that we proposed are reasonable
and are not reducing them, despite having adopted some modifications to rule 22e-4 that we
believe reduce the burden relative to the proposal.
We estimate that 9,347 funds, rather than 8,734 funds, will be required to file, on a
monthly basis, additional information on Form N-PORT as a result of the modifications to Form
N-PORT to require additional liquidity information. 1253 We continue to expect that funds will
incur a one-time internal burden to initially classify a fund’s portfolio securities and program
new and/or existing systems to conduct the ongoing classifications and reviews required under
rule 22e-4 for reporting purposes. We continue to estimate that each fund will incur an average
one-time burden of 54 hours, at a time cost of $15,576, rather than $15,330 based on updated
data concerning funds and fund personnel salaries. 1254 Amortized over a three-year period, we
estimate that this will result in an average annual hour burden of approximately 18 burden hours,
and a time cost of $5,192, rather than $5,110. 1255
2. Reporting on Form N-PORT
In addition to the classification and review of securities, we estimated in the Proposing
Release that 8,734 1256 funds would be required to file, on a monthly basis, additional information

1253

This is based on estimates that there are 9,039 open-end mutual funds (excluding money market funds) and
1,594 ETFs as of the end of 2015. See supra footnote 1045 and accompanying text. Based on staff
experience, we estimate that more than 75% of ETFs or 1,196 ETFs will identify as In-Kind ETFs and thus
will not be subject to the classification requirement. 9,039 + (1,594 – 1,196) = 9,437.

1254

We estimate that these systems modifications will include the following costs: (i) project planning and
systems design (24 hours x $264 (hourly rate for a senior systems analyst) = $6,336) and (ii) systems
modification integration, testing, installation and deployment (30 hours x $308 (hourly rate for a senior
programmer) = $9,240. $6,336 + $9,240 = $15,576.

1255

$15,576 ÷ 3 = $5,192.

1256

See Proposing Release, supra footnote 9, at section V.E. There were 8,734 open-end funds (excluding
money market funds, and including ETFs) as of the end of 2014. See 2016 ICI Fact Book, supra footnote
11, at 177, 184.

414

on Form N-PORT. We estimated that each fund that files reports on Form N-PORT in house
(35%, or 3,057 funds) would require an average of approximately 3 burden hours to compile
(including review of the information), tag, and electronically file the additional information in
light of the proposed additions regarding liquidity information for the first time and an average
of approximately 1 burden hours for subsequent filings. Therefore, we estimated the per fund
average annual hour burden associated with the incremental changes to Form N-PORT as a result
of the proposed additions for these funds would be an additional 14 hours for the first year 1257 and
an additional 12 hours for each subsequent year. 1258 Amortized over three years, we estimated
that the average annual hour burden would be an additional 12.67 hours per fund. 1259
In the Proposing Release, we also estimated that 65% of funds (5,677) would retain the
services of a third party to provide data aggregation, validation and/or filing services as part of
the preparation and filing of reports on proposed Form N-PORT on the fund’s behalf. 1260 For
these funds, we estimated that each fund would require an average of approximately 4 hours to
compile and review the information with the service provider prior to electronically filing the
report for the first time and an average of 0.5 burden hours for subsequent filings.
Therefore, in the Proposing Release, we estimated that the per-fund average annual hour
burden associated with the incremental changes to proposed Form N-PORT as a result of the
proposed additions related to liquidity information for these funds would be an additional 9.5

1257

The estimate was based on the following calculation: (1 filing x 3 hours) + (11 filings x 1 hour) = 14
burden hours in the first year.

1258

This estimate was based on the following calculation: 12 filings x 1 hour = 12 burden hours in each
subsequent year.

1259

The estimate was based on the following calculation: (14 + (12 x 2)) ÷ 3 = 12.67.

1260

Proposing Release, supra footnote 9.

415

hours for the first year 1261 and an additional 6 hours for each subsequent year. 1262 Amortized over
three years, we estimated that the average aggregate annual hour burden would be an additional
7.17 hours per fund. 1263 In sum, we estimated that the proposed additions to Form N-PORT
would impose an average total annual hour burden of an additional 79,436.28 hours on
applicable funds. 1264 We did not anticipate any change to the total external annual costs of
$97,674,221 associated with Form N-PORT. 1265
As discussed in section V.E.2 above, many commenters expressed concerns over the
operational costs associated with the assignment of liquidity classifications and the reporting of
this information on Form N-PORT. In addition, one commenter recommended that estimated
costs to purchase third-party liquidity assessment data be included in the total estimated costs to
comply with proposed rule given the likelihood that many funds will subscribe to such services
to operationally comply with the rule 22e-4. 1266
The Commission has modified the estimated increase in annual burden hours and total
time costs that will result from Form N-PORT and the liquidity related amendments to Form NPORT in consideration of commenters’ concerns that the Commission underestimated the
operational requirements for reporting and to reflect updates to the industry data figures that
were utilized in the Proposing Release. We estimate that 9,347 funds would be required to file,
1261

The estimate was based on the following calculation: (1 filing x 4 hours) + (11 filings x 0.5 hour) = 9.5
burden hours in the first year.

1262

This estimate was based on the following calculation: 12 filings x 0.5 hour = 6 burden hours in each
subsequent year.

1263

The estimate was based on the following calculation: (9.5 + (6 x 2)) ÷ 3 = 7.17.

1264

The estimate was based on the following calculation: (3,057 funds x 12.67 hours) + (5,677 funds x 7.17
hours) = 79,436.28 hours.

416

on a monthly basis, additional information on Form N-PORT as a result of the additional
liquidity-related reporting items adopted today. 1267
We estimate that each fund that files reports on Form N-PORT in house (35%, or 3,271)
will require an average of approximately 6 burden hours, rather than 3 burden hours, to compile
(including review of the information), tag, and electronically file the additional liquidity
information required on Form N-PORT for the first time and an average of approximately 2
burden hours, rather than 1 burden hour, for subsequent filings. Therefore, we estimate the per
fund average annual hour burden associated with the incremental changes to Form N-PORT as a
result of the added liquidity information for these funds would be an additional 28 hours, rather
than 14 hours for the first year 1268 and an additional 24 hours for each subsequent year. 1269
Amortized over three years, the average annual hour burden would be an additional 25.33 hours
per fund. 1270
We further estimate that 65% of funds (9,076) will retain the services of a third party to
provide data aggregation, validation and/or filing services as part of the preparation and filing of
reports on Form N-PORT on the fund’s behalf. For these funds, we estimate that each fund will
require an average of approximately 8 hours, rather than 4 hours, to compile and review the
added liquidity-related information with the service provider prior to electronically filing the
report for the first time and an average of 1 burden hour, rather than 0.5 burden hours, for
subsequent filings. Therefore, we estimate the per fund average annual hour burden associated
1267

See footnote 1253 and accompanying text.

1268

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (1 filing x 6 hours) + (11 filings x 2 hour) = 28 burden
hours in the first year.

1269

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 12 filings x 2 hour = 24 burden hours in each
subsequent year.

1270

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (28 + (24 x 2)) ÷ 3 = 25.33.

417

with the liquidity-related changes to Form N-PORT for these funds would be an additional 19
hours, rather than 9.5 hours, for the first year 1271 and an additional 12 hours, rather than 6 hours,
for each subsequent year. 1272 Amortized over three years, the average aggregate annual hour
burden would be an additional 14.33 hours per fund, rather than 7.17 hours per fund. 1273
In sum, we estimate that the adopted additional liquidity reporting information on Form
N-PORT will impose an average total annual hour burden of an additional 169,923.51 hours,
rather than 79,436.28 hours, on applicable funds. 1274 As we stated in the Proposing Release, we
believe that the changes to Form N-PORT associated with reporting liquidity classifications will
not result in third party service providers charging additional fees above those estimated in the
Investment Company Modernization Proposing Release. Therefore, we have revised our
estimates of number of funds affected as discussed previously, but are continuing to estimate the
same external costs for hiring third party service providers as in the Investment Company
Modernization Adopting Release. Accordingly, we estimate that the total external annual cost
burden of compliance with the information collection requirements of Form N-PORT will be
$103,787,680, or $9,118 per fund. 1275
D.

Form N-LIQUID and Rule 30b1-10
As discussed above, we are adopting a new requirement that open-end investment

companies, including In-Kind ETFs but not including money market funds, file a current report
1271

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (1 filing x 8 hours) + (11 filings x 1 hour) = 19 burden
hours in the first year.

1272

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 12 filings x 1 hour = 12 burden hours in each
subsequent year.

1273

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (19 + (12 x 2)) ÷ 3 = 14.33.

1274

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (3,271 funds x 25.33 hours) + (6,076 funds x 14.33
hours) = 169,923.51 hours.

on Form N-LIQUID on a non-public basis when certain events related to their liquidity occur. 1276
Similar to Form 8-K under the Exchange Act, 1277 or Form N-CR under the Investment Company
Act for money market funds, 1278 Form N-LIQUID requires disclosure, by means of a current
report filed with the Commission, of certain specific reportable events. The information reported
on Form N-LIQUID concerns events under which more than 15% of a fund’s or In-Kind ETF’s
net assets are, or become, illiquid investments that are assets as defined in rule 22e-4 and when
holdings in illiquid investments are assets that previously exceeded 15% of a fund’s net assets
have changed to be less than or equal to 15% of the fund’s net assets. 1279 The information
reported on Form N-LIQUID also regards events under which a fund’s holdings in assets that are
highly liquid investments fall below the fund’s highly liquid investment minimum for more than
7 consecutive calendar days. A report on Form N-LIQUID is required to be filed, as applicable,
within one business day of the occurrence of one or more of these events. 1280
This reporting requirement on Form N-LIQUID is a collection of information under the
PRA. The information provided on Form N-LIQUID will enable the Commission to receive
information on fund liquidity events more uniformly and efficiently and will enhance the
Commission’s oversight of funds when significant liquidity events occur and its ability to
respond to market events. The Commission will be able to use the information provided on
Form N-LIQUID in its regulatory, disclosure review, inspection, and policymaking roles. This
1276

This requirement will be implemented through our adoption of new rule 30b1-10, which requires funds to
file a report on new Form N-LIQUID in certain circumstances. See rule 30b1-10; Form N-LIQUID. For
purposes of the PRA analysis, therefore, the burden associated with the requirements of rule 30b1-10 is
included in the collection of information requirements of Form N-LIQUID.

The staff estimates that the Commission will receive, in the aggregate, an average of 30
reports 1281 per year filed in response to an event specified on Part B (“Above 15% Illiquid
Investments”), an average of 30 reports 1282 per year filed in response to an event specified on Part
C (“At or Below 15% Illiquid Investments”), and an average of 30 reports 1283 per year filed in
response to an event specified on Part D (“Highly Liquid Investments Below the Highly Liquid
Investment Minimum”) of the form.
When filing a report on Form N-LIQUID, 1284 staff estimates that a fund will spend on
average approximately 4 hours 1285 of an in-house attorney’s time and one 1286 hour of an in-house
accountant’s time to prepare, review, and submit Form N-LIQUID, at a total time cost of
$1,745. 1287 Accordingly, in the aggregate, staff estimates that compliance with new rule 30b1-10
and Form N-LIQUID will result in a total annual burden of approximately 450 burden hours and
total annual time costs of approximately $157,050. 1288 Given an estimated 10,633 funds will be

Commission staff estimates this figure based, in part, by reference to the total of 28 Form N-CR filings
received by the Commission from mid-July 2015 to mid-July 2016. We recognize that the circumstances
under which money market funds report events on Form N-CR are not the same as the liquidity events
reported on Form N-LIQUID and that reported occurrences may be less than or more than 30. We believe,
however, that Form N-CR provides a helpful guidepost for estimation purposes and believe an estimation
of 30 reports is appropriate for purposes of this PRA.

1284

For purposes of this estimate, the staff expects that it would take approximately the same amount of time to
prepare and file a report on Form N-LIQUID, regardless under which Part of Form N-LIQUID it is filed.

1285

This estimate is derived in part from our current PRA estimate for Form N-CR and Form 8-K.

1287

This estimate is based on the following calculations: (4 hours x $386/hour for an attorney = $1,544), plus
(1 hour x $201/hour for a senior accountant = $201), for a combined total of 5 hours at total time costs of
$1,745.

1288

This estimate is based on the following calculations: (30 reports filed per year with respect to Part B) + (30
reports filed per year with respect to Part C) + (30 reports filed per year with respect to Part D) = 90 reports
filed per year. 90 reports filed per year x 5 hours per report = approximately 450 total annual burden hours.

required to comply with new rule 30b1-10 and Form N-LIQUID, 1289 this would result in an
annual burden of approximately 0.04 burden hours and annual time costs of approximately $15
on a per-fund basis. Staff estimates that there will be no external costs associated with this
collection of information.
E.

Form N-CEN
On May 20, 2015, we proposed to amend rule 30a-1 to require all funds to file reports

with certain census-type information on proposed Form N-CEN with the Commission on an
annual basis. Proposed Form N-CEN would have been a collection of information under the
PRA, and was designed to facilitate the Commission’s oversight of funds and its ability to
monitor trends and risks. The collection of information under Form N-CEN would be mandatory
for all funds, and responses would not be kept confidential.
In the Investment Company Reporting Modernization Proposing Release, we estimated
that the average annual hour burden per response for proposed Form N-CEN for the first year
would be 32.37 hours and 12.37 hours in subsequent years. 1290 Amortizing the burden over three
years, we estimated that the average annual hour burden per fund per year would be 19.04 and
the total average annual hour burden would be 59,900 hours. 1291 We also estimated that all
applicable funds would incur, in the aggregate, external annual costs of $1,748,637, which would
include the costs of registering and maintaining LEIs for funds.
We are adopting, substantially as proposed, amendments to Form N-CEN to enhance the
90 reports filed per year x $1,745 in costs per report = $157,050 total annual costs.
1289

This estimate is based on the number of funds the staff estimates will be required to file reports on Form NPORT with the Commission. For purposes of this PRA, the staff assumes that the universe of funds
affected by rule 30b1-9 for Form N-PORT would be similar to the universe of funds affected by rule 30b110 for Form N-LIQUID.

reporting of a fund’s liquidity risk management practices. Specifically, the amendments to Form
N-CEN will require a fund to report information about lines of credit, but in a modification to the
proposal, funds will report about both committed and uncommitted lines of credit. 1292 As
proposed, funds will be required to report information such as the size of the line of credit, the
number of days that the line of credit was used, and the identity of the institution with whom the
line of credit is held. 1293 The amendments to Form N-CEN also will require a fund to report
whether it engaged in interfund lending or interfund borrowing. 1294 In addition, amendments to
Form N-CEN will require an ETF to report whether it qualifies as an “In-Kind ETF” for
purposes of rule 22e-4. 1295
In the Proposing Release, we estimated that 8,734 funds would be required to file
responses on Form N-CEN as a result of the proposed amendments to the form. We estimated
that the average annual hour burden per additional response to Form N-CEN as a result of the
proposed amendments would be 0.5 hour per fund per year for a total average annual hour
burden of 4,367 hours. 1296 We did not estimate any change to the external costs associated with
proposed Form N-CEN.
We did not receive any comments on these estimated hour and cost burdens. The
Commission has modified the estimated increase in annual burden hours and total time costs that

1293

See Id.

1294

See Item C.20.b. of Form N-CEN.

1295

See Item E.5 of Form N-CEN. We do not estimate any change in burden as a result of Item E.5 of Form NCEN because the item only requires a yes or no response. In the Proposing Release, we also proposed to
add to Form N-CEN a requirement for funds to report whether the fund required that an authorized
participant post collateral to the fund or any of its designated service providers in connection with the
purchase or redemption of fund shares during the reporting period. We are adopting this requirement in the
Reporting Modernization Release. See supra footnote 898.

1296

This estimate was based on the following calculation: 8,734 funds x 0.5 hours = 4,367 hours.

422

will result from the amendments based on the modifications to the proposal to require funds to
report information on uncommitted lines of credit in addition to committed lines of credit as well
as in light of updated data concerning funds and fund personnel salaries. We estimate that
10,633 funds, rather than 8,734 funds will be required to file responses on Form N-CEN as a
result of the amendments to the form based on updates to the industry data figures that were
utilized in the Proposing Release. 1297 We estimate that the average annual hour burden per
additional response to Form N-CEN as a result of the adopted additions to Form N-CEN will be
one hour per fund per year, instead of 0.5 hour per fund per year, for a total average annual hour
burden of 10,633, rather than 4,367 hours. 1298 We do not estimate any change to the external
costs associated with proposed Form N-CEN.
F.

Form N-1A
Form N-1A is the registration form used by open-end investment companies. The

respondents to the amendments to Form N-1A adopted today are open-end management
investment companies registered or registering with the Commission. Compliance with the
disclosure requirements of Form N-1A is mandatory, and the responses to the disclosure
requirements are not confidential. We currently estimate for Form N-1A a total hour burden of
1,579,974 hours, and the total annual external cost burden is $124,820,197. 1299
We are adopting amendments to Form N-1A that require funds to disclose additional
information concerning the procedures for redeeming a fund’s shares. Funds will be required to
describe the number of days following receipt of shareholder redemption requests in which the
1297

See 2016 ICI Fact Book, supra footnote 11, at 22, 176, 183.

1298

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 10,633 funds x 1 hour = 10,633 hours.

1299

These estimates are based on the last time the rule’s information collections were submitted for PRA
renewal in 2014.

423

fund reasonably expects to pay redemption proceeds to redeeming shareholders. 1300 Funds also
will be required to describe the methods used to meet redemption requests in stressed and
non-stressed market conditions. 1301 Funds, however, will not be required to file as exhibits to
their registration statements credit agreements as originally proposed. Overall, we believe that
requiring funds to provide this additional disclosure regarding redemption procedures will
provide Commission staff, investors, and market participants with improved information about
the procedures funds use to meet their redemption obligations.
Form N-1A generally imposes two types of reporting burdens on investment companies:
(i) the burden of preparing and filing the initial registration statement; and (ii) the burden of
preparing and filing post-effective amendments to a previously effective registration statement
(including post-effective amendments filed pursuant to rule 485(a) or 485(b) under the Securities
Act, as applicable). In the Proposing Release, we estimated that each fund would incur a onetime burden of an additional 2 hours, 1302 at a time cost of an additional $637, 1303 to draft and
finalize the required disclosure and amend its registration statement in response to the proposed
Form N-1A disclosure requirements. In aggregate, we estimated that funds would incur a onetime burden of an additional 17,468 hours, 1304 at a time cost of an additional $5,563,558, 1305 to
comply with the Form N-1A disclosure requirements originally proposed. We estimated that

See Item 11(c)(8) of Form N-1A.

1302

This estimate was based on the following calculation: 1 hour to update registration statement to include
swing pricing-related disclosure statements + 1 hour to update registration statement disclosure about
redemption procedures = 2 hours.

1303

This estimate was based on the following calculation: 2 hours x $318.5 (blended rate for a compliance
attorney ($334) and a senior programmer ($303)) = $637.

1304

This estimate was based on the following calculations: 2 hours x 8,734 funds = 17,468 hours.

1305

This estimate was based on the following calculation: 17,468 hours x $318.50 (blended rate for a
compliance attorney ($334) and a senior programmer ($303)) = $5,563,558.

424

amortizing the one-time burden over a three-year period would result in an average annual
burden of an additional 5,823 hours at a time cost of an additional $1,854,519. 1306
In the Proposing Release, we also estimated that each fund would incur an ongoing
burden of an additional 0.25 hours, at a time cost of an additional $80, 1307 each year to review and
update the proposed disclosure in response to Item 11 and Item 28 of Form N-1A regarding the
pricing and redemption of fund shares and the inclusion of credit agreements as exhibits,
respectively. In aggregate, we estimated that funds would incur an annual burden of an
additional 2,184 hours, 1308 at a time cost of an additional $695,604, 1309 to comply with the
proposed Form N-1A disclosure requirements.
In the Proposing Release, we further estimated that amortizing these one-time and
ongoing hour and cost burdens over three years would result in an average annual increased
burden of approximately 0.50 hours per fund, 1310 at a time cost of $265.42 per fund. 1311
In total, we estimated in the Proposing Release that funds would incur an average annual
increased burden of approximately 8,007 hours, 1312 at a time cost of approximately
$2,550,123, 1313 to comply with the proposed Form N-1A disclosure requirements. We did not

This estimate was based on the following calculation: 17,468 hours ÷ 3 = 5,823 average annual burden
hours; $5,563,558 burden costs ÷ 3 = $1,854,519 average annual burden cost.

1307

This estimate was based on the following calculations: 0.25 hours x $318.50 (blended hourly rate for a
compliance attorney ($334) and a senior programmer ($303)) = $79.63.

1308

This estimate was based on the following calculation: 0.25 hours x 8,734 funds = 2,183.5 hours.

1309

This estimate was based on the following calculation: 2,184 hours x $318.50 (blended hourly rate for a
compliance attorney ($334) and a senior programmer ($303)) = $695,604.

1310

This estimate was based on the following calculation: 1 burden hour (year 1) + 0.25 burden hour (year 2) +
0.25 burden hour (year 3) ÷ 3 = 0.50 hours.

1311

This estimate was based on the following calculation: $637 (year 1 monetized burden hours) + $79.63 (year
2 monetized burden hours) + $79.63 (year 3 monetized burden hours) ÷ 3 = $265.42.

1312

This estimate was based on the following calculation: 5,823 hours + 2,184 hours = 8,007 hours.

This estimate was based on the following calculation: $1,854,519 + $695,604 = $2,550,123.

estimate any change to the external costs associated with the proposed amendments to Form N1A.
One commenter stated that the cost estimates under the proposal were overly optimistic,
including as an example our estimated $637 cost per fund to implement the proposed Form N-1A
disclosure requirements. 1314 As discussed above, our amendments to Form N-1A include several
modifications or clarifications from the proposal that address concerns raised by commenters and
that are intended, in part, to decrease implementation burdens relative to the proposal. For
example, we are not adopting the proposed requirement that funds file credit agreements as
exhibits to their registration statements. Furthermore, instead of a requirement for funds to
disclose the exact number of days in which a fund would pay redemption proceeds, including the
number of days that apply for each distribution channel of the fund, funds are required to
disclose the number of days a fund reasonably expects to pay redemption proceeds and are not
required to account for all distribution channels, only varied payment methods, if applicable. We
believe that these modifications will increase the quality of information provided to fund
shareholders about the timing of their redemption proceeds and, at the same time, reduce the
likelihood that disclosures regarding such timing will be overly granular and complex for
investors and overly burdensome for registrants.
We believe that certain modifications from and clarifications to the proposal that we are
adopting today as well as the removal of the swing pricing disclosure requirements from this
Release will generally reduce the estimated burden hours and costs associated with the adopted
1314

See FSR Comment Letter (noting that changes to a fund’s disclosure typically involve a number of
stakeholders and several rounds of drafting and review, such that costs associated with even modest
changes to fund disclosure can have a serious cost component). With the exception of this comment, we
did not receive comments on the estimated hour and costs burdens associated with the disclosure
amendments to Form N-1A under the proposal.

426

amendments to Form N-1A relative to the proposal. Furthermore, we have considered the
concern expressed by one commenter that the burdens and costs estimated in the proposal were
overly optimistic and believe that any possible underestimates in burdens and costs expressed in
the proposal have been offset by the adopted modifications that reduce such burdens. For these
reasons, we believe that the amendments to Form N-1A adopted today, including modifications
from the proposal, will reduce the estimated burden hours and costs stated in the Proposing
Release.
We estimate that each fund will incur a one-time burden of an additional hour, rather than
2 hours, to draft and finalize the required disclosure and amend its registration statement, 1315 but
at a time cost of an additional $324, rather than $637, 1316 based on updated data concerning funds
and fund personnel salaries and the removal of the swing pricing disclosure requirement. In
aggregate, we estimate that funds will incur a one-time burden of an additional 11,114 hours, 1317
rather than 17,468 hours, at a time cost of an additional $3,600,936, 1318 rather than $5,563,558, to
comply with the Form N-1A disclosure requirements as adopted. We estimate that amortizing
the one-time burden over a three-year period will result in an average annual burden of an
additional 3,705 hours, rather than 5,823 hours at a time cost of an additional $1,200,312, rather
than $1,854,519. 1319
1315

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 1 hour to update registration statement disclosure about
redemption procedures = 1 hour.

1316

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 1 hour x $324 (blended rate for a compliance attorney
($340) and a senior programmer ($308)) = $324.

1317

This estimate was based on the following calculations: 1 hour x 11,114 funds (including money market
funds and ETFs) = 11,114 hours.

1318

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 11,114 hours x $324 (blended rate for a compliance
attorney ($340) and a senior programmer ($308)) = $3,600,936.

1319

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 11,114 hours ÷ 3 = 3,704.67 average annual burden
hours; $3,600,936 burden costs ÷ 3 = $1,200,312 average annual burden cost.

427

In addition, we estimate that each fund will incur an ongoing burden of an additional 0.25
hours, but at a time cost of an additional $81, 1320 each year to review and update disclosures
required in response to the amendments to Form N-1A. In aggregate, we estimate that funds will
incur an annual burden of an additional 2,778.50 hours, 1321 at a time cost of an additional
$900,234, 1322 to comply with the Form N-1A disclosure requirements adopted today.
Furthermore, we estimate that amortizing these one-time and ongoing hour and cost
burdens over three years will result in an average annual increased burden of approximately 0.50
hours per fund, 1323 at a time cost of $162 per fund. 1324
In total, we estimate that funds will incur an average annual increased burden of
approximately 6,483.17 hours, 1325 at a time cost of approximately $3,300,858, 1326 to comply with
the Form N-1A disclosure requirements adopted today. We do not estimate any change to the
external costs associated with these amendments to Form N-1A.

prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (“IRFA”) in conjunction with the Proposing
Release in September 2015. 1328 The Proposing Release included, and solicited comment, on the
IRFA. In the Proposing Release, we also proposed amendments to rule 22c-1, rule 31a-2, and
Form N-1A as well as additions to Form N-CEN regarding the use of swing pricing. 1329
A.

Need for the Rule
With the exception of money market funds, open-end funds (including both in-kind and

other ETFs) and UITs are not currently subject to requirements under the federal securities laws
or Commission rules that specifically require them to manage their liquidity risk, 1330 although
there are guidelines stating that such entities should limit their investments in illiquid assets. 1331
In addition, funds are only subject to limited disclosure and reporting requirements concerning a
fund’s liquidity risk and risk management. 1332 We understand that funds today engage in a
variety of different practices, with varying levels of comprehensiveness, for classifying the
liquidity of their portfolio investments, assessing and managing liquidity risk, and disclosing
information about their liquidity risk, redemption practices, and liquidity risk management
practices to investors. 1333
The Commission is adopting a new rule, amendments to current rules, a new form and
amendments to current forms to promote effective liquidity risk management throughout the
open-end fund industry and thereby reduce the risk that funds will be unable to meet redemption
obligations and mitigate dilution of the interests of fund shareholders. The changes also seek to

enhance disclosure regarding fund liquidity and redemption practices. Specifically, a primary
objective of these liquidity regulations is to promote shareholder protection by elevating the
overall quality of liquidity risk management across the fund industry, as well as by increasing
transparency of funds’ liquidity risks and risk management. The liquidity regulations are also
intended to lessen the possibility of investor dilution created by insufficient liquidity risk
management. Finally, the liquidity regulations are meant to address recent industry
developments that have underscored the significance of funds’ liquidity risk management
practices. Each of these objectives is discussed in detail in section III above.
B.

Significant Issues Raised by Public Comment
In the Proposing Release, we requested comment on the IRFA, requesting in particular

comment on the number of small entities that would be subject to the proposed liquidity
regulations and whether the proposed liquidity regulations would have any effects that have not
been discussed. We requested that commenters describe the nature of any effects on small
entities subject to the proposed liquidity regulations and provide empirical data to support the
nature and extent of such effects. We also requested comment on the estimated compliance
burdens of the proposed liquidity regulations and how they would affect small entities. We
received a number of comments related to the impact of our proposal on small entities, with
some commenters expressing concern that liquidity risk management programs, as proposed,
would require building entirely new systems and/or maintaining parallel system, which certain of
the commenters believed could generate disproportionate burdens on small funds. 1334 We discuss
these costs in detail in section V., above, and conclude that such costs are justified by the
benefits of liquidity risk management programs.
1334

See Dechert Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter I; SIFMA Comment Letter I; T. Rowe Comment Letter.

C.

Small Entities Subject to the Rule
An investment company is a small entity if, together with other investment companies in

the same group of related investment companies, it has net assets of $50 million or less as of the
end of its most recent fiscal year. 1335 Commission staff estimates that, as of December 31, 2015,
there were 78 small open-end investment companies (within 76 fund complexes) that would be
considered small entities; this number includes open-end ETFs.
D.

Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements
1. New Rule 22e-4
Rule 22e-4 generally requires each registered open-end fund (but not including money

market funds), including each small entity, to establish a written liquidity risk management
program. 1336 A fund’s board will be required to approve the fund’s liquidity risk management
program, as well as the fund’s designation of the fund’s investment adviser or officers as
responsible for administering the fund’s liquidity risk management program, and review a report
on the program’s effectiveness no less than annually. In addition, for funds that do not primarily
hold assets that are highly liquid investments, the new rule requires the determination of and
periodic review of the fund’s highly liquid investment minimum and establishment of policies
and procedures for responding to a shortfall of the fund’s highly liquid investment minimum,
which includes reporting to the fund’s board of directors. The new rule also requires a fund’s
liquidity risk management program to incorporate certain specified elements. 1337 Rule 22e-4
includes tailored liquidity risk management program requirements for ETFs, intended to target
ETFs’ unique risks while eliminating requirements that are largely inapplicable to ETFs that
1335

See supra footnote 113.

1337

431

redeem in kind. 1338 The rule also includes liquidity-related requirements for UITs, intended to
recognize the unmanaged structure of UITs while requiring that principal underwriters or
depositors of UITs to determine, on or before the date of the initial deposit of portfolio securities
into a UIT, that the portion of the illiquid investments that the UIT holds or will hold at the date
of deposit that are assets is consistent with the redeemable nature of the securities that it
issues. 1339 Rule 22e-4 also includes certain recordkeeping requirements. 1340 We estimate that 76
fund complexes are small fund groups that have funds that would be required to comply with the
proposed liquidity risk management program requirement. 1341 As discussed above, we estimate
that a fund complex would incur one-time costs ranging from $0.8 million to $10.2 million,
depending on the fund’s particular circumstances and current liquidity risk management
practices, to establish and implement a liquidity risk management program. 1342 We further
estimate that a fund complex would incur ongoing annual costs associated with proposed rule
22e-4 that would range from $40,000 to $3.3 million. 1343 Finally, we estimate that any UITs
launched after the rule’s compliance date will incur one-time costs associated with rule 22e-4 of
$8,000 to $52,000. 1344

N-CEN are intended to enhance fund disclosure and reporting regarding a fund’s redemption
practices, portfolio liquidity, and certain liquidity risk management practices. New Form NLIQUID will require a fund to confidentially notify the Commission if the fund’s illiquid
investment holdings exceed 15% of its net assets or if its highly liquid investments decline below
its minimum for more than a brief period of time. 1345 The amendments to Form N-1A require
funds to disclose additional information concerning the procedures for redeeming a fund’s
shares. 1346 The amendments to Forms N-PORT and N-CEN require reporting of certain
information regarding the liquidity of a fund’s holdings and the fund’s liquidity risk management
practices. We estimate that 78 funds are small entities that would be required to comply with the
proposed disclosure and reporting requirements. 1347
As discussed above, for each fund, including a fund that is a small entity, when filing a
report on Form N-LIQUID, staff estimates that a fund will spend on average approximately 4
hours 1348 of an in-house attorney’s time and one 1349 hour of an in-house accountant’s time to
prepare, review, and submit Form N-LIQUID, at a total time cost of $1,745. 1350 Staff estimates
that there will be no external costs associated with this collection of information.
As discussed above, we estimate that each fund, including funds that are small entities, would
incur a one-time burden of an additional 1 hour, 1351 at a time cost of an additional $324 (plus printing

costs), to comply with the amendments to Form N-1A. 1352 We also estimate that each fund, including
small entities, would incur an ongoing burden of an additional 0.25 hours, at a time cost of
approximately an additional $81 each year associated with compliance with the amendments to Form
N-1A. 1353 We do not estimate any change to the external costs associated with the proposed
amendments to Form N-1A.
We also estimate that each fund that files reports on Form N-PORT (35% of funds) in

house will require an average of approximately 6 burden hours to compile (including review of
the information), tag, and electronically file the additional liquidity information required on
Form N-PORT for the first time and an average of approximately 2 burden hours, rather than 1
burden hour, for subsequent filings. Therefore, we estimate the per fund average annual hour
burden associated with the incremental changes to Form N-PORT as a result of the added
liquidity information for these funds would be an additional 28 hours for the first year and an
additional 24 hours for each subsequent year. 1354 Amortized over three years, the average annual
hour burden would be an additional 25.33 hours per fund. 1355 We further estimate that 65% of
funds will retain the services of a third party to provide data aggregation, validation and/or filing
services as part of the preparation and filing of reports on Form N-PORT on the fund’s behalf.
For these funds, we estimate that each fund will require an average of approximately 8 hours to
compile and review the added liquidity-related information with the service provider prior to
electronically filing the report for the first time and an average of 1 burden hour for subsequent
filings. Therefore, we estimate the per fund average annual hour burden associated with the

434

liquidity-related changes to Form N-PORT for these funds would be an additional 19 hours for
the first year 1356 and an additional 12 hours for each subsequent year. 1357 Amortized over three
years, the average aggregate annual hour burden would be an additional 14.33 hours per fund. 1358
We further estimate that the total external annual cost burden of compliance with the information
collection requirements of Form N-PORT will be $9,118 per fund. 1359
As discussed above, we also estimate that the average annual hour burden per additional
response to Form N-CEN as a result of the adopted additions to Form N-CEN will be one hour
per fund per year. 1360 We do not estimate any change to the external costs associated with
proposed Form N-CEN. 1361
E.

Agency Action to Minimize Effect on Small Entities
The Regulatory Flexibility Act directs the Commission to consider significant

alternatives that would accomplish the stated objective, while minimizing any significant impact
on small entities. Alternatives in this category would include: (i) establishing different
compliance or reporting standards that take into account the resources available to small entities;
(ii) clarifying, consolidating, or simplifying the compliance requirements under the rules and
amendments for small entities; (iii) using performance rather than design standards; and (iv)
exempting small entities from coverage of the rules and amendments, or any part of the rules and
amendments.
The Commission does not presently believe that these rules and amendments would

require the establishment of special compliance requirements or timetables for small entities.
These rules and amendments are specifically designed to reduce any unnecessary burdens on all
funds (including small funds). To establish special compliance requirements or timetables for
small entities may in fact disadvantage small entities by encouraging larger market participants
to focus primarily on the needs of larger entities when making the operational changes
envisioned by certain of the rules and amendments, and possibly ignoring the needs of smaller
funds.
With respect to further clarifying, consolidating, or simplifying the compliance
requirements of the rules and amendments, using performance rather than design standards, and
exempting small entities from coverage of these rules and amendments or any part of the rules
and amendments, we believe additional such changes would be impracticable. Small entities are
as vulnerable to the risks of being unable to meet redemption obligations and of dilution of the
interests of fund shareholders as larger funds. We believe that the rules and amendments are
necessary to help mitigate these risks. Exempting small funds from coverage under these rules
and amendments or any part of the rules and amendments could compromise the effectiveness of
the rules and amendments or any part of the rules and amendments.

Section 270.22e-4 is added to read as follows:

§270.22e-4 Liquidity risk management programs.
(a) Definitions. For purposes of this section:
(1) Acquisition (or acquire) means any purchase or subsequent rollover.
(2) Business day means any day, other than Saturday, Sunday, or any customary business
holiday.
(3) Convertible to cash means the ability to be sold, with the sale settled.
(4) Exchange-traded fund or ETF means an open-end management investment company
(or series or class thereof), the shares of which are listed and traded on a national securities
exchange, and that has formed and operates under an exemptive order under the Act granted by
the Commission or in reliance on an exemptive rule adopted by the Commission.
(5) Fund means an open-end management investment company that is registered or
required to register under section 8 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-8) and includes a separate series of
such an investment company, but does not include a registered open-end management
investment company that is regulated as a money market fund under § 270.2a-7 or an In-Kind
ETF.
(6) Highly liquid investment means any cash held by a fund and any investment that the
fund reasonably expects to be convertible into cash in current market conditions in three business
days or less without the conversion to cash significantly changing the market value of the
investment, as determined pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.

438

(7) Highly liquid investment minimum means the percentage of the fund’s net assets that
the fund invests in highly liquid investments that are assets pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of
this section.
(8) Illiquid investment means any investment that the fund reasonably expects cannot be
sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without the sale or
disposition significantly changing the market value of the investment, as determined pursuant to
the provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
(9) In-Kind Exchange Traded Fund or In-Kind ETF means an ETF that meets
redemptions through in-kind transfers of securities, positions, and assets other than a de minimis
amount of cash and that publishes its portfolio holdings daily.
(10) Less liquid investment means any investment that the fund reasonably expects to be
able to sell or dispose of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without the
sale or disposition significantly changing the market value of the investment, as determined
pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, but where the sale or disposition
is reasonably expected to settle in more than seven calendar days.
(11) Liquidity risk means the risk that the fund could not meet requests to redeem shares
issued by the fund without significant dilution of remaining investors’ interests in the fund.
(12) Moderately liquid investment means any investment that the fund reasonably expects
to be convertible into cash in current market conditions in more than three calendar days but in
seven calendar days or less, without the conversion to cash significantly changing the market
value of the investment, as determined pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this
section.

439

(13) Person(s) designated to administer the program means the fund or In-Kind ETF’s
investment adviser, officer, or officers (which may not be solely portfolio managers of the fund
or In-Kind ETF) responsible for administering the program and its policies and procedures
pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.
(14) Unit Investment Trust or UIT means a unit investment trust as defined in section 4(2)
of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-4).
(b) Liquidity Risk Management Program. Each fund and In-Kind ETF must adopt and
implement a written liquidity risk management program (“program”) that is reasonably designed
to assess and manage its liquidity risk.
(1) Required program elements. The program must include policies and procedures
reasonably designed to incorporate the following elements:
(i) Assessment, Management, and Periodic Review of Liquidity Risk. Each fund and InKind ETF must assess, manage, and periodically review (with such review occurring no less
frequently than annually) its liquidity risk, which must include consideration of the following
factors, as applicable:
(A) The fund or In-Kind ETF’s investment strategy and liquidity of portfolio investments
during both normal and reasonably foreseeable stressed conditions, including whether the
investment strategy is appropriate for an open-end fund, the extent to which the strategy involves
a relatively concentrated portfolio or large positions in particular issuers, and the use of
borrowings for investment purposes and derivatives;
(B) Short-term and long-term cash flow projections during both normal and reasonably
foreseeable stressed conditions;

440

(C) Holdings of cash and cash equivalents, as well as borrowing arrangements and other
funding sources; and
(D) For an ETF:
(i) The relationship between the ETF’s portfolio liquidity and the way in which,
and the prices and spreads at which, ETF shares trade, including, the efficiency of the
arbitrage function and the level of active participation by market participants (including
authorized participants); and
(ii) The effect of the composition of baskets on the overall liquidity of the ETF’s
portfolio.
(ii) Classification. Each fund must, using information obtained after reasonable inquiry
and taking into account relevant market, trading, and investment-specific considerations, classify
each of the fund’s portfolio investments (including each of the fund’s derivatives transactions) as
a highly liquid investment, moderately liquid investment, less liquid investment, or illiquid
investment. A fund must review its portfolio investments’ classifications, at least monthly in
connection with reporting the liquidity classification for each portfolio investment on Form NPORT in accordance with §270.30b1-9, and more frequently if changes in relevant market,
trading, and investment-specific considerations are reasonably expected to materially affect one
or more of its investments’ classifications.
Note to paragraph (b)(1)(ii): If an investment could be viewed as either a highly liquid
investment or a moderately liquid investment, because the period to convert the investment to
cash depends on the calendar or business day convention used, a fund should classify the
investment as a highly liquid investment. For a discussion of considerations that may be relevant

441

in classifying the liquidity of the fund’s portfolio investments, see Investment Company Act
Release No. IC-XXXXX (DATE).
(A) The fund may generally classify and review its portfolio investments (including the
fund’s derivatives transactions) according to their asset class, provided, however, that the fund
must separately classify and review any investment within an asset class if the fund or its adviser
has information about any market, trading, or investment-specific considerations that are
reasonably expected to significantly affect the liquidity characteristics of that investment as
compared to the fund’s other portfolio holdings within that asset class.
(B) In classifying and reviewing its portfolio investments or asset classes (as applicable),
the fund must determine whether trading varying portions of a position in a particular portfolio
investment or asset class, in sizes that the fund would reasonably anticipate trading, is reasonably
expected to significantly affect its liquidity, and if so, the fund must take this determination into
account when classifying the liquidity of that investment or asset class.
(C) For derivatives transactions that the fund has classified as moderately liquid
investments, less liquid investments, and illiquid investments, identify the percentage of the
fund’s highly liquid investments that it has segregated to cover, or pledged to satisfy margin
requirements in connection with, derivatives transactions in each of these classification
categories.
Note to paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C): For purposes of calculating these percentages, a fund
that has segregated or pledged highly liquid investments and non-highly liquid investments to
cover derivatives transactions classified as moderately liquid, less liquid, or illiquid investments
first should apply segregated or pledged assets that are highly liquid investments to cover these
transactions, unless it has specifically identified segregated non-highly liquid investments as
442

covering such derivatives transactions.
(iii) Highly Liquid Investment Minimum.
(A) Any fund that does not primarily hold assets that are highly liquid investments must:
(1) Determine a highly liquid investment minimum, considering the factors specified in
paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) through (E) of this section, as applicable (but considering those factors
specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) and (B) only as they apply during normal conditions, and
during stressed conditions only to the extent they are reasonably foreseeable during the period
until the next review of the highly liquid investment minimum). The highly liquid investment
minimum determined pursuant to this paragraph may not be changed during any period of time
that a fund’s assets that are highly liquid investments are below the determined minimum
without approval from the fund’s board of directors, including a majority of directors who are
not interested persons of the fund;
(2) Periodically review, no less frequently than annually, the highly liquid investment
minimum; and
(3) Adopt and implement policies and procedures for responding to a shortfall of the
fund’s highly liquid investments below its highly liquid investment minimum, which must
include requiring the person(s) designated to administer the program to report to the fund’s board
of directors no later than its next regularly scheduled meeting with a brief explanation of the
causes of the shortfall, the extent of the shortfall, and any actions taken in response, and if the
shortfall lasts more than 7 consecutive calendar days, must include requiring the person(s)
designated to administer the program to report to the board within one business day thereafter
with an explanation of how the fund plans to restore its minimum within a reasonable period of
time.
443

(B) For purposes of determining whether a fund primarily holds assets that are highly
liquid investments, a fund must exclude from its calculations the percentage of the fund’s assets
that are highly liquid investments that it has segregated to cover all derivatives transactions that
the fund has classified as moderately liquid investments, less liquid investments, and illiquid
investments, or pledged to satisfy margin requirements in connection with those derivatives
transactions, as determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C) of this section.
(iv) Illiquid Investments. No fund or In-Kind ETF may acquire any illiquid investment if,
immediately after the acquisition, the fund or In-Kind ETF would have invested more than 15%
of its net assets in illiquid investments that are assets. If a fund or In-Kind ETF holds more than
15% of its net assets in illiquid investments that are assets:
(A) It must cause the person(s) designated to administer the program to report such an
occurrence to the fund’s board of directors within one business day of the occurrence, with an
explanation of the extent and causes of the occurrence, and how the fund plans to bring its
illiquid investments that are assets to or below 15% of its net assets within a reasonable period of
time; and
(B) If the amount of the fund’s illiquid investments that are assets is still above 15% of its
net assets 30 days from the occurrence (and at each consecutive 30 day period thereafter), the
fund or In-Kind ETF’s board of directors, including a majority of directors who are not interested
persons of the fund or In-Kind ETF, must assess whether the plan presented to it pursuant to
paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(A) continues to be in the best interest of the fund or In-Kind ETF.
(v) Redemptions in Kind. A fund that engages in, or reserves the right to engage in,
redemptions in kind and any In-Kind ETF must establish policies and procedures regarding how
and when it will engage in such redemptions in kind.
444

(2) Board Oversight. A fund or In-Kind ETF’s board of directors, including a majority of
directors who are not interested persons of the fund or In-Kind ETF, must:
(i) Initially approve the liquidity risk management program;
(ii) Approve the designation of the person(s) designated to administer the program; and
(iii) Review, no less frequently than annually, a written report prepared by the person(s)
designated to administer the program that addresses the operation of the program and assesses its
adequacy and effectiveness of implementation, including, if applicable, the operation of the
highly liquid investment minimum, and any material changes to the program.
(3) Recordkeeping. The fund or In-Kind ETF must maintain:
(i) A written copy of the program and any associated policies and procedures adopted
pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(2) of this section that are in effect, or at any time
within the past five years were in effect, in an easily accessible place;
(ii) Copies of any materials provided to the board of directors in connection with its
approval under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, and materials provided to the board of
directors under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, for at least five years after the end of the
fiscal year in which the documents were provided, the first two years in an easily accessible
place; and
(iii) If applicable, a written record of the policies and procedures related to how the
highly liquid investment minimum, and any adjustments thereto, were determined, including
assessment of the factors incorporated in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii)(A) through (B) of this section and
any materials provided to the board pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A)(3) of this section, for a
period of not less than five years (the first two years in an easily accessible place) following the
determination of, and each change to, the highly liquid investment minimum.
445

(c) UIT Liquidity. On or before the date of initial deposit of portfolio securities into a
registered UIT, the UIT’s principal underwriter or depositor must determine that the portion of
the illiquid investments that the UIT holds or will hold at the date of deposit that are assets is
consistent with the redeemable nature of the securities it issues, and must maintain a record of
that determination for the life of the UIT and for five years thereafter.
