17 CFR Part 240
[Release No. 34-71699; File No. S7-03-14]
RIN 3235-AL48
Standards for Covered Clearing Agencies
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Proposed rule.
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or “Commission”) proposes to
amend Rule 17Ad-22 and add Rule 17Ab2-2 pursuant to Section 17A of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and the Payment, Clearing, and Settlement Supervision Act of
2010 (“Clearing Supervision Act”), adopted in Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”). Among other things, the proposed
rules would establish standards for the operation and governance of certain types of registered
clearing agencies that meet the definition of a “covered clearing agency.”

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission proposes to amend Rule 17Ad-22
to add new Rule 17Ad-22(e) to establish requirements for risk management, operations, and
governance of registered clearing agencies that meet the definition of a “covered clearing
agency.” Covered clearing agencies would include registered clearing agencies that (i) have
been designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council

2

(“FSOC”) and for which the Commission is the supervisory agency, pursuant to the Clearing
Supervision Act (“designated clearing agencies”), (ii) provide central counterparty (“CCP”)
services for security-based swaps or are involved in activities the Commission determines to
have a more complex risk profile, where in either case the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (“CFTC”) is not the supervisory agency for such clearing agency as defined in
Section 803(8) of the Clearing Supervision Act, or (iii) are otherwise determined to be covered
clearing agencies by the Commission. The Commission also proposes to add new Rule 17Ad22(f) to codify the Commission’s statutory authority and new Rule 17Ab2-2 to establish
procedures for making determinations regarding covered clearing agencies under proposed Rule
17Ad-22(e). The Commission also proposes to amend existing Rule 17Ad-22(d) to limit its
application to clearing agencies other than covered clearing agencies and to revise existing Rule
17Ad-22(a) to add 15 new definitions. The Commission has begun, and intends to continue,
consultation with the FSOC and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“the
Board”) and has considered the relevant international standards as required by Section
805(a)(2)(A) of the Clearing Supervision Act. 1

I. Current Regulatory Framework for Clearing Agencies
A. Section 17A of the Exchange Act
When Congress added Section 17A to the Exchange Act as part of the Securities Acts
Amendments of 1975, it directed the Commission to facilitate the establishment of a national
system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions. 2 In
Section 17A of the Exchange Act, Congress directed the Commission to have due regard for the
public interest, the protection of investors, the safeguarding of securities and funds, and
maintenance of fair competition among brokers and dealers, clearing agencies, and transfer
agents. 3 The Commission’s ability to achieve these goals and its supervision of securities
clearance and settlement systems is based upon the regulation of clearing agencies registered
2

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1; Report of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing & Urban
Affairs, S. Rep. No. 94-75, at 4 (1975) (urging that “[t]he Committee believes the banking and
security industries must move quickly toward the establishment of a fully integrated national
system for the prompt and accurate processing and settlement of securities transactions”).

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(a)(2)(A).

with the Commission (“registered clearing agencies”). Clearing agencies are broadly defined
under the Exchange Act and undertake a variety of functions. 4 One such function is to act as a
CCP, which is an entity that interposes itself between the counterparties to a trade. 5 Over the
years, registered clearing agencies have become an essential part of the infrastructure of the U.S.
securities markets. 6 Registered clearing agencies help reduce the costs and increase the safety
and efficiency of securities trading and are required to be structured to manage and reduce
counterparty risk. 7

4

Section 3(a)(23)(A) of the Exchange Act defines the term “clearing agency” to mean any
person who acts as an intermediary in making payments or deliveries or both in connection with
transactions in securities or who provides facilities for the comparison of data regarding the
terms of settlement of securities transactions, to reduce the number of settlements of securities
transactions, or for the allocation of securities settlement responsibilities. Such term also means
any person, such as a securities depository, who acts as a custodian of securities in connection
with a system for the central handling of securities whereby all securities of a particular class or
series of any issuer deposited within the system are treated as fungible and may be transferred,

Section 17A of the Exchange Act and Rule 17Ab2-1 require entities to register with the
Commission prior to performing the functions of a clearing agency. 8 Under the statute, the
Commission is not permitted to grant registration unless it determines that the rules and
operations of the clearing agency meet the standards set forth in Section 17A of the Exchange
Act. 9 If the Commission registers a clearing agency, the Commission oversees the clearing
agency to facilitate compliance with the Exchange Act using various tools that include, among
other things, the rule filing process for self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”) and on-site
examinations by Commission staff. 10 The Commission also oversees registered clearing
agencies through regular contact, including onsite visits, by Commission staff with clearing
agency senior management and other personnel and ongoing interactions of Commission staff
with the registered clearing agencies regarding current and expected proposed rule changes under
Section 19(b) of the Exchange Act.

(j) to Section 17A of the Exchange Act to establish requirements for any entity that performs the
functions of a clearing agency for security-based swaps).

A clearing agency can be registered with the Commission only if the Commission makes
a determination that the clearing agency satisfies the requirements set forth in Section
17A(b)(3)(A) through (I) of the Exchange Act. See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)(A) through (I). In
1980, the Commission published a statement of the views and positions of the Commission staff
regarding the requirements of Section 17A in its Announcement of Standards for the Registration
of Clearing Agencies. See Exchange Act Release No. 34-16900 (June 17, 1980), 45 FR 41920
(June 23, 1980).

Under the Clearing Supervision Act, the supervisory agency must consult annually with
the Board regarding the scope and methodology of on-site examinations of designated FMUs,
and those examinations may include participation by the Board, if requested. See infra note 32
and accompanying text; see also 15 U.S.C. 78u(a) (providing the Commission with authority to
initiate and conduct investigations to identify potential violations of the federal securities laws);

B. OTC Swaps Clearing and the Dodd-Frank Act
The Commission drew on its experience regulating clearing agencies to address recent
developments in the over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives markets. In December 2008, the
Commission acted to facilitate the central clearing of credit default swaps (“CDS”) by permitting
certain entities that performed CCP services to clear and settle CDS on a temporary, conditional
basis. 11 Consequently, some CDS transactions were centrally cleared prior to the enactment of
the Dodd-Frank Act.
On July 21, 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act into law. 12 The
Dodd-Frank Act was enacted, among other reasons, to promote the financial stability of the
United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system. 13 It is
intended, among other things, to bolster the existing regulatory structure and provide regulatory

11

The Commission authorized five entities to clear CDS. See Exchange Act Release Nos.

tools to address risks in the OTC derivatives markets, which have experienced dramatic growth
in recent years and are capable of affecting significant sectors of the U.S. economy. 14
1. Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act
Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title VII”) provides the Commission and the CFTC
with enhanced authority to regulate certain OTC derivatives in response to the 2008 financial
crisis. 15 Title VII provides that the CFTC will regulate “swaps,” the Commission will regulate
“security-based swaps,” and both the CFTC and the Commission will regulate “mixed swaps.” 16
Title VII provides the Commission with new regulatory authority over security-based swaps by
requiring, among other things, that security-based swaps generally be cleared and that clearing
agencies for security-based swaps register with the Commission.
The swap and security-based swap markets traditionally have been characterized by
privately negotiated transactions entered into by two counterparties, in which each assumes the

From their beginnings in the early 1980s, the notional value of these markets grew to
approximately $693 trillion globally by June 2013. See Bank for International Settlements
(“BIS”), Statistical Release: OTC Derivatives Statistics at End-June 2013, at 2 (Nov. 2013),
available at http://www.bis.org/publ/otc_hy1311.pdf.
15

See Dodd-Frank Act, 124 Stat. at 1641–1802.

16

Section 712(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act provides that the Commission and the CFTC, in
consultation with the Board, shall further define the terms “swap,” “security-based swap,” “swap
dealer,” “security-based swap dealer,” “major swap participant,” “major security-based swap
participant,” “eligible contract participant,” and “security-based swap agreement.” 124 Stat. at
1644. The Commission and the CFTC jointly adopted rules to further define the terms “swap
dealer,” “security-based swap dealer,” “major swap participant,” “major security-based swap
participant,” and “eligible contract participant,” as well as rules to further define the terms
“swap,” “security-based swap,” and “security-based swap agreement” and to govern the
regulation of mixed swaps. See Exchange Act Release Nos. 34-67453 (July 18, 2012), 77 FR
48208 (Aug. 13, 2012); 34-66868 (Apr. 27, 2012), 77 FR 30596 (May 23, 2012).

credit risk of the other counterparty. 17 Title VII amended the Exchange Act to require that
transactions in security-based swaps be cleared through a clearing agency if they are of a type
that the Commission determines must be cleared, unless an exemption from mandatory clearing
applies. 18 When structured and operated appropriately, clearing agencies may improve the
management of counterparty risk in security-based swap markets and may provide additional
benefits, such as the multilateral netting of trades. 19
Title VII also added new provisions to the Exchange Act that require entities performing
the functions of a clearing agency with respect to security-based swaps (“security-based swap
clearing agencies”) to register with the Commission and require the Commission to adopt rules
with respect to security-based swap clearing agencies. 20 Specifically, new Section 17A(j)

1376, 1768 (2010) (adding paragraph (g) to Section 17A of the Exchange Act). Pursuant to
Section 774 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the requirement in Section 17A(g) of the Exchange Act for
security-based swap clearing agencies to be registered with the Commission took effect on July
16, 2011. See 124 Stat. at 1802.
16

requires the Commission to adopt rules governing security-based swap clearing agencies, and
new Section 17A(i) gives the Commission authority to promulgate rules that establish standards
for security-based swap clearing agencies. 21 Compliance with any such rules is a prerequisite to
the registration of a clearing agency that clears security-based swaps with the Commission and is
also a condition to maintain its continued registration. 22 Section 17A(i) also provides that the
Commission, in establishing clearing agency standards and in its oversight of clearing agencies,
may conform such standards and such oversight to reflect evolving international standards. 23
Before commencing any rulemaking regarding, among other things, security-based swap clearing
agencies, Title VII provides that the Commission shall consult and coordinate, to the extent
possible, with the CFTC and the prudential regulators for the purpose of assuring regulatory
consistency and comparability, to the extent possible. 24
Title VII further provides that some of the entities that the Commission permitted to clear
and settle CDS on a temporary, conditional basis prior to the July 21, 2010 enactment of the
Dodd-Frank Act are deemed under the Dodd-Frank Act to be registered clearing agencies (the
“deemed registered provision”). 25 As a result, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (“CME”),

21

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(i), (j); Dodd-Frank Act, Sec. 763(b), 124 Stat. at 1768–69 (adding
paragraphs (i) and (j) to Section 17A of the Exchange Act).

See supra note 9 (describing the requirements under Section 17A(b)(3) of the Exchange
Act, 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)).

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(i) (stating that, in establishing standards for security-based swap
clearing agencies, and in the exercise of its oversight of such a clearing agency pursuant to this
title, the Commission may conform such standards or oversight to reflect evolving United States
and international standards).
24

See Dodd-Frank Act, Sec. 712(a)(2), 124 Stat. at 1641–42.

25

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(l). The deemed registered provision applies to certain depository
institutions that cleared swaps as multilateral clearing organizations and certain derivatives
17

ICE Clear Credit LLC (“ICE”), and ICE Clear Europe LLC (“ICEEU”) became clearing
agencies deemed registered with the Commission on July 16, 2011, solely for the purpose of
clearing security-based swaps.
2. Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act
The Clearing Supervision Act, adopted in Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title
VIII”), provides for enhanced regulation of financial market utilities (“FMUs”), such as clearing
agencies that manage or operate a multilateral system for the purpose of transferring, clearing, or
settling payments, securities, or other financial transactions among financial institutions or
between financial institutions and the FMU. 26 The enhanced regulatory regime in Title VIII
applies only to FMUs that the FSOC designates as systemically important (or likely to become
systemically important) in accordance with Section 804 of the Clearing Supervision Act. 27 On

clearing organizations (“DCOs”) that cleared swaps pursuant to an exemption from registration
as a clearing agency before the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the deemed
registered provision, such a clearing agency is deemed registered for the purpose of clearing
security-based swaps and is therefore required to comply with all requirements of the Exchange
Act, and the rules thereunder, applicable to registered clearing agencies, including, for example,
the obligation to file proposed rule changes under Section 19(b) of the Exchange Act. See infra
note 96 (describing the requirements in Section 19(b) of the Exchange Act).
26

The definition of “financial market utility” in Section 803(6) of the Clearing Supervision
Act contains a number of exclusions that include, but are not limited to, certain designated
contract markets, registered futures associations, swap data repositories, swap execution
facilities, national securities exchanges, national securities associations, alternative trading
systems, security-based swap data repositories, security-based swap execution facilities, brokers,
dealers, transfer agents, investment companies and futures commission merchants. See 12
U.S.C. 5462(6)(B).
27

Pursuant to Section 803(9) of the Clearing Supervision Act, an FMU is systemically
important if the failure of or a disruption to the functioning of such FMU could create or increase
the risk of significant liquidity or credit problems spreading among financial institutions or
markets and thereby threaten the stability of the U.S. financial system. See 12 U.S.C. 5462(9).

18

July 11, 2011, the FSOC published a final rule concerning its authority to designate FMUs as
systemically important. 28
Section 806(e) of the Clearing Supervision Act requires FMUs designated as systemically
important to file 60 days advance notice of changes to its rules, procedures, or operations that
could materially affect the nature or level of risk presented by the FMU (“Advance Notice”). 29
In addition, Section 806(e) requires each supervisory agency to adopt rules, in consultation with
the Board, that define and describe when a designated FMU is required to file an Advance
Notice with its supervisory agency. 30 The Commission published a final rule concerning the
Advance Notice process for designated clearing agencies on June 28, 2012. 31 In evaluating an

28

See 76 FR 44763 (July 27, 2011). Under Section 804 of the Clearing Supervision Act,
the FSOC has the authority, on a non-delegable basis and by a vote of no fewer than two-thirds
of the members then serving, including the affirmative vote of its chairperson, to designate those
FMUs that the FSOC determines are, or are likely to become, systemically important. See 12
U.S.C. 5463. The FSOC may, using the same procedures as discussed above, rescind such
designation if it determines that the FMU no longer meets the standards for systemic importance.
Before making either determination, the FSOC is required to consult with the Board and the
relevant supervisory agency (as determined in accordance with Section 803(8) of the Clearing
Supervision Act). See id. Finally, Section 804 of the Clearing Supervision Act sets forth the
procedures for giving entities a 30-day notice and the opportunity for a hearing prior to a
designation or rescission of the designation of systemic importance. See id.
29

See 12 U.S.C. 5465(e)(1)(A).

30

Section 803(8) of the Clearing Supervision Act defines the term “supervisory agency” in
reference to the primary regulatory authority for the FMU. For example, it provides that the
Commission is the supervisory agency for any FMU that is a registered clearing agency. See 12
U.S.C. 5462(8). To the extent that an entity is both a clearing agency registered with the
Commission and registered with another agency, such as a DCO registered with the CFTC, the
statute requires the two agencies to agree on one agency to act as the supervisory agency, and if
the agencies cannot agree on which agency has primary jurisdiction, the FSOC shall decide
which agency is the supervisory agency for purposes of the Clearing Supervision Act. See 12
U.S.C. 5462(8).
31

See Exchange Act Release No. 34-67286 (June 28, 2012), 77 FR 41602 (July 13, 2012).

Advance Notice filed with the Commission, the Commission would assess, among other things,
the consistency of the Advance Notice with the rules proposed herein, if adopted.
The Clearing Supervision Act also provides for enhanced coordination between the
Commission, the Board, and the CFTC by facilitating examinations and information sharing.
Under Section 807 of the Clearing Supervision Act, the Commission and the CFTC must consult
annually with the Board regarding the scope and methodology of any examination of a
designated FMU, and the Board is authorized to participate in any such examination. 32 Section
809 of the Clearing Supervision Act authorizes the Commission, the Board, and the CFTC to
disclose to each other copies of examination reports or similar reports regarding any designated
FMU. 33 It further authorizes the Commission, the Board, and the CFTC to promptly notify each
other of material concerns about a designated FMU and share appropriate reports, information,
or data relating to such concerns. 34 Section 813 of the Clearing Supervision Act requires the
Commission and the CFTC to coordinate with the Board to develop risk management
supervision programs for designated clearing agencies. 35
Section 805(a) of the Clearing Supervision Act 36 also provides that the Commission may
prescribe risk management standards governing the operations related to payment, clearing, and
settlement activities (“PCS activities”) of designated FMUs for which it acts as the supervisory

agency, in consultation with the FSOC and the Board and taking into consideration relevant
international standards and existing prudential requirements. 37
On July 18, 2012, the FSOC designated as systemically important the following
registered clearing agencies: CME, The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), Fixed Income
Clearing Corporation (“FICC”), ICE, National Securities Clearing Corporation (“NSCC”), and
The Options Clearing Corporation (“OCC”). 38 Under the Clearing Supervision Act, the
Commission is the supervisory agency for DTC, FICC, NSCC, and OCC. 39 The Commission
jointly regulates DTC with the Board and OCC with the CFTC. 40 The Commission also jointly
regulates CME and ICE with the CFTC, which serves as their supervisory agency. 41

37

See 12 U.S.C. 5464(a)(2) (stating that these regulations may govern the operations
related to payment, clearing, and settlement activities of such designated clearing entities, and
the conduct of designated activities by such financial institutions). PCS activities are defined in
Section 803(7) of the Clearing Supervision Act. See 12 U.S.C 5462(7).

As a member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System and a limited purpose trust company
under New York State banking law, DTC is subject to regulation by the Board.

In addition, the Commission jointly regulates ICEEU, which is not currently designated
as systemically important by the FSOC, with the CFTC and the Bank of England.

C. Rule 17Ad-22 Under the Exchange Act
On October 22, 2012, the Commission adopted Rule 17Ad-22 under the Exchange Act. 42
Through Rule 17Ad-22, the Commission sought to strengthen the substantive regulation of
registered clearing agencies, promote the safe and reliable operation of registered clearing
agencies, and improve efficiency, transparency, and access to registered clearing agencies by
establishing minimum requirements with due consideration given to observed practices and
international standards. 43 At that time, the Commission noted that the implementation of Rule
17Ad-22 would be an important first step in developing the regulatory changes contemplated by
Titles VII and VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act. 44 Rule 17Ad-22 requires all registered clearing
agencies to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures that are
reasonably designed to meet certain minimum requirements for their operations and risk
management practices on an ongoing basis. 45 These requirements are designed to work in
tandem with the SRO rule filing process and the requirement in Section 17A of the Exchange
Act that the Commission must make certain determinations regarding a clearing agency’s rules

43

See id. at 66225, 66263–64.

44

See Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra note 5, at 66225.

45

Rules 17Ad-22(b)(1) through (4) contain several requirements that address risk
management practices by registered clearing agencies that provide CCP services. Rules 17Ad22(b)(5) through (7) establish certain requirements regarding access to registered clearing
agencies that provide CCP services. Rule 17Ad-22(c) requires that a registered clearing agency
providing CCP services calculate and maintain a record of its financial resources and requires
each registered clearing agency to publish annual audited financial statements. Rule 17Ad-22(d)
sets forth certain minimum standards for the operations of registered clearing agencies providing
CCP or central securities depository (“CSD”) services. See infra Part II.B.4.b (discussing the
current requirements for CCPs under Rule 17Ad-22); see also Clearing Agency Standards
Release, supra note 5 (adopting the existing standards under Rule 17Ad-22).

22

and operations for purposes of initial and ongoing registration. 46 Rule 17Ad-22 does not apply
to entities that are operating pursuant to an exemption from registration as a clearing agency
granted by the Commission, 47 and it does not give particular consideration to issues relevant to
clearing agencies designated as systemically important FMUs.
D. Relevant International Standards
In proposing amendments to Rule 17Ad-22, the Commission considered international
standards, as required by Section 805(a) of the Clearing Supervision Act, that are relevant to its
supervision of covered clearing agencies. 48 CPSS-IOSCO published in April 2012 the PFMI

46

See supra note 9 (describing the requirements under Section 17A(b)(3) of the Exchange
Act, 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)) and infra note 96 (further describing the Commission’s framework
for regulation of SROs and the SRO rule filing process).
47

See, e.g., Exchange Act Release No. 34-44188 (Apr. 17, 2001), 66 FR 20494 (Apr. 23,
2011) (the Omgeo exemption); Exchange Act Release No. 34-39643 (Feb. 11, 1998), 63 FR
8232 (Feb. 18, 1998) (the Euroclear exemption); Exchange Act Release No 34-38328 (Feb. 24,
1997), 62 FR 9225 (Feb. 28, 1997) (the Clearstream exemption).
48

See supra note 36. In addition, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”),
the international body that sets standards for the regulation of banks, published in July 2012 the
Capital Requirements for Bank Exposures to Central Counterparties (“Basel III capital
requirements”). The Basel III capital requirements set forth interim rules governing the capital
charges arising from bank exposures to CCPs related to OTC derivatives, exchange-traded
derivatives, and securities financing transactions (which term, as used throughout this release,
refers generally to repurchase agreements and securities lending). Among other things, the Basel
III framework imposes lower capital requirements on CCPs that obtain “qualifying CCP”
(“QCCP”) status and would apply QCCP status only to CCPs that are subject to a regulatory
framework consistent with the standards set forth in the PFMI Report. See BCBS, Capital
Requirements for Bank Exposures to Central Counterparties (July 2012), available at
http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs227.pdf (setting forth he interim requirements set forth in this
report, currently under revision by the BCBS, in consultation with CPSS and IOSCO). See also

Recommendations”). 50 Commission staff participated in the development and drafting of the

See supra note 1.

The PFMI Report defines a “financial market infrastructure” (“FMI”) as a multilateral
system among participating institutions, including the operator of the system, used for the
purposes of clearing, settling, or recording payments, securities, derivatives, or other financial
transactions. See id. at 7; FMIs include CCPs, CSDs, securities settlement systems (“SSSs”), and
trade repositories (“TRs”). Cf. 12 U.S.C. 5462(6)(B), supra note 30 (defining “financial market
utility” under the Clearing Supervision Act).
The PFMI Report presumes that all CSDs, SSSs, CCPs, and TRs are systemically
important in their home jurisdiction. See PFMI Report, supra note 1, at 131 & n.177 (noting the
“presumption . . . that all CSDs, SSSs, CCPs, and TRs are systemically important because of
their critical roles in the markets they serve,” but also noting that ultimately “national law will
dictate the criteria to determine whether an FMI is systemically important”).
The Commission notes that the PFMI Report’s definition of “financial market
infrastructure” is consistent with the Commission’s prior use of the term. See Study of Unsafe
and Unsound Practices of Brokers and Dealers, H.R. Doc. No. 231, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. 13
(1971) (defining “financial market infrastructure” as a multilateral system among participating
institutions, including the operator of the system, used for the purposes of clearing, settling, or
recording payments, securities, derivatives, or other financial transactions).

http://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCPD176.pdf.
The Board applies these standards in its supervisory process and expects systemically
important FMUs, as determined by the Board and subject to its authority, to complete a selfassessment against the standards set forth in the policy. See Financial Market Utilities, 77 FR
45907 (Aug. 2, 2012) (the Board adopting Regulation HH for FMUs) (“Reg. HH”); Policy on
Payments System Risk, 72 FR 2518 (Jan. 12, 2007).
The Board has proposed to amend the standards in Regulation HH to replace the current
standards for payment systems with standards based those set forth in the PFMI Report. It has
also proposed to amend its Policy on Payments System Risk. See infra note 53.

PFMI Report, 51 and the Commission believes that the standards set forth in the PFMI Report are
generally consistent with the requirements applicable to clearing agencies set forth in the
Exchange Act. 52 Regulatory authorities around the world are in various stages of updating their
regulatory regimes to adopt measures that are in line with the standards set forth in the PFMI
Report. 53 The rule proposals set forth below are a continuation of the Commission’s active
efforts to foster the development of the national clearance and settlement system.

discussions on this topic and stated that it intends to revisit its rules once the Basel III capital
framework is revised. See id. The Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s
final rules define “QCCP” to mean, among other things, a designated FMU under the Clearing
Supervision Act. See 12 CFR 217.2; see also Regulatory Capital Rules, supra, at 62100.

II. Discussion of the Proposed Amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and Proposed Rule 17Ab2-2
The Commission is proposing to amend Rule 17Ad-22 and add Rule 17Ab2-2 pursuant to
Section 17A of the Exchange Act and the Clearing Supervision Act to provide a new regulatory
framework for “covered clearing agencies,” as defined below.
Generally, Section 17A directs the Commission to facilitate the establishment of a
national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions,
having due regard for the public interest, the protection of investors, the safeguarding of
securities and funds, and the maintenance of fair competition among brokers and dealers. 54 It
further requires that a clearing agency be so organized and have the capacity and rules designed
to, among other things, facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities
transactions, and to comply with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. 55 In establishing a regulatory framework for clearance and settlement,
the Exchange Act requires that a registered clearing agency’s rules not impose any burden on
competition not necessary or appropriate in the furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange
Act. 56
Consistent with these statutory objectives, the Commission previously adopted Rule
17Ad-22(d) to establish minimum requirements for registered clearing agencies and indicated
that it might consider further rulemaking at a later date. 57 In furtherance of the provisions of
Section 17A of the Exchange Act and the Clearing Supervision Act described above and as
54

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(a)(2)(A).

26

previously considered by the Commission, the Commission is proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e) to
establish new requirements for covered clearing agencies, which the Commission preliminarily
believes are appropriate given the risks that their size, operation, and importance pose to the U.S.
securities markets, the risks inherent in the products they clear, and the goals of Title VII and the
Exchange Act. 58 In connection with its supervision of registered clearing agencies under Section
17A of the Exchange Act, including after the adoption of Rule 17Ad-22, 59 the Commission has
considered whether enhanced requirements for covered clearing agencies could contribute to the
stability of U.S. securities markets, as described further in Part IV, and has determined to issue
this proposal for comment.
The Commission has preliminarily chosen to retain Rule 17Ad-22(d) and to continue to
apply it to registered clearing agencies that are not covered clearing agencies. 60 The
Commission preliminarily believes that retaining Rule 17Ad-22(d) ensures that clear,
comprehensive, and transparent standards for registered clearing agencies that are not covered
clearing agencies will continue to exist and, because they are narrower in scope, would thereby
provide a more flexible regime for new entrants seeking to establish and operate registered
clearing agencies, consistent with the continuing development of the national system for
clearance and settlement, than would otherwise be the case with a single regime under proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e).
58

See id. (contemplating future Commission action on clearing agency standards).

59

See Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra note 5, at 66227 (stating that Rule 17Ad22 generally codifies existing practices that reflect the CPSS-IOSCO Recommendations
published in 2001 and 2004).
60

See infra Part II.E (discussing the proposed language amending Rule 17Ad-22(d) to
apply to registered clearing agencies that are not covered clearing agencies).

27

The Commission notes that it is not proposing to alter the existing requirements under
Rule 17Ad-22(b), which establishes risk-management and participant access requirements for
registered clearing agencies that perform CCP services for security-based swaps, or Rule 17Ad22(c), which requires registered clearing agencies that provide CCP services to maintain a record
of financial resources and all registered clearing agencies to post on their websites annual audited
financial statements. 61 These requirements continue to be appropriate for all registered clearing
agencies because they promote prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities and
security-based swap transactions. Notably, Rule 17Ad-22(b) reduces the likelihood, in a
participant default scenario, that losses from default would disrupt the operations of the clearing
agency, and Rule 17Ad-22(c) provides an additional layer of information about the activities and
financial strength of a registered clearing agency that market participants may find useful in
assessing their use of the registered clearing agency’s services while also assisting the
Commission in its oversight of registered clearing agencies’ compliance with Rule 17Ad-22 by
providing a clear record of the method used by the clearing agency to, among other things,
maintain sufficient financial resources. 62

61

The standards in Rules 17Ad-22(b) and (c) were also adopted by the Commission in
2012. See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(b), (c); see also Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra note
5.
The Commission is proposing to revise Rule 17Ad-22(a) to account for new proposed
definitions. See proposed revision of Rule 17Ad-22(a), infra Part VII. The existing definitions
in 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(a) would be renumbered to account for new terms. In addition, the
definition of “participant family” would be amended to include references to its use in proposed
paragraphs (e)(4) and (e)(7). See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(13), infra Part VII.
62

See Exchange Act Release No. 34-64017 (Mar. 3, 2011), 76 FR 14474, 14477-83 (Mar.
16, 2011); see also Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra note 5, at 66244.

28

A. Overview
The Commission is proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e) to establish requirements for covered
clearing agencies with respect to general organization, 63 financial risk management, 64
settlement, 65 CSDs and exchange-of-value settlement systems, 66 default management, 67 general
business risk and operational risk management, 68 access, 69 efficiency, 70 and transparency. 71 The
discussion below provides greater detail regarding each respective requirement in proposed Rule
17Ad-22(e). Several aspects of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) are similar to existing Rule 17Ad-

63

See infra Parts II.B.1–3 (discussing proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(1) (legal risk), 17Ad22(e)(2) (governance), and 17Ad-22(e)(3) (framework for the comprehensive management of
risk)).

See infra Part II.B.4 (discussing proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4) (credit risk), 17Ad22(e)(5) (collateral), 17Ad-22(e)(6) (margin), and 17Ad-22(e)(7) (liquidity risk)).

See infra Parts II.B.5–7 (discussing proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(8) (settlement finality),

22(d), 72 but in general the Commission preliminarily notes that certain requirements under
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) would require covered clearing agencies to consider and adopt
policies and procedures more closely tailored to the risks that are posed by covered clearing
agencies, which the Commission preliminarily identified as appropriate in connection with its
experience in supervising registered clearing agencies under Section 17A of the Exchange Act,
including since the adoption of Rule 17Ad-22.
The Commission preliminarily believes that the requirements of proposed Rule 17Ad22(e) would help promote governance, operations, and risk management practices more closely
tailored to the risks raised by registered clearing agencies that have been designated systemically
important, are engaged in activities with a more complex risk profile, or are determined to be
covered clearing agencies by the Commission, consistent with Section 17A of the Exchange Act.
The Commission preliminarily believes these requirements would also enable consistent
supervision of designated FMUs and would reflect the Commission’s consideration of
international standards, as contemplated by Section 17A(i) and the Clearing Supervision Act. 73
While the Commission has made its own determination to issue the proposed rules for comment,
the Commission preliminarily believes that generally updating its rules, where appropriate, to
take into account the standards set forth in the PFMI Report would contribute to the efforts of
regulators around the world, described above, 74 to implement consistent standards for FMIs. 75
72

See infra Part II.A.4 (discussing the anticipated impact of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)
given the existing requirements for registered clearing agencies under Rule 17Ad-22).
73

See supra Part I.B.2, in particular notes 36–37 and accompanying text (discussing the
requirements under Section 17A(i) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(i), and Section 805(a)
of the Clearing Supervision Act, 12 U.S.C. 5464(a)).
74

See supra note 53 and accompanying text.

30

The Commission also preliminarily believes that Rule 17Ad-22(e) would provide an additional
benefit of providing support for a determination by foreign bank regulators that covered clearing
agencies providing CCP services for derivatives and securities financing transactions meet the
requirements for QCCP status under the Basel III framework and could therefore help reduce
competitive frictions among CCPs in different jurisdictions.
Part II.A first discusses the scope of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e), the role that written
policies and procedures play in framing the proposed rule, and the reasons for imposing certain
frequency of review requirements throughout the proposed rules. It then discusses the
anticipated impact of the proposed rules given the existing requirements applicable to registered
clearing agencies under Rules 17Ad-22(b) through (d), with which a covered clearing agency
must already be in compliance.
Part II.B next discusses the proposed rules under Rule 17Ad-22(e). Finally, Parts II.C, D,
and E discuss, in turn, proposed Rule 17Ab2-2, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(f), and the proposed
amendment to Rule 17Ad-22(d).
1. Scope of Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)
The Commission is proposing to add four terms to Rule 17Ad-22(a) to identify the
registered clearing agencies that would be subject to proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e). First, the
Commission is proposing to add Rule 17Ad-22(a)(9) to define “financial market utility”
(“FMU”) as defined in Section 803(6) of the Clearing Supervision Act. 76 Second, the
75

See infra Part IV.C.1.e (further discussing the economic effects of obtaining QCCP status
under the Basel III capital requirements); see also supra note 48.
76

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(9), infra Part VII; see also 12 U.S.C. 5462(6) (defining
“financial market utility” pursuant to the Clearing Supervision Act); supra note 26 (providing
further explanation of “financial market utility”).

31

Commission is proposing Rule 17Ad-22(a)(8) to define “designated clearing agency.” 77 A
designated clearing agency would mean a clearing agency registered with the Commission under
Section 17A of the Exchange Act that has been designated as a systemically important FMU by
the FSOC and for which the Commission is the supervisory agency as defined in Section 803(8)
of the Clearing Supervision Act. 78 Third, the Commission is proposing to add Rule 17Ad22(a)(4) to define “clearing agency involved in activities with a more complex risk profile” 79 to mean a clearing agency registered with the Commission under Section 17A of the Exchange Act
that either (i) provides central counterparty services for security-based swaps or (ii) has been
determined by the Commission to be involved in activities with a more complex risk profile
(“complex risk profile clearing agency”), either at the time of its initial registration or upon a
subsequent determination by the Commission pursuant to proposed Rule 17Ab2-2. 80 Fourth, the
Commission is proposing to add Rule 17Ad-22(a)(7) to define a “covered clearing agency” as a
designated clearing agency, a complex risk profile clearing agency, or any clearing agency

77

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(8), infra Part VII.

78

Rule 17Ad-22 does not currently apply to entities operating pursuant to an exemption
from clearing agency registration. The proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 would not
broaden the scope of Rule 17Ad-22 to an entity operating pursuant to an exemption from
registration as a clearing agency granted by the Commission.
79

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(4), infra Part VII.

80

The Commission is proposing Rule 17Ab2-2 to establish a process for making
determinations regarding clearing agencies involved in activities with a more complex risk
profile. See infra Part II.C (further discussing the purpose, scope, and application of proposed
Rule 17Ab2-2) and Part VII (proposed text of Rule 17Ab2-2).
The Commission is also proposing Rule 17Ad-22(a)(16) to define “security-based swap”
to mean security-based swap as defined in Section 3(a)(68) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.
78c(a)(68). See infra Part VII.

32

determined to be a covered clearing agency by the Commission pursuant to proposed Rule
17Ab2-2. 81
The Commission preliminarily believes there could be several different bases under
which registered clearing agencies would be required to comply with proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e).
For instance, because DTC, FICC, NSCC, and OCC are registered clearing agencies pursuant to
Section 17A of the Exchange Act and are designated clearing agencies for which the
Commission is the supervisory agency under the Clearing Supervision Act, 82 they would be
covered clearing agencies under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(7) and would be subject to the
requirements for covered clearing agencies in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e). In addition, because
ICEEU provides CCP services for security-based swaps and has been deemed registered with the
Commission as a security-based swap clearing agency, 83 it would be a complex risk profile
clearing agency under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(4) and also subject to the requirements for
covered clearing agencies proposed in Rule 17Ad-22(e).
By comparison, CME and ICE would not be subject to the proposed requirements for
covered clearing agencies in Rule 17Ad-22(e) because (i) they have been designated as
systemically important FMUs under Section 804 of the Clearing Supervision Act; 84 (ii) they are
each dually registered with the Commission and the CFTC as a clearing agency and DCO,
respectively; and (iii) the CFTC is their supervisory agency under the Clearing Supervision

81

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(7), infra Part VII.

82

See supra Part I.B.2.

83

See supra note 41 and accompanying text.

84

See 12 U.S.C. 5463.

33

Act. 85 The Commission preliminarily believes that, because CME and ICE would be subject to
the CFTC’s requirements for systemically important DCOs, 86 applying proposed Rule 17Ad22(e) to them could impose duplicative requirements. Given the Commission’s existing
regulatory authority under Section 17A(l) of the Exchange Act, 87 however, CME and ICE would
remain subject to the continuing requirements for registered clearing agencies in Rules 17Ad22(b) through (d).
Two dormant clearing agencies, the Stock Clearing Corporation of Philadelphia
(“SCCP”) and the Boston Stock Exchange Clearing Corporation (“BSECC”), have not been
designated systemically important by the FSOC and are not involved in activities with a more
complex risk profile. 88 Accordingly, each would also remain subject to the requirements in
Rules 17Ad-22(b) through (d).
Further, proposed Rule 17Ab2-2 would provide the Commission flexibility to determine
that the operations or circumstances of a registered clearing agency, including a registered
clearing agency that is exempt from certain requirements applicable to registered clearing

In 2008, NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. acquired SCCP and BSECC. See Exchange Act

acquisition of BSECC); Exchange Act Release No. 34-58180 (July 17, 2008), 73 FR 42890 (July
23, 2008) (order approving acquisition of SCCP).
Both SCCP and BSECC are currently registered with the Commission as clearing
agencies but conduct no clearing or settlement activities. See Exchange Act Release No. 3463629 (Jan. 3, 2011), 76 FR 1473 (Jan. 10, 2011); Exchange Act Release No. 34-63268 (Nov. 8,
2010), 75 FR 69730 (Nov. 15, 2010).

agencies generally, warrant designation as a covered clearing agency. 89 It would also provide
flexibility to make determinations regarding newly registered clearing agencies.
The Commission preliminarily believes the requirements proposed in Rule 17Ad-22(e)
aid the regulation of covered clearing agencies by, as noted above, establishing requirements
more closely tailored to the risks they pose to the U.S. securities markets. For example,
designated clearing agencies are systemically important because of their significance to the U.S.
financial system and the risk that the failure of, or a disruption to, their functioning would
increase the risk of significant liquidity or credit problems spreading among financial
institutions, thereby threatening the stability of the U.S. financial system. 90 Similarly, the
Commission preliminarily believes that complex risk profile clearing agencies, such as those
providing CCP services for security-based swaps, subject the U.S. securities markets to a
material level of systemic risk due to the nature of the products that they clear. 91 The
requirements proposed in Rule 17Ad-22(e) are intended to ensure that covered clearing agencies
have robust policies and procedures that help promote sound governance, operations, and risk
management.
As noted above, 92 the Commission preliminarily believes that establishing separate rules
for covered clearing agencies and registered clearing agencies that are not covered clearing

agencies is appropriate given the Commission’s goals to facilitate the development of a national
system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities consistent with Section
17A of the Exchange Act and to mitigate systemic risk consistent with Titles VII and VIII of the
Dodd-Frank Act. 93 In this regard, the Commission intends that Rule 17Ad-22(d) would continue
to provide minimum requirements for the operation and governance of registered clearing
agencies that also facilitate the entrance of new participants, as appropriate, into the market for
clearance and settlement services. 94 The Commission preliminarily believes that Rule 17Ad22(e) would establish new requirements for established participants in the market for clearance
and settlement services commensurate to the risks that their size, operation, and importance pose
to the U.S. securities markets. 95
Request for Comments. The Commission generally requests comments on all aspects of
the scope of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e), the relationship between proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) and
Rule 17Ad-22(d), and on proposed Rules 17Ad-22(a)(4), (7), (8), and (9). In addition, the
Commission requests comments on the following specific issues:
•

Is the scope of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) appropriate? Why or why not? Is the scope
sufficiently clear? Why or why not? Has the Commission provided sufficient guidance
regarding the scope of the proposed rule? Are there aspects of the scope of the proposed

See supra notes 2, 13–14, and accompanying text (noting the goals of, respectively,
Section 17A of the Exchange Act and the Dodd-Frank Act).
94

See supra note 43 and accompanying text (noting the Commission’s intent in adopting
Rule 17Ad-22 in the Clearing Agency Standards Release).
95

See supra note 44 and accompanying text (noting further that the requirements adopted
under Rule 17Ad-22 constituted an important first step to enhance the substantive regulation of
registered clearing agencies pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act); see also infra Part IV.C.1.a
(addressing systemic risk in the context of discussing the general economic considerations
undertaken by the Commission in proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e)).

36

rule for which the Commission should consider providing additional guidance? If so,
please explain.
•

Given that all non-dormant registered clearing agencies would either be covered clearing
agencies subject to Commission supervision or be subject to CFTC regulation as
designated clearing entities for which the CFTC is the supervisory agency, should the
Commission replace the existing requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(d) with the
requirements proposed under Rule 17Ad-22(e)? Why or why not?

•

Is the Commission’s proposed definition of “financial market utility” appropriate and
sufficiently clear given the proposed requirements? Why or why not? Should the
definition be modified? If so, how? Is there an alternative definition the Commission
should consider?

•

Is the Commission’s proposed definition of “designated clearing agency” appropriate and
sufficiently clear given the requirements proposed? Why or why not? Should the
definition be modified? If so, how? Is there an alternative definition the Commission
should consider?

•

Is the Commission’s proposed definition of “clearing agency involved in activities with a
more complex risk profile” appropriate and sufficiently clear given the requirements
proposed? Why or why not? Should the definition be modified? If so, how? Is there an
alternative definition the Commission should consider?

•

Is the Commission’s proposed definition of “covered clearing agency” appropriate and
sufficiently clear given the requirements proposed? Why or why not? Should the
definition be modified? If so, how? Is there an alternative definition the Commission
should consider?
37

•

Are the requirements in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) necessary, or do the existing
provisions in Rule 17Ad-22(d) already sufficiently address the issues identified in this
release as justification for increased regulation?
2. Role of Written Policies and Procedures
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) would require covered clearing agencies to establish,

implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to, as
applicable, fulfill the requirements set forth in paragraphs (e)(1) through (23) of the proposed
rule. The Commission preliminarily believes that this approach would facilitate the
Commission’s supervision of covered clearing agencies, is appropriate given their role as
SROs, 96 and is consistent with the approach taken by the Commission elsewhere in Rule 17Ad22. 97 The Commission preliminarily believes that, by requiring written policies and procedures
and, where appropriate, their disclosure, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) should help promote the
development of improved standards for clearing agencies by allowing market participants to
compare certain of the operations of covered clearing agencies with those of other clearing
entities, which choose to make their policies and procedures publicly available or are required to
do so by equivalent regulatory standards. 98
96

Registered clearing agencies are SROs as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange
Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26). After a clearing agency has been registered with the Commission, the
clearing agency, as an SRO, must submit most proposed rule changes to the Commission, for
approval pursuant to Rule 19b-4 under the Exchange Act. A stated policy, practice, or
interpretation of an SRO, such as a clearing agency’s written policies and procedures, would
generally be deemed to be a proposed rule change. See 17 CFR 240.19b-4.

See Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra note 5, at 66228–29 (describing the scope
of Rule 17Ad-22 at adoption).
98

Compare proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23), infra Part VII (requiring public disclosure of,
among other things, a covered clearing agency’s rules, policies, and procedures) with proposed
Reg. HH, supra note 53, at 3666–67, 3686–88, 3693 (the Board proposing disclosure
38

The Commission is proposing to require policies and procedures developed by each
covered clearing agency to fulfill the requirements of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) because the
Commission preliminarily believes that it is important to allow covered clearing agencies enough
flexibility to use their market experience and understanding of their institutions to shape the
rules, policies, and procedures implementing proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e). This proposed
approach is consistent with the Commission’s established approach for supervising SROs, and
the Commission preliminarily believes continuing this practice under Rule 17Ad-22(e) will
allow the Commission to continue to perform its supervisory function through the SRO rule
filing process under Section 19(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 19b-4, 99 periodic inspections
and examinations, other monitoring of the activities of registered clearing agencies, and other
established supervisory processes. Because of the importance the Commission gives to both
maintaining clearing agency flexibility and to existing oversight mechanisms, the Commission
preliminarily believes that the proposed approach is appropriate.
The Commission anticipates that a covered clearing agency’s rules, policies, and
procedures will need to evolve over time so that it can adequately respond to changes in
technology, legal requirements, the needs of its members and their customers, trading volumes,
trading practices, linkages between financial markets, and the financial instruments traded in the
markets that a covered clearing agency serves. Accordingly, the Commission preliminarily
believes that covered clearing agencies should continually evaluate and make appropriate
requirements intended to be in line with the PFMI Report in Sec. 234.3(a)(23)); DCO Int’l
Standards Release, supra note 53, at 72493–94, 72521 (CFTC adopting disclosure requirements
intended to be in line with the PFMI Report in Sec. 39.37).

updates and improvements to their operations and risk management practices to facilitate prompt
and accurate clearance and settlement.
3. Frequency of Review Required Under Certain Policies and Procedures
Many of the policies and procedures requirements proposed in Rule 17Ad-22(e) specify a
frequency of review. Generally, the proposed regularity of review falls into three categories—
daily, monthly, or annually—and is based on the Commission’s understanding of the current
review practices generally at covered clearing agencies. The Commission’s rationale for these
differences is as follows:
•

Daily: For those activities that the Commission understands to be directly related to the
day-to-day operations of a covered clearing agency, 100 such as activities related to the
calculation and collection of margin, the Commission preliminarily believes that a
covered clearing agency should undertake a daily review and make decisions on a daily
basis;

•

Monthly: For those activities that the Commission understands to coincide with and
complement the review and reporting cycles of the governance structures related to the
risk management function of the covered clearing agency, 101 the Commission
preliminarily believes that a covered clearing agency should undertake a monthly review;
based on its supervisory experience, the Commission notes that well-functioning risk
management committees of the board and similar management committees or other board
or management committees commonly meet or receive reports and other risk

100

See proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi)(A); 17Ad-22(e)(6)(ii); 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi)(A);
17Ad-22(e)(7); 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi)(A); and 17Ad-22(e)(11)(ii), infra Part VII.
101

See proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi)(B); 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi)(C); 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi)(B);
17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi)(C); 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi)(B); and 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi)(C), infra Part VII.

40

management information from management on a monthly basis and the monthly
requirement would be consistent with such meeting and reporting frequency;
•

Annually: For those activities that are less integral to day-to-day operations, involve
issues that merit review of information collected over longer time periods, or require
more high-level review and consideration by, for example, the full board of directors of a
clearing agency, 102 the Commission preliminarily believes that a covered clearing agency
should undertake an annual review; additionally, the Commission preliminary believes
that an annual cycle is appropriate in certain instances because other major reviews such
as auditing of the financial statements of registered clearing agencies and their disclosure
are required to occur on an annual basis.
Request for Comments. The Commission generally requests comments on all aspects of

the frequency of review that would be required to be included in a covered clearing agency’s
policies and procedures under each of the requirements in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e). In
addition, the Commission requests comments on whether its assessment of daily, monthly, and
annual activities at covered clearing agencies is accurate and appropriate given the proposed
rules. The Commission also requests comment on what factors should be considered in
determining the nature, timing, and extent of the required reviews and whether other frequencies
of review might be appropriate under some or all of the proposed rules.
4. Anticipated Impact of Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)
Based on the Commission’s experience supervising registered clearing agencies, and
given the current requirements applicable to registered clearing agencies under Rule 17Ad-22,
102

See proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(3)(i); 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vii); 17Ad-22(e)(5); 17Ad22(e)(6)(vii); 17Ad-22(e)(7)(v); 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vii); 17Ad-22(e)(7)(x); 17Ad-22(e)(13)(iii); and
17Ad-22(e)(15)(iii), infra Part VII.

41

the Commission preliminarily anticipates that the degree of changes that covered clearing
agencies may need to make to their policies and procedures to satisfy the proposed requirements
of Rule 17Ad-22(e) would vary among the particular provisions of the proposed rule and depend
in part on the business model and operations of the clearing agency itself, as discussed below.
The Commission preliminarily believes that, for the provisions in its proposal where a similar
existing requirement has been identified, covered clearing agencies may need to make only
limited changes to update their policies and procedures, and the table below provides summary
information regarding the Commission’s preliminary assessment of the impact of the proposed
rules:

registered clearing agencies that provide CCP services, the “cover two” requirement under Rule
17Ad-22(b)(3) applies only to registered clearing agencies that provide CCP services for
security-based swaps, and requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(d)(14) apply only to registered
clearing agencies that provide CSD services. See infra Part II.B.4 (discussing, among other
things, the relationship between existing requirements under Rule 17Ad-22 and proposed Rule
17Ad-22(e)(4)); see also 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22; Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra note
5.
104

The Commission notes that the relevant requirement in Rule 17Ad-22(b)(4) concerns
policies and procedures regarding an annual model validation for margin models while proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) would impose, in addition to requiring policies and procedures regarding an
annual model validation for margin models, additional requirements that do not appear in Rule

policies and procedures), and may need to take other steps, to satisfy the proposed requirements
of Rule 17Ad-22(e).

17Ad-22(e), see Part IV.C.
5. General Request for Comments
The Commission generally requests comments on all aspects of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)
and on all aspects of the definitions included in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a), as discussed in more
detail in Part II.B. 105 In addition, the Commission requests comments on the following issues:
•

Is each aspect of proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(1) through (23), including any terms used
therein, sufficiently clear given the proposed requirements? Why or why not? Has the
Commission provided sufficient guidance as to the meaning of each provision of the
proposed rules? Are there aspects of the proposed rules for which the Commission
should consider providing additional guidance? If so, please explain.

•

Are the Commission’s definitions in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a) accurate, appropriate,
and sufficiently clear? Why or why not? Should the definitions be modified? If so,
how? Should the Commission adopt alternative definitions than those proposed? Are
there additional terms used in Rule 17Ad-22(e) that should be defined? Please explain.

•

Is the Commission’s use of certain terms it believes to be commonly understood (e.g.,
“high degree of confidence” or “due diligence”) appropriate and accurate? Why or why
not?

105

Part II.B also contains additional requests for comments on each proposed rule regarding
particular issues specific to each proposed rule.

44

•

Would the proposed rules require covered clearing agencies to change their current
practices? If so, how? What are the expected costs and benefits to covered clearing
agencies in connection with adding or revising their current practices with respect to the
implementation of the Commission’s proposed rules? 106

•

Should the Commission consider an alternative approach with respect to written policies
and procedures included in the proposed rules? Why or why not? If so, what alternative
approaches should the Commission consider? Please explain in detail.

•

Should the Commission’s proposed rules be less or more prescriptive? Why or why not?
If so, what alternative approaches should the Commission consider? Please explain in
detail.

•

Are there any other factors that the Commission should take into consideration with
respect to the requirements of the proposed rules?

•

Should there be a phase-in period with respect to any of the requirements of proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e)? If so, what should the phase-in periods be? What facts and
circumstances should the Commission consider in evaluating whether to adopt a potential
phase-in period? Please explain in detail.

•

Could the proposed rules affect the ability of covered clearing agencies to compete for
certain types of business either within the United States or internationally? If so, how?
Please provide specific examples and data.

•

Are there significant operational or legal impediments to implementing the proposed
rules? Would the proposed rules impact the ability of covered clearing agencies to clear

with the proposed rules?
•

Are there any requirements under existing Rule 17Ad-22 that could be viewed as being
consistent with the PFMI standards without being supplemented or replaced by new
requirements in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)? Please explain in detail.
B. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)
1. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1): Legal Risk
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,

implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide
for a well-founded, clear, transparent, and enforceable legal basis for each aspect of its activities
in all relevant jurisdictions. 107 Rule 17Ad-22(d)(1) currently requires a registered clearing
agency’s policies and procedures to meet substantially the same requirement. 108 Because the
requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(d)(1) and proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1) are substantially the
same, the Commission anticipates that covered clearing agencies may need to make only limited
changes to update their policies and procedures to comply with the proposed rule. 109
107

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1), infra Part VII.

The Commission preliminarily believes that (i) the United States is the relevant
jurisdiction for covered clearing agencies that perform the functions of a clearing agency in the
United States for purposes of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1), and (ii) that covered clearing agencies
operating in multiple jurisdictions would be required to address any conflicts of laws issues that
they may encounter.
108

Rule 17Ad-22(d)(1) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide for a wellfounded, transparent, and enforceable legal framework for each aspect of its activities in all
relevant jurisdictions. See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(1); see also Clearing Agency Standards
Release, supra note 5, at 66245–46.
109

See supra Part II.A.4.
46

Consistent with the Exchange Act requirements discussed above, 110 the Commission is
proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1) to require that a covered clearing agency have a legal basis for
each aspect of its activities in all relevant jurisdictions. The legal framework for a particular
clearing agency may cover a broad array of areas and issues, in particular including but not
limited to its (i) organizational and governance documents, such as its charter, bylaws, and any
charters for board and management committees; 111 (ii) rules, policies, and procedures, 112
including those regarding settlement finality, netting, 113 default of a member, margin,
collateral, 114 payments, obligations to the participant or default fund, eligibility and participation

110

See notes 54–56 and accompanying text; see also Parts I.A and B (generally discussing
the regulatory framework under Section 17A of the Exchange Act, as amended by the DoddFrank Act).
111

The role of governance arrangements in promoting effective risk management has also
been a focus of rules proposed by the Commission to mitigate conflicts of interest at certain
registered clearing agencies. See Exchange Act Release No. 34-64017 (Mar. 3, 2011), 76 FR
14472 (Mar. 16, 2011) (proposing Rule 17Ad-23 to address conflicts of interest and Rule 17Ad26 to require standards for board members or board committee directors at registered clearing
agencies); Exchange Act Release No. 34-63107 (Oct. 14, 2010), 75 FR 65881, 65893 (Oct. 26,
2010) (proposing Regulation MC to mitigate conflicts of interest at security-based swap clearing
agencies).
112

See supra note 96 (describing the requirements in Section 19(b) of the Exchange Act).

113

Netting offsets obligations between or among participants in the netting arrangement,
thereby reducing the number and value of payments or deliveries needed to settle a set of
transactions. Netting can reduce potential losses in the event of a participant default and may
reduce the probability of a default. Netting arrangements can differ as to both timing and the
parties to the arrangement: (i) certain netting arrangements net payments or other contractual
obligations resulting from market trades (or both) on a continuous basis, while others close-out
payments or obligations when an event such as insolvency occurs; and (ii) netting arrangement
may net obligations bilaterally among two parties or multilaterally among multiple parties.

114

Collateral arrangements may involve either a pledge or a title transfer. Therefore,
regarding pledged assets, a covered clearing agency would examine the degree of legal certainty
that a pledge has been validly created in the relevant jurisdiction and, as appropriate, validly
perfected. Regarding transfer of title to assets, a covered clearing agency would examine the
47

requirements for members, and recovery and wind-down plans; (iii) contracts (notably including
with service providers, settlement banks and liquidity providers); (vi) its use of novation or
similar legal devices; 115 and (vii) service restrictions that may be imposed on participants such as
restrictions on activities or access.
In addition, the Commission is proposing to add Rule 17Ad-22(a)(20) to define
“transparent” to mean, for proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(1), (2), and (10), that relevant
documentation is disclosed, as appropriate, to the Commission and other relevant authorities,
clearing members and customers of clearing members, the owners of the covered clearing
agency, and the public, to the extent consistent with other statutory and Commission
requirements. 116 In proposing this definition, the Commission recognizes that certain types of
information, such as confidential information, may not be appropriate for public disclosure or
disclosure to certain third parties. Confidential information might include, for instance, policies
and procedures with respect to the security of information technology or other critical systems or
governance arrangements relating to the creation of special advisory committees by the board of

degree of legal certainty that the transfer is validly created in the relevant jurisdiction and will be
enforced.
115

Novation enables a clearing agency to act as a CCP. In novation, the original contract
between the buyer and seller is discharged and two new contracts are created, one between the
CCP and the buyer and the other between the CCP and the seller. The CCP thereby assumes the
original parties’ contractual obligations to each other. Legal certainty regarding novation may
reinforce market participants’ confidence regarding CCP support for or guarantee of the
transaction.

116

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(20), infra Part VII; see also Parts II.B.2 and 7 (discussing
proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(2) and (10), respectively).
Separately, the Commission has proposed rules to require policies and procedures to
protect the confidentiality of trading information and procedures. See Exchange Act Release No.
34-64017 (Mar. 3, 2011), 76 FR 14472 (Mar. 16, 2011) (proposing Rule 17Ad-23).

48

directors. With regard to public disclosures contemplated by proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(20), a
covered clearing agency could comply with the proposed requirement by posting the relevant
documentation to a covered clearing agency’s website. The Commission preliminarily believes
that these disclosures would support a participant’s ability to evaluate the risks associated with
participating in the covered clearing agency. For example, disclosures that facilitate market
participants’ understanding of the legal basis for a covered clearing agency’s activities and its
governance arrangements may encourage participation in the covered clearing agency (with
respect to prospective clearing members) and may encourage trading in the United States that
would result in clearance and settlement through the covered clearing agency (with respect to
prospective investors).
As was the case when the Commission considered Rule 17Ad-22(d)(1), where a clearing
agency is faced with significant uncertainty regarding legal risk, the Commission preliminary
believes this uncertainty may undermine a covered clearing agency’s ability to provide prompt
and accurate clearance and settlement, to safeguard securities and funds and to provide fair
procedures, as required under Section 17A of the Exchange Act. For example, where a covered
clearing agency’s procedures addressing a participant default and establishing a security interest
in collateral lack clarity or there is significant uncertainty regarding enforceability, there is a risk
the clearing agency may face claims to void, stay or reverse its actions, which could be made by
a bankruptcy trustee or other type of receiver in an insolvency of a participant, undermining the
clearing agency’s ability to safeguard securities and funds. As a similar example, if covered
clearing agency netting activities are voided or reversed on legal grounds, which could involve a
participant’s insolvency, clearing and settlement could be disrupted as participant accounts are
rebalanced. Also, for example, if a covered clearing agency’s plan for recovery and wind-down

49

is subject to legal uncertainty, the covered clearing agency or governmental authorities may be
delayed in or prevented from taking appropriate actions, resulting in disorder that may
undermine the provision of prompt and accurate clearance and settlement. 117
Therefore, like Rule 17Ad-22(d)(1), the Commission preliminarily believes that proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1) would support the effectiveness of a covered clearing agency’s risk
management procedures in two ways. First, by imposing requirements addressing legal risk, it
would continue to promote effective risk management at covered clearing agencies. Second, the
proposed rule would reinforce covered clearing agency policies and procedures regarding risks
other than legal risk, including, among others, credit, liquidity, operational, and general business
risk. 118
Request for Comments. The Commission generally requests comments on all aspects of
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1) and proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(20). In addition, the Commission
requests comments on the following specific issues:
•

Should the proposed rule include more specific requirements based on the type of
business or the types of services offered by covered clearing agencies and/or whether the
covered clearing agency operates in multiple jurisdictions? If so, are there any
considerations, such as those concerning compliance with regulations in other
jurisdictions, the Commission should take into account for covered clearing agencies
operating in multiple jurisdictions?

117

Issues addressed in such wind-down plans may include termination, netting, and the
transfer of securities positions and assets.

118

Cf. PFMI Report, supra note 1, at 21–25 (discussing Principle 1, legal basis).

50

•

Should the Commission adopt more prescriptive or less prescriptive rules to define how
covered clearing agencies would provide for a well-founded, clear, transparent, and
enforceable legal basis? Why or why not? If so, what would those rules be?

•

Should the Commission require a covered clearing agency to maintain documentation to
demonstrate the legal adequacy of the mechanisms at the clearing agency that are in place
to handle participant defaults? If so, what kinds of documentation should the
Commission require?

•

In proposing Rule 17Ad-22(a)(20), has the Commission taken the right approach with
respect to requiring public disclosures? Why or why not? Should the Commission adopt
rules that would require either more or less disclosure? Why or why not?

•

What should be the minimum level of public disclosure required of a covered clearing
agency? What information should a covered clearing agency be permitted to withhold?
What form should that disclosure take? What content should be required? Please explain
in detail.
2. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2): Governance
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2)(i) through (iv) would require a covered clearing agency to

establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to provide for governance arrangements that are clear and transparent, clearly prioritize the
safety and efficiency of the covered clearing agency, and support the public interest requirements
in Section 17A of the Exchange Act and the objectives of owners and participants. 119 The

119

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2), infra Part VII. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) would
complement other requirements that may apply separately, including requirements in proposed
Rules 17Ad-25 and 17Ad-26, and requirements for security-based swap clearing agencies under
51

proposed rule contains requirements similar to those currently applicable to registered clearing
agencies under Rule 17Ad-22(d)(8), but the proposed rule also requires that a covered clearing
agency’s policies and procedures provide for governance arrangements that clearly prioritize the
safety and efficiency of the covered clearing agency. 120
Governance arrangements are critical to the sound operation of SROs, including covered
clearing agencies. 121 The Exchange Act explicitly conditions clearing agency registration on a
clearing agency having rules that (i) assure a fair representation of shareholders or members and
participants in the selection of its directors and administration of affairs, (ii) facilitate prompt and
accurate clearance and settlement, (iii) protect investors and the public interest, (iv) do not permit
unfair discrimination in the use of the clearing agency by participants and (v) provide certain fair
procedures regarding participants and other interested parties. 122 Accordingly, the proper
functioning of registered clearing agencies pursuant to the requirements of the Exchange Act is
premised on the existence of a well-organized and operating governance function.

Section 765 of the Dodd-Frank Act, 12 U.S.C. 8343. See supra note 111 (noting rules proposed
by the Commission to address potential conflicts of interest).
120

Specifically, Rule 17Ad-22(d)(8) requires a registered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to have
governance arrangements that are clear and transparent to fulfill the public interest requirements
in Section 17A of the Exchange Act applicable to clearing agencies, to support the objectives of
owners and participants, and to promote the effectiveness of the clearing agency’s risk
management procedures. See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(8); see also Clearing Agency Standards
Release, supra note 5, at 66251–52.
121

See supra Part I.A and note 96 (describing the Commission’s framework for regulation of
SROs and the SRO rule filing process).
122

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(a)(3)(F), (H).

52

Consistent with these requirements and the Exchange Act requirements discussed
above, 123 the Commission preliminarily believes that the governance requirements proposed in
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) are appropriate because governance arrangements are fundamental to the
functioning of a covered clearing agency pursuant to Section 17A of the Exchange Act. 124
Consistent with the Commission’s statutory mandate under the Exchange Act, the proposed rule
would specify that governance arrangements also be consistent with the public interest
requirements in Section 17A of the Exchange Act as applicable to clearing agencies. Because a
covered clearing agency’s decisions can have widespread impact, affecting multiple market
participants, financial institutions, markets, and jurisdictions, the Commission preliminarily
believes it is important that each covered clearing agency place a high priority on the safety and
efficiency of its operations and explicitly support the objectives of owners and participants. In
addition, supporting the public interest is a broad concept that includes, for example, contributing
to the ongoing development of the U.S. financial system, in particular the national clearance and
settlement system contemplated by Section 17A of the Exchange Act, and protecting investors
and fostering fair and efficient markets. The Commission believes that, by supporting the public
interest, market participants can develop common processes that help reduce uncertainty in the
market, such as industry standards and market protocols related to clearance and settlement that
facilitate a common understanding and interactions among clearing agencies and their members.
The Commission preliminarily believes that covered clearing agencies, as SROs, are
appropriately positioned to determine, based on their experience in providing clearance and
123

See notes 54–56 and accompanying text; see also Parts I.A and B (generally discussing
the regulatory framework under Section 17A of the Exchange Act, as amended by the DoddFrank Act).
124

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(a)(2)(A).

53

settlement services and based on information obtained from their members and other
stakeholders, as appropriate in the circumstances, what governance arrangements appropriately
support the public interest requirements in Section 17A applicable to clearing agencies consistent
with the expectations of such stakeholders, 125 balancing the potentially competing viewpoints of
the various stakeholders. The Commission also preliminarily believes that mechanisms through
which a covered clearing agency could support the objectives of owners and participants could
potentially include representation on the board of directors, user committees, and various public
consultation processes.
As with Rule 17Ad-22(d)(8), the Commission preliminarily believes that requiring
policies and procedures for clear and transparent governance arrangements support
accountability in the decisions, rules, policies, and procedures of the covered clearing agency.
Such policies and procedures requirements for governance arrangements provide owners,
participants, and, if applicable, general members of the public, with an opportunity to comment
on or otherwise provide input to governance arrangements and, in turn, provide a covered
clearing agency with the opportunity to balance the potentially competing viewpoints of various
stakeholders in its decision making. 126 Similarly, these policies and procedures requirements for
governance arrangements may promote the effectiveness of a covered clearing agency’s risk
management procedures by fostering a focus on the critical role that risk management plays in

125

19b-4).
126

promoting prompt and accurate clearance and settlement. 127
In addition, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2)(iv) would require that the covered clearing
agency establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to provide for governance arrangements establishing that the board of directors and
senior management have appropriate experience and skills to discharge their duties and
responsibilities. 128 The Commission preliminarily believes that these aspects of a covered
clearing agency’s governance framework are particularly important and that establishing
requirements in these areas would be appropriate given the risks that a covered clearing agency’s
size, operation, and importance pose to the U.S. securities markets. 129
The Commission preliminarily believes that directors serving on the board and board
committees of a clearing agency play an important role in creating a framework that supports
prompt and accurate clearance and settlement because of their role in the decision-making
process within a clearing agency. Additionally, the Commission preliminarily believes that a
covered clearing agency’s senior management has an important role in ensuring, under the
board’s direction, that the clearing agency’s activities are consistent with the objectives, strategy,
and risk tolerance of the clearing agency, as determined by the board. Accordingly, the expertise
and skills of senior management and directors serving on the board of a covered clearing agency
are likely to affect its effective operation. For example, a lack of expertise by board members

interest at clearing agencies as part of efforts to promote sound risk management and governance
arrangements).
128

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2), infra Part VII.

directors and senior management, and the anticipated impact of the proposed requirements for
governance, see Parts IV.B.3.a.ii and IV.C.3.a.ii, respectively.

55

may deter them from challenging decisions by management and lessen the potential that
management would escalate appropriate issues to the board for the board’s consideration.
Similarly, board members and management should not have conflicts of interests that could
undermine the decision-making process within a covered clearing agency or interfere with fair
representation and equitable treatment of clearing members or other market participants by a
covered clearing agency.
The Commission believes that covered clearing agencies are well positioned to determine
which individuals would have the appropriate experience, skills, incentives and integrity to
discharge their duties and responsibilities that reflect the particular characteristics of each
covered clearing agency. Accordingly, the Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed
requirement for policies and procedures would provide the covered clearing agency with a
process to evaluate the expertise and skills of board members and senior management, consistent
with the particular circumstances of the covered clearing agency. Such policies and procedures
may include provisions requiring the covered clearing agency to consider, for example, the
specific qualifications, experience, competence, character, skills, incentives, integrity or other
relevant attributes to support a conclusion that an individual nominee can appropriately serve as
a board member or on senior management. Such policies and procedures could also include,
among other things, requirements as to industry experience relevant to the services provided by
the covered clearing agency, educational background, the absence of a criminal or disciplinary
record, or other factors relevant to the qualifications of nominees being considered.
Request for Comments. The Commission generally requests comments on all aspects of
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2). In addition, the Commission requests comments on the following
specific issues:

56

•

Should the Commission require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to
provide for governance arrangements that prioritize the safety and efficiency of the
covered clearing agency? Why or why not?

•

The Commission is not proposing at this time to require a covered clearing agency’s
policies and procedures provide for governance arrangements that also support the
objectives of participants’ customers, securities issuers and holders, and other
stakeholders. Should the Commission consider such a requirement? Why or why not?
Are existing protections under the Exchange Act, such as those in Section 17A(b)(3)(H)
(requiring clearing agency rules to provide fair procedures to persons with respect to
access to services offered by the clearing agency), 130 Section 17A(b)(5)(B) (establishing
requirements for clearing agencies when determining whether a person may be prohibited
or limited with respect to services offered), 131 and Section 19(d)(2) (persons aggrieved by
SRO actions may apply to the Commission for review) 132 already satisfactory or would
additional Commission governance requirements also be appropriate? What would be
the possible advantages and disadvantages of expanding the scope of proposed Rule
17Ad-22(e)(2)(iii) to require covered clearing agency policies and procedures to consider
the interests of persons other than owners and participants?

•

Should the Commission require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to
provide for governance arrangements establishing that the board of directors and senior
management have appropriate experience and skills to discharge their duties and

130

57

responsibilities? Why or why not? Has the Commission provided sufficient guidance on
what “experience and skills” would require? Why or why not?
•

Are there any other requirements that should be included in the rule to promote clear and
transparent governance arrangements?

•

The Commission is not proposing at this time to require a covered clearing agency’s
policies and procedures provide for governance arrangements to ensure that lines of
responsibility and accountability at the covered clearing agency are clear and direct.
Should the Commission consider such a requirement? Why or why not?

•

The Commission is not proposing at this time to require a covered clearing agency’s
policies and procedures provide for governance arrangements that ensure major decisions
of the board of directors are disclosed to the public. Should the Commission consider
such a requirement? Why or why not?

•

Should there be a phase-in period for covered clearing agencies to comply with proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2), such as until the next annual meeting of shareholders of the covered
clearing agency or other time period? Why or why not?

•

Are the governance requirements in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) necessary to achieve
the benefits discussed in Part IV.C.3.a.ii? Why or why not? For example, how and why
would particular features of the proposed rules, such as expectations that directors and
officers of covered clearing agencies have certain skills and experience, contribute to
greater market stability and reduced risk of insufficient internal controls endangering
broader financial stability? Are there existing requirements under Section 17A of the
Exchange Act, such as the “fair representation” requirement in Section 17A(b)(3)(C),
rules and regulations adopted by the Commission and applicable to SROs, or relevant
58

interpretations published by the Commission that already provide a clear and sufficient
basis for the Commission to supervise covered clearing agencies in the manner
contemplated by proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) without adopting the proposed
rule? What are the possible benefits of adopting the rule as proposed and what possible
detriments may arise that the Commission should consider?
•

Are there disclosures that a covered clearing agency should be required to make with
respect to its governance arrangements? Why or why not? If so, what should be the form
and content of those disclosures?

•

Should the Commission require that the performance of the board of directors and senior
management—individually and as a group—are reviewed on a regular basis? If so, how
often should this review be conducted? Should this review be conducted independently?

•

Should the board of directors of covered clearing agencies include individuals who are
not executives, officers, or employees of the covered clearing agency, or an affiliate of
the covered clearing agency? Should the board of directors of covered clearing agencies
include an independent audit committee?

•

Should the Commission be involved in and/or set requirements and standards with
respect to board and management governance at covered clearing agencies? Does the
Commission have the requisite statutory authority to adopt the rule proposals and matters
addressed in the related questions set forth in this release as to governance arrangements,
standards, composition, and qualifications of covered clearing agencies’ boards and
management? Is the Commission’s oversight and establishment of corporate governance
measures and standards at clearing agencies a proper and good use of Commission

59

resources? What are the potential costs and benefits of these corporate governance
provisions?
3. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3): Framework for the Comprehensive
Management of Risks
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
maintain a sound risk management framework for comprehensively managing legal, credit,
liquidity, operational, general business, investment, custody, and other risks that arise in or are
borne by the covered clearing agency. 133
Existing Rules 17Ad-22(b) and (d) require registered clearing agencies to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to meet
several requirements that address risk management practices by registered clearing agencies that
provide CCP services (Rules 17Ad-22(b)(1) through (4)), certain requirements regarding access
to registered clearing agencies that provide CCP services (Rules 17Ad-22(b)(5) through (7)), and
certain minimum standards for the operations of registered clearing agencies providing CCP or
CSD services. 134 Consistent with these requirements and the Exchange Act requirements
discussed above, 135 the Commission preliminarily believes that proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3) is
133

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3), infra Part VII.

134

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(b), (d); see also Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra
note 5, at 66230–43, 66244–58. Specifically, as examples, Rule 17Ad-22(d)(4) requires a
registered clearing agency to have policies and procedures reasonably designed to address certain
aspects of operational risk, and Rule 17Ad-22(d)(7) requires a registered clearing agency to have
policies and procedures reasonably designed to address certain aspects of risks relating to
linkages. See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(4), (7).
135

See notes 54–56 and accompanying text; see also Parts I.A and B (generally discussing
the regulatory framework under Section 17A of the Exchange Act, as amended by the DoddFrank Act).
60

appropriate and would require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to take a
broader, more comprehensive approach to risk management, which the Commission believes is
fundamental to a covered clearing agency’s functioning given its size, operation, and importance
in the U.S. securities markets. While existing rules under the Exchange Act already target
certain aspects of risk management, the Commission preliminarily believes that comprehensive
risk management policies and procedures established pursuant to proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)
would further support the examination of risks, the assessment of their probability and impact,
and the identification of linkages to other entities that in turn pose risks to the covered clearing
agency. The Commission also believes that comprehensive risk management policies and
procedures would facilitate the development of mechanisms to better prioritize, manage, and
monitor risks, and to measure the covered clearing agency’s risk tolerance and capacity. In
proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3), the Commission is emphasizing a comprehensive approach to
risk management that would require risk management policies and procedures be designed
holistically, be consistent with each other, and work effectively together in order to mitigate the
risk of financial losses to covered clearing agencies’ members and participants in the markets
they serve.
In addition, policies and procedures for the comprehensive management of risks have the
potential to play an important role in making sure that covered clearing agencies better fulfill the
Exchange Act requirements that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to protect investors
and the public interest. 136 Similarly, these requirements may promote the effectiveness of a
covered clearing agency’s risk management procedures by fostering a focus on the critical role
that risk management plays in promoting prompt and accurate clearance and settlement.
136

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(a)(2).

61

Accordingly, the Commission preliminarily believes that it is important that covered clearing
agencies have policies and procedures that enable them to identify, monitor, and manage the
range of risks that arise in or are borne by all aspects of their clearance and settlement activities.
In addition, the Commission is proposing the requirements described below, which do not
appear in existing Rules 17Ad-22(b) or (d). The Commission preliminarily believes these
requirements would be appropriate for covered clearing agencies given the risks that their size,
operation, and importance pose to the U.S. securities markets.
a. Policies and Procedures Requirements, Periodic Review, and
Annual Board Approval
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(i) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide
for risk management policies, procedures, and systems designed to identify, measure, monitor,
and manage the range of risks that arise in or are borne by the covered clearing agency, and
subject them to review on a specified periodic basis and approval by the board of directors
annually. 137
The Commission preliminarily believes periodic review of the risk management policies
and procedures would allow covered clearing agencies to assess whether the risk management
policies and procedures should be updated to account for changing factors in the market and to
address and codify in a uniform way the approach to new risks taken since the last periodic
review. The Commission preliminarily believes that the board of directors of a covered clearing
agency should be required to approve the risk management policies and procedures. The
Commission preliminarily believes that, in complying with this requirement, a board of directors
137

See id.

62

may want to subject all material components of the covered clearing agency’s risk management
policies and procedures to review pursuant to Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(i) due to the critical role that
risk management plays in promoting prompt and accurate clearance and settlement.
b. Recovery and Orderly Wind-Down Plans
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(ii) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
it establishes plans for the recovery and orderly wind-down of the covered clearing agency
necessitated by credit losses, liquidity shortfalls, losses from general business risk, or any other
losses. 138
Securities exchanges, market participants, and investors rely upon the safe, sound, and
efficient operations of covered clearing agencies, and accordingly the Commission preliminarily
believes that a disorderly wind-down of a covered clearing agency would have systemic
consequences. 139 The Commission preliminarily believes that a recovery plan designed to deal
with possible scenarios that may threaten or potentially prevent a covered clearing agency from
being able to provide its critical operations and services as a going concern and that assesses a
full range of options for recovery could mitigate the impact of a near failure of a covered
clearing agency.
Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission recognizes that covered clearing
agencies operating in the market today each have relevant standards and practices relating to
138

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3), infra Part VII.

139

See generally Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra note 5, at 66283 (noting, in
discussing Rule 17Ad-22(d)(11), that having policies and procedures “allow[s] a clearing agency
to wind down positions in an orderly way and continue to perform its obligations in the event of
a participant default, assuring continued functioning of the securities market in times of stress
and reducing systemic risk”).

63

recovery and orderly wind-down with differing degrees of formality. The Commission therefore
preliminarily expects that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(ii) would require covered clearing agencies to
review such standards and practices for sufficiency with respect to the safe operation of the
covered clearing agency and revise such practices in a manner consistent with the findings of
such review consistent with the proposed rule, if adopted, and the requirements of the Exchange
Act.
c. Risk Management and Internal Audit
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(iii) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide
risk management and internal audit personnel with sufficient authority, resources, independence
from management, and access to the board of directors. The Commission preliminarily believes
that a covered clearing agency could satisfy the policies and procedures requirement for
independence from management by, for example, providing reporting lines for risk management
functions that are clear and separate from those for other operations and providing for direct
reporting to the board of directors or a relevant committee of the board. In that regard, proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(iv) would require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide risk
management and internal audit personnel with oversight by and a direct reporting line to a risk
management committee and an audit committee of the board of directors, respectively.
Furthermore, proposed Rule 17A-22(e)(3)(v) would require a covered clearing agency to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to provide for an independent audit committee.
The Commission preliminarily believes that a covered clearing agency should have an
effective internal audit function in order to provide, among other things, a rigorous and
64

independent assessment of the effectiveness of the clearing agency’s risk management and
control processes, and should have an independent audit committee overseeing the internal audit
function in order to help promote the integrity and efficiency of the audit process and strengthen
internal controls. In order to satisfy the independence requirement for an audit committee under
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2), a covered clearing agency could use such independence criteria as
are established by its board of directors. The Commission further preliminarily believes that
policies and procedures for risk management are important to the effective operation of a
covered clearing agency.
d. Request for Comments
The Commission generally requests comments on all aspects of Proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(3). In addition, the Commission requests comments on the following specific issues:
•

Should the Commission require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to
maintain a sound risk management framework for comprehensively managing legal,
credit, liquidity, operational, general business, investment, custody, and other risks that
arise in or are borne by the covered clearing agency? Why or why not?

•

Should the Commission require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures
include plans for the recovery and orderly wind-down of the covered clearing agency
necessitated by credit losses, liquidity shortfalls, losses from general business risk, or any
other losses? Why or why not?

•

How and to whom should the board of directors communicate the results of its review of
the risk management framework, if at all?

•

Are there any other requirements that should be included in the rule to facilitate policies
and procedures that maintain a sound risk management framework, including the

65

proposed requirements for policies and procedures regarding board review and approval
of risk management policies and policies and procedures with respect to recovery and
orderly wind-down plans? Why or why not? For example, should the Commission
require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to identify, measure,
monitor, and manage the material risks that it poses to other entities, such as other
financial market utilities, settlement banks, liquidity providers, or service providers, as a
result of interdependencies? Why or why not?
•

The Commission is not proposing at this time to require a covered clearing agency’s
policies and procedures to, in its comprehensive risk management framework, provide for
criteria for the independence of audit committee members. Should the Commission
consider requirements that specify such criteria? Why or why not? If so, should those
criteria be similar to the audit committee independence requirements for listed companies
in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act? 140 In order to satisfy the policies and procedures
requirement for independence of the audit committee under proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(3), should a covered clearing agency be allowed to use such independence criteria
as are established by its board of directors?
4. Proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4) through (7): Financial Risk Management
a. Overview of Financial Risks Faced by Clearing Agencies
Covered clearing agencies face a variety of financial risks from their participants and

service providers, including credit or counterparty default risk, market risk, and liquidity risk.
For example, for clearing agencies that provide CSD services, credit risk arises from the
potential that a participant will not pay what it owes for securities that it has purchased or will
140

See 17 CFR 240.10A-3.

66

not deliver securities that it has sold. For clearing agencies that clear and settle derivatives
contracts, credit risk arises from the potential that a participant will not meet its margin or
settlement obligations or pay any other amounts owed to the covered clearing agency. 141 Credit
risk also arises for clearing agencies of any type from commercial banks or custodians that the
covered clearing agency uses to effect money transfers among participants, to hold overnight
deposits, or to safeguard cash or other collateral.
Clearing agencies that provide CCP services take offsetting positions as the substituted
counterparty to a transaction and, therefore, do not ordinarily face market risk except in the event
of a participant default. In such an event, market risk takes two forms. First, the clearing agency
may need to liquidate collateral posted by the defaulting participant. The clearing agency is
therefore exposed to volatility in the market price of the defaulting participant’s non-cash
collateral that could result in the clearing agency having insufficient financial resources to cover
the losses in the defaulting participant’s open positions. Second, a clearing agency providing
CCP services is subject to volatility in the market price of the defaulting participant’s open
positions during the interval between the point at which the clearing agency takes control of
those positions and the point at which the clearing agency is able to offset, transfer, or liquidate
those positions. A clearing agency faces the risk that its exposure to a participant can change as
a result of a change in prices, positions, or both.
A clearing agency must be able to measure the counterparty credit exposures that it is
expected to manage effectively. A clearing agency can ascertain its current credit exposure to
141

In this context, the clearing agency’s credit risk is closely related to the participant’s
market risk. A participant’s ability to meet its obligations to the clearing agency may be affected
by the participant’s exposure to fluctuations in the market value of the participant’s open
positions. In addition, fluctuations in the market value of the collateral posted by the participant
may require the clearing agency to obtain additional margin from the participant.

67

each participant by marking each participant’s outstanding positions to current market prices and
(to the extent permitted by a clearing agency’s rules and supported by law) netting any gains
against any losses.
In addition to credit risk and market risk, clearing agencies also face liquidity or funding
risk. Currently, to complete the settlement process, clearing agencies generally rely on incoming
payments from participants in net debit positions in order to make payments to participants in net
credit positions. If a participant does not have sufficient funds to make an incoming payment
immediately when it is due (even though it may be able to pay at some future time), or if a
settlement bank is unable to make an incoming payment on behalf of a participant, the clearing
agency faces a funding shortfall. A clearing agency typically holds additional financial resources
to cover potential funding shortfalls such as margin collateral or lines of credit. However, if
collateral cannot be liquidated within a short time, or if lines of credit are unavailable, liquidity
risk would be exacerbated.
b. Current Financial Risk Management Requirements for CCPs
Rules 17Ad-22(b)(1) through (4) concern risk management requirements for clearing
agencies that perform CCP services (hereinafter “CCPs” in this part). Rule 17Ad-22(b)(1)
requires that CCPs establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to measure their credit exposures at least once per day. 142 Rule 17Ad22(b)(2) requires that CCPs establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to use margin requirements to limit their exposures to
participants. 143 This margin can also be used to reduce a CCP’s losses in the event of a
142

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(b)(1).

143

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(b)(2).
68

participant default. Rule 17Ad-22(b)(3) requires that CCPs establish, implement, maintain and
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to maintain sufficient financial
resources to withstand, at a minimum, a default by the participant family to which a CCP has the
largest exposure in extreme but plausible market conditions, except that CCPs clearing securitybased swap transactions must maintain additional financial resources sufficient to withstand the
simultaneous default by the two participant families to which a CCP has the largest exposures. 144
Finally, Rule 17Ad-22(b)(4) requires that CCPs establish, implement, maintain and enforce
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide for an annual model validation
that consists of evaluating the performance of a clearing agency’s margin models and the related
parameters and assumptions associated with such models and that is performed by a qualified
person who is free from influence from the persons responsible for development or operation of
the models being validated. 145
c. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4): Credit Risk
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
effectively identify, measure, monitor, and manage its credit exposures to participants and those
exposures arising from its payment, clearing, and settlement processes. 146 The Commission

144

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(b)(3).

145

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(b)(4).

146

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4), infra Part VII.

69

preliminarily believes the proposed rule is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act
discussed above. 147
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i) would require a covered clearing to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
maintain sufficient financial resources to cover its credit exposure to each participant fully with
a high degree of confidence. The Commission’s intention in proposing the term “high degree of
confidence” is to refer to the statistical meaning of this term. 148 The proposed rule would require
a covered clearing agency to use statistical methods to develop models in order to estimate the
financial resources required under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(ii) and (iii), 149 and to comply
with the requirements of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(ii) and (iii), while recognizing that such
an approach is necessarily imprecise to at least some degree.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(ii) would require a covered clearing agency that provides
CCP services, and that is “systemically important in multiple jurisdictions” or “a clearing agency
involved in activities with a more complex risk profile,” to establish, implement, maintain and
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to maintain additional financial
resources, to the extent not already maintained pursuant to proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i), at a
minimum level necessary to enable it to cover a wide range of foreseeable stress scenarios,
including but not limited to the default of the two participant families that would potentially

See notes 54–56 and accompanying text; see also Parts I.A and B (generally discussing
the regulatory framework under Section 17A of the Exchange Act, as amended by the DoddFrank Act).

See, e.g., Arthur S. Goldberger, A Course in Econometrics 122–23 (Harvard Univ. Press,
2003) (defining confidence intervals for parameter estimates).

counterparty credit exposures in order to manage risk effectively).

70

cause the largest aggregate credit exposure for the covered clearing agency in extreme but
plausible market conditions (hereinafter the “cover two” requirement).
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(iii) would require a covered clearing agency that is not
subject to proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(ii) to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to maintain additional financial resources, to the
extent not already maintained pursuant to proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i), at the minimum to
enable it to cover a wide range of foreseeable stress scenarios, including the default of the
participant family that would potentially cause the largest aggregate credit exposure for the
covered clearing agency in extreme but plausible market conditions (hereinafter the “cover one”
requirement). 150 The Commission notes that the requirement in proposed Rules 17Ad22(e)(4)(ii) and (iii) to examine exposure under foreseeable stress scenarios including extreme
but plausible market conditions means the covered clearing agency may need to use models to
determine how its estimated exposure under such conditions differs from its actual exposure to
positions of such participants, which it would be required to measure under proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(4)(i).
Also, as previously discussed, the Commission is proposing Rule 17Ad-22(a)(4) to define
“clearing agency involved in activities with a more complex risk profile.” 151 The Commission is
150

The Commission notes that, with the exception of security-based swap clearing agencies,
all registered clearing agencies providing CCP services are all currently required to meet a
“cover one” standard under Rule 17Ad-22(b)(3), and therefore the Commission anticipates that
covered clearing agencies may need to make only limited changes to policies and procedures to
satisfy the proposed requirement, if adopted. See infra Parts IV.B.3.b.i and IV.C.3.a.iv(1)
(discussing current practices at registered clearing agencies relating to credit risk and the
anticipated economic effect of the proposed requirement, respectively).
151

See supra Part II.A.1 (discussing the scope of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)); supra notes
79–80 and accompanying text.

71

also proposing Rule 17Ad-22(a)(19) to define “systemically important in multiple jurisdictions”
to mean a covered clearing agency that has been determined by the Commission to be
systemically important in more than one jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 17Ab2-2. 152
Like the “cover two” requirement in Rule 17Ad-22(b)(3), which applies to registered
clearing agencies that provide CCP services for security-based swaps, 153 proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(4)(ii) would impose a “cover two” requirement to address credit risk of certain covered
clearing agencies: those systemically important in multiple jurisdictions and those involved in
activities with a more complex risk profile. The Commission notes that the set of complex risk
profile clearing agencies subject to this requirement would include, as of the date of this
proposal, only registered clearing agencies that provide CCP services for security-based swaps,
which are already subject to the “cover two” requirement in Rule 17Ad-22(b)(3). In addition,
the Commission notes that no covered clearing agency would be systemically important in
multiple jurisdictions unless and until the Commission made such a determination pursuant to
proposed Rule 17Ab2-2. 154 For any covered clearing agency not currently subject to a “cover
two” requirement that could be determined by the Commission in the future to be either
systemically important in multiple jurisdictions or involved in activities with a more complex

offset increased risk and to prepare for extreme but plausible market conditions is appropriate
because it could decrease the likelihood that systemic events in other jurisdictions or extreme
volatility in more complex financial instruments would result in interruptions to the provision of
clearance and settlement services in the U.S. securities markets.
In addition, the Commission is proposing the requirements described below. In
discussing these requirements, the below sections describe how they differ from existing
requirements in Rules 17Ad-22(b)(1) through (4) applicable to security-based swap clearing
agencies, previously discussed above. 155
i. Prefunded Financial Resources
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(iv) would require a covered clearing agency providing
CCP services that is either systemically important in multiple jurisdictions or a complex risk
profile clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to include prefunded financial resources, excluding assessments
for additional guaranty fund contributions or other resources that are not prefunded, when
calculating the financial resources available to meet the standards under proposed Rules 17Ad22(e)(4)(i) through (iii), as applicable. 156 The Commission preliminarily believes that
prefunding default obligations is appropriate because of the importance of the ability of a
covered clearing agency to meet its default resource obligations to the clearance and settlement
system, given the risks that its size, operation, and importance pose to the U.S. securities

155

See supra Part II.B.4.b.

156

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(iv), infra Part VII.

73

markets. 157 Immediately available financial resources are necessary to ensure that a covered
clearing agency can meet its financial obligations on an ongoing basis. Without prefunded
financial resources, a covered clearing agency may be unable to meet its financial obligations in
stressed market conditions, when clearing members may be unwilling or unable to contribute to
the clearing agency’s guaranty fund in the event of a member default.
The Commission notes that while the ability to assess participants for contributions under
applicable covered clearing agency governing documents, rules, or agreements could not be
included in this calculation, previously paid-in participant contributions into a covered clearing
agency default fund could be counted to the extent the clearing agency’s rules, policies, or
procedures permit such resources to be used in a manner equivalent to other financial resources
in the default fund. Other sources of prefunded resources, such as margin previously posted to
the clearing agency by participants, could also be treated in this manner. In addition, while the
ability to draw down under a revolving loan facility could not be counted towards prefunded
resources because funds from such loan facility would not be in the covered clearing agency’s
immediate possession, the covered clearing agency could count borrowed funds already drawn
down, such as under a term loan or other credit facility.
Existing requirements under Rule 17Ad-22 do not include requirements for prefunded
financial resources at registered clearing agencies. The proposed requirement reflects the
Commission’s recognition of the importance of a covered clearing agency meeting its default

157

See generally 12 U.S.C. 5461 (Congress finding, among other things, that enhancements
to the regulation and supervision of systemically important FMUs and the conduct of
systemically important PCS activities by financial institutions are necessary, under Title VIII, to
provide consistency, to promote robust risk management and safety and soundness, to reduce
systemic risks, and to support the stability of the broader financial system).

74

resource obligations, given the risks that its size, operation, and importance pose to the U.S.
securities markets.
ii. Combined or Separately Maintained Clearing or Guaranty
Funds
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(v) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
maintain the financial resources required under proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i) through (iii) in
combined or separately maintained clearing or guaranty funds. 158 The proposed rule makes clear
that a covered clearing agency may choose to maintain a separate default fund for purposes of
complying with proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i) through (iii).
This requirement would be similar to the requirement in Rule 17Ad-22(b)(3) requiring a
security-based swap clearing agency to have policies and procedures reasonably designed to
maintain financial resources generally or in separately maintained funds. 159 The Commission
believes that this approach facilitates the operations of clearing agencies. For example, clearing
agencies may maintain separate default funds for each product or asset type cleared, in order to
more appropriately tailor risk management requirements or contain losses from a default to that
fund.
iii. Testing the Sufficiency of Financial Resources
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to test the
158

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(v), infra Part VII.

159

Rule 17Ad-22(b)(3) currently also permits a security-based swap clearing agency to have
policies and procedures reasonably designed to maintain financial resources generally or in
separately maintained funds. See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(b)(3); see also Clearing Agency
Standards Release, supra note 5, at 66233–236.

75

sufficiency of its total financial resources available to meet the minimum financial resource
requirements under proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i) through (iii), as applicable, by conducting a
stress test of its total financial resources at least once each day using standard predetermined
parameters and assumptions. 160 Registered clearing agencies are not subject to requirements for
testing the sufficiency of their financial resources under existing Rule 17Ad-22.
The proposed rule would also require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to conduct a
comprehensive analysis on at least a monthly basis of the existing stress testing scenarios,
models, and underlying parameters and assumptions, and consider modifications to ensure they
are appropriate for determining the covered clearing agency’s required level of default protection
in light of current market conditions. When the products cleared or markets served by a covered
clearing agency display high volatility, become less liquid, or when the size or concentration of
positions held by the entity’s participants increases significantly, the proposed rule would
specifically require a covered clearing agency to have policies and procedures for conducting
comprehensive analyses of stress testing scenarios, models, and underlying parameters and
assumptions more frequently than monthly. The Commission preliminarily believes that what
constitutes “high volatility” and “low liquidity” would vary across asset classes that a covered
clearing agency might clear. Accordingly, the Commission preliminarily believes that a clearing
agency would need flexibility to address changing circumstances and is therefore not proposing
to prescribe triggers for any particular circumstance.
The proposed rule would also require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide for the
160

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi), infra Part VII.

76

reporting of the results of this analysis to the appropriate decision makers at the covered clearing
agency, including its risk management committee or board of directors, and to require the use of
the results to evaluate the adequacy of and to adjust its margin methodology, model parameters,
and any other relevant aspects of its credit risk management policies and procedures, in
supporting compliance with the minimum financial resources requirements discussed above.
The Commission is also proposing to add Rule 17Ad-22(a)(18) to define “stress testing”
to mean the estimation of credit and liquidity exposures that would result from the realization of
extreme but plausible price changes or changes in other valuation inputs and assumptions. 161
The Commission preliminarily believes that stress testing is an important component of the
proposed rules because stress testing may enable a covered clearing agency to be prepared for an
extreme event that may not be anticipated or expected based solely on current market conditions
or from a sample of historical data.
The Commission preliminarily believes that the requirements in proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(4)(vi) are appropriate for testing the sufficiency of the financial resources of covered
clearing agencies because, in certain market conditions, such as periods of high volatility or
diminished liquidity, existing stress scenarios, models, or underlying parameters may no longer
be valid or appropriate. Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission believes that
certain, but not all, covered clearing agencies adjusted their stress testing scenarios following the
2008 financial crisis to incorporate larger debt, equity, and credit market shocks similar to those
experienced during the crisis. Accordingly, the Commission preliminarily believes that specific
policies and procedures contemplating actions to be taken by all covered clearing agencies in
such circumstances are necessary to ensure the safe functioning of the covered clearing agencies
161

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(18), infra Part VII.

77

as required by the Exchange Act, 162 and that requiring periodic feedback and analysis on the
strength of credit risk management policies and procedures would improve the reliability of
those policies and procedures. The Commission also preliminarily believes that the rule would
provide a covered clearing agency with the flexibility to use stress scenarios that are
appropriately tailored to current market conditions and that can be revised over time as markets
change and believes that such flexibility is appropriate to achieve the objectives of the Exchange
Act.
iv. Annual Conforming Model Validation
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vii) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to require
a conforming model validation for its credit risk models to be performed not less than annually
or more frequently as may be contemplated by the covered clearing agency’s risk management
policies and procedures. 163 The Commission preliminary believes that an annual cycle is
appropriate for the reasons described in Part II.A.3. The Commission notes that other important
reviews such as auditing of the financial statements of registered clearing agencies and their
disclosure are required to occur on an annual basis as well. 164
The Commission is proposing to add Rule 17Ad-22(a)(5) to define “conforming model
validation” to mean an evaluation of the performance of each material risk management model
used by a covered clearing agency, along with the related parameters and assumptions associated
162

See notes 54–56 and accompanying text; see also Parts I.A and B (generally discussing
the regulatory framework under Section 17A of the Exchange Act, as amended by the DoddFrank Act).

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vii), infra Part VII.

164

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(c)(2).

78

with such models. 165 Such model validation would apply to models that would include initial
margin models, liquidity risk models, and models used to generate clearing or guaranty fund
requirements. A conforming model validation would also require that the model validation be
performed by a qualified person who is free from influence from the persons responsible for the
development or operation of the models or policies being validated so that credit risk models can
be candidly assessed. 166 Generally, the Commission considers that a person is free from
influence when that person does not perform functions associated with the clearing agency’s
models (except as part of the annual model validation) and does not report to a person who
performs these functions. The Commission generally would not expect that it would be
necessary for policies and procedures adopted pursuant to this proposed requirement to require
the clearing agency to separate organizationally model review from model development or to
maintain two separate quantitative teams.
The proposed rule differs from the existing requirement for security-based swap clearing
agencies in Rule 17Ad-22(b)(4) by defining in explicit terms the requirements for a conforming
model validation and by requiring it for credit risk models. 167 The proposed rule would also
165

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(5), infra Part VII.

166

See Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra note 5, at 66238.

167

Rule 17Ad-22(b)(4) requires a security-based swap clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide
for an annual model validation consisting of evaluating the performance of the clearing agency’s
margin models and the related parameters and assumptions associated with such models by a
qualified person who is free from influence from the persons responsible for the development or
operation of the models being validated. See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(b)(4); see also Clearing
Agency Standards Release, supra note 5, at 66236–238.
In contrast to proposed Rules 17Ad-22(a)(5) and (e)(4)(vii), Rule 17Ad-22(b)(4) requires
only a model validation for margin models and does not specify the general elements of a model
validation.
79

apply to any covered clearing agency, and not only security-based swap clearing agencies. The
Commission preliminarily believes, because credit risk models play an important role in limiting
systemic risk, that it is important to create a consistent, clear, and uniformly applied minimum
standard for model validation across all covered clearing agencies. 168 The Commission also
preliminarily believes that annual conforming model validation would provide unbiased
feedback on the performance of such models and policies, and therefore could improve their
reliability.
d. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5): Collateral
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to limit
the assets it accepts as collateral to those with low credit, liquidity, and market risks, and also
require policies that set and enforce appropriately conservative haircuts and concentration limits
if the covered clearing agency requires collateral to manage its own or its participants’ credit
exposures. 169 The proposed rule includes requirements similar to those applicable to registered
clearing agencies under Rule 17Ad-22(d)(3) but would, in addition, require a covered clearing
agency’s policies and procedures to set and enforce appropriately conservative haircuts and
concentration limits if the covered clearing agency requires collateral to manage its own or its
participants’ credit exposures. 170

168

See generally Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra note 5, at 66238.

169

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5), infra Part VII.

170

Registered clearing agencies are currently subject to requirements under Rule 17Ad22(d)(3), which requires registered clearing agencies to hold assets in a manner that minimizes
risk of loss or risk of delay in access to them and invest assets in instruments with minimal
credit, market, and liquidity risk. See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(3); see also Clearing Agency
80

The Commission is proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5) to require policies and procedures
with respect to specific practices to be followed by a covered clearing agency when managing
collateral to ensure the safeguarding of funds, consistent with the requirements under the
Exchange Act discussed above. 171 In doing so, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5) would promote
confidence that covered clearing agencies are able to meet their settlement obligations by
reducing the likelihood that assets securing participant obligations to the covered clearing agency
would be unavailable or insufficient when the covered clearing agency needs to draw on them.
Specifically, such requirements recognize the role played by system-wide asset price
deterioration in generating systemic risk and the vulnerability a covered clearing agency could
face if posted collateral were concentrated in assets that subsequently experience such
deterioration in price. 172 The Commission preliminarily believes the proposed rule is appropriate
given the risks that its size, operation, and importance pose to the U.S. securities markets,
thereby promoting stability in the national system for clearance and settlement by increasing the
likelihood collateral holdings will function as designed when faced with stressed market
conditions.

Standards Release, supra note 5, at 66247–48; infra Part II.B.13 (discussing proposed Rule
17Ad-22(e)(16)).
Similarly, the Commission preliminarily believes that appropriately conservative haircuts
and concentration limits would require a covered clearing agency to value assets in a manner that
minimizes risk of loss or risk of delay in access to them.
171

See notes 54–56 and accompanying text; see also Parts I.A and B (generally discussing
the regulatory framework under Section 17A of the Exchange Act, as amended by the DoddFrank Act).
172

See, e.g., Mark Roe, Clearinghouse Overconfidence (Aug. 11, 2013), available at
http://ssrn.com/abstract=2224305 (discussing the risks posed to clearing agencies by asset price
deterioration).

81

In addition, the Commission is proposing that a covered clearing agency establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to include
a not-less-than-annual review of the sufficiency of a covered clearing agency’s collateral haircuts
and concentration limits. 173 Rule 17Ad-22(d) does not impose a similar requirement on
registered clearing agencies. The Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed approach
is appropriate because of the importance of collateral haircuts and concentration limits to a
covered clearing agency’s risk management policies and procedures. Because of the role
collateral plays in a default, a covered clearing agency needs assurance of its value in the event
of liquidation, as well as the capacity to draw upon that collateral promptly. The Commission
preliminarily believes, given the risks that a covered clearing agency’s size, operation, and
importance pose to the U.S. securities markets, that it is important to require policies and
procedures for a not-less-than-annual review of the sufficiency of its collateral haircuts and
concentration limits.174
e. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6): Margin
Generally, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) would require a covered clearing agency that
provides CCP services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to cover its credit exposures to its participants by establishing a
risk-based margin system that is monitored by management on an ongoing basis and regularly
reviewed, tested, and verified. 175

173

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5), infra Part VII.

174

See supra Part II.A.3 (discussing the Commission’s rationale for imposing varying
frequencies of review under certain policies and procedures requirements of the proposed rules).
175

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6), infra Part VII.

82

Rule 17Ad-22(b)(2) currently requires registered clearing agencies that provide CCP
services to use risk-based models and parameters to set margin requirements, and to review such
margin requirements and the risk-based models and parameters at least monthly, 176 and the
proposed rule would impose substantially the same requirements. 177 Rule 17Ad-22(b)(4) also
currently requires a registered clearing agency that provides CCP services to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide
for an annual model validation consisting of evaluating the performance of the clearing agency’s
margin models and the related parameters and assumptions associated with such models by a
qualified person who is free from influence from the persons responsible for the development or
operation of the models being validated.
The Commission notes that proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) is different from these existing
requirements under Rule 17Ad-22, as discussed below. The proposed requirements reflect more
specific recognition by the Commission of the importance margin plays in risk management by
covered clearing agencies. The Commission preliminarily believes that these requirements for a
covered clearing agency to periodically verify and modify margin requirements in light of
changing market conditions would be appropriate to mitigate the risks posed by a covered
clearing agency to financial markets in periods of financial stress considering the risks that its
size, operation, and importance pose to the U.S. securities markets.

176

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(b)(2).

177

Similar to Rule 17Ad-22(b)(2), proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi) would require a
covered clearing agency to conduct on at least a monthly basis a conforming sensitivity analysis
of its margin resources and its parameters and assumptions for backtesting. See infra Parts
II.B.4.e.vi and VII.

83

i. Active Management of Model Risk
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(i) would require a covered clearing agency that provides
CCP services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to result in a margin system that at a minimum considers, and produces
margin levels commensurate with, the risks and particular attributes of each relevant product,
portfolio, and market. 178 The complexity and product risk characteristics of the cleared product
and underlying instrument can influence the margin requirements necessary to manage the credit
exposures posed by a covered clearing agency’s participants. Additionally, the volume of
trading may also influence the margin requirements necessary to manage the credit exposures
proposed by a covered clearing agency’s participants. The Commission preliminarily believes
that expressly requiring policies and procedures regarding the active management of a covered
clearing agency’s margin system to account for those factors and differences would help ensure
the effectiveness of a covered clearing agency’s risk management practices.
ii. Collection of Margin
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(ii) would require a covered clearing agency that provides
CCP services to establish implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to ensure that the margin system would mark participant positions to market
and collect margin, including variation margin or equivalent charges if relevant, at least daily,
and include the authority and operational capacity to make intraday margin calls in defined
circumstances. 179 The Commission preliminarily believes that marking each participant’s
outstanding positions to current market prices is an important feature of an effective margin
178

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(i), infra Part VII.

179

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(ii), infra Part VII.

84

system because adverse price movements can rapidly increase a covered clearing agency’s
exposures to its participants. Rule 17Ad-22(b)(2) requires registered clearing agencies that
provide CCP services to calculate margin requirements daily. The Commission preliminarily
believes that requiring a covered clearing agency to have the authority and operational capacity
to make intraday margin calls in defined circumstances will benefit covered clearing agencies by
covering settlement risk created by intraday price movements. By being more specific with
respect to its expectations for collecting sufficient margin and having other liquid resources at its
disposal, the Commission expects that a covered clearing agency will be better able to organize
its practices accordingly, to limit its exposures to potential losses from defaults by clearing
members in normal market conditions considering the risks that its size, operation, and
importance pose to the U.S. securities markets. 180
iii. Ninety-Nine Percent Confidence Level
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(iii) would require a covered clearing agency that provides
CCP services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to calculate margin sufficient to cover its potential future exposure to
participants in the interval between the last margin collection and the close out of positions
following a participant default. 181 The Commission is proposing to add Rule 17Ad-22(a)(14) to
define “potential future exposure” to mean the maximum exposure estimated to occur at a future
point in time with an established single-tailed confidence level of at least 99% with respect to the
estimated distribution of future exposure. 182 The Commission preliminarily believes that a 99%
180

181

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(iii), infra Part VII.

182

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(14), infra Part VII.
85

confidence level is an appropriately conservative setting that is also consistent with the
international standard for bank capital requirements, which requires banks to measure market
risks at a 99% confidence interval when determining regulatory capital requirements. 183
The Commission preliminarily believes that, rather than establish specific criteria in
advance, it is more appropriate to address liquidation periods separately with respect to each
covered clearing agency through the Commission’s supervisory process under Sections 17A and
19 of the Exchange Act, 184 so that the length of the liquidation period can be appropriately
tailored to the characteristics of the products cleared by the covered clearing agency as financial
markets evolve.
iv. Price Data Source
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(iv) would require a covered clearing agency that provides
CCP services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to ensure that it uses reliable sources of timely price data and procedures
and sound valuation models for addressing circumstances in which pricing data are not readily
available or reliable. 185 The Commission preliminarily believes that a covered clearing agency
should use reliable sources of timely price data because its margin system needs such data to
183

See Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra note 5, at 66226 (describing the history of
usage for a 99% confidence interval). A 99% confidence level would represent one day of actual
trading losses that exceeded the results predicted by the model (as revealed by backtesting) for
every 100 days that trading occurred. See id. Requiring a covered clearing agency to have
policies and procedures with a higher or lower confidence level than that currently used by its
clearing members could potentially create incentives or disincentives for clearing members to
clear based on the statistical confidence level alone.
184

See supra Part I.A (discussing the regulatory framework under Section 17A of the
Exchange Act); supra note 96 (describing the requirements in Section 19(b) of the Exchange
Act).

86

operate with a high degree of accuracy and reliability, given the risks that the covered clearing
agency’s size, operation, and importance pose to the U.S. securities markets. 186 Based on its
supervisory experience, the Commission preliminarily believes that reliable data sources may
include the following features, among other things: (i) provision of data by the data source that is
accurate, complete, and timely; (ii) capability of the data source to provide broad data sets to the
covered clearing agency; and (iii) limited need for manual intervention by the clearing agency.
In some situations, price data may not be available or reliable, such as in instances where third
party data providers experience lapses in service or where limited liquidity otherwise makes
price discovery difficult. Establishing appropriate procedures and sound valuation models is a
useful step a covered clearing agency can take to help protect itself in such situations. The
Commission preliminarily believes, in selecting price data sources, a covered clearing agency
should consider the likelihood of the data being provided under a variety of market conditions
and not select price data sources based on their cost alone.
v. Method for Measuring Credit Exposure
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(v) would require a covered clearing agency that provides
CCP services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to ensure the use of an appropriate method for measuring credit exposure
that accounts for relevant product risk factors and portfolio effects across products. Measuring
such portfolio effects means a covered clearing agency may take into account certain netting
procedures or offsets through which credit exposure may be reduced in measuring credit
exposure, including the use of portfolio margining procedures across products where

186

Cf. PFMI Report, supra note 1, at 51 (discussing Principle 6, margin).

87

applicable. 187 The Commission preliminarily believes that this proposed requirement that
covered clearing agencies contemplate both product level and portfolio level effects when
considering and measuring their credit exposure is appropriate, given that the method for
measuring credit exposure will determine the accuracy of a covered clearing agency’s
measurements in practice.
vi. Backtesting and Sensitivity Analysis
Under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi), in addition to the requirement discussed above
in relation to monitoring by management on an ongoing basis, a covered clearing agency that
provides CCP services would be required to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to regularly review, test, and verify its risk-based
margin system by conducting backtests at least once each day and conducting a conforming
sensitivity analysis of its margin resources and its parameters and assumptions for backtesting at
least monthly, and consider modifications to ensure the backtesting practices are appropriate for
determining the adequacy of its margin resources. 188 The Commission preliminarily believes
that, since margin positions must be calculated at least daily, policies and procedures should also
provide for daily backtesting. The Commission preliminarily believes that requiring, on at least
a monthly basis, a conforming sensitivity analysis of margin resources and parameters and
assumptions for backtesting would appropriately balance cost concerns with the interest of
assuring that risk margin methodologies continue to reflect current conditions. The Commission
notes that, based on its supervisory experience, risk management committees of the board and
similar management committees of registered clearing agencies commonly meet on a monthly
187

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(v), infra Part VII.

188

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi), infra Part VII.

88

basis, and therefore the proposed requirement of a monthly sensitivity analysis would be
consistent with such meeting frequency.
Backtesting is a technique used to compare the potential losses forecasted by a model
with the actual losses that participants incurred, and is intended to reveal the accuracy of models.
Misspecified or miscalibrated models may lead to errors in decision making. The Commission is
proposing to require policies and procedures that provide for backtesting the margin models used
by covered clearing agencies to help uncover and address possible errors in model design,
misapplication of models, or errors in the inputs to, and assumptions underlying, margin models.
The Commission is also proposing to add Rule 17Ad-22(a)(1) to define “backtesting” to mean an
ex-post comparison of actual outcomes with expected outcomes derived from the use of margin
models. 189 Additionally, the Commission is proposing to add Rule 17Ad-22(a)(17) to define
“sensitivity analysis” to mean an analysis that involves analyzing the sensitivity of a model to its
assumptions, parameters, and inputs. 190 The Commission preliminarily understands that these
terms and definitions are commonly accepted among, and employed by, market participants. 191
The Commission is also proposing to add Rule 17Ad-22(a)(6) to define “conforming
sensitivity analysis” to mean a sensitivity analysis that considers the impact on the model of both
moderate and extreme changes in a wide range of inputs, parameters, and assumptions, including
correlations of price movements or returns if relevant, which reflect a variety of historical and

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(1), infra Part VII.

See, e.g., Alexander J. McNeil, Rüdiger Frey & Paul Embrechts, Quantitative Risk
Management: Concepts, Techniques, and Tools, at 35 (Princeton Univ. Press, 2005) (defining

of the underlying risk factors).

89

hypothetical market conditions and actual and hypothetical portfolios of proprietary positions
and, where applicable, customer positions. The Commission notes that “sensitivity analysis” is a
commonly understood term among industry participants, 192 and the Commission intends for the
proposed definition to ensure that the specified minimum requirements are met in performing
sensitivity analyses. Under the proposed definition, a conforming sensitivity analysis, when
performed by or on behalf of a covered clearing agency involved in activities with a more
complex risk profile, would consider the most volatile relevant periods, where practical, that
have been experienced by the markets served by the clearing agency. Under the proposed
definition, a conforming sensitivity analysis would also test the sensitivity of the model to
stressed market conditions, including the market conditions that may ensue after the default of a
member and other extreme but plausible conditions as defined in a covered clearing agency’s
risk policies. 193
Under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi), the policies and procedures for model review,
testing, and verification requirements would include policies and procedures for conducting a
conforming sensitivity analysis more frequently than monthly when the products cleared or
markets served display high volatility, become less liquid, or when the size or concentration of
positions held by participants increases or decreases significantly. 194 The proposed rule would
also require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to report the results of such conforming sensitivity
analysis to appropriate decision makers at the covered clearing agency, including its risk
192

management committee or board of directors, and use these results to evaluate the adequacy of
and adjust its margin methodology, model parameters, and any other relevant aspects of its credit
risk management policies and procedures. The Commission preliminary believes that the
requirement to report to appropriate decision makers at the covered clearing agency, including its
risk management committee or board of directors, is important to ensure that such risk
management requirements and compliance therewith are addressed at the most senior levels of
the governance framework of the covered clearing agency, commensurate with the importance of
said requirements.
By proposing the requirement for conducting a conforming sensitivity analysis, the
Commission expects that feedback generated by these analyses would improve the performance
of risk-based margin systems used by covered clearing agencies and therefore better ensure the
safe functioning of covered clearing agencies. Additionally, the Commission preliminarily
believes that conforming sensitivity analysis may help a covered clearing agency discover and
address shortcomings in its margin models that would not otherwise be revealed through
backtesting and is accordingly appropriate given the risks that its size, operation, and importance
pose to the U.S. securities markets. 195
vii. Annual Conforming Model Validation
Rule 17Ad-22(b)(4) currently requires a registered clearing agency that provides CCP
services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to provide for an annual model validation consisting of evaluating the
performance of the clearing agency’s margin models and the related parameters and assumptions
associated with such models by a qualified person who is free from influence from the persons
195

Cf. PFMI Report, supra note 1, at 56 (discussing Principle 6, margin).

91

responsible for the development or operation of the models being validated. Under proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vii), a covered clearing agency that provides CCP services would be
required to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to require not less than annually a conforming model validation of the
covered clearing agency’s margin system and related models. 196 As previously discussed, the
model validation would be required to include initial margin models, liquidity risk models, and
models used to generate clearing or guaranty fund requirements. Also, for a model validation to
be considered a conforming model validation under the proposed rule, it would have to be
performed by a qualified person who is free from influence from the persons responsible for the
development or operation of the models or policies being validated. 197
The Commission preliminarily believes the proposed approach of requiring policies and
procedures that subject a covered clearing agency’s models to review by such parties would be
relevant to ensuring the safe operation of covered clearing agencies and will help to ensure that
covered clearing agencies have the opportunity to benefit from the views of a qualified person
free from influence and incorporate alternative risk management methodologies into their models
as appropriate. The Commission preliminarily believes this is important for covered clearing
agencies given the risks that a covered clearing agency’s size, operation, and importance pose to
the U.S. securities markets.

196

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vii), infra Part VII; see also supra Part II.B.4.c.iv and

providing the definition text, respectively).

f. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7): Liquidity Risk
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
effectively measure, monitor, and manage the liquidity risk that arises in or is borne by it, by
meeting, at a minimum, the ten requirements specified below. 198
Liquidity risk describes the risk that an entity will be unable to meet financial obligations
on time due to an inability to deliver funds or securities in the form required though it may
possess sufficient financial resources in other forms. Although Rule 17Ad-22(d)(11) currently
requires, among other things, that a registered clearing agency establish, implement, maintain
and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to take timely action to contain
liquidity pressures and to continue to meet obligations in the event of a participant default, the
Commission does not currently have requirements for policies and procedures of registered
clearing agencies regarding the management of liquidity risk with the level of specificity
proposed in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7). Given the risks that a covered clearing agency’s size,
operation, and importance pose to the U.S. securities markets, the proposed requirements would
require a covered clearing agency to maintain sufficient liquidity resources to ensure they are
prepared to meet their payment obligations in order to facilitate the prompt and accurate
clearance and settlement of securities transactions.
i. Sufficient Liquid Resources
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) would require that a covered clearing agency’s policies
and procedures be reasonably designed to ensure that it maintains sufficient liquid resources in
all relevant currencies to effect same-day and, where appropriate, intraday and multiday
198

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7), infra Part VII; see also infra Parts II.B.4.f.i–x.

93

settlement of payment obligations with a high degree of confidence under a wide range of
potential stress scenarios that includes the default of the participant family that would generate
the largest aggregate payment obligation for it in extreme but plausible market conditions. As
noted above, maintaining sufficient liquidity resources helps ensure that a covered clearing
agency is prepared to meet its payment obligations in order to facilitate the prompt and accurate
clearance and settlement of securities transactions
ii. Qualifying Liquid Resources
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ii) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
it holds qualifying liquid resources sufficient to meet the minimum liquidity resource
requirement in each relevant currency for which the covered clearing agency has payment
obligations owed to clearing members. 199 The Commission is also proposing to add Rule 17Ad22(a)(15) to define “qualifying liquid resources.” 200 For any covered clearing agency, in each
relevant currency, qualifying liquid resources would include three types of assets:
•

cash held either at the central bank of issue or at creditworthy commercial
banks; 201

199

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ii), infra Part VII. In other words, if payment
obligations were denominated in U.S. dollars, the minimum liquidity resource requirement
would refer to a U.S. dollar amount.
200

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(15), infra Part VII.

201

The Commission preliminarily believes that the creditworthiness of commercial banks
should be considered by a covered clearing agency after considering its particular circumstances
and those of its members and the markets which it services. Accordingly, in complying with the
requirements of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) and proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(15), a covered
clearing agency’s policies and procedures for determining whether a commercial bank is
creditworthy may reflect such circumstances.

94

•

assets that are readily available and convertible into cash through either:
o prearranged funding arrangements without material adverse change
limitations, such as committed lines of credit, foreign exchange swaps,
and repurchase agreements, or
o other prearranged funding arrangements determined to be highly reliable
even in extreme but plausible market conditions by the board of directors
of the covered clearing agency following a review conducted for this
purpose not less than annually; and

•

other assets that are readily available and eligible for pledging to (or conducting
other appropriate forms of transactions with) a relevant central bank, if the
covered clearing agency has access to routine credit at such central bank. 202

The Commission preliminarily believes that this requirement is appropriate, given the
risks that its size, operation, and importance pose to the U.S. securities markets, and will help
ensure that a covered clearing agency has sufficient liquid resources, as determined by stress
testing, to effect settlement of payment obligations with a high degree of confidence under a
wide range of potential stress scenarios. 203 Furthermore, the Commission preliminarily believes
this requirement is appropriate given the specific circumstances of the U.S. securities markets.
202

See id. The Commission notes that such access to routine credit at a relevant central
bank and the collateral required by such central bank to be posted to secure a loan may be
determined at the discretion of the central bank, and accordingly the practical application of the
definition of qualifying liquid resources would be subject to variation based on those decisions.
The Commission preliminarily believes that inclusion of assets eligible for pledging to any
central bank, as opposed to only to a Federal Reserve Bank, is appropriate because, in practice, a
covered clearing agency may need access to liquid resources in currencies other than U.S.
dollars.
203

Cf. PFMI Report, supra note 1, at 60 (discussing Principle 7, liquidity risk).

95

U.S. securities markets are among the largest and most liquid in the world, and CCPs operating
in the United States are also among the largest in the world. 204 The resulting peak liquidity
demands of CCPs are therefore proportionately large on both an individual and an aggregate
basis, and the ability of CCPs to satisfy a requirement limiting qualifying liquid resources to
committed facilities could be constrained by the capacity of traditional liquidity sources in the
U.S. banking sector in certain circumstances. Therefore, the Commission is proposing to include
in the definition of qualifying liquid resources other prearranged funding arrangements
determined to be highly reliable even in extreme but plausible market conditions.
For similar reasons, the Commission preliminarily believes it is appropriate to include in
the definition of qualifying liquid resources assets that a central bank would permit a covered
clearing agency to use as collateral, to the extent such covered clearing agency has access to
routine credit at such central bank. 205 The Commission preliminarily notes that, although
covered clearing agencies do not currently have access to routine credit at Federal Reserve
Banks, potential registrants that could be determined to be covered clearing agencies in the
future may be operating in a jurisdiction where access to routine credit is provided to the
potential registrant by that jurisdiction’s central bank. 206
204

processed by U.S. clearing agencies).

See ICMA Eur. Repo Council, The Interconnectivity of Central and Commercial Bank
Money in the Clearing and Settlement of the European Repo Market, at 10–11 (Sept. 2011)
(indicating that access to central bank credit is important and may cause banks to use either
central bank settlement services or cash settlement banking services of a commercial bank,
depending on availability of, and the terms of, central bank credit).
206

See Peter Allsopp, Bruce Summers & John Veale, The Evolution of Real-Time Gross
Settlement: Access, Liquidity and Credit, and Pricing, at 15 (World Bank, Feb. 2009) (indicating
that CCPs in the Eurozone have access to central bank settlement account services and routine
credit).
96

With regard to assets convertible into cash, the Commission preliminarily notes that the
mere ownership of assets that a covered clearing agency may consider readily available and also
may consider readily convertible into cash, based on factors such as the historical volume of
trading in a particular market for such asset, may not be sufficient alone to make the assets count
towards qualifying liquid resources unless one of the above-referenced prearranged funding
arrangements is in place under which the covered clearing agency would receive cash in a timely
manner. The prearranged funding arrangements would be in place to cover any shortfall. The
Commission, however, preliminarily considers committed funding arrangements to be
reasonably capable of being established by covered clearing agencies in the relevant commercial
lending markets and other funding arrangements to be reasonably capable of being assessed for
reliability by the boards of directors of covered clearing agencies following consideration of the
relevant circumstances, and therefore preliminarily believes the standard to be sufficiently clear
to allow for it to be interpreted and applied in practice by covered clearing agencies. Further, the
Commission preliminarily notes that, in complying with proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7), covered
clearing agencies should consider the lower of the value of the assets capable of being pledged
and the amount of the commitment (or the equivalent availability under a highly reliable
prearranged facility) as the amount that counts towards qualifying liquid resources in the event
there is any expected difference between the two. 207 This may occur, for example, where the

207

The Commission notes that, based on the types of assets that may be considered
qualifying liquid resources, for purposes of complying with proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ii),
factors that may be relevant for a covered clearing agency to take into account include (i) the
portion of its default fund that is held as cash, (ii) the portion of its default fund that is held as
securities, (iii) the portion of any excess default fund contributions held as cash that could be
used by the covered clearing agency to meet liquidity needs, (iv) the portion of any excess
default fund contributions held as securities that could be used by the covered clearing agency to
meet liquidity needs, (v) the amount at any given time of securities or cash delivered by
97

terms of the arrangement provide for over-collateralization or where the covered clearing agency
lacks sufficient qualifying assets to make full use of an otherwise qualifying liquidity facility.
In defining the proposed requirements for qualifying liquid resources, the Commission
preliminarily believes that it would be appropriate to provide covered clearing agencies with the
flexibility to use highly reliable funding arrangements in addition to committed arrangements for
purposes of using assets other than cash to meet the proposed requirements of Rule 17Ad22(e)(7). 208 The Commission preliminarily believes that limiting the funding arrangements that
are included within the definition of qualifying liquid resources to committed funding
arrangements may not be necessary or appropriate in determining liquidity requirements for a
covered clearing agency operating in the U.S. securities markets and expanding the concept of
qualifying liquid resources to include other highly reliable funding arrangements is necessary
and appropriate to ensure the proper functioning of covered clearing agencies as required by the
Exchange Act.
For similar reasons, the Commission preliminarily believes it is appropriate to include in
the definition of qualifying liquid resources assets that a central bank would permit a covered
clearing agency to use as collateral. 209 The Commission notes that, although routine discount
window borrowing at a Federal Reserve Bank is currently not available to covered clearing
members that a covered clearing agency may be able to use to meet liquidity needs upon the
default of a member, and (vi) the borrowing limits under any committed funding arrangement.
208

Cf. PFMI Report, supra note 1, at 57 (discussing Principle 7, liquidity risk, at Key
Consideration 5).
209

The Commission also preliminarily notes that the term “central bank” in the proposed
definition of “qualifying liquid resources” is not limited to a Federal Reserve Bank, and
accordingly covered clearing agencies based in or operating outside of the United States that
have access to routine credit at other central banks would be able to take that into consideration
when assessing the amount of their qualifying liquid resources.

98

agencies, this provision will provide covered clearing agencies with additional flexibility in
meeting the liquidity requirements of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7), should routine credit at a
Federal Reserve Bank become available in the future. 210
iii. Access to Account Services at a Federal Reserve Bank or
Other Relevant Central Bank
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(iii) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
it uses accounts and services at a Federal Reserve Bank, pursuant to Section 806(a) of the
Clearing Supervision Act, 211 or other relevant central bank, when available and where
determined to be practical by the board of directors of the covered clearing agency, in order to
enhance its management of liquidity risk. 212 The Commission notes that the proposed rule
would not require using Federal Reserve Bank or other relevant central bank account services; it
would only require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to consider and determine when and in what
circumstances it chooses to do so, when the services are available and when considered to be
practical. The Commission preliminarily believes that covered clearing agencies should be
encouraged to actively consider using Federal Reserve Bank or other central bank accounts and
services, as this is a valuable new tool made available under the Clearing Supervision Act. 213
210

See infra Part IV.C.3.a.iv(4) (discussing the relative cost of central bank credit). Section
806(b) of the Clearing Supervision Act states that the Board may authorize a Federal Reserve
Bank to provide to a designated FMU discount and borrowing privileges only in unusual and
exigent circumstances, subject to certain conditions. See 12 U.S.C. 5465(b).

See 12 U.S.C. 5465(a).

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(iii), infra Part VII.

213

See Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra note 5, at 66268–69 & n.535.
99

The Commission preliminarily believes, however, that it should also permit the use of
commercial banks by covered clearing agencies holding cash as collateral or for other services
related to clearance and settlement activity, even when comparable services are available from a
central bank.
iv. Liquidity Providers
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(iv) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
it undertakes due diligence to confirm that it has a reasonable basis to believe each of its liquidity
providers, whether or not such liquidity provider is a clearing member, has sufficient information
to understand and manage the liquidity provider’s liquidity risks, and the capacity to perform as
required under its commitments to provide liquidity. 214
The Commission preliminarily intends for the term “due diligence” to have the same
meaning as what this term is commonly understood to mean by market participants.
Consequently, in order to comply with the requirements of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) and to
form a reasonable basis regarding a liquidity provider’s understanding and management of
liquidity risks and operational capacity, the Commission expects a covered clearing agency
would ordinarily not rely on representations of the liquidity provider to this effect and instead
conduct its own investigation into the liquidity provider’s business. A covered clearing agency
should consider implementing due diligence procedures that provide a sufficient basis for its
belief, given its business and the nature of its liquidity providers. Procedures for purposes of
forming a reasonable basis could include, for example, interviewing the liquidity provider’s staff
and reviewing both public and non-public documents that would allow the covered clearing
214

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(iv), infra Part VII.

100

agency to gather information about relevant factors, including but not limited to the strength of
the liquidity provider’s financial condition, its risk management capabilities, and its internal
controls.
The Commission preliminarily believes that proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(iv) is
appropriate because a covered clearing agency needs to soundly manage its relationships with
liquidity providers given the risks posed to the U.S. securities markets by its size, operation, and
importance. In addition, Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(iv) would reinforce proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(7)(ii) and the definition of qualifying liquid resources in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(15),
which contemplate potential reliance on liquidity providers where a covered clearing agency
would seek to use assets other than cash for purposes of complying with proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(7)(ii) and would need to transact with a liquidity provider to convert such assets into cash.
Should a committed or prearranged funding arrangement prove to be unreliable at the time a
covered clearing agency needs to utilize it because of liquidity problems at the lender itself, this
failure may trigger a liquidity problem at the covered clearing agency, which would raise
systemic risk concerns for the U.S. securities markets. These types of problems at a liquidity
provider, by indirectly affecting a covered clearing agency, could undermine the national system
for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.
v. Maintenance and Annual Testing of Liquidity Provider
Procedures and Operational Capacity
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(v) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
that the covered clearing agency maintains and, on at least an annual basis, 215 tests with each
215

The Commission preliminary believes that an annual cycle is appropriate for the reasons
described in Part II.A.3.
101

liquidity provider, to the extent practicable, its procedures and operational capacity for accessing
each type of relevant liquidity resource. 216
In addition, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(v) would reinforce proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(7)(ii) and the definition of qualifying liquid resources in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(15),
which contemplate potential reliance on liquidity providers where a covered clearing agency
would seek to use assets other than cash for purposes of complying with proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(7)(ii) and would need to transact with a liquidity provider to convert such assets into cash.
If procedures or operational capacity for accessing liquidity under committed or prearranged
funding arrangements fail to function as planned and in a timely manner, the covered clearing
agency may fail to meet its payment obligation, which would raise systemic risk concerns for the
U.S. markets and could undermine the national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and
settlement of securities transactions. Proper preparation for a liquidity shortfall scenario could
also promote members’ confidence in the ability of a covered clearing agency to perform its
obligations, which can mitigate the risk of contagion during stressed market conditions. The
Commission preliminarily believes this is important for covered clearing agencies given the risks
that a covered clearing agency’s size, operation, and importance pose to the U.S. securities
markets.
The Commission preliminarily believes that testing of access to liquidity resources could
include efforts by a covered clearing agency to verify that a liquidity provider is able to provide
the relevant liquidity resource in the manner intended under the terms of the funding
arrangement and without undue delay, such as, for example, promptly funding a draw on the
covered clearing agency’s credit facility. Testing procedures could include, for example, test
216

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(v), infra Part VII.

102

draws funded by the liquidity provider or tests of electronic connectivity between the covered
clearing agency and the liquidity provider. The Commission recognizes that testing with
liquidity providers may not always be practicable in the absence of committed liquidity
arrangements.
The Commission preliminarily believes the proposed requirement that testing of a
covered clearing agency’s access to liquidity be conducted at least annually with each liquidity
provider to be a reasonable step to ensure the objectives of the Exchange Act are achieved in
practice. The Commission understands such tests are routinely performed currently by certain
registered clearing agencies but are subject to variation due, in part, to the absence of a
regulatory requirement and the incremental time and attention needed to conduct the tests. The
Commission preliminarily anticipates the effect of the proposed rule will be to require the
development of more uniform liquidity testing practices by covered clearing agencies, and has
accordingly proposed to allow covered clearing agencies to assess the practicability of such
testing to provide them with reasonable flexibility to design the tests to suit the circumstances of
the covered clearing agency and its particular liquidity arrangements.
vi. Testing the Sufficiency of Liquid Resources
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi)(A) through (C) would require a covered clearing
agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to determine the amount and regularly test the sufficiency of the liquid resources held
for purposes of meeting the minimum liquid resource requirement of proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(7)(i) by (A) conducting a stress test of its liquidity resources at least once each day using

103

standard and predetermined parameters and assumptions; 217 (B) conducting a comprehensive
analysis of the existing stress testing scenarios, models, and underlying parameters and
assumptions used in evaluating liquidity needs and resources, and considering modifications to
ensure they are appropriate for determining the covered clearing agency’s identified liquidity
needs and resources in light of current and evolving market conditions at least once each
month; 218 and (C) conducting a comprehensive analysis of the existing stress testing scenarios,
models, and underlying parameters and assumptions used in evaluating liquidity needs and
resources more frequently when products cleared or markets served display high volatility or
become less liquid, when the size or concentration of positions held by participants increases
significantly, or in other circumstances described in the covered clearing agency’s policies and
procedures. 219 Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi)(D) would also require a covered clearing
agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to result in reporting the results of the analyses performed under proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(7)(vi)(B) and (C) to appropriate decision makers, including the risk management
committee or board of directors, at the covered clearing agency for use in evaluating the
adequacy of and adjusting its liquidity risk management framework.
The Commission preliminarily believes that proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi)(A)
through (D) would require a covered clearing agency to take reasonable steps to ensure the
adequacy of liquid resources in practice. Given the risks that a covered clearing agency’s size,

described in Part II.A.3.

104

operation, and importance pose to the U.S. securities markets, in addition to the potential
consequences to the U.S. financial system of a failure of a covered clearing agency, the
Commission preliminarily believes that requiring a covered clearing agency to devote additional
time and attention to testing the sufficiency of its liquid resources, relative to a registered
clearing agency generally, is appropriate. The Commission preliminarily believes that the
requirements in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi) are appropriate for testing the sufficiency of
liquid resources of covered clearing agencies because, in certain market conditions, such as
periods of high volatility or diminished liquidity, existing stress scenarios, models, or underlying
parameters may no longer be valid or appropriate. For example, covered clearing agencies may
have adjusted their financial resources models following the 2008 financial crisis to account for
larger debt, equity, and credit market shocks than would have been contemplated by those
models prior to the crisis. Accordingly, the Commission preliminarily believes that specific
policies and procedures specifying actions to be taken by covered clearing agencies to maintain
sufficient liquid resources would contribute to the safe functioning of the covered clearing
agency as required by the Exchange Act, 220 and that requiring periodic feedback and analysis on
the strength of liquidity risk management policies and procedures would improve the reliability
of those policies and procedures. The Commission also preliminarily believes that covered
clearing agencies should have the flexibility to use stress scenarios that are appropriately
calibrated to the markets in which they operate and that they can be revised over time as those
markets change. Proper preparation for a liquidity shortfall scenario could also promote a

220

See notes 54–56 and accompanying text; see also Parts I.A and B (generally discussing
the regulatory framework under Section 17A of the Exchange Act, as amended by the DoddFrank Act).

105

participant’s confidence in the ability of a covered clearing agency to perform its obligations,
which can mitigate the risk of undue disruption during stressed market conditions.
One of the appropriate methods of preparation by a covered clearing agency would be, in
the Commission’s preliminary view, the testing of the sufficiency of liquidity that it might need
under certain extreme but plausible parameters and assumptions. The Commission preliminarily
believes that conducting stress testing of liquidity would allow a covered clearing agency to
understand its level of resilience and adjust its operations accordingly to address areas of
inadequacy. The Commission preliminarily believes that by testing under extreme but plausible
scenarios, covered clearing agencies, and in particular those designated systemically important,
would be better prepared in the event that equivalent or similar scenarios actually occurred.
vii. Annual Conforming Model Validation
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vii) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to result in
performing an annual or more frequent conforming model validation of its liquidity risk
models. 221
The Commission preliminarily believes that such annual conforming model validation
would provide feedback on the performance of such liquidity risk models conducted by a
qualified person who is free from influence from the persons responsible for the development or
operation of the liquidity risk model, as contemplated by the definition of “conforming model
221

See proposed Rules 17Ad-22(a)(5) and (e)(7)(vii), infra Part VII. The Commission notes
that, in contrast to proposed Rules 17Ad-22(a)(5) and (e)(7)(vii), Rule 17Ad-22(b)(4) requires
only a model validation for margin models and does not specify the general elements of a model
validation. See supra note 167 and accompanying text.
In addition, the Commission preliminary believes that an annual cycle is appropriate for
the reasons described in Part II.A.3.

106

validation” in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(5), and incorporate alternative liquidity risk
management methodologies into their models as appropriate. Generally, the Commission
preliminarily considers that a person is free from influence when that person does not perform
functions associated with the clearing agency’s models (except as part of the annual model
validation) and does not report to a person who performs these functions. Preliminarily, the
Commission would not expect policies and procedures adopted pursuant to this proposed
requirement to require the clearing agency to detach model review from model development or
to maintain two separate quantitative teams. By reacting to such feedback, a covered clearing
agency may improve the functioning of its liquidity risk model. The Commission notes that
misspecified or miscalibrated liquidity risk models may lead to errors in decision making. The
Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed rule is appropriate following consideration
of the Exchange Act requirements discussed above 222 and the risks that a covered clearing
agency’s size, operation, and importance pose to the U.S. securities markets.
viii. Address Liquidity Shortfalls and Seek to Avoid
Unwinding Settlement
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(viii) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to address
foreseeable liquidity shortfalls that would not be covered by its liquid resources and seek to
avoid unwinding, revoking, or delaying the same-day settlement of payment obligations. 223 The
Commission preliminarily believes advance planning by a covered clearing agency with regard
222

See notes 54–56 and accompanying text; see also Parts I.A and B (generally discussing
the regulatory framework under Section 17A of the Exchange Act, as amended by the DoddFrank Act).
223

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(viii), infra Part VII.

107

to liquidity shortfalls could further enhance the covered clearing agency’s ability to perform its
payment obligations without delay and therefore support the ability of the clearing agency’s
participants to function without disruption. Foreseeable liquidity shortfalls could include, for
example, potential shortfalls that can be identified through testing a covered clearing agency’s
financial resources in a manner consistent with the policies and procedures requirements in
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi). The Commission recognizes that foreseeable liquidity
shortfalls could occur even when a covered clearing agency is in compliance with the proposed
requirements of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7), such as when, for example, the covered clearing agency is
unable to obtain liquidity pursuant to a prearranged funding arrangements that are uncommitted.
The Commission preliminarily believes the proposed requirement is appropriate for covered
clearing agencies given the risks that a covered clearing agency’s size, operation, and importance
pose to the U.S. securities markets and are consistent with the Exchange Act requirements
discussed above. 224
ix. Replenishment of Liquid Resources
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ix) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to describe
its process for replenishing any liquid resources that it may employ during a stress event. 225 The
Commission preliminarily believes a covered clearing agency should specifically contemplate
and memorialize its expectations for replenishing its financial resources when they are depleted
so that its ability to withstand repeated stress events, such as multiple market shocks or

the regulatory framework under Section 17A of the Exchange Act, as amended by the DoddFrank Act).

108

sequential defaults of multiple participants is clearly understood and reflected in its planning for
such events. The Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed requirement is
appropriate given the risks that a covered clearing agency’s size, operation, and importance pose
to the U.S. securities markets and is consistent with the Exchange Act requirements discussed
above. 226
x. Feasibility Analysis for “Cover Two”
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(x) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
it, at least once a year, evaluates the feasibility of maintaining sufficient liquid resources at a
minimum in all relevant currencies to effect same-day and, where appropriate, intraday and
multiday settlement of payment obligations with a high degree of confidence under a wide range
of foreseeable stress scenarios that includes, but is not limited to, the default of the two
participant families that would potentially cause the largest aggregate credit exposure for the
covered clearing agency in extreme but plausible market conditions if the covered clearing
agency provides CCP services and is either systemically important in multiple jurisdictions or a
clearing agency involved in activities with a more complex risk profile. 227
Rule 17Ad-22 does not currently provide specific requirements regarding the sizing and
testing of liquid resources or what types of financial resources would qualify as liquid.
However, the financial crisis of 2008 demonstrated the plausibility of the default of two large

the regulatory framework under Section 17A of the Exchange Act, as amended by the DoddFrank Act).
227

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(x), infra Part VII.

109

participants in a clearing agency over a brief period. 228 Accordingly, the Commission
preliminarily believes that its proposed approach is appropriate, given the need for more
stringent financial resource requirements for a covered clearing agency due to the risks that its
size, operation, and importance pose to the U.S. securities markets, and is consistent with the
Exchange Act requirements discussed above. 229 The Commission also believes that such
financial resources must be robust enough to accommodate the risks that are particular to each
market served and accordingly believes that a covered clearing agency should have the flexibility
to determine that different standards are appropriate in different markets, given the variable
nature and risks associated with the products cleared. 230
The Commission also preliminarily believes that, with greater emphasis being placed on
the role of CCPs in the financial system, the requirement in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(x) for
CCPs to review and consider the feasibility of meeting a higher liquidity risk management
standard is appropriate. While Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(x) would impose on certain covered clearing
agencies’ policies and procedures requirements to conduct an annual analysis of the feasibility of
maintaining “cover two” for liquidity, such covered clearing agencies would not be mandated to
adopt a “cover two” approach regarding liquidity risk management. The responsibility for such a

228

financial crisis of 2008 demonstrated the plausibility of the default of two large participants in a
clearing agency over a brief period).

the regulatory framework under Section 17A of the Exchange Act, as amended by the DoddFrank Act).

110

determination would remain with the boards of directors of covered clearing agencies following
a review of the information produced pursuant to proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(x).
The Commission preliminarily believes that it may be appropriate for a covered clearing
agency that provides CCP services to maintain liquidity coverage at levels higher than other
clearing agencies due to the heightened need to ensure the safe operation of covered clearing
agencies given their importance to the U.S. financial markets and the risks attributable to the
products they clear, but also that covered clearing agencies not subject to a “cover two”
requirement should have flexibility to evaluate the results of an annual feasibility study and to
make their own determinations as to whether a “cover two” approach to liquidity risk
management is necessary or appropriate. Furthermore, the Commission notes that if, following
completion of a feasibility study as contemplated in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(x), a covered
clearing agency makes a determination to move beyond “cover one” for liquidity that would be
required under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i), such covered clearing agency would not be
limited to sizing its qualifying liquid resources to cover the default of its two largest participant
families. In such case, the covered clearing agency could select a level of liquid resources
exceeding “cover one” that it deems most appropriate to the management of liquidity risk, which
could be either less than, equal to, or more than “cover two.”
Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission also preliminarily believes that, in
sizing its liquid resources to exceed “cover one,” a covered clearing agency may take into
account a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, (i) the business model of the covered
clearing agency, such as a utility model (which may be also referred to as an “at cost” model)
versus a for-profit model; (ii) diversification of its members’ business models as they impact the
members’ ability to supply liquidity to the covered clearing agency; (iii) concentration of

111

membership of the covered clearing agency, as the breadth of the membership may affect the
ability to draw liquidity from members; (iv) levels of usage of the covered clearing agency’s
services by members, as the concentration of demand on the covered clearing agency’s services
may bear upon potential liquidity needs; (v) the relative concentration of members’ market share
in the cleared products; (vi) the degree of alignment of interest between member ownership of
the covered clearing agency and the provision of funding to the covered clearing agency; and
(vii) the nature of, and risks associated with, the products cleared by the covered clearing agency.
g. Request for Comments
The Commission generally requests comments on all aspects of proposed Rules 17Ad22(e)(4), (5), (6), and (7) and proposed Rules 17Ad-22(a)(5), (6), (14), (15), (17), (18), and (19).
In particular, the Commission requests comments on the following issues:
•

Has the Commission provided sufficient guidance for Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) regarding the
meaning of the requirement to cover credit exposures to each participant “fully with a
high degree of confidence”? Has the Commission provided sufficient guidance regarding
the meaning of the requirement to maintain the financial resources required under
proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i) through (iii), as applicable, “in combined or separately
maintained clearing or guaranty funds”? Has the Commission provided sufficient
guidance regarding the use of “high volatility” and “become less liquid”? Why or why
not?

•

Is the Commission’s proposed requirement to cover credit exposures to each participant
“fully with a high degree of confidence” in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) appropriate?
Why or why not?

112

•

Should a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures provide for the measurement
of credit exposures more frequently than once per day? Why or why not? If so, how
frequently? What factors should be considered in determining the minimum frequency?

•

Should the Commission require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to
limit the assets it accepts as collateral to those with low credit, liquidity, and market
risks? Why or why not? Has the Commission provided sufficient guidance regarding
what constitutes “low credit, liquidity, and market risks”? Why or why not? If not, what
additional guidance should the Commission consider providing?

•

Should the Commission require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to
set and enforce appropriately conservative haircuts and concentration limits if the
covered clearing agency requires collateral to manage its or its participants’ credit
exposure? Why or why not? Has the Commission provided sufficient guidance on what
would constitute “appropriately conservative haircuts and concentration limits”? Why or
why not? Should the Commission adopt different standards? If so, what should those
standards be? Please explain in detail.

•

Are there any other requirements that should be included in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5)
to facilitate policies and procedures that address collateral? Why or why not? Are there
any requirements that should be removed? Why or why not? For instance, should the
Commission require policies and procedures that avoid concentrated holdings of any
particular kind of asset, such as those that would significantly impair the covered clearing
agency’s ability to liquidate such assets quickly without significant adverse price effects?
Should the Commission require policies and procedures that avoid concentrated holdings
under certain conditions?

113

•

Has the Commission provided sufficient guidance for Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) regarding
“margin levels commensurate with, the risks and particular attributes of each relevant
product, portfolio, and market”? Has the Commission provided sufficient guidance
regarding what a “reliable” source of timely price data is? Why or why not? Should the
Commission use a different standard? If so, what should that standard be? Please
explain in detail.

•

Is the requirement in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(i) regarding policies and procedures
reasonably designed to result in a margin system that at a minimum considers, and
produces margin levels commensurate with, the risks and particular attributes of each
relevant product, portfolio, and market appropriate? Why or why not?

•

Is the Commission’s approach in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(iii), requiring a covered
clearing agency’s policies and procedures to calculate margin sufficient to cover its
potential future exposure to participants, and the definition of “potential future exposure”
in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(14) to mean the “maximum exposure estimated to occur at
a future point in time with an established single-tailed confidence interval of at least 99%
with respect to the estimated distribution of future exposure” appropriate and sufficiently
clear? Why or why not?

•

Are there any other requirements that should be included in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)
to facilitate policies and procedures that address margin? Why or why not? For instance,
should the Commission require policies and procedures that address minimum liquidation
periods for products cleared by covered clearing agencies? Why or why not?

•

Has the Commission provided sufficient guidance for Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) regarding what
constitutes the “relevant currency” in holding qualifying liquid resources? Has the
114

Commission provided sufficient guidance regarding the “due diligence” with respect to
liquidity providers? Has the Commission provided sufficient guidance regarding what
constitutes “foreseeable” liquidity shortfalls? Why or why not?
•

Has the Commission provided sufficient guidance regarding what constitutes “regularly”
testing the sufficiency of liquid resources under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi)? Why
or why not? How frequently should a covered clearing agency test the sufficiency of its
liquid resources? Please explain.

•

Does the set of minimum requirements for policies and procedures under proposed Rule
17Ad-22(e)(7) sufficiently address liquidity risks? Why or why not? Should the
Commission adopt other requirements for addressing liquidity risk?

•

Is the proposed definition of “qualifying liquid resources” under Rule 17Ad-22(a)(15)
accurate, appropriate, and sufficiently clear given the requirements proposed? Why or
why not? Should all types of assets be subject to prearranged funding arrangements?
Should the proposed definition distinguish among them by asset, product type, or
liquidity? Are there alternative definitions the Commission should consider?

•

Is the meaning of the term “due diligence” under Rule 17Ad-22(7)(iv) sufficiently clear?
Why or why not?

•

Is the proposed definition of “systemically important in multiple jurisdictions” under
Rule 17Ad-22(a)(19) accurate, appropriate, and sufficiently clear given the requirements
proposed? Why or why not? Are there alternative definitions the Commission should
consider? How should the Commission assess another regulator or jurisdiction’s

115

determination that a covered clearing agency is systemically important in multiple
jurisdictions? Please explain. 231
•

Is the Commission’s proposed approach to “cover one” and “cover two” with respect to
credit risk appropriate? Should the Commission expand or contract the scope of covered
clearing agencies subject to a “cover two” requirement beyond those systemically
important in multiple jurisdictions or those involved in activities with a more complex
risk profile? Why or why not? Is the “cover two” approach, in which the covered
clearing agency must have policies and procedures requiring financial resources
sufficient to cover the default of the two participant families that would potentially cause
the largest aggregate credit exposure for the covered clearing agency in extreme but
plausible market conditions, appropriate? Should the Commission require policies and
procedures that provide for financial resources in excess of “cover two”? Why or why
not? If so, what would be the potential costs and benefits?

•

Is the Commission’s proposed approach to “cover one” and “cover two” with respect to
liquidity risk appropriate? Should the Commission require policies and procedures that
would provide for maintaining qualifying liquid resources equal to “cover two,” rather
than policies and procedures for a feasibility analysis with regard to “cover two”? Why
or why not?

•

Should the Commission include more specific requirements for policies and procedures
regarding stress testing that take into account, for example, relevant peak historic price
volatilities, shifts in other market factors such as price determinants and yield curves,

231

For additional requests for comments relating to proposed Commission determinations
under Rule 17Ab2-2, see Part II.C.4.

116

multiple defaults over various time horizons, simultaneous pressures in funding and asset
markets, or a spectrum of forward-looking stress scenarios in a variety of extreme but
plausible market conditions? Why or why not?
•

Is the requirement to require policies and procedures for reporting the results of a
conforming sensitivity analysis to the appropriate decision makers at the covered clearing
agency appropriate? Why or why not? Has the Commission sufficiently described who
the appropriate decision makers are? Please explain.

•

Do any of the proposed rules for financial risk management differentiate between
clearing agencies based on factors that should not be determinative, i.e. whether a
clearing agency is covered or uncovered, whether a clearing agency is systemically
important in multiple jurisdictions, involved in activities with a more complex risk
profile, or neither, and whether the clearing agency provides CCP services for securitybased swaps or other securities? Should the Commission consider other factors in
determining which clearing agencies should be subject to the proposed requirements?
5. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8): Settlement Finality
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,

implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to define
the point at which settlement is final no later than the end of the day on which the payment or
obligation is due and, where necessary or appropriate, intraday or in real time. 232
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(12) currently requires registered clearing agencies to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
that final settlement occurs no later than the end of the settlement day and to require that intraday
232

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8), infra Part VII.

117

or real-time finality be provided where necessary to reduce risks. 233 The Commission
preliminarily believes that defining settlement finality with specific reference to the day on
which the payment or obligation is due is appropriate because it better reflects the prevailing
international convention and accordingly helps to ensure that covered clearing agencies can
facilitate transactions globally. 234 Because of the similarity between proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(8) and Rule 17Ad-22(d)(12), the Commission anticipates that covered clearing agencies
may need to make only limited changes to update their policies and procedures to comply with
the proposed rule. 235
As with Rule 17Ad-22(d)(12), the Commission preliminarily believes that proposed Rule
17Ad-22(e)(8) is appropriate for covered clearing agencies, given the risks that a covered
clearing agency’s size, operation, and importance pose to the U.S. securities markets, for the
following reasons. First, the Commission preliminarily believes that defining the point at which
settlement is final may assist in the potential wind-down of a member in the event of insolvency
because it provides the covered clearing agency with information regarding the member’s open
positions. As an example, clearly defining the point at which settlement is final might include
establishing a cut-off point after which unsettled payments, transfer instructions, or other
obligations may not be revoked by a clearing member. Clearly defining the point at which
settlement is final could also provide to clearing members the necessary guidance from the
233

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(12); see also Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra
note 5, at 66255–56. Rule 17Ad-22(d)(12) focuses on achieving settlement on the particular
settlement date associated with the securities transaction or on an intraday or real-time basis (i.e.,
delivery versus payment) where those additional steps are necessary to reduce risks. See
Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra note 5, at 66256.
234

Cf. PFMI Report, supra note 1, at 64.

235

See supra Part II.A.4.

118

covered clearing agency to permit extensions for members with operating problems. For
example, the covered clearing agency may establish rules governing the approval and duration of
such extensions.
Second, the Commission preliminarily believes that a covered clearing agency’s policies
and procedures should require completing final settlement no later than the end of the day on
which the payment or obligation is due and that practices creating material uncertainty regarding
when final settlement will occur or permit the back-dating or “as of” dating of a transaction that
settles after the end of the day on which the payment or obligation is due would not comply with
this requirement. The Commission preliminarily believes that final settlement has the effect of
reducing the buildup of exposures between clearing members and the clearing agency, and final
settlement no later than the end of the day on which the payment or obligation is due limits these
exposures to the change in price between valuation and the end of the day. Accordingly,
deferring final settlement beyond the end of the day on which the payment or obligation is due
would allow these exposures to increase in size, thereby creating the potential for credit and
liquidity pressures for members and other market participants and potentially increasing systemic
risk.
Third, the Commission preliminarily believes that a covered clearing agency’s policies
and procedures, where necessary and appropriate, should require intraday or real-time finality in
order to reduce risk in circumstances where uncertainty regarding finality may impede the
clearing agency’s ability to facilitate prompt and accurate clearance and settlement, cause the
clearing agency’s members to fail to meet their obligations, or otherwise disrupt the securities
markets. The Commission preliminarily believes that such efforts would be necessary and
appropriate when, for example, the risks in question are material or when the opportunity to

119

require intraday or real-time finality is available and it would be reasonable, whether in
economic or other terms, to do so.
Request for Comments. The Commission generally requests comments on all aspects of
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8). In addition, the Commission requests comments on the following
specific issues:
•

Should the Commission require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to
define the point at which settlement is final no later than the end of the day on which the
payment or obligation is due, as in the proposed rule, or no later than the end of the
settlement date, as in existing Rule 17Ad-22(d)(12) applicable to registered clearing
agencies? Please explain.

•

What changes, if any, would be created by the proposed requirements for settlement
finality? Does the proposed rule affect certain, identifiable categories of market
participants differently than others, such as smaller entities or entities with limited
operations in the United States? If so, how?

•

Are there operational, legal, or regulatory impediments to intraday or real-time settlement
finality? Will the proposed standard make it harder for covered clearing agencies to
conduct certain types of business for which intraday or real-time finality may be
difficult? Are any additional rules or regulations needed to encourage intraday or realtime finality to reduce risks?

•

Are there circumstances when the requirements of intraday, real-time, or end-of-day
settlement finality proposed by the rule are not feasible or are not beneficial? If so, in
what circumstances?

120

6. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(9): Money Settlements
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(9) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
it considers conducting its money settlements in central bank money, where available and
determined to be practical by the board of directors of the covered clearing agency, and
minimizes and manages credit and liquidity risk arising from conducting its money settlements
in commercial bank money if central bank money is not used by the covered clearing agency. 236
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(9) contains requirements similar to those applied to registered clearing
agencies under Rule 17Ad-22(d)(5), but would additionally require a covered clearing agencies
to have policies and procedures for conducting money settlement in central bank money. 237
Because this is the only requirement that differs between proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(9) and
existing Rule 17Ad-22(d)(5), the Commission anticipates that covered clearing agencies may
need to make only limited changes to update their policies and procedures. 238

236

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(9), infra Part VII.

The Commission notes that, in some cases, for example, the use of central bank money
may not be practical, as direct access to all central bank accounts and payment services may not
be available to certain clearing agencies or members, and, for clearing agencies working under
different currencies, certain central bank accounts may not be operational at the time money
settlements occur.
237

In full, Rule 17Ad-22(d)(5) requires registered clearing agencies to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to employ money
settlement arrangements that eliminate or strictly limit the clearing agency’s settlement bank
risks, such as credit and liquidity risks from the use of banks to effect money settlements with its
participants. See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(5); see also Clearing Agency Standards Release,
supra note 5, at 66249–50.
238

See supra Part II.A.4 (noting the anticipated effect of the proposed rule) and infra Part
IV.B.3.c (describing the current practices at registered clearing agencies regarding settlement).

121

As with Rule 17Ad-22(d)(5), the Commission is proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e)(9) to
provide assurance that funds transfers are final when effected. 239 The Commission preliminarily
believes that the proposed requirement for policies and procedures for conducting money
settlement in central bank money would, in addition, help to further reduce the risk that financial
obligations related to the activities of a covered clearing agency are not settled in a timely
manner or discharged with finality because settlement in central bank money eliminates
settlement risk within the jurisdiction of the central bank. 240
The Commission notes that there are a number of arrangements that a covered clearing
agency could employ to meet the requirements under the proposed rule. For example, pursuant
to the Clearing Supervision Act, designated clearing agencies may obtain access to account
services at a Federal Reserve Bank. 241 The Commission preliminarily believes, however, that it
may be appropriate for covered clearing agencies to use commercial banks for conducting money
settlements even when comparable services are available from a central bank, and therefore the
proposed rule would permit a covered clearing agency to decide for itself which service to use in
those circumstances. If central bank account services are not available or used, then the covered
clearing agency should consider establishing criteria for use of commercial banks to effect
money settlements with its participants that address such commercial banks’ regulation and
supervision, creditworthiness, capitalization, access to liquidity, and operational reliability. In
239

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(9), infra Part VII.

240

See ICMA Eu. Repo Council, supra note 205, at 8–9 (noting that central bank money
“can be regarded as completely safe in the jurisdiction of the central bank” and listing a number
of advantages attributable to central bank money).
241

See 12 U.S.C. 5465(a); see also supra Parts II.B.4.d and II.B.4.f.iii (discussing access to
account services at a Federal Reserve Bank, or other relevant central bank, pursuant to proposed
Rules 17Ad-22(e)(5) and (7), respectively).

122

addition, a covered clearing agency also could seek to ensure that its legal agreements with such
commercial settlement banks support such risk-reduction principles and commercial settlement
bank criteria, including through provisions providing that funds transfers to the covered clearing
agency are final when effected.
The proposed rule would also permit a covered clearing agency to use multiple settlement
banks in order to monitor and manage concentration of payments among its commercial
settlement banks. In those circumstances, policies and procedures would be required to consider
the degree to which concentration of a covered clearing agency’s exposure to a commercial
settlement bank is affected or increased by multiple relationships with the settlement bank,
including (i) where the settlement bank is also a participant in the covered clearing agency, or (ii)
where the settlement bank provides back-up liquidity resources to the covered clearing agency.
Request for Comments. The Commission generally requests comments on all aspects of
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(9). In addition, the Commission requests comments on the following
specific issues:
•

Should the Commission require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to
conduct its money settlements in central bank money, where available and determined to
be practical by the board of directors of the covered clearing agency? Why or why not?
Has the Commission provided sufficient guidance on what would be “practical” in this
context? Why or why not?

•

Should the Commission require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to
minimize and manage credit and liquidity risk arising from conducting its money
settlements in commercial bank money if central bank money is not used by the covered
clearing agency? Why or why not?

123

•

Are there other requirements that the Commission should apply to money settlements,
such as requiring policies and procedures with respect to the minimum number of banks
that a covered clearing agency may use to effect money settlements with its participants
in order to avoid reliance on a small number of such banks? Should the Commission
require policies and procedures specifying the characteristics of financial institutions that
may be used by clearing agencies for settlement purposes? Why or why not?

•

Should the Commission require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to
establish and monitor adherence to criteria based on high standards for the covered
clearing agency’s settlement banks? For example, should the Commission require that
criteria to consider the applicable regulatory and supervisory frameworks,
creditworthiness, capitalization, access to liquidity, and operational reliability? Why or
why not?

•

Should the Commission require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to
monitor and manage the concentration of credit and liquidity exposures to its commercial
settlement banks? Why or why not?

•

Should rules for money settlements established by the Commission be uniform for all
types of money settlements, or are there circumstances in which it would be appropriate
for covered clearing agencies to accept a higher degree of money settlement risk, such as
when transacting in certain product categories or with certain types of customers? Why
or why not?
7. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(10): Physical Delivery Risks
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(10) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,

implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to

124

establish and maintain transparent written standards that state its obligations with respect to the
delivery of physical instruments and operational practices that identify, monitor, and manage the
risk associated with such physical deliveries. 242
The proposed requirement is similar to the requirement applicable to registered clearing
agencies in Rule 17Ad-22(d)(15), but the proposed rule also requires that such standards be
transparent at covered clearing agencies. 243 Considering the risks that a covered clearing
agency’s size, operation, and importance pose to the U.S. securities markets, the Commission
preliminarily believes that the proposed new requirement for transparent standards is appropriate.
Physical delivery may require the involvement of multiple parties, including the clearing agency
itself, its members, customers, custodians, and transfer agents, and failures to deliver physical
instruments can threaten the integrity and smooth functioning of the financial system. By
requiring policies and procedures to include transparent written standards at covered clearing
agencies, the proposed rule helps to mitigate physical delivery risks.
The Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed requirement for a covered
clearing agency to maintain transparent written standards that state its obligations with respect to
physical deliveries would help to ensure that members and their customers have information that
is likely to enhance their understanding of their rights and responsibilities with respect to using

242

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(10), infra Part VII.

243

Registered clearing agencies are currently subject to existing Rule 17Ad-22(d)(15),
which requires them to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to state to its participants the clearing agency’s obligations with
respect to physical deliveries and identify and manage the risks from these obligations. See 17
CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(15); see also Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra note 5, at 66257–
58.

125

the clearance and settlement services of a covered clearing agency. 244 The Commission
preliminarily believes that such information, when available to members and their customers
through the covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures, would promote a shared
understanding regarding physical delivery practices between the covered clearing agency and its
members. The requirement for policies and procedures with transparent written standards may
further facilitate prompt and accurate clearance and settlement and mitigate physical delivery
risks.
The Commission acknowledges that practices regarding physical delivery vary based on
the types of assets that a covered clearing agency settles. 245 A covered clearing agency would be
required, however, to state clearly which asset classes it accepts for physical delivery and the
procedures surrounding the delivery of each. The Commission notes that there are a number of
arrangements that a covered clearing agency could employ pursuant to the requirements of the
proposed rule. For example, if a covered clearing agency takes physical delivery of securities
from its members in return for payments of cash, then it should inform its members of the extent
244

The Commission is proposing additional requirements regarding disclosures to
participants and disclosure generally, pursuant to proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(1) (legal risk),
(e)(2) (governance), and (e)(23) (disclosure of rules, key procedures, and market data). See infra
Parts II.B.1, 2, and 20, respectively.
245

The proposed rule would provide covered clearing agencies with flexibility to achieve
clear and transparent standards but would necessarily require an approach that provides sufficient
notice to its participants regarding the covered clearing agency’s obligations. See infra Parts
II.B.20 and VII (discussing a covered clearing agency’s disclosure obligations pursuant to
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) and providing proposed rule text).
The Commission notes that CDS employing the contractual term “physical delivery” or
similar language, which upon an event of default are settled by “physical delivery” of the
instrument (as such terms are used in the agreement) to the protection seller by the protection
buyer are not within the scope of this rule merely because of such contractual terminology where
they are not delivered in paper form (but are delivered through book entry or electronic transfer).

126

of the clearing agency’s obligations to make payment. The Commission envisions that one
possible approach a covered clearing agency could take in fulfillment of the proposed
requirement would be to employ policies and procedures that clearly state any obligations it
incurs to members for losses incurred in the delivery process. In addition, its policies and
procedures could clearly state rules or obligations regarding definitions for acceptable physical
instruments, the location of delivery sites, rules for storage and warehouse operations, and the
timing of delivery.
The proposed rule would also require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify, monitor,
and manage the risks that arise in connection with their obligations for physical deliveries. 246
The Commission notes that this is similar to the requirement for a registered clearing agency’s
policies and procedures to identify and manage the risks from its obligations in Rule 17Ad22(d)(15). 247 As with Rule 17Ad-22(d)(15), the Commission believes that requiring a clearing
agency’s policies and procedures to identify, monitor, and manage these risks facilitates its
ability to deal preemptively with potential issues with physical delivery, in line with Exchange
Act requirements to facilitate prompt and accurate clearance and settlement and the safeguarding
of assets. 248
The Commission preliminarily notes that certain risks associated with physical deliveries
could stem from operational limitations with respect to assuring receipt of and processing of
physical deliveries. Other operational risks may relate to personnel, which can be mitigated by
246

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(10), infra Part VII.

127

having policies and procedures designed to review and assess the qualifications of potential
employees, including reference and background checks and employee training, among other
things. Further operational risks include theft, loss, counterfeiting, and deterioration of or
damage to assets. 249 Insurance coverage may be one way to mitigate such risk of theft, loss,
counterfeiting, fraud, and damage to assets. Other appropriate methods to identify, monitor, and
manage risks related to delivery and storage of physical assets may include ensuring records of
physical assets received and held accurately reflect holdings and that employee duties for such
recordkeeping for and holding of physical assets are separated.
Request for Comments. The Commission generally requests comments on all aspects of
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(10). In addition, the Commission requests comments on the
following specific issue:
•

Should the Commission require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to
establish and maintain transparent written standards that state its obligations with respect
to the delivery of physical instruments? Why or why not? Are there physical delivery
obligations that a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures should not be
required to state through transparent written standards? If so, please explain.
8. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11): Central Securities Depositories
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11) would apply only to a covered clearing agency providing

CSD services (hereinafter a “covered CSD” in this part). 250 Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11)(i)
249

In addition, the Commission is proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17) to establish minimum
requirements for operational risk management. See infra Parts IV.C.3.a.xii and VII (further
discussing the proposed requirements and providing proposed rule text).
250

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(3), infra Part VII (defining “central securities depository
services”). In the United States, DTC is currently the only registered clearing agency that
provides CSD services.
128

would require a covered CSD to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to maintain securities in an immobilized or dematerialized form
for their transfer by book entry, ensure the integrity of securities issues, and minimize and
manage the risks associated with the safekeeping and transfer of securities. 251 While Rule 17Ad22(d)(10) similarly requires registered clearing agencies that provide CSD services to have
policies and procedures reasonably designed to immobilize or dematerialize securities
certificates and transfer them by book entry to the greatest extent possible, 252 proposed Rule
17Ad-22(e)(11) would also require a covered CSD to have policies and procedures that ensure
the integrity of securities issues, and minimize and manage the risks associated with the
safekeeping and transfer of securities. The Commission preliminarily believes these additional
requirements are appropriate for covered CSDs given the risks that a covered CSD’s size,
operation, and importance pose to the U.S. securities markets.
Like existing Rule 17Ad-22(d)(10), proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11)(i) would, among
other things, require a covered CSD to have policies and procedures to maintain securities in an
immobilized or dematerialized form for transfer by book entry. 253 The Commission
This definition is currently codified at 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(a)(2). See supra note 61
(noting that 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(a) is being revised to incorporate additional terms).
251

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11), infra Part VII.

252

In full, existing Rule 17Ad-22(d)(10) requires registered clearing agencies that provide
CSD services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to immobilize or dematerialize securities certificates and transfer them by
book entry to the greatest extent possible. See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(10); see also Clearing
Agency Standards Release, supra note 5, at 66253–54.
253

Immobilization refers to any circumstance where an investor does not receive a physical
certificate upon the purchase of shares or is required to physically deliver a certificate upon the
sale of shares. Dematerialization is the process of eliminating physical certificates as a record of
security ownership.
129

preliminarily believes this approach would continue to promote a reduction in securities transfer
processing costs, as well as the risks associated with securities settlement and custody, such as
destruction or theft, by removing the need to hold and transfer many, if not most, physical
certificates. 254 In addition, the Commission preliminarily believes the requirement would
continue to promote prompt and efficient settlement processes through the potential for increased
automation and may also help reduce the risk of error and delays in securities processing. The
Commission also preliminarily believes the proposed rule would, like Rule 17Ad-22(d)(10),
further the objectives in Section 17A of the Exchange Act requiring the Commission to end the
physical movement of securities certificates in connection with settlement among brokers and
dealers. 255 Further, the Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed rule, by continuing
to facilitate book-entry transfer, may also continue to facilitate the use of exchange-of-value

The Commission notes that, while registered clearing agencies that provide CSD services
are already subject to this requirement under Rule 17Ad-22(d)(10), the Commission is proposing
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(10) as part of a comprehensive set of rules for regulating covered clearing
agencies. Because Rule 17Ad-22(d)(10) already contains this requirement, however, the
Commission anticipates that covered clearing agencies may need to make only limited changes
to update their policies and procedures to comply with this requirement under the proposed rule.
See supra Part II.A.4.
254

By concentrating the location of physical securities in a CSD, clearing agencies are able
to achieve efficiencies in clearance and settlement by streamlining transfer. Virtually all mutual
fund securities, government securities, options, and municipal bonds in the United States are
dematerialized and most of the equity and corporate bonds in the U.S. market are either
immobilized or dematerialized. While the U.S. markets have made great strides in achieving
immobilization and dematerialization for institutional and broker-to-broker transactions, many
industry representatives believe that the small percentage of securities held in certificated form
imposes unnecessary risk and expense to the industry and to investors. See Exchange Act
Release No. 34-49405 (Mar. 11, 2004), 69 FR 12922, 12933 (Mar. 18, 2004).
255

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(e).
130

settlement systems, which help to reduce settlement risk pursuant to proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(12). 256
As with Rule 17Ad-22(d)(10), the Commission notes that the proposed requirement for
policies and procedures to cover maintaining securities in an immobilized form is not intended to
prohibit a covered CSD from holding physical securities certificates on behalf of its members for
purposes other than to facilitate immobilization where such securities currently continue to exist
in paper form. In this regard, the Commission believes it would be useful to describe three
relevant features of the current U.S. market. First, in order for securities to be offered and sold
publicly, the offer or sale of the securities generally must be registered with the Commission or
subject to an exemption from registration. 257 Securities sold in an exempt transaction may be
subject to restrictions. For example, securities acquired from the issuer in a transaction not
involving any public offering are restricted securities, 258 are subject to restrictions on resale,
often bear legends that discuss such restrictions, and often are in paper certificate form in current
market practice. The restrictions on such securities may make more complex the immobilization
or ultimate dematerialization of these paper certificates. For instance, registered CSDs in the
United States currently do not provide book-entry transfer for all restricted securities. 259
256

See infra Parts II.B.9 (discussing proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12) for exchange-of-value
settlement systems) and IV.C.3.a.vi (noting that the economic effect of book-entry transfer in a
delivery versus payment system is to allow securities to be credited to an account immediately
upon debiting the account for the payment amount and that it thereby helps reduce trade
failures).
257

See 15 U.S.C. 77e.

258

See 17 CFR 230.144(a)(3).

259

See 17 CFR 230.144A; see also Exchange Act Release No. 34-59384 (Feb. 11, 2009), 74

available at http://www.dtcc.com/.
131

Second, U.S. law generally does not provide for a federal corporate law or corporate
charter. Instead, states currently permit corporations to issue stock certificates to registered
owners. While the market in the United States has made advances in immobilizing and
dematerializing securities, no federal statute or regulation prohibits the issuance of paper
certificates to registered owners of a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act or
companies that file periodic reports with the Commission. Accordingly, the Commission’s rules
do not prohibit, and in some respects contemplate, the issuance of securities certificates. 260 As a
result, some registered owners may hold securities in paper certificate form.
Third, some broker-dealers in the United States no longer operate vaults in which to hold
securities certificates registered in the names of their customers where such customers seek a
third-party to physically hold their certificates. In such cases, broker-dealers (without an inhouse vault) may utilize the vault services of the CSD of which they are a participant in order to
be able to offer such custody service to their customers.
The Commission also notes that the proposed rule is not intended to alter the following
practices in the U.S. market. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11) would not prohibit a covered CSD
from providing custody-only services for purposes not intended to promote immobilization to
facilitate street name transfer but solely to hold these securities for third parties. Likewise,
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11) would not prohibit a covered CSD from holding American
depositary shares in custody. 261
260

In the absence of a federal or state requirement, an issuer could limit its issuance of
certain types of securities to book-entry only form through its own charter, bylaws, or policies.

261

Issuers of American depositary receipts (“ADRs”), whether in programs sponsored or
unsponsored by a foreign issuer, may hold the underlying shares of the foreign issuer (which
may be in paper certificate form and are commonly referred to as American depositary shares) to
which the ADRs relate in the ultimate custody of a covered CSD.
132

In addition, the Commission preliminarily believes that the policies and procedures of a
covered CSD should be required to ensure the integrity of securities issues and minimize and
manage the risks associated with the safekeeping and transfer of securities, given the risks that a
covered CSD’s size, operation, and importance pose to the U.S. securities markets, for the
following reasons. First, the preservation of the rights of issuers and holders of securities is
necessary for the orderly functioning of the securities markets. 262 The integrity of a securities
issue can be undermined, for instance, if a covered CSD does not prohibit overdrafts and debit
balances in securities accounts, which can create unauthorized issuances of securities that
undermine the integrity of the covered CSD’s services. Second, minimizing and managing the
risks associated with the safekeeping and transfer of securities promotes risk management
policies and procedures that address custody risk. 263
In addition, the Commission is proposing the requirements described below. Although
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(10) does not include similar requirements, the Commission anticipates that,
based on the current practices of registered CSDs in the United States, a registered CSD may
need to make only limited changes to update its policies and procedures to comply with the
below proposed requirements. 264

262

The Commission is proposing additional requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11) to
further address the integrity of securities issues. See infra Part II.B.8.a.
263

The Commission is proposing additional requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11) to
further address custody risk at covered CSDs. See infra Part II.B.8.c.
264

See infra Parts IV.B.3.d.i (discussing the current practices of registered CSDs in the
United States) and IV.C.3.a.vi (discussing the anticipated economic effect of the proposed rule).

133

a. Controls to Safeguard the Rights of Securities Issuers and Holders
and Prevent the Unauthorized Creation or Deletion of
Securities
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11)(ii) would require a covered CSD to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to implement internal
auditing and other controls to safeguard the rights of securities issuers and holders and prevent
the unauthorized creation or deletion of securities.
The Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed requirement to safeguard the
rights of issuers and holders is appropriate because, while issuers and holders may not be
participants in a covered CSD, they access its services through covered CSD immobilization or
dematerialization of securities and thus a failure to safeguard securities by the CSD may
adversely affect issuers or holders, including for example by creating legal problems related to
unauthorized issuance of securities, dilution of a holder’s ownership interest or the holder’s
claim on the security as beneficial owner where holding indirectly through a member of the
CSD.
As noted above, the preservation of the rights of securities issuers and holders is
necessary for the orderly functioning of the securities markets. Accordingly, the Commission
preliminarily believes the proposed rule is appropriate to help ensure that a covered clearing
agency can verify that its records are accurate and provide a complete accounting of its securities
issues.
b. Periodic and At Least Daily Reconciliation of Securities Maintained
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11)(ii) would require a covered CSD to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to conduct periodic

134

and at least daily reconciliation of securities issues it maintains. 265 The Commission
preliminarily believes that the proposed requirement to reconcile on a daily basis securities
maintained would (i) support the safeguarding of securities because, through such internal
control procedures, accurate record-keeping is promoted and thereby safe, accurate, and effective
clearing and settlement is also promoted, and (ii) further benefit issuers and holders, as discussed
above, by potentially preventing unauthorized issuance of securities, dilution of a holder’s
positions, or the holder’s claim on the security as beneficial owner where holding indirectly
through a member of the CSD.
The Commission notes that CSDs in the United States currently do not provide registrar
or transfer agent services to record name owners of securities. CSD services that facilitate bookentry transfer are limited to holding jumbo/global certificates in custody or, through subcustodian relationships with the transfer agent for a particular issuer via the Fast Automated
Securities Transfer (“FAST”) system, which is used to maintain jumbo/global record ownership
position balances of the CSD’s holdings in a particular issue. 266 In both cases, custody or subcustody facilitates book-entry transfer for ultimate beneficial owners as the CSD credits and
debits the accounts of its members, which then maintain records of ownership and send account
statements to their customers that are the ultimate beneficial owners. Since the registrar
maintaining the security holder list for an issuer is not the CSD, the daily reconciliation
265

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11), infra Part VII. The Commission preliminary
believes that daily reconciliation is appropriate for the reasons described in Part II.A.3.
266

For a description of DTC’s rules relating to FAST, see Exchange Act Release Nos. 3464191 (Apr. 5, 2011), 76 FR 20061 (Apr. 11, 2011); 34-61800 (Mar. 30, 2010), 75 FR 17196
(Apr. 5, 2010); 34-60196 (Jun. 30, 2009), 74 FR 33496 (Jul. 13, 2009); 34-46956 (Dec. 2, 2002),
67 FR 77115 (Dec. 16, 2002); 34-31941 (Mar. 3, 1993); 34-21401 (Oct. 16, 1984); 34-14997
(Jul. 26, 1978); and 34-13342 (Mar. 8, 1977).

135

requirement applicable to a covered CSD reconciling CSD ownership positions (that facilitate
book-entry transfer for ultimate beneficial owners) against the record of such CSD ownership
positions on the security holder list could not be done solely in-house but would require the CSD
to coordinate with the registrar maintaining the security holder list for each issue that has been
immobilized. 267
c. Protect Assets against Custody Risk
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11)(iii) would require a covered CSD to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to protect assets
against custody risk through appropriate rules and procedures consistent with relevant laws,
rules, and regulations in jurisdictions where it operates. 268 The Commission preliminarily
believes the proposed requirement to address custody risk is appropriate because a covered CSD
faces risks of negligence, misuse of assets, fraud, record-keeping or administrative failures, loss,
destruction, damage, natural disaster, and theft or other crime regarding assets held in custody.
The Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed rule would further support Section
17A(b)(3)(F) of the Exchange Act, which requires the rules of a clearing agency to assure the
safeguarding of securities and funds that are in the custody or control of the clearing agency or
for which it is responsible. 269
267

Commonly, the entity performing the registrar and transfer services for an issue would be
the same. Both functions are functions that place an entity within the definition of “transfer
agent” pursuant to Section 3(a)(25) of the Exchange Act and the related regulatory regime for
transfer agents. See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(25).

268

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11), infra Part VII. For example, in the United States,
additional safekeeping requirements may apply under state law. See, e.g., N.Y. UCC Law 8-504
(requires securities intermediaries, including clearing corporations, to exercise due care in
accordance with reasonable commercial standards to obtain and maintain the financial asset).
269

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)(F).
136

Such custody risk may be related to physical delivery risk, which proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(10) would require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to identify, monitor,
and manage. 270 Operational risks may also be implicated, including those relating to personnel,
which can be mitigated by having policies and procedures designed to review and assess the
qualifications of potential employees, including reference and background checks and employee
training, among other things. Additional operational risks include theft, loss, counterfeiting, and
deterioration of or damage to assets. 271 Insurance coverage may be one way to mitigate such risk
of theft, loss, counterfeiting, fraud, and damage to assets. Other appropriate methods to monitor
and manage custody risks may include ensuring records of securities held in custody accurately
reflect holdings and that employee duties for such recordkeeping for and holding of securities are
separated. 272
The Commission also preliminarily notes that increased dematerialization would not
eliminate the applicability of the requirement to protect assets against custody risk. When held in
electronic custody through accounting entries, such as through electronic sub-custody of the
CSD global/jumbo record ownership position with a transfer agent via FAST, assets may
nevertheless remain subject to operational risks and may be subject to variations of such risks,
such as hacking or digital piracy, that are different from those risks faced with respect to paper
certificates.
270

See supra Part II.B.7 and infra Part VII (discussing the requirements under proposed Rule
17Ad-22(e)(10) and providing proposed rule text).
271

The Commission is also proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17) to establish minimum standards
for operational risk management. See infra Parts II.B.14 and VII.

272

The Commission is also proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16) to establish minimum standards
for custody and investment risk. See infra Parts II.B.13 and VII.

137

d. Request for Comments
The Commission generally requests comments on all aspects of proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(11). In addition, the Commission requests comments on the following specific issues:
•

Should the Commission require a covered CSD’s policies and procedures to maintain
securities in an immobilized or dematerialized form for their transfer by book entry?
Why or why not? Are there any circumstances under which this would be inappropriate?
Please explain.

•

Should the Commission require a covered CSD’s policies and procedures to ensure the
integrity of securities issues? Why or why not?

•

Should the Commission require a covered CSD’s policies and procedures to protect
assets against custody risk through appropriate rules and procedures consistent with
relevant laws, rules, and regulations in jurisdictions where it operates? Why or why not?

•

Are there any other requirements that should be included in the proposed rule to promote
sound practices at covered CSDs? For instance, should the Commission require a
covered CSD’s policies and procedures to include provisions to identify, measure,
monitor, and manage its risks from other activities that it may perform? Should the
Commission require a covered CSD’s policies and procedures to employ a robust system
that ensures segregation between the CSD’s own assets and the securities of its
participants and segregation among the securities of participants? Why or why not?
9. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12): Exchange-of-Value Settlement Systems
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12) would apply to transactions cleared by a covered clearing

138

agency that involve the settlement of two linked obligations. 273 The proposed rule would require
a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to eliminate principal risk by conditioning the final settlement of
one obligation upon the final settlement of the other, regardless of whether the covered clearing
agency settles on a gross or net basis and when finality occurs. 274 The Commission preliminarily
believes that the proposed rule is appropriate to help reduce the potential that delivery of a
security is not appropriately matched with payment for the security, thereby impairing a covered
clearing agency’s ability to facilitate prompt and accurate clearance and settlement.
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(13) similarly requires that a registered clearing agency’s policies and
procedures be reasonably designed to eliminate principal risk by linking securities transfers to
funds transfers in a way that achieves delivery versus payment (“DVP”), 275 though it does not
specify that settlement should occur regardless of whether the clearing agency settles on a gross
or net basis and when finality occurs. Because this is the only provision that differs between
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12) and existing Rule 17Ad-22(d)(13), the Commission anticipates
that covered clearing agencies may need to make only limited changes to update their policies
and procedures. 276
The Commission notes that ensuring settlement finality only when settlement of the
corresponding obligation is final—regardless of whether a covered clearing agency settles on a

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12), infra Part VII.

note 5, at 66256.

139

gross or net basis—may require corresponding policies and procedures that address legal,
contractual, operational, and other risks. 277 Given the risks that the size, operation, and
importance of covered clearing agencies pose to the U.S. securities markets, the Commission
preliminarily believes that this requirement is appropriate for covered clearing agencies.
Market confidence, in addition to public confidence more generally, hinges in large part
on the dependability and promptness of the clearing and settlement systems underlying a given
market. If CCPs are unable to promptly and fully give to clearing members access to funds due,
they and other market participants may lose confidence in the settlement process. 278
As under Rule 17Ad-22(d)(13), a covered clearing agency can link securities transfers to
funds transfers and mitigate principal risk in connection with settlement through DVP settlement
mechanisms. DVP is achieved in the settlement process when the mechanisms facilitating
settlement ensure that delivery occurs only if payment occurs. 279 DVP eliminates the risk that a
party would lose some or its entire principal because securities were delivered without payments
being confirmed. The Commission notes that DVP settlement mechanisms are prevalent among
registered clearing agencies because they eliminate principal risk and reduce the settlement risk
277

See supra Parts II.B.1–3 and infra Parts II.B.14 and VII (discussing proposed rules
establishing minimum standards for legal risk and governance arrangements, requiring a
comprehensive risk management framework, requiring minimum standards for operational risk
management, and providing proposed rule text in each case, respectively).
278

Settlement: The Next Frontier, Remarks before the Symposium on Risk Reduction in Payments,
Clearance and Settlement Systems (Jan. 26, 1996), available at

279

See BIS, Delivery Versus Payment in Securities Settlement Systems (Sept. 1992),
available at http://www.bis.org/publ/cpss06.pdf. Three different DVP models can be
differentiated according to whether the securities and/or funds transfers are settled on a gross
(trade-by-trade) basis or on a net basis. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(10), supra Part II.B.7 and
infra Part VII, would establish minimum requirements for physical deliveries.

140

that arises in a securities transaction. A counterparty default absent a DVP settlement
mechanism may cause substantial losses and liquidity pressures. Further, a settlement default
could result in high replacement costs because the unrealized gain on an unsettled contract or the
cost of replacing the original contract at market prices may change rapidly during periods of
market stress.
Request for Comments. The Commission generally requests comments on all aspects of
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12). In addition, the Commission requests comments on the
following specific issues:
•

Should the Commission require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to, if
the covered clearing agency settles transactions that involve the settlement of two linked
obligations, eliminate principal risk by conditioning the final settlement of one obligation
upon the final settlement of the other? Should the Commission impose this policy and
procedure requirement regardless of whether the covered clearing agency settles on a
gross or net basis, as proposed? Should the Commission impose this policy and
procedure requirement regardless of when finality occurs, as proposed? Why or why
not?

•

Does the proposed rule affect certain identifiable categories of covered clearing agencies
differently than others, such as clearing agencies with more diversified post-trade
services as compared to clearing agencies that specialize in fewer activities? If so, how?
How should the proposed rule account for these differences?

•

Are there operational or legal impediments to implementing the proposed rule? Would
the proposed rule make it more difficult for covered clearing agencies to conduct certain
types of business that may require a longer settlement cycle, for reasons outside of their

141

control? Are any additional rules or regulations needed to support achievement of the
proposed rule?
•

Are there circumstances when ensuring that the settlement of an obligation is final if and
only if the settlement of the corresponding obligation is final is not feasible or
practicable? If so, when?
10. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13): Participant-Default Rules and Procedures
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,

implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
that the covered clearing agency has the authority and operational capacity to take timely action
to contain losses and liquidity demands and continue to meet its obligations in the event of a
participant default. 280 Because Rule 17Ad-22(d)(11) currently requires a registered clearing
agency’s policies and procedures to meet substantially the same requirements, 281 the
Commission anticipates that covered clearing agencies may need to make only limited changes
to update their policies and procedures to comply with the proposed rule. 282
As with Rule 17Ad-22(d)(11), the Commission believes that proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(13) is appropriate given the importance of having established procedures in the event a
280

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13), infra Part VII. The Commission is proposing Rule
17Ad-22(e)(13) as part of a comprehensive set of rules for regulating covered clearing agencies
that is consistent with and comparable to other domestic and international standards for FMIs.
281

Rule 17Ad-22(d)(11) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to establish default
procedures that ensure that the clearing agency can take timely action to contain losses and
liquidity pressures and to continue meeting its obligations in the event of a participant default.
See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(11); see also Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra note 5, at
66254–55.
282

See supra Part II.A.4.

142

covered clearing agency faces a member default. The proposed rule would continue to provide
certainty and predictability to market participants about the measures a clearing agency will take
in the event of a participant default as default procedures, among other things, are meant to
reduce the likelihood that a default by one or more participants will disrupt the clearing agency’s
operations. By establishing, implementing, maintaining and enforcing such policies and
procedures, a covered clearing agency should be in a better position to continue providing its
services in a manner that promotes prompt and accurate clearance and settlement during times of
market stress. 283 Accordingly, a covered clearing agency that has financial and operational
triggers for default would need to ensure these are clearly defined. 284 In addition, where triggers
are not automatic through the application of objective standards or thresholds, the discretion
afforded a covered clearing agency to declare defaults would need to be clearly defined. 285 For
example, a clear definition may include defining which person or group exercises discretionary
authority in the event of default and providing specific examples of when the exercise of
discretion is appropriate.

283

The Commission is also proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) to require disclosure of rules,
key procedures, and market data to members, market participants, and in certain circumstances
the public. See infra Parts II.B.20 and VII (discussing the proposed rule and providing rule text,
respectively).
284

An operational default may occur when a participant is not able to meet its obligations
due to an operational problem, such as a failure in information technology systems. The
Commission is proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17) to establish minimum standards for operational
risk management. See infra Parts II.B.14 and VII (discussing the proposed rule and providing
rule text, respectively).
285

In this regard, the Commission notes that policies and procedures regarding participant
default must satisfy the requirement for legal certainty in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1). See
supra Part II.B.1.

143

The proposed rule would also require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that it can
take timely action to contain losses and liquidity pressures and to continue meeting its
obligations when due in the event of a member default. 286 Default procedures are meant to
reduce the likelihood that a default by a member, or multiple members, will disrupt the covered
clearing agency’s operations. Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission
preliminarily believes such policies and procedures would address, among other things, the
following: (i) accessing credit facilities, (ii) managing (which may include hedging open
positions and funding collateral positions it is not prudent to close out immediately), transferring
(such as through allocation or auction to other members) and/or closing out a defaulting
member’s positions; and (iii) transferring and/or liquidating applicable collateral. By employing
policies and procedures that are designed to permit a covered clearing agency to take actions to
contain losses and liquidity pressures it faces in the event of a participant default while
continuing to meet its obligations, a covered clearing agency should be in a better position to
continue providing its services in a manner that promotes accurate clearance and settlement
during times of market stress.
A covered clearing agency should also have the operational capacity to comply with the
proposed requirements to contain losses. The Commission preliminarily believes that the
following measures would help promote such operational capacity: (i) establishing training
programs for employees involved in default matters to ensure policies are well implemented; (ii)
developing a communications strategy for communicating with stakeholders, including the
286

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13), infra Part VII. A clearing agency may be able to
contain liquidity pressures it faces by taking actions to secure additional sources of liquidity or
limiting transactions that potentially serve to drain liquidity resources.

144

Commission, concerning defaults; and (iii) making sure the proper tools and resources (whether
these are personnel or other) required are available to close out, transfer, or hedge open positions
of a defaulting member promptly even in the face of rapid market movements. 287
In addition, based on its supervisory experience, the Commission preliminarily believes
that a covered clearing agency’s default procedures would generally include the following: (i)
the action that may be taken (e.g., exercising mutualization of losses); (ii) who may take those
actions (e.g., the division of responsibilities when clearing agencies operate links to other
clearing agencies); (iii) the scope of the actions that may be taken (e.g., any limits on the total
losses that would be mutualized); (iv) potential changes to the normal settlement practices,
should these changes be necessary in extreme circumstances, to ensure timely settlement; (v) the
management of transactions at different stages of processing; (vi) the sequencing of actions; (vii)
the roles, obligations, and responsibilities of the various parties, including non-defaulting
members; (viii) the mechanisms to address a covered clearing agency’s obligations to nondefaulting members (e.g., the process for clearing trades guaranteed by the covered clearing
agency to which a defaulting member is a party); and (ix) the mechanisms to address the
defaulting member’s obligations to its customers (e.g., the process for dealing with a defaulting
member’s accounts).
In addition, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) would include the requirements described
below, for which no comparable requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(d) are applicable to
registered clearing agencies. The Commission preliminarily believes the proposed requirements

287

See supra note 284 and accompanying text. The Commission has also proposed
Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity (“Regulation SCI”) to establish requirements for
operational capacity. See infra note 326 and accompanying text.

145

are appropriate for covered clearing agencies given the risks that a covered clearing agency’s
size, operation, and importance pose to the U.S. securities markets.
a. Address Allocation of Credit Losses
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13)(i) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to address
the allocation of credit losses it may face if its collateral and other resources are insufficient to
fully cover its credit exposures, including the repayment of any funds the covered clearing
agency may borrow from liquidity providers. 288
The Commission preliminarily believes that this requirement is appropriate because
requiring that policies and procedures address key aspects of the allocation of credit losses would
provide certainty and predictability about the measures available to a covered clearing agency in
the event of a default. Such certainty and predictability would facilitate the orderly handling of
member defaults and would enable members to understand their obligations to the covered
clearing agency in extreme circumstances. In some instances, managing a member default may
involve hedging open positions, funding collateral so that the positions can be closed out over
time, or both. A covered clearing agency may also decide to auction or allocate open positions to
its participants. To the extent possible, the Commission believes a covered clearing agency
would allow non-defaulting members to continue to manage their positions in the ordinary
course. By addressing the allocation of credit losses, the covered clearing agency would have
policies and procedures intended to address the resolution of a member default where its
collateral and other financial resources are insufficient to cover credit losses.

288

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13), infra Part VII.

146

b. Describe Replenishment of Financial Resources
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13)(ii) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to describe
its process to replenish any financial resources it may use following a member default or other
event in which use of such resources is contemplated. 289
The Commission preliminarily believes this requirement is appropriate because the
absence of procedures to replenish resources may undermine a covered clearing agency’s ability
to contain losses and liquidity pressures. The Commission also preliminarily believes that a
covered clearing agency’s rules and procedures to draw on financial resources will support the
proposed rule’s other requirements to contain losses and liquidity pressures. Such procedures
commonly specify the order of use of different types of resources, including (i) assets provided
by the defaulting member (such as margin or other collateral), (ii) the guaranty fund of the
covered clearing agency, (iii) capital calls on members, and (iv) credit facilities. In addition, the
Commission preliminarily believes a covered clearing agency could satisfy the proposed
requirement by having policies and procedures that describe (i) how resources that have been
depleted as a result of a member default would be replenished over time and (ii) what burdens a
non-defaulting member may bear.
c. Test Default Procedures Annually and Following Material Changes
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13)(iii) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to require
its members and, when practicable, other stakeholders to participate in the testing and review of
its default procedures, including any close out procedures. The proposed rule would also require
289

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13), infra Part VII.

147

policies and procedures providing for such testing and review to occur at least annually and
following material changes thereto. 290 The Commission preliminarily expects that covered
clearing agencies would make efforts to secure the participation of all stakeholders in such
testing and review of default procedures but recognizes that covered clearing agencies may have
limited ability to require said participation by all such stakeholders, and therefore the proposed
rule requires such participation by other stakeholders only when practicable.
The Commission preliminarily believes that including members and other stakeholders in
such testing will help to ensure that procedures will be practical and effective in the face of an
actual default. In addition to the relevant employees, members, and other stakeholders that
would be involved in testing default procedures, a covered clearing agency may determine, as
appropriate, to include members of its board of directors or similar governing body, and to invite
linked clearing agencies, significant indirect participants, providers of credit facilities, and other
service providers to participate. The Commission preliminarily believes requiring member and,
where practicable, stakeholder participation in periodic testing is appropriate because successful
default management will require coordination among these parties, particularly during periods of
market stress.
d. Request for Comments
The Commission generally requests comments on all aspects of proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(13). In addition, the Commission requests comments on the following specific issues:
•

Should the Commission require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to
ensure the covered clearing agency has the authority and operational capacity to take

290

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13), infra Part VII. The Commission preliminary
believes that an annual testing cycle is appropriate for the reasons described in Part II.A.3.

148

timely action to contain losses and liquidity demands and continue to meet its
obligations? Should the proposed rule include minimum requirements, as proposed?
Why or why not?
•

Should the Commission require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to require its
members and, when practicable, other stakeholders to participate in the testing and
review of its default procedures? Why or why not? Is it appropriate for stakeholders
other than a covered clearing agency’s participants to participate in the testing and review
of its default procedures? Why or why not? Should the Commission require policies and
procedures that would require stakeholders to be included in testing unless a
determination is made by the covered clearing agency that it would be impracticable to
do so?

•

Should the Commission require policies and procedures regarding specific default
procedures for covered clearing agencies, or should they have discretion to create their
own default procedures consistent with the proposed rule? If the latter, how much
flexibility should a covered clearing agency have in its policies and procedures regarding
the time it takes to manage a default and liquidate positions?
11. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14): Segregation and Portability
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) would apply to a covered clearing agency that is either a

security-based swap clearing agency or a complex risk profile clearing agency. 291 The proposed
rule would require such a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to enable the segregation and portability of
291

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14), infra Part VII.

149

positions of a member’s customers and the collateral provided to the covered clearing agency
with respect to those positions, and effectively protect such positions and related collateral from
the default or insolvency of that member. 292 The Commission notes that security-based swap
clearing agencies are currently not subject to rules regarding segregation and portability under
existing Rule 17Ad-22.
The Commission preliminarily believes that proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) is appropriate
because it facilitates the protection of customer collateral and positions by requiring a covered
clearing agency’s policies and procedures to prescribe means for holding or accounting for them
separately from the assets of the clearing agency member providing services to the customer.
The Commission preliminarily believes that proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) should apply
only to security-based swap clearing agencies and complex risk profile clearing agencies because
existing rules applicable to broker-dealers address customer security positions and funds in cash
securities and listed option markets, thereby promoting segregation and portability and protecting
customer positions and funds. 293 The Commission considered certain international standards,
292

See id.

293

Exchange Act Rule 15c3-3 requires broker-dealers that maintain custody of customer
securities and cash (a “carrying broker-dealer”) to take two primary steps to safeguard these
assets. The steps are designed to protect customers by segregating their securities and cash from
the broker-dealer’s proprietary business activities. If the broker-dealer fails financially, the
securities and cash should be readily available to be returned to customers. In addition, if the
failed broker-dealer is liquidated in a formal proceeding under the Securities Investor Protection
Act of 1970, the securities and cash would be isolated and readily identifiable as “customer
property” and, consequently, available to be distributed to customers ahead of other creditors.

The first step required by Rule 15c3-3 is that a carrying broker must maintain physical
possession or control of all fully paid and excess margin securities of their customers. See 17
CFR 240.15c3-3. Physical possession or control means the broker-dealer must hold these
securities in one of several locations specified in Rule 15c3-3 and free of liens or any other
interest that could be exercised by a third party to secure an obligation of the broker-dealer.
Permissible locations include a bank, as defined in section 3(a)(6) of the Exchange Act, and a
150

which recognize that cash market CCPs operate in legal regimes that achieve protection of
customer assets by alternate means, in proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14). 294 The Commission

clearing agency. As described herein, holding jumbo/global positions in the record name and
custody of a clearing agency is a fundamental part of current U.S. market structure in which
many holders hold indirectly through “street name.”
The second step is that a carrying broker-dealer must maintain a reserve of cash or
qualified securities in an account at a bank that is at least equal in value to the net cash owed to
customers, including cash obtained from the use of customer securities. The account must be
titled “Special Reserve Bank Account for the Exclusive Benefit of Customers.” The amount of
net cash owed to customers is computed pursuant to a formula set forth in Exhibit A to Rule
15c3-3. Under the customer reserve formula, the broker-dealer adds up customer credit items
(e.g. cash in customer securities accounts and cash obtained through the use of customer margin
securities) and then subtracts from that amount customer debit items (e.g. margin loans). If
credit items exceed debit items, the net amount must be on deposit in the customer reserve
account in the form of cash and/or qualified securities. A broker-dealer cannot make a
withdrawal from the customer reserve account until the next computation and then even only if
the computation shows that the reserve requirement has decreased. The broker-dealer must make
a deposit into the customer reserve account if the computation shows an increase in the reserve
requirement. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3.
In addition, records of customer positions are subject to broker-dealer recordkeeping
rules. Exchange Act Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 require records be kept for certain periods of time,
such as three or six year periods depending upon the type of record. See 17 CFR 240.17a-3, 17a4.
See also 15 U.S.C. 78c-5 (providing for segregation with respect to security-based swaps
pursuant to Section 3E of the Exchange Act); Exchange Act Release No. 34-68071 (Oct. 18,
2012), 77 FR 70213, (Nov. 23, 2012) (proposing Rule 18a-4 under the Exchange Act for
segregation with respect to security-based swaps). The Commission has also granted conditional
relief under Sections 3E(b), (d), and (e) of the Exchange Act to, among others, clearing entities
dually registered with the Commission and the CFTC as registered clearing agencies and DCOs,
respectively. See Exchange Act Release No. 34-68433 (Dec. 14, 2012), 77 FR 75211 (Dec. 19,
2012).
294

International standards recognize that regimes providing the same degree of protection as
segregation and portability of customer positions at a CCP include the following features, in the
event of a participant failure: (a) the customer positions can be identified timely, (b) customers
will be protected by an investor protection scheme designed to move customer accounts from the
failed participant to another participant in a timely manner, and (c) customer assets can be
restored. See PFMI Report, supra note 1, at 83 (discussing Principle 14, Explanatory Note
3.14.6). The Commission preliminarily believes that the customer protections existing under the
Commission’s regulatory regime for broker-dealers include each of these three features and that
151

further notes that customer security positions and funds in cash securities and listed options
markets are further protected under the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (“SIPA”). 295
In addition, in so limiting the scope of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14), the Commission
intends to avoid requiring changes to the existing structure of cash securities and listed options
markets in the United States where registered clearing agencies that provide CSD or CCP
services play a central role. Transactions in the U.S. cash security and listed options markets are
characterized by the following features: (i) customers of members generally do not have an
account at a clearing agency; 296 and (ii) the clearing agency is not able to identify which
participants’ customers beneficially own the street name positions registered in the record name
of the clearing agency (or its nominee) and the clearing agency has no recourse to funds of
customers of members. Therefore, in part because neither portability nor segregation could
limiting the application of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) in the manner described above is
appropriate.
The Commission also notes that, separately, it has proposed Rule 18a-4 to apply
customer protection rules to security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap
participants. The approach in proposed Rule 18a-4 was modeled on the customer protection
scheme under Rule 15c3-3 for broker-dealers. See Exchange Act Release No. 34-68071 (Oct. 18,
2012), 77 FR 70213 (Nov. 23, 2012).
295

See 15 U.S.C. 78eee et seq. Pursuant to SIPA, when a broker-dealer that is a member of
the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”) fails and customer assets are missing,
SIPC seeks to return customer cash and securities, and supplements the distribution of the
remaining customer assets at the broker-dealer with SIPC reserve funds of up to $500,000 per
customer, including a maximum of $250,000 for cash claims.
296

A customer of a member also would not have an account at the clearing agency where
holding in record name (rather than through street name ownership). This is the case even where
such record name owner-customer does not receive a paper security certificate but holds in bookentry form through the direct registration system, as direct registration system accounts are
maintained by a transfer agent and not by the clearing agency. See Exchange Act Release No.
34-63320 (Nov. 16, 2010), 75 FR 71473, 71474 (Nov. 23, 2010) (discussing the ability of
registered owners to hold their assets on the records of transfer agents in book-entry form
through the direct registration system).

152

occur as a practical matter under the current cash securities and listed options markets structure,
the Commission preliminarily believes that Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) should apply only to
a covered clearing agency that is either a security-based swap clearing agency or a complex risk
profile clearing agency.
The Commission notes that segregation can be achieved either through an omnibus
account structure, as is common in the U.S. securities markets today, or an individual account
structure. An omnibus account structure, where all collateral belonging to all customers of a
particular member is commingled and held in a single account segregated from that of the
member, might not be as operationally intensive as an individual account structure. Omnibus
accounts may expose a customer to “fellow-customer risk” (i.e. the risk that another customer of
the same member will default) in the event of a loss that exceeds the amount of available
collateral posted by the fellow customer who has defaulted and the available resources of the
member, in which case the remaining commingled collateral of the member’s non-defaulting
customers may be exposed to the loss. Fellow-customer risk is of particular concern because
customers may have limited ability to monitor or to manage the risk of their fellow customers.
To mitigate this risk, omnibus account structures can be designed in a manner that operationally
commingles collateral related to customer positions while protecting customers legally on an
individual basis. 297 This may require a covered clearing agency to rely on the records of its
members or maintain its own books reflecting customer-level interest in the customer’s portion
of collateral.
297

See, e.g., Protection of Cleared Swaps Customer Contracts and Collateral; Conforming
Amendments to the Commodity Broker Bankruptcy Provisions, 77 FR 6336 (Feb. 7, 2012)
(CFTC adopting rules imposing on DCOs legal segregation with operational commingling
(“LSOC”) for cleared swaps).

153

An omnibus account structure may be more efficient when porting positions and
collateral for a group of customers subject to a defaulting member (where there has been no
customer default or where customer collateral is legally protected on an individual basis).
Omnibus accounts may also foster portability depending on whether the covered clearing agency
collects margin on a gross or net basis. Margin calculated on a gross basis to support individual
customer portfolios may result in less efficient netting with respect to members; however, it may
eliminate the possibility of under-margined customer positions when ported. As a result, a
clearing agency may be able to port in bulk or piecemeal the positions of a customer of a
member that has defaulted. When margin is collected on a net basis, there may be a risk that full
portability cannot be achieved if under-margining means that porting will depend on the ability
and willingness of customers to provide additional collateral where transferee members are
unwilling to accept the porting to them of under-margined positions.
Alternatively, an individual account structure may also provide a high degree of
protection from the default of another customer of a member, as a customer’s collateral is
intended to be used to cover losses associated solely with the default of that customer. In the
event of a member failure (whether or not due to a customer default), clear and reliable
identification of a customer’s collateral may promote portability of an individual customer’s
positions and collateral or, alternatively, expedite their return to the customer. Maintaining
individual accounts, however, can be operationally and resource intensive for a covered clearing
agency and could impact the overall efficiency of its clearing operations. An individual account
structure may also impact margin collection practices at a covered clearing agency, as the
individual account structure may be inconsistent with net collection of margin because it may be

154

impractical for the covered clearing agency to allocate the net margin to individual customers
rather than among omnibus accounts.
The Commission preliminarily notes that a covered clearing agency subject to the
proposed rule would be required to structure its portability arrangements in a way that makes it
highly likely that the positions and collateral of a defaulting member’s customers will be
effectively transferred to one or more other members. The Commission also preliminarily notes
that the following methods may assist a covered clearing agency in achieving portability: (i)
identifying positions that belong to customers; (ii) identifying and asserting rights to related
collateral held by or through the covered clearing agency; (iii) identifying potential members to
accept the positions and collateral; (iv) disclosing relevant information to such members so that
they can evaluate the counterparty credit and market risk associated with the customers and
positions, respectively; (v) transferring positions and related collateral to one or more members;
and (vi) carrying out default management procedures in an orderly manner.
Finally, where a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures facilitating portability
permit a transfer of specific positions and collateral that is not performed with the consent of the
member to whom they are transferred, the Commission preliminarily believes that a covered
clearing agency could satisfy this requirement by having policies and procedures that set out the
circumstances where this may occur. In addition, the Commission preliminarily notes that the
portability requirement does not apply only upon default of a member; a covered clearing agency
should have policies and procedures that facilitate porting in the normal course of business, such

155

as when a customer ends its relationship with a member to start a new relationship with a
different member, or as a result of other events, such as a merger involving the member. 298
Request for Comments. The Commission generally requests comments on all aspects of
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14). In addition, the Commission requests comments on the
following specific issues:
•

Should the Commission require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to
enable the segregation and portability of positions of a participant’s customers and the
collateral provided to the covered clearing agency with respect to those positions? Why
or why not?

•

Should the Commission require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to
effectively protect the positions of a participant’s customers and related collateral from
the default or insolvency of that participant? Why or why not?

•

Does the proposed rule affect certain identifiable categories of covered clearing agencies
differently than others in ways not discussed in this proposing release? If so, how?
Should the requirements under the proposed rule apply to certain identifiable categories
of covered clearing agencies in addition to security-based swap and complex risk profile
clearing agencies, as proposed? Please explain.
12. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15): General Business Risk
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,

implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
identify, monitor, and manage its general business risk and hold sufficient liquid net assets
298

In this regard, the Commission notes that policies and procedures regarding segregation
and portability must satisfy the requirement for legal certainty in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1).
See supra Part II.B.1.

156

funded by equity to cover potential general business losses so that the covered clearing agency
can continue operations and services as a going concern if those losses materialize. 299
Registered clearing agencies are not subject to rules regarding general business risk under
existing Rule 17Ad-22, but the Commission preliminarily believes the proposed rule is
appropriate for covered clearing agencies given the risks that a covered clearing agency’s size,
operation, and importance pose to the U.S. securities markets.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) is designed to help mitigate the potential impairment of a
covered clearing agency’s status as a going concern resulting from general business losses, such
as a decline in revenues or an increase in expenses resulting in expenses that exceed revenues
and a loss that must be charged against the covered clearing agency’s capital. 300 The
Commission preliminarily believes that proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) is appropriate because it
would help to mitigate the risk of a disruption in clearance and settlement services that might
result from general business losses. The Commission preliminarily believes that such
impairment could be caused by a variety of business factors, including poor execution of
business strategy, negative cash flows, or unexpected and/or excessively large operating
expenses. The Commission preliminarily believes that general business losses should be
considered separately in the covered clearing agency’s risk management policies and procedures
to promote effective and efficient measuring, monitoring, and management of general business
299

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15), infra Part VII.

300

General business risk is the risk of potential losses arising from the covered clearing
agency’s administration and operation as a business enterprise. Such losses are not related to
member default under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) nor covered by the financial resources
required for credit and liquidity risk management under proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4) and (7).
See supra Parts II.B.4.c, II.B.4.f, and II.B.10 and infra Part VII (proposing rules for managing
credit risk, liquidity risk, and participant default, and providing proposed rule text, respectively).

157

risk. The risk of general business losses may require a firm to take into account past loss events
and financial projections, events distinct from the risks that arise from member default, credit
losses, or liquidity shortfalls. 301 Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) would require a covered clearing
agency to establish implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to address the management of general business risk and the development of a business
risk profile to address these concerns. 302
In addition, the Commission is proposing the requirements described below. Registered
clearing agencies are not subject to similar rules under Rule 17Ad-22, but the Commission
preliminarily believes the proposed requirements are appropriate for covered clearing agencies
given the risks that a covered clearing agency’s size, operation, and importance pose to the U.S.
securities markets and are consistent with the Exchange Act requirements discussed above. 303
a. Determining Liquid Net Assets for Recovery and an Orderly WindDown
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(i) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
determine the amount of liquid net assets funded by equity based upon its general business risk
profile and the length of time required to achieve a recovery or orderly wind-down, as
appropriate, of its critical operations and services if such action is taken. 304 The Commission

301

See id.

302

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15), infra Part VII.

See notes 54–56 and accompanying text; see also Parts I.A and B (generally discussing
the regulatory framework under Section 17A of the Exchange Act, as amended by the DoddFrank Act).
304

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(i), infra Part VII.

158

preliminarily believes that plans for orderly recovery and wind-down are critical to maintain
functioning U.S. securities markets, particularly in times of market stress. Because of the
reliance of securities markets, market participants, and investors on the safe, sound, and efficient
operations of covered clearing agencies, the Commission believes that a disorderly failure of a
covered clearing agency would have systemic consequences. Accordingly, the Commission is
proposing to require liquid net assets funded by equity to ensure that the covered clearing agency
can continue operations and services as a going concern in the event of general business losses.
Equity allows a covered clearing agency to absorb losses on an ongoing basis and should
therefore be permanently available for this purpose. The specific amount of liquid net assets
funded by equity that a covered clearing agency should hold is discussed in more detail below.
b. Requirements for Liquid Net Assets
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(ii) would require a clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide
for holding liquid net assets funded by equity equal to the greater of either six months of its
current operating expenses or the amount determined by the board of directors to be sufficient to
ensure a recovery or orderly wind-down of critical operations and services of the covered
clearing agency, as contemplated by the plans established under proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(3)(ii). 305 A clearing agency’s policies and procedures would require these liquid net assets
to be held in addition to resources held to cover participant defaults or other risks covered under

305

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(ii), infra Part VII; see also supra Part II.B.3.b

the credit risk standard in proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i) through (iii) and the liquidity risk
standard in proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) and (ii). 306
The Commission preliminarily believes that the requirements for a covered clearing
agency’s policies and procedures regarding liquid net assets are necessary to ensure that a
covered clearing agency’s general business risk management is sufficiently robust to facilitate
either its orderly recovery or wind-down. The Commission is proposing these requirements to
ensure that a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures clearly define what liquid net
assets are sufficient under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) and to require a covered clearing agency to
maintain, pursuant to its policies and procedures, liquid net assets appropriate to cover general
business risk in addition to those resources appropriate for managing participant default, credit
losses, or liquidity shortfalls. Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission preliminarily
believes that a covered clearing agency could satisfy this requirement by having policies and
procedures that limit appropriate liquid net assets to cash or cash equivalents because these types
of assets would best facilitate continued operations if a clearing agency experienced general
business losses. 307 Further, the Commission preliminarily believes that a covered clearing
agency could satisfy this requirement by having policies and procedures that fund liquid net
306

See supra Parts II.B.4.c and f and infra Part VII (discussing requirements under proposed
Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4) and (e)(7), respectively, and providing proposed rule text).
307

Regarding marketable securities that may be included as cash equivalents within liquid
net assets, the Commission has not proposed to require such assets to be readily available and
convertible into cash through certain funding arrangements as it has proposed under Rule 17Ad22(e)(7)(ii) (which incorporates proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(15) defining “qualifying liquid
resources”). The Commission preliminarily believes the amount of liquidity needed to cover
participant defaults in the context of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) may be significantly greater
than the amount of liquidity needed to cover general business losses, and it is therefore
appropriate to permit the use of such assets in the context of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ii), in
order to provide greater flexibility to covered clearing agencies regarding liquidity risk
management.

assets by common stock, disclosed reserves, or other retained earnings in order to ensure that a
covered clearing agency has a permanent source of capital from which to draw in order to
continue as a going concern in the case of general business losses for at least a six month period
or in accord with a determination of the board of directors of the covered clearing agency. 308
Assets funded by debt or other less permanent sources of capital would not achieve this result
and in some circumstances could further complicate the resolution process of a covered clearing
agency.
The Commission also preliminarily believes that a backward-looking calculation of
operating expenses based on the income statement for the most recently ended fiscal year would
not be the type of policy and procedure sufficient to comply with the proposed requirements
regarding current operating expense. 309 While reviewing past losses and past levels of operating
expense may be a useful reference point, the Commission envisions that one possible approach a
covered clearing agency could take in fulfillment of the proposed requirement would be to
consider projected operating expense expected over some time period, as well as potential
changes to the business environment of the covered clearing agency over that time period. Based
308

The Commission preliminarily believes it is appropriate to apply the limitation that liquid
net assets be funded by equity in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) but has not proposed such
limitation in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) (regarding financial resources required to manage credit risk) or
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ii) (regarding qualifying liquid resources in relevant currencies required to
manage liquidity risk) because equity allows a covered clearing agency to absorb losses on an
ongoing basis so that it can continue operations as a going concern. Cf. PFMI Report, supra note
1, at 90 & n.137.
In addition, the Commission preliminarily believes a covered clearing agency may
exclude depreciation and amortization expenses from its calculation of current operating
expenses because depreciation and amortization expenses are non-cash expenses and accordingly
would not have an effect on a covered clearing agency’s cash flow, which might affect its ability
to continue operations as a going concern.
309

See id. at 90.

161

on its supervisory experience, the Commission also believes that the following factors may
materially affect current operating expenses, as compared to operating expense experienced in
the past, that a covered clearing agency may need to take into account and therefore are likely to
be important to the covered clearing agency’s forward-looking projections: (i) expectations
regarding expansion of its business including as a result of offering new services or clearing and
settling new types of securities, (ii) expectations regarding contraction of its business including
due to reduction in or loss of certain types of clearing and settlement activity or clearing
members, (iii) potential risk of any large one-time or non-recurring types of losses, and (iv) the
degree to which expected future losses may be covered by insurance or an indemnity provided
by a third-party unaffiliated with the covered clearing agency.
The proposed rule also requires a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide for
monitoring its business operations and reducing the likelihood of losses, which the Commission
believes furthers the requirements of the Exchange Act discussed above. 310
Because of the integral role that liquid net assets play in supporting the recovery or
orderly wind-down of a covered clearing agency in the event of a business loss, the Commission
is proposing requirements for a clearing agency’s policies and procedures to require liquid net
assets, funded by equity, equal to the greater of six months of operating expenses or an amount
determined by the board of directors to be sufficient to facilitate an orderly recovery or winddown of critical operations and services. The Commission preliminarily believes this is
appropriate because liquid net assets allow the covered clearing agency to continue operations as

the regulatory framework under Section 17A of the Exchange Act, as amended by the DoddFrank Act).

162

a going concern by acting as a cushion while the covered clearing agency is in recovery or winddown.
c. Plan for Raising Additional Equity
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(iii) would further require a covered clearing
agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to provide for maintaining a viable plan, approved by the board of directors and
updated at least annually, for raising additional equity should its equity fall close to or below the
amount required by the proposed rule as discussed above. 311
As noted above, because of the reliance of securities markets, market participants, and
investors on the safe, sound, and efficient operations of covered clearing agencies, a disorderly
failure of a covered clearing agency would have systemic consequences. The proposed rule
requires a covered clearing agency to maintain a viable plan to raise additional equity in the
event that its liquid net assets funded by equity fall close to or below the amount required by the
proposed rule. 312 The Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed rule is necessary to
facilitate ongoing management of a covered clearing agency’s general business risk and to
provide a covered clearing agency with a mechanism for maintaining or replenishing appropriate
levels of equity following business losses.
d. Request for Comments
The Commission generally requests comments on all aspects of proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(15). In addition, the Commission requests comments on the following specific issues:

312

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)(iii), infra Part VII.

163

•

Should the Commission require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to
identify, monitor, and manage the covered clearing agency’s general business risk? Why
or why not? Are there other requirements that the Commission should include in
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) to address the general business risk management at
covered clearing agencies?

•

Is the proposed requirement for a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to
hold liquid net assets funded by equity equal to the greater of either (x) six months of the
covered clearing agency’s current operating expenses or (y) the amount determined by
the board of directors to be sufficient to ensure a recovery or orderly wind-down of
critical operations and services of the covered clearing agency appropriate? Why or why
not? Under the proposed requirement for policies and procedures, is six months of
operating expenses appropriate? Should the Commission adopt a different standard, such
as three, nine, or twelve months? Please explain in detail why using an alternative
standard would be appropriate.

•

Should the Commission require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to
hold liquid net assets in addition to resources held to cover participant defaults or other
risks covered under the credit risk standard in Rule 17Ad-22(b)(3)? Under the credit risk
standard in proposed Rules 17Ad-22 (e)(4)(i) through (iii), as applicable? Under the
liquidity risk standard in proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) and (ii), as applicable? Why
or why not?

Has the Commission provided sufficient guidance regarding what

constitutes “liquid net assets”? Why or why not?
•

Should a covered clearing agency be required to provide notice to the Commission at any
time before its liquid net assets reach the minimum required amount? If so, at what

164

amount should the requirement apply, e.g. at 110% of the minimum, 120% of the
minimum, or some other amount? 313
•

Regarding securities that are cash equivalents and therefore liquid net assets, should the
Commission establish requirements for policies and procedures that discount the value of
these securities compared to their fair value?
13. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16): Custody and Investment Risks
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,

implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
safeguard its own and its participants’ assets and minimize the risk of loss and delay in access to
these assets. 314 It also requires a clearing agency to invest its own and its participants’ assets in
instruments with minimal credit, market, and liquidity risks. 315 Rule 17Ad-22(d)(3) currently
requires similar policies and procedures of registered clearing agencies, but the proposed rule
would further require a covered clearing agency to have policies and procedures designed to
safeguard its own and its participants’ assets. 316 The Commission preliminarily believes this
313

See, e.g., Commission Delegated Regulation No. 152/2013 of 19 December 2012, 2013
O.J. (L 52), at art. 1(3) (European Union requiring that, if the required amount of capital held by
a CCP is lower than 110% of the capital requirements or lower than 110% of £7.5 million (the
“notification threshold”), the CCP shall immediately notify the competent authority and keep it
updated at least weekly, until the amount of capital held by the CCP returns above the
notification threshold).
314

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16), infra Part VII.

315

See id.

316

Registered clearing agencies are currently subject to existing Rule 17Ad-22(d)(3), which
requires them to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to hold assets in a manner that minimizes risk of loss or of delay in its
access to them, and invest assets in instruments with minimal credit, market, and liquidity risks.
See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(3); see also Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra note 5, at
66247–48.
165

additional specificity is appropriate for covered clearing agencies given the risks that a covered
clearing agency’s size, operation, and importance pose to the U.S. securities markets. Because
this is the only element of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16) that differs from Rule 17Ad-22(d)(3), the
Commission anticipates that covered clearing agencies may need to make only limited changes
to update their policies and procedures to comply with the proposed rule. 317
Custody risk is the risk of loss on assets held in custody in the event of a custodian’s (or
subcustodian’s) insolvency, negligence, fraud, or poor administration. Investment risk is the risk
of loss faced by a clearing agency when it invests its own or its participants’ assets. In each case,
the risk is the likelihood that assets securing participant obligations to the covered clearing
agency or otherwise needed for the clearing agency to meet its own obligations would be
unavailable or insufficient when the covered clearing agency needs to draw on them. Failure by
a clearing agency to hold assets in instruments with minimal credit, market, and liquidity risk
may limit the clearing agency’s ability to retrieve these assets promptly. That, in turn, can cause
the clearing agency to fail to meet its settlement obligations to its participants or cause the
clearing agency’s participants to fail to meet their obligations. Accordingly, as under Rule
17Ad-22(d)(3), the Commission believes it is appropriate to continue to limit such risks to ensure
the proper functioning of a covered clearing agency pursuant to Section 17A of the Exchange
Act. 318 The Commission also preliminarily believes that requiring a covered clearing agency to

317

See supra Part II.A.4.

318

The Commission preliminarily believes, however, that it should not indirectly prohibit
the use of commercial banks by covered clearing agencies holding cash as collateral or for other
services related to clearance and settlement activity when comparable services are available from
a central bank.

166

have policies and procedures that safeguard its own and its participants’ assets further supports
this objective.
Under existing Rule 17Ad-22(d)(3), the members of a registered clearing agency
typically deposit securities with the clearing agency, or the clearing agency holds assets that
secure the participants’ obligations to it and may invest these assets. In such circumstances, the
clearing agency is exposed to custody and investment risk. The Commission is aware that,
currently, clearing agencies ordinarily seek to minimize the risk of loss or delay in access by
holding assets that are highly liquid (e.g., cash, U.S. Treasury securities, or securities issued by a
U.S. government agency) and by using only supervised and regulated entities such as banks to
act as custodians for the assets and to facilitate settlement. Steps are also ordinarily taken to
ensure assets held in custody are protected against claims of a custodian’s creditors through trust
accounts or other equivalent arrangements. In addition, the use of individual custodians is
subject to periodic assessment across several risk criteria and should remain within acceptable
concentration limits.
Request for Comments. The Commission generally requests comments on all aspects of
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16). In addition, the Commission requests comments on the
following specific issues:
•

Should the Commission require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to
invest its own and its participants’ assets in instruments with minimal credit, market, and
liquidity risks? Why or why not?

•

Should the Commission require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to
minimize the risk of loss and delay in access to its own and its participants’ assets? Why
or why not?

167

•

Has the Commission provided sufficient guidance regarding what instruments have
“minimal credit, market, and liquidity risks”? Should the Commission further specify
what kinds of assets would be appropriate under the proposed requirement, such as
investments that are secured by, or are claims on, high-quality obligors and investments
that allow for timely liquidation with little, if any, adverse price effect? Why or why not?

•

Should covered clearing agencies ever be permitted to hold assets in instruments that do
not have minimal credit, market, and liquidity risk? If so, why and under what
circumstances? What type of measures should covered clearing agencies have in place to
minimize the risk of loss from delays in accessing these assets? Should the proposed rule
specify any such requirements? Should the Commission develop more specific criteria
regarding how covered clearing agencies may hold or invest assets?
14. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17): Operational Risk Management
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,

implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to manage
the covered clearing agency’s operational risk. 319 Operational risk involves, among other things,
the likelihood that deficiencies in information systems or internal controls, human errors or
misconduct, management failures, unauthorized intrusions into corporate or production systems,
or disruptions from external events such as natural disasters, would adversely affect the
functioning of a clearing agency. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17)(i) would require a covered
clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to identify the plausible sources of operational risk, both internal and
external, and mitigate their impact through the use of appropriate systems, policies, procedures,
319

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17), infra Part VII.

168

and controls. 320 Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17)(ii) would require the covered clearing agency to
establish, implement, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to ensure that systems have a high degree of security, resiliency, operational reliability, and
adequate, scalable capacity. 321 Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17)(iii) further requires a covered
clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to provide for a business continuity plan that addresses events posing a
significant risk of disrupting operations. 322 Rule 17Ad-22(d)(4) currently requires a registered
clearing agency to have policies and procedures that are substantially similar to those in
proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(17)(i) through (iii). 323 Although proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(17)(i)
through (iii) differ from Rule 17Ad-22(d)(4) in contemplating both internal and external
operational risks, a high degree of security and operational reliability for systems, and, in the
context of business continuity plans, events posing a significant risk of disrupting operations, the
Commission preliminarily believes that a covered clearing agency may need to make only
limited changes to update its policies and procedures. The Commission preliminarily believes

320

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17)(i), infra Part VII.

321

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17)(ii), infra Part VII. By requiring “adequate, scalable
capacity,” the Commission preliminarily believes that a covered clearing agency should have
operational systems that can be extended or expanded based on its anticipated business needs.
322

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17)(iii), infra Part VII.

323

Rule 17Ad-22(d)(4) requires a registered clearing agency to establish policies and
procedures reasonably designed to identify sources of operational risk and minimize them
through the development of appropriate systems, controls, and procedures. It also requires
registered clearing agencies to establish policies and procedures reasonably designed to
implement systems that are reliable and secure, and have adequate, scalable capacity; and have
business continuity plans that allow for timely recovery of operations and fulfillment of a
clearing agency’s obligations. See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(4); see also Clearing Agency
Standards Release, supra note 5, at 66248–49.

169

these requirements are appropriate for covered clearing agencies given the risks that a covered
clearing agency’s size, operation, and importance pose to the U.S. securities markets.
As with Rule 17Ad-22(d)(4), the Commission preliminarily believes that the
requirements in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17)(i) through (iii) should help covered clearing
agencies and its participants continue to address and manage risks posed by potential operational
deficiencies. Specifically, to help limit disruptions that may impede the proper functioning of a
covered clearing agency, the Commission preliminarily believes it is imperative that covered
clearing agencies review their operations for potential weaknesses and develop appropriate
systems, controls, and procedures to address weaknesses the proposed rule seeks to mitigate.
The Commission intends for proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17) to supplement the existing
guidance provided by the Commission in its Automation Review Policy (“ARP”) statements 324
and the Interagency White Paper on Sound Practices to Strengthen the Resilience of the U.S.

324

See Automated Systems of Self-Regulatory Organizations, Exchange Act Release No.
34-27445 (Nov. 16, 1989), 54 FR 48703 (Nov. 24, 1989) (“ARP I”); Automated Systems of SelfRegulatory Organizations (II), Exchange Act Release No. 34-29815 (May 9, 1991), 56 FR 22489
(May 15, 1991) (“ARP II”).
Generally, the guidance in ARP I and ARP II provides for the following activities by
clearing agencies: (1) performing periodic risk assessments of its automated data processing
(“ADP”) systems and facilities; (2) providing for the selection of the clearing agency’s
independent auditors by non-management directors and authorizing such non-management
directors to review the nature, scope, and results of all audit work performed; (3) having an
adequately staffed and competent internal audit department; (4) furnishing annually to
participants audited financial statements and an opinion from an independent public accountant
as to the clearing agency’s system of internal control –including unaudited quarterly financial
statements also should be provided to participants upon request; and (5) developing and
maintaining plans to assure the safeguarding of securities and funds, the integrity of the ADP
system, and recovery of securities, funds, or data under a variety of loss or destruction scenarios.

Request for Comments. The Commission generally requests comments on all aspects of
proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(17). In addition, the Commission requests comments on the
following specific issues:
•

Should the Commission require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to
manage its operational risks by establishing and maintaining a business continuity plan
that addresses events posing a significant risk of disrupting operations? Why or why not?
Has the Commission provided sufficient guidance on what an event “posing a significant
risk of disrupting operations” would be?

•

Should the Commission’s proposal require a specific methodology to identify and
mitigate operational risk? If so, what is the methodology and why should this
methodology be imposed?

•

Is the Commission’s proposed approach with respect to ensuring that systems have a high
degree of security, resiliency, and operational reliability appropriate and sufficiently
clear? Why or why not?

326

Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17) would not conflict with the Commission’s proposed
Regulation SCI, should the Commission determine at a later date to adopt those rules as
proposed. Proposed Regulation SCI would, however, subject all covered clearing agencies to
certain requirements, including requirements for operational risk management and business
continuity planning, in addition to those that appear in this proposal. See Exchange Act Release
No. 34-69077 (Mar. 8, 2013), 78 FR 18083, 18091–141 (Mar. 25, 2013).

Should the Commission adopt additional policies and procedures requirements for
business continuity planning? If so, please explain in detail.
15. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18): Access and Participation Requirements
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,

implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
establish objective, risk-based, and publicly disclosed criteria for participation, 327 which permit
fair and open access by direct and, where relevant, indirect participants and other FMUs. 328
In addition to the requirements described above, 329 Section 17A of the Exchange Act
requires registered clearing agencies to have rules not designed to permit unfair discrimination in
the admission of participants. 330 The Commission has historically used its authority to help
ensure fair access and participation requirements. 331 In this regard, the Commission notes that
327

The Commission notes that, in contrast to other requirements in Rule 17Ad-22(e) where
“transparent” is used and permits disclosure “where appropriate” pursuant to Rule 17Ad22(a)(20), the requirement here for policies and procedures designed to ensure “publicly
disclosed” criteria for participation would require policies and procedures requiring such
disclosure.

172

Rules 17Ad-22(b)(5) through (7) impose requirements regarding access and participation for the
policies and procedures of registered clearing agencies that provide CCP services. 332 Similarly,
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(2) requires a registered clearing agency to establish policies and procedures for
access and participation that require participants to have sufficient financial resources and robust
operational capacity to meet obligations arising from participation in the CCP and have
procedures in place to monitor that participation requirements are met on an ongoing basis. 333
Appropriate minimum operational, legal, and capital requirements for membership that
are maintained and enforced through the supervisory practices of a clearing agency help to
ensure all members will be reasonably capable of meeting their various obligations to the
clearing agency in stressed market conditions and upon member default. Member defaults
challenge the safe functioning of a clearing agency by creating credit and liquidity risks, which
impede a clearing agency’s ability to settle securities transactions in a timely manner. Ensuring
332

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(b)(5) through (7); Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra
note 5, at 66238–43. The Commission notes that covered clearing agencies providing CCP
services would remain subject to the requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(b), in addition to the
requirements under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18).
333

Rule 17Ad-22(d)(2) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to (i) require
participants to have sufficient financial resources and robust operational capacity to meet
obligations arising from participation in the clearing agency; (ii) have procedures in place to
monitor that participation requirements are met on an ongoing basis; (iii) have participation
requirements that are objective and publicly disclosed, and permit fair and open access. See 17
CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(2); see also Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra note 5, at 66246–
47.
The Commission notes that the elements of Rule 17Ad-22(d)(2)(i), regarding policies and
procedures requiring participants to have financial resources and robust operational capacity to
meet obligations arising from participation are also reflected in other proposed rules, including
Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4) and (17). See supra Parts II.B.4.c (requiring under proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(4) policies and procedures for testing the sufficiency of financial resources) and II.B.14
(requiring under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17) policies and procedures for operational risk
management).

173

that clearing members meet objective levels of operational and financial soundness helps to
counterbalance the potential for cascading effects on other participants and limit the potential of
a systemic disruption in the U.S. securities markets. Fair and open access to all parties meeting
the objective criteria for participation similarly helps to ensure wide participation and thereby
increase beneficial risk mitigating effects.
Accordingly, the Commission preliminarily believes Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18) is appropriate
because it would promote membership standards at covered clearing agencies that are likely to
limit the potential for member defaults and, as a result, losses to non-defaulting members in the
event of a member default. The proposed rule has similar requirements to those applied to
registered clearing agencies under Rule 17Ad-22(d)(2) but would also explicitly require a
covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to establish publicly disclosed criteria for
participation, which permit fair and open access by direct and, where relevant, indirect
participants and other FMUs, and also require that the criteria be risk-based, in addition to
objective. 334 The Commission preliminarily believes the requirement that policies and
procedures for publicly disclosed criteria for participation that specify fair and open access by
both direct and indirect participants and other FMUs is appropriate because of the size and reach
of covered clearing agencies, which are likely to transact or link with many participants, both
direct and indirect, as well as other FMUs. The Commission also preliminarily believes that the
requirement for risk-based criteria helps protect investors and facilitates prompt and accurate
334

The Commission is proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18) as part of a comprehensive set of
rules for regulating covered clearing agencies that is consistent with and comparable to other
domestic and international standards for FMIs. Because of the similarity between the existing
requirement in Rule 17Ad-22(d)(2)(iii) and these requirements under proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(18), the Commission anticipates that covered clearing agencies may need to make only
limited changes to update their policies and procedures to comply with these requirements under
the proposed rule. See supra Part II.A.4.

174

clearance and settlement by helping to ensure that covered clearing agencies accept participants
that are less prone to default.
In addition, the Commission is proposing a requirement that covered clearing agencies
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to require participants to have sufficient financial resources and robust operational capacity to
meet obligations arising from participation in the clearing agency and to monitor compliance
with participation requirements on an ongoing basis. Rule 17Ad-22(d)(2)(i) and (ii) also require
a registered clearing agencies to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to have procedures in place to require participants to have
sufficient financial resources and robust operational capacity to meet obligations arising from
participation in the clearing agency and to monitor that participation requirements are met on an
ongoing basis. 335 Because these other requirements in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18) are the
same as those for registered clearing agencies more generally under existing Rule 17Ad22(d)(2), the Commission anticipates that covered clearing agencies may need to make only
limited changes to update their policies and procedures. 336 As with Rule 17Ad-22(d)(2), the
Commission believes these requirements are appropriate because they would further support
membership standards at covered clearing agencies that are likely to limit the potential for
member defaults and, as a result, losses to non-defaulting members in the event of a member
default.

Request for Comments. The Commission generally requests comments on all aspects of
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18). In addition, the Commission requests comments on the
following specific issues:
•

Should the Commission require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to
monitor compliance with its participation requirements on an ongoing basis? Why or
why not? Would a more specific monitoring requirement be appropriate? For example,
should this requirement specify a frequency of review? Why or why not? If so, what
would be the appropriate frequency of review? Please explain.

•

Would it be appropriate for the Commission to require a covered clearing agency’s
policies and procedures to provide for different categories of participation? If so, please
explain in detail what these different categories would be and why they would be
appropriate.
16. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19): Tiered Participation Agreements
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,

implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
identify, monitor, and manage the material risks to the covered clearing agency arising from
arrangements in which firms that are indirect participants in the covered clearing agency rely on
the services provided by direct participants in the covered clearing agency to access the covered
clearing agency’s payment, clearing, or settlement facilities (hereinafter “tiered participation
arrangements”). 337 The Commission preliminarily believes the proposed rule is appropriate due
337

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19), infra Part VII. Because proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(19) only addresses the situation where a covered clearing agency relies on direct
participants, the proposed rule does not apply to a broker-dealer that is a member of a CSD and
maintains accounts for retail customers.

176

to the associated dependencies and risk exposures that tiered participation arrangements create,
as discussed above. Such risks, including credit, liquidity, and operational risks, can undermine
the operations of a covered clearing agency and pose risks to the operations of a clearing
agency’s participants, both direct and indirect, and to the broader securities markets as well.
Registered clearing agencies are currently not subject to rules regarding tiered
participation arrangements under existing Rule 17Ad-22. The Commission preliminarily
believes the proposed rule is appropriate for covered clearing agencies, given the risks that a
covered clearing agency’s size, operation, and importance pose to the U.S. securities markets,
and is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act discussed above. 338
The Commission has previously noted that, in situations where direct access to clearing
agencies is limited by reasonable participation standards, firms that do not meet these standards
may still be able to access clearing agencies through correspondent clearing arrangements with
direct participants. 339 Such a process would involve the non-participant entering into a
correspondent clearing arrangement with a participant so that the transaction may be submitted
by the participant to the clearing agency. The dependencies and risk exposures, including credit,
liquidity, and operational risks, inherent in tiered participation arrangements present risks to a
clearing agency and its functioning, in addition to the direct participant. A covered clearing
agency with direct participants that clear transactions on behalf of indirect participants with large

the regulatory framework under Section 17A of the Exchange Act, as amended by the DoddFrank Act).

agencies, security-based swap execution facilities, and national securities exchanges with respect
to security-based swaps under Regulation MC).

177

values or volumes faces the risk of default by both the indirect participant itself and the direct
participant through which those transactions are routed. Accordingly the Commission is
proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) to promote the ongoing management of risks associated with
such tiered participation arrangements.
In addition, the Commission is proposing to require that a covered clearing agency
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to regularly review the material risks to the covered clearing agency arising from such tiered
participation arrangements. 340 The Commission preliminarily believes the proposed requirement
is appropriate due to the ongoing dependencies and risk exposures that tiered arrangements
present to the operation of a covered clearing agency and to the operation of a covered clearing
agency’s participants. Registered clearing agencies are currently not subject to a similar
requirement under existing Rule 17Ad-22, and that the proposed rule is appropriate for covered
clearing agencies, given the risks that a covered clearing agency’s size, operation, and
importance pose to the U.S. securities markets, and is consistent with the requirements of the
Exchange Act discussed above. 341
The operational, financial, and other interconnections between direct and indirect
participants to tiered participation arrangements are subject to market forces and can therefore
change over time. Because direct and indirect participants collectively contribute to the
operational and financial stability of a covered clearing agency, the Commission preliminarily
believes that the requirement to regularly review a covered clearing agency’s tiered participation

arrangements supports the Exchange Act requirements that clearing agencies be able to facilitate
prompt and accurate clearance and settlement, protect investors and the public interest, and
ensure the safeguarding of securities and funds in the custody or control of the clearing agency or
for which the clearing agency is responsible. 342
Request for Comments. The Commission generally requests comments on all aspects of
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19). In addition, the Commission requests comments on the
following specific issues:
•

Should the Commission require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to
identify, monitor and manage the material risks to the covered clearing agency arising
from arrangements in which firms that are indirect participants in the covered clearing
agency rely on the services provided by direct participants to access the covered clearing
agency’s payment, clearing, or settlement facilities? Why or why not?

•

Has the Commission provided sufficient guidance regarding who would be “indirect
participants” and “direct participants”? Why or why not?
17. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20): Links
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,

implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
identify, monitor, and manage risks related to any link with one or more other clearing agencies,
FMUs, or trading markets. 343 Rule 17Ad-22(d)(7) requires registered clearing agencies to have

342

See 15 U.S.C 78q-1(b)(3)(A).

343

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20), infra Part VII.

179

policies and procedures for evaluating the potential sources of risks that can arise from links. 344
For the purposes of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20), however, the Commission would further define “link”
in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(10) to mean any set of contractual and operational arrangements
between a covered clearing agency and one or more other clearing agencies, FMUs, or trading
venues that connect them directly or indirectly for the purposes of participating in settlement,
cross margining, expanding its services to additional instruments and participants, or for any
other purposes material to their business. 345 The Commission preliminarily believes this
expanded and more prescriptive approach to defining a link is appropriate for covered clearing
agencies given their size, global operation, and importance to the U.S. securities markets.
In addition to the requirements discussed above, 346 Section 17A of the Exchange Act
directs the Commission to facilitate the establishment of linked or coordinated facilities for
clearance and settlement. 347 Links between clearing agencies, FMUs, and trading markets
develop in several circumstances for different reasons. A CCP may establish a link with another

344

Rule 17Ad-22(d)(7) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to evaluate the
potential sources of risks that can arise when the clearing agency establishes links either crossborder or domestically to clear or settle trades, and ensure that the risks are managed prudently
on an ongoing basis. See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(7); see also Clearing Agency Standards
Release, supra note 5, at 66250–51.
345

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(10), infra Part VII.

346

See notes 54–56 and accompanying text; see also Parts I.A and B (generally discussing
the regulatory framework under Section 17A of the Exchange Act, as amended by the DoddFrank Act).
347

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(a)(2)(A)(ii); see also 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(a)(1)(D) (Congress finding
that the linking of all clearance and settlement facilities and the development of uniform
standards and procedures for clearance and settlement will reduce unnecessary costs and increase
the protection of investors and persons facilitating transactions by and acting on behalf of
investors).

CCP to enable a participant in the first CCP to clear trades with a participant in the second CCP.
Similarly, a CSD may establish a link with another CSD to enable its participants to access
services provided by the other CSD. Clearing agencies may also generally establish links with
trade repositories and trading markets to fulfill regulatory obligations.
Accordingly, the Commission is proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20) to ensure that covered
clearing agencies identify and assess the potential sources of risk arising from a link arrangement
and incorporate that analysis into its risk management policies and procedures. In certain cases,
the creation of a link may raise risks similar to those raised by tiered participation arrangements
and participant requirements, discussed above: namely, the interconnections between the clearing
agency and the other entity may increase the risks to the clearing agency stemming from, among
other things, the risks of participant default, credit losses, or liquidity shortfalls arising through
the linked entity rather than the clearing agency’s own operations. 348 The range of implicated
risks is broad; a clearing agency that operates links may increase its exposure to legal,
operational, custody, settlement, credit, and liquidity risk depending on the nature and extent of
the link involved.
Request for Comments. The Commission generally requests comments on all aspects of
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20) and 17Ad-22(a)(10). In addition, the Commission requests
comments on the following specific issue:
•

Should the Commission require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to
identify, monitor, and manage risks related to any link the covered clearing agency

348

See supra Parts II.B.15 and 16 (discussing the access and participation requirements in
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18) and requirements for tiered participation arrangements in
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19)).

establishes with one or more other clearing agencies, FMUs, or trading markets? Why or
why not?
•

Is the definition of “link” in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(10) appropriate and sufficiently
clear in light of the proposed requirements? Why or why not? Is there an alternative
definition that the Commission should consider?
18. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21): Efficiency and Effectiveness
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,

implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
that it is efficient and effective in meeting the requirements of its participants and the markets it
serves. 349 Rule 17Ad-22(d)(6) similarly requires registered clearing agencies to have policies
and procedures designed to be cost-effective in meeting the requirements of participants while
maintaining safe and secure operations. 350
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21) would further require a covered clearing agency’s
management to regularly review the efficiency and effectiveness of its (i) clearing and settlement
arrangements; (ii) operating structure, including risk management policies, procedures, and
systems; (iii) scope of products cleared, settled, or recorded; and (iv) use of technology and
communication procedures. 351 The Commission preliminarily believes this requirement for

349

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21), infra Part VII.

350

Rule 17Ad-22(d)(6) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to be cost-effective in
meeting the requirements of participants while maintaining safe and secure operations. See 17
CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(6); see also Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra note 5, at 66250.
351

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21), infra Part VII.

182

regular review is appropriate for covered clearing agencies given the risks that a covered clearing
agency’s size, global operation, and importance pose to the U.S. securities markets. 352
For purposes of the proposed rule, efficiency refers generally to the efficient use of
resources by a clearing agency to perform its functions, and effectiveness refers to its ability to
meet its intended goals and objectives. A covered clearing agency that operates inefficiently or
functions ineffectively may distort financial activity and market structure, increasing not only the
risks borne by its members, but also the risks of indirect participants, such as the customers of
participants or other buyers and sellers of securities. If a covered clearing agency is inefficient, a
participant may choose not to trade or may choose to settle bilaterally, which could potentially
result in greater risks to the U.S. financial system than would otherwise occur in the presence of
a more efficiently functioning covered clearing agency.
In addition to the requirements discussed above, 353 Section 17A of the Exchange Act
requires that registered clearing agencies have rules designed to promote the prompt and accurate
clearance and settlement of securities transactions, 354 following a finding by Congress that
inefficient procedures for clearance and settlement impose unnecessary costs on investors and
persons facilitating transactions by and acting on behalf of investors. 355 The Commission

the regulatory framework under Section 17A of the Exchange Act, as amended by the DoddFrank Act).

effective, and safe procedures for clearance and settlement).
183

preliminarily believes that proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21) is appropriate because a covered
clearing agency must be designed and operated to meet the needs of its participants and the
markets it serves, while remaining sufficiently flexible to respond to changing demand and new
technologies.
The Commission is also proposing to require that a covered clearing agency regularly
review the items identified in Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21)(i) through (iv) because the Commission
preliminarily believes that they are reflective of key aspects of a clearing agency’s business
necessary for efficient and effective operation. Moreover, because technology, sound practices,
market forces, and the number and characteristics of participants may change over time, the
Commission preliminarily believes that measures of efficiency and effectiveness must be subject
to policies and procedures for regular review.
Request for Comments. The Commission generally requests comments on all aspects of
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21). In addition, the Commission requests comments on the
following specific issues:
•

Has the Commission provided sufficient guidance on what policies and procedures would
be necessary to ensure that a covered clearing agency is “efficient and effective” in
meeting the requirements of the proposed rule? Why or why not?

•

Is the proposed requirement for a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to
regularly review the following aspects of its business and operations appropriate: clearing
and settlement arrangements; operating structure, including risk management policies,
procedures, and systems; the scope of products cleared, settled, or recorded; and the use
of technology and communication procedures? Why or why not? Should the

184

Commission require that other aspects of a covered clearing agency’s business and
operations be subject to regular review?
19. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22): Communication Procedures and
Standards
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
that it uses, or at a minimum accommodates, relevant internationally accepted communication
procedures and standards in order to facilitate efficient payment, clearing, and settlement. 356 No
comparable requirement exists for registered clearing agencies under Rule 17Ad-22(d). The
Commission preliminarily believes this proposed requirement is appropriate for covered clearing
agencies given a covered clearing agency’s size and global operation. The Commission
understands that covered clearing agencies currently use the relevant internationally accepted
communication procedures and standards, 357 so the Commission expects only limited changes
may be necessary to satisfy the requirements of the proposed rule.
The ability of participants to communicate with a covered clearing agency in a timely,
reliable, and accurate manner is important to achieving prompt and accurate clearance and
settlement. The Commission preliminarily believes that requiring policies and procedures in line
with internationally accepted communication procedures and standards is appropriate for a
covered clearing agency for two reasons. First, internationally accepted communication
procedures and standards, because they are widely accepted and adopted standards, reduce the

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22), infra Part VII.

Paper, 2012), available at http://www.infosys.com/finacle/solutions/thoughtpapers/Documents/messaging-standards-financial-industry.pdf (describing messaging standards

185

likelihood of errors and technical complexity in the clearance and settlement process, thereby
reducing risks and costs, improving efficiency, and reducing barriers to entry. Such procedures
and standards would include standardized protocols for exchanging messages and reference data
for identifying financial instruments and counterparties.
Second, internationally accepted communication procedures and standards ensure
effective communication with direct and indirect participants, which the Commission
preliminarily believes is important for covered clearing agencies, given the global nature of their
businesses. Securities markets in the United States are among the largest and most actively
traded in the world, with direct and indirect participants from numerous other countries that
necessitate the development and use of internationally accepted communication procedures and
standards. Accordingly, the Commission preliminarily believes that covered clearing agencies
are likely to be engaged in transactions across borders, where standardized communications
protocols and mechanisms are essential to ensure prompt and accurate clearance and settlement.
Request for Comments. The Commission generally requests comments on all aspects of
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22). In addition, the Commission requests comments on the
following specific issues:
•

Should the Commission require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to
use, or at a minimum accommodate, relevant internationally accepted communication
procedures and standards in order to facilitate efficient payment, clearing, and
settlement? Why or why not?

•

Is the Commission’s assumption that covered clearing agencies are already using
internationally accepted communication procedures correct? Why or why not?

186

•

Has the Commission provided sufficient guidance on what “relevant internationally
accepted communication procedures and standards” would be appropriate under the
proposed policies and procedures requirement? Why or why not?
20. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23): Disclosure of Rules, Key Procedures, and
Market Data
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,

implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
maintain clear and comprehensive rules and procedures that provide for the specific disclosures
enumerated in the rule, as discussed below. 358 The proposed rule would require such policies
and procedures to specifically require a covered clearing agency to (i) publicly disclose all
relevant rules and material procedures, including key aspects of its default rules and procedures;
(ii) provide sufficient information to enable participants to identify and evaluate the risks, fees,
and other material costs they incur by participating in the covered clearing agency; and (iii)
publicly disclose relevant basic data on transaction volume and values. 359 As with public

358

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23), infra Part VII; see also Parts II.B.20.a and b
(discussing the specific disclosures enumerated in the proposed rule).
The Commission is proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) as part of a comprehensive set of
rules for regulating covered clearing agencies that is consistent with and comparable to other
domestic and international standards for FMIs.
The Commission notes that Rule 17Ad-22(c)(2) currently requires a registered clearing
agency, within 60 days after the end of its fiscal year, to post on its website its annual audited
financial statements. See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(c)(2); see also Clearing Agency Standards
Release, supra note 5, at 66244.
359

In full, Rule 17Ad-22(d)(9) requires registered clearing agencies to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide market
participants with sufficient information for them to identify and evaluate the risks and costs
associated with using its services. See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(9); see also Clearing Agency
Standards Release, supra note 5, at 66252–53.

187

disclosures contemplated under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(20), a covered clearing agency could
comply with the proposed requirement by posting the relevant documentation to its website. The
Commission preliminarily believes the proposed rule is appropriate to promote continued
transparency at covered clearing agencies and thereby continue to facilitate prompt and accurate
clearance and settlement.
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(9) currently requires registered clearing agencies to have policies and
procedures to facilitate disclosures similar to proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(ii), but does not
require policies and procedures similar to proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(23)(i) and (iii). The
Commission preliminarily believes these additional requirements are appropriate for a covered
clearing agency given the risks that a covered clearing agency’s size, operation, and importance
pose to the U.S. securities markets because these disclosures provide the relevant authorities with
information that further facilitates supervision of the covered clearing agency, including
information that may allow the relevant authorities to better assess the covered clearing agency’s
observance of risk management requirements and better identify possible risks posed by the
covered clearing agency, and provide relevant stakeholders with information regarding risks
associated with participation in a covered clearing agency.
In addition to the Exchange Act requirements described above, 360 Section 17A of the
Exchange Act requires registered clearing agencies to have rules designed to foster cooperation
and coordination with persons engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities
transactions. 361 The Commission preliminarily believes that requiring a covered clearing agency
360

See notes 54–56 and accompanying text; see also Parts I.A and B (generally discussing
the regulatory framework under Section 17A of the Exchange Act, as amended by the DoddFrank Act).
361

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)(F).
188

to have policies and procedures reasonably designed to disclose sufficient information so that
participants can identify risks and costs associated with using the covered clearing agency would
allow participants to make informed decisions about the use of the covered clearing agency and
to take appropriate actions to mitigate their risks and to better understand the costs associated
with their use of the covered clearing agency. Similarly, the Commission preliminarily believes
that requiring a covered clearing agency to publicly disclose relevant basic data on transaction
volume and values would allow regulators, market participants, and market observers to make
informed decisions about the activities of the covered clearing agency and to take appropriate
action, if necessary, in response.
Pursuant to existing Commission regulations, changes to the rules of an SRO, including
clearing agencies, are required to be available on the SRO’s website and are published by the
Commission. 362 The Commission’s proposed rule is designed to promote understanding among
market participants of the policies and procedures of covered clearing agencies, and the
Commission believes the proposed rule is consistent with existing requirements for SROs.
Continued and improved understanding of the risks and costs associated with using a covered
clearing agency’s services should promote confidence generally in the covered clearing agency’s
ability to set and manage appropriately risks and costs, such as margin requirements, restrictions
on or limitations of the covered clearing agency’s obligations, and conditions used by the
covered clearing agency to test the adequacy of its financial resources. The Commission

362

See 17 CFR 240.19b-4(l) (requiring an SRO to post each proposed rule change, and any
amendments thereto, on its website within two business days of filing with the Commission); 17
CFR 240.19b-4(i) (requiring SROs to retain for public inspection and copying all filings made
pursuant to this section and all correspondence and other communications reduced to writing,
including comment letters, to and from such SRO concerning any such filing).

189

preliminarily believes these requirements are especially important for covered clearing agencies
given their size and importance.
The Commission notes that these policies and procedures requirements are intended in
part to codify disclosure practices currently undertaken by some registered clearing agencies on
an elective basis. 363
Below is a discussion of the specific disclosures required under the proposed rule, which
are not similarly required of registered clearing agencies under Rule 17Ad-22(d)(9). The
Commission preliminarily believes that these additions to a covered clearing agency’s disclosure
practices are important to ensure clearing members and the public have access to up-to-date
information about the covered clearing agency’s activities, policies, and procedures, which
would promote confidence in its operations and thereby contribute to the prompt and accurate
clearance and settlement of securities transactions. 364
a. Comprehensive Public Disclosure
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(iv) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
maintain clear and comprehensive rules and procedures that provide for a comprehensive public
disclosure of its material rules, policies, and procedures regarding governance arrangements and
legal, financial, and operational risk management, accurate in all material respects at the time of
363

See, e.g., DTC, Assessment of Compliance with Recommendations for Securities
Settlement Systems (Dec. 2011), available at http://dtcc.com/legal/policy-and-compliance.aspx.
364

As noted above, the Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed requirement for
a comprehensive public disclosure is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act, Rule
19b-4, and the current practices of some clearing agencies that would be covered clearing
agencies. See supra notes 362–363 and accompanying text; see also Part IV.B.3.i (discussing
the current practices of registered clearing agencies with respect to transparency and disclosure).

190

publication, including (i) a general background of the covered clearing agency, including its
function and the market it serves, basic data and performance statistics on its services and
operations, such as basic volume and value statistics by product type, average aggregate intraday
exposures to its participants, and statistics on the covered clearing agency’s operational
reliability, and a description of its general organization, legal and regulatory framework, and
system design and operations; (ii) a standard-by-standard summary narrative for each applicable
standard set forth in proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(1) through (22) with sufficient detail and
context to enable the reader to understand its approach to controlling the risks and addressing the
requirements in each standard; (iii) a summary of material changes since the last update of the
disclosure; and (iv) an executive summary of the key points regarding each. 365 The Commission
is proposing to require that the comprehensive public disclosure provide basic data and
performance statistics, such as statistics on the covered clearing agency’s operational reliability
so that the relevant stakeholders and the general public have data regarding, for example,
performance targets for systems and the actual performance of systems over specified periods
and targets for recovery. The Commission is also proposing to require that the comprehensive
public disclosure include a standard-by-standard summary narrative to elicit a summary
discussion of a covered clearing agency’s implementation of policies and procedures
requirements that would need to be established, implemented, maintained and enforced by a
covered clearing agency in response to proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(1) through (23). In addition,
the Commission is proposing to require a summary of material changes and would expect that a
covered clearing agency should consider its particular circumstances, such as, for example,

365

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(iv), infra Part VI.

191

changes in the scope of services provided by the covered clearing agency, in satisfying this
requirement.
The Commission preliminarily believes that disclosure of the above required information
will provide participants with the information necessary to, at a minimum, identify and evaluate
the risks and costs associated with use of the covered clearing agency, thereby promoting
transparency and enhancing competition and market discipline. The Commission preliminarily
believes it would also provide other stakeholders, including regulators and the public, with
information that facilitates informed oversight and decision-making regarding covered clearing
agencies.
b. Updates to the Comprehensive Public Disclosure
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(v) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure
the comprehensive public disclosure required under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(iv) is
updated not less than every two years, or more frequently following changes to its system or the
environment in which it operates to the extent necessary, to ensure statements previously
provided remain accurate in all material respects. 366 The Commission preliminarily believes that
ensuring statements previously provided remain accurate would require a covered clearing
agency’s comprehensive public disclosure to provide statements that would provide a market
participant with an accurate representation of the risks and costs of participating in the covered
clearing agency.
The Commission preliminarily believes that this requirement would help provide
participants, regulators, other stakeholders, and the public with disclosures that are current,
366

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(v), infra Part VI.

192

accurate, and comprehensive, thereby promoting transparency and enhancing competition and
market discipline. The Commission preliminarily believes it would also provide other
stakeholders, including regulators and the public, with timely information that facilitates
informed oversight and decision-making regarding covered clearing agencies, thereby promoting
the clearing agency obligations required under Section 17A of the Exchange Act. 367
c. Request for Comments
The Commission generally requests comments on all aspects of proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(23). In addition, the Commission requests comments on the following specific issues:
•

Should the Commission require a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to
maintain clear and comprehensive rules and procedures that provide for the specific
disclosures proposed under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)? Why or why not? Are there rules and
procedures that should not be fully disclosed to participants? Please explain in detail
what such rules and procedures would be and why they should not be disclosed to
participants.

•

In imposing certain minimum requirements for policies and procedures regarding the
comprehensive public disclosure, has the Commission provided sufficient guidance
regarding what elements must appear in the disclosure? Should different elements
appear? Should the Commission require policies and procedures to update the
comprehensive public disclosure every two years, as proposed? Should the Commission
require policies and procedures to update the comprehensive public disclosure more
frequently following changes to its system or the environment in which it operates to the

367

extent necessary to ensure the statements provided remain accurate in all material
respects? Why or why not?
•

Are certain ways that covered clearing agencies communicate information to market
participants more effective than others? For example, does including information in a
covered clearing agency’s rulebook or published interpretive materials provide adequate
notice of the risks and costs of being a participant to persons that are not currently
participants in the covered clearing agency? Why or why not?

•

Should the types of information that a covered clearing agency discloses under the
proposed rule be generally available to the public? Should any categories of the
information required to be disclosed under the proposed rule be restricted to certain
parties only, such as clearing members or the Commission itself? Why or why not?

•

Should the Commission require covered clearing agencies to make public disclosures of
information contained in their audited financial statements that would provide a
discussion and analysis of the covered clearing agency’s financial condition, in particular
with respect to liquidity, capital resources, and results of operations, similar to the
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
disclosure required under Items 303(a)(1) through (3) of Regulation S-K?

•

Should the Commission require that policies and procedures pursuant to proposed Rule
17Ad-22(e)(23) specify a certain form for the disclosures (e.g., using tagged or structured
data)? Why or why not? What form should the proposed disclosures take? Please
explain.

C. Proposed Rule 17Ab2-2
The Commission is proposing Rule 17Ab2-2 to establish procedures for the Commission
to make determinations affecting covered clearing agencies. 368 Under the proposed rule, the
Commission would make determinations in three cases, as discussed below. In each case, under
proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(d), the Commission would publish notice of its intention to consider
such determinations, together with a brief statement of the grounds under consideration, and
provide at least a 30-day public comment period prior to any determination. 369 The Commission
may provide the clearing agency subject to the proposed determination opportunity for hearing
regarding the proposed determination. Under proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(e), notice of
determinations in each case would be given by prompt publication thereof, together with a
statement of written reasons supporting the determination. 370
The Commission notes that under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e), five active registered
clearing agencies would meet the definition of a covered clearing agency without action under
proposed Rule 17Ab2-2 by the Commission. 371 Because the two dormant registered clearing
agencies would not meet the definition of a covered clearing agency, if they elected to begin
providing clearance and settlement services, they could potentially be subject to a determination

See proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(d), infra Part VII.

370

See proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(e), infra Part VII.

371

See supra notes 82–87 and accompanying text. As noted, the CFTC has been designated
the supervisory agency for two registered clearing agencies, CME and ICE, which have been
designated as systemically important by the FSOC pursuant to the Clearing Supervision Act, and
accordingly they would not be covered clearing agencies under proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e) and
17Ab2-2.

195

under Rule 17Ab2-2. 372 In addition, the Commission notes that it would consider, upon
receiving an application for registration as a clearing agency, either making a determination
regarding a registrant’s status as a covered clearing agency as part of the registration process, if
the Commission believes the clearing agency already meets the definition of a covered clearing
agency, or after registration, if the Commission determines that the clearing agency does not
meet the definition of a covered clearing agency upon registration but does so at a later date, as
either market conditions or the characteristics of the clearing agency itself change, pursuant to
proposed Rule 17Ab2-2. 373
1. Determination that a Registered Clearing Agency is a Covered Clearing
Agency
Under proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(a), the Commission may, if it deems appropriate, upon
application by any registered clearing agency or member thereof, or on its own initiative,
determine whether a registered clearing agency should be considered a covered clearing
agency. 374 In determining whether a registered clearing agency should be considered a covered
clearing agency, the Commission may consider characteristics such as the clearing of financial
instruments that are characterized by discrete jump-to-default price changes or that are highly
correlated with potential participant defaults or other such factors as it deems appropriate in the
circumstances. The Commission preliminarily believes it should reserve the right to make a
determination on its own initiative in the event that it independently determines that a registered
clearing agency meets the definition of a covered clearing agency, as either market conditions or
372

See supra note 88 and accompanying text.

373

See supra note 9 and accompanying text (discussing the requirements for registration as a
clearing agency pursuant to Section 17A of the Exchange Act).
374

See proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(a), infra Part VII.

196

the characteristics of the clearing agency itself change. The Commission preliminarily believes
that the clearing of financial instruments that are characterized by discrete jump-to-default price
changes or that are highly correlated with potential participant defaults are two factors that
indicate a registered clearing agency may raise systemic risk concerns supporting application of
the requirements under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e). 375
The Commission preliminarily believes that proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(a) would provide
the Commission with the flexibility necessary to achieve the goals of Section 17A of the
Exchange Act, 376 Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, 377 and the Clearing Supervision Act, 378 given
the ever-changing nature of the U.S. securities markets, including the nature and character of
participants in the market and the products required to be cleared and settled in practice. The
Commission preliminarily believes that Rule 17Ab2-2(a) is necessary to ensure that a registered
clearing agency not otherwise meeting the definition of either a designated clearing agency or a
complex risk profile clearing agency can nonetheless be subject to the requirements for covered
clearing agencies in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) upon a determination made by the Commission.
The Commission preliminarily believes this is necessary to ensure that the Commission is
appropriately able to respond to registered clearing agencies that raise systemic risk concerns
supporting application of the requirements under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e).

375

See Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra note 5, at 66234 n.162 (describing the
risks that arise from financial instruments that are characterized by discrete jump-to-default price
changes or that are highly correlated with potential participant defaults).

2. Determination that a Covered Clearing Agency Is Systemically Important
in Multiple Jurisdictions
Under proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(b), the Commission may, if it deems appropriate, upon
application by any clearing agency or member thereof, or on its own initiative, determine
whether a covered clearing agency meets the definition of “systemically important in multiple
jurisdictions.” 379 In determining whether a covered clearing agency is systemically important in
multiple jurisdictions, the Commission may consider (i) whether the covered clearing agency is a
designated clearing agency; (ii) whether the clearing agency has been determined to be
systemically important by one or more jurisdictions other than the United States through a
process that includes consideration of whether the foreseeable effects of a failure or disruption of
the designated clearing agency could threaten the stability of each relevant jurisdiction’s
financial system; 380 or (iii) such other factors as the Commission may deem appropriate in the
circumstances.
The Commission preliminarily believes that it should propose the procedures set forth in
Rule 17Ab2-2(b) for designating a covered clearing agency as systemically important in multiple
jurisdictions. Accordingly, the Commission is proposing Rule 17Ab2-2(b) to provide procedures
for determining when a clearing agency has become systemically important in multiple
jurisdictions. In this regard, the Commission preliminarily believes that proposed Rule 17Ab2-

379

See proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(b), infra Part VII.

380

The Commission notes that this provision of proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(b) parallels the
definition of systemic importance in Section 803(9) of the Clearing Supervision Act, which
states that systemic importance means a situation where the failure of or a disruption to the
functioning of an FMU could create, or increase, the risk of significant liquidity or credit
problems spreading among financial institutions or markets and thereby threaten the stability of
the financial system of the United States. See 12 U.S.C. 5462(9).

198

2(b)(ii) is consistent with Section 804(a)(2)(D) of the Clearing Supervision Act. 381 The
Commission is also proposing that it may consider additional factors in determining whether a
covered clearing agency is systemically important in multiple jurisdictions, in addition to
whether the foreseeable effects of a failure or disruption of the designated clearing agency could
threaten the stability of multiple jurisdictions’ financial systems. Such analysis could include
whether foreign regulatory authorities have designated the covered clearing agency as
systemically important and whether any findings were made in anticipation of that designation.
3. Determination that a Clearing Agency Has a More Complex Risk Profile
Under proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(c), the Commission may, if it deems appropriate,
determine whether any of the activities of a clearing agency providing central counterparty
services, in addition to clearing agencies registered with the Commission for the purpose of
clearing security-based swaps, have a more complex risk profile. 382 In determining whether a
clearing agency’s activity has a more complex risk profile, the Commission may consider (i)
characteristics such as the clearing of financial instruments that are characterized by discrete
jump-to-default price changes or that are highly correlated with potential participant defaults;
and (ii) such other characteristics as it deems appropriate in the circumstances. The Commission
preliminarily believes that the clearing of financial instruments that are characterized by discrete
jump-to-default price changes or that are highly correlated with potential participant defaults are

381

See 12 U.S.C. 5463(a)(2)(D) (listing, as one of the systemic importance criteria for the
FSOC to consider, the effect that the failure of or a disruption to the FMU or PCS activity would
have on critical markets, financial institutions, or the broader financial system).
382

See proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(c), infra Part VII.
199

two factors that indicate a registered clearing agency raises systemic risk concerns supporting
application of the requirements under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e). 383
The Commission preliminarily believes that proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(c) would provide
the Commission with the flexibility necessary to achieve the goals of Section 17A of the
Exchange Act, 384 Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, 385 and the Clearing Supervision Act, 386 given
the dynamic nature of the U.S. securities markets, including the nature and character of
participants in the market and the products required to be cleared and settled in practice, by
permitting the Commission to determine that certain registered clearing agencies are complex
risk profile clearing agencies. The Commission also preliminarily believes that activities
involving a more complex risk profile, because they may involve the clearing of financial
instruments that are characterized by discrete jump-to-default price changes or that are highly
correlated with potential participant defaults, implicate systemic risk concerns supporting
application of the requirements under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e). 387
4. Request for Comments
The Commission generally requests comments on all aspects of proposed Rule 17Ab2-2.
In addition, the Commission requests comments on the following specific issues:
•

Should the Commission establish procedures for making determinations affecting
covered clearing agencies? Why or why not?

should the Commission give to determinations by other jurisdictions or regulators
regarding the systemic importance in multiple jurisdictions of a covered clearing agency?
Is it appropriate for the Commission to assess whether such determination was made
through a process that includes consideration of whether the foreseeable effects of a
failure or disruption of the designated clearing agency could threaten the stability of each
relevant jurisdiction’s financial system, as proposed? Please explain. Are there
particular other factors that the Commission should consider? If so, please explain the
relevance of those characteristics in detail.

PFMI Report’s use of “systemic importance in multiple jurisdictions” and “more
complex risk profile” activities? If so, please explain.
D. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(f)
The Commission is proposing Rule 17Ad-22(f) to codify its special enforcement

authority over designated clearing agencies for which the Commission acts as the supervisory
agency, pursuant to the Clearing Supervision Act. Under Section 807(c) of the Clearing
Supervision Act, for purposes of enforcing the provisions of the Clearing Supervision Act, a
designated clearing agency is subject to, and the Commission has authority under, the provisions
of subsections (b) through (n) of Section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act in the same

202

manner and to the same extent as if a designated clearing agency were an insured depository
institution and the Commission were the appropriate Federal banking agency for such insured
depository institution. 388
Request for Comments. The Commission requests comment on proposed Rule 17Ad22(f), including whether the proposed rule is clear and consistent with the requirements of the
Exchange Act and the Clearing Supervision Act.
E. Proposed Amendment to Rule 17Ad-22(d)
To facilitate consistency with proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e), the Commission is proposing to
amend Rule 17Ad-22(d). Rule 17Ad-22(d) sets forth certain minimum requirements for the
operation and governance of registered clearing agencies. 389 The first paragraph of Rule 17Ad22(d) currently provides that a registered clearing agency shall establish, implement, maintain
and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to fulfill the requirements of
Rule 17Ad-22(d), as applicable. The Commission is proposing to amend this first paragraph of
Rule 17Ad-22(d) to state that Rule 17Ad-22(d) applies to registered clearing agencies other than
covered clearing agencies. 390 As a result, the proposed amendment would limit the applicability
of Rule 17Ad-22(d) to CME and ICE, as systemically important FMUs for which the CFTC is
the supervisory agency under the Clearing Supervision Act, 391 the two registered but dormant

clearing agencies, 392 and any clearing agency registered with the Commission in the future that is
not one of the following: a designated clearing agency, a complex risk profile clearing agency, or
a clearing agency that the Commission has otherwise determined to be a covered clearing agency
pursuant to proposed Rule 17Ab2-2. 393
Request for Comments. The Commission requests comment on the proposed amendment
to Rule 17Ad-22(d), including whether the proposed amendment is clear and consistent with the
requirements of the Exchange Act, the Clearing Supervision Act, and proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)
thereunder.
III. Paperwork Reduction Act
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”) 394 imposes certain requirements on
federal agencies in connection with the conducting or sponsoring of any “collection of
information.” 395 More specifically, an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not
required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid control
number. Additionally, 44 U.S.C. 3507(a)(1)(D) provides that before adopting (or revising) a
collection of information requirement, an agency must, among other things, publish a notice in
the Federal Register stating that the agency has submitted the proposed collection of information
to the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) and setting forth certain required
information, including (1) a title for the collection of information; (2) a summary of the
collection information; (3) a brief description of the need for the information and the proposed
392

See supra note 88 and accompanying text (discussing SCCP and BSECC).

393

See supra Part II.A.1 (further discussing the scope of the proposed rules).

394

44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.

395

See 44 U.S.C. 3502(3).

204

use of the information; (4) a description of the likely respondents and proposed frequency of
response to the collection of information; (5) an estimate of the paperwork burden that shall
result from the collection of information; and (6) notice that comments may be submitted to the
agency and director of OMB. 396
Certain provisions of the proposed rules would impose new “collection of information”
requirements within the meaning of the PRA. Accordingly, the Commission has submitted the
information to the OMB for review in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3507 and 5 CFR 1320.11. A
title and control number already exists for Rule 17Ad-22 adopted in October 2012 (OMB
Control No. 3235-0695 for “Clearing Agency Standards for Operation and Governance”).
Because the Commission is proposing to revise the collection of information under this proposed
rulemaking for amendments to Rule 17Ad-22, the Commission will use OMB Control No. 32350695 for the collections of information for proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e).
Additionally, proposed Rule 17Ab2-2 would contain a new collection of information
requirement for PRA purposes. The title of the new collection of information under this
proposed rulemaking is Determinations Affecting Covered Clearing Agencies (a proposed new
collection of information).
A. Overview and Organization
The Commission preliminarily believes information that would be required to be
collected by virtue of written policies and procedure requirements contained in this proposed
rulemaking reflects to a degree existing practices at covered clearing agencies. 397 In certain
instances, however, the proposed requirements would require covered clearing agencies to
396

See 44 U.S.C. 3507(a)(1)(D); see also 5 CFR 1320.5(a)(1)(iv).

397

See infra Part IV.B.3 (describing current practices at registered clearing agencies).

205

establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to comply with this proposed rulemaking.
With regard to proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e), given that several provisions of the proposed
rule are intended to be consistent with Rule 17Ad-22, the Commission preliminarily believes that
covered clearing agencies currently in compliance with the requirements of existing Rule 17Ad22 may already have some written rules and procedures similar to those in proposed Rule 17Ad22(e). Accordingly, when covered clearing agencies review and update their policies and
procedures in order to come into compliance with proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e), the Commission
preliminarily believes that the PRA burden would vary across the requirements of proposed Rule
17Ad-22(e), based on the complexities of the requirements under each paragraph of the proposed
rule and the extent to which covered clearing agencies currently comply with the proposed
requirements under their existing policies and procedures. 398
The portions of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) for which the PRA burden is preliminarily
expected to be higher are the provisions contemplating requirements not addressed in Rule
17Ad-22, as discussed in Part II.A.4. Because these proposed requirements may not reflect
established practices of covered clearing agencies or reflect the normal course of their activities,
the PRA burden for these proposed rules may entail both initial one-time burdens to create new
written policies and procedures and ongoing burdens. The expected PRA burden for the
proposed rules is discussed in detail below. 399

398

For a discussion of the differences between Rule 17Ad-22(d) and proposed Rule 17Ad22(e), see Parts II.B.1–20.

399

See infra Parts III.D.6 (estimated burdens under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)) and 7
(estimated burdens under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19)).

206

In addition to the collection of information requirements imposed under proposed Rule
17Ad-22(e), proposed Rule 17Ab2-2 also would contain collection of information requirements
for PRA purposes. Proposed Rule 17Ab2-2 establishes a process for making determinations
regarding whether or not a clearing agency would be a covered clearing agency and whether a
covered clearing agency is either involved in activities with a more complex risk profile or
systemically important in multiple jurisdictions. 400 The expected PRA burden for proposed Rule
17Ab2-2 is discussed below.
B. Summary of Collection of Information and Proposed Use of Information for
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) 401 and Proposed Rule 17Ab2-2
1. Proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(1) through (3): General Organization
a. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide
for a well-founded, clear, transparent and enforceable legal basis for each aspect of its activities
in all relevant jurisdictions. 402 The purpose of this collection of information is to reduce the
legal risks involved in the clearance and settlement process and to ensure that a covered clearing
agency’s policies and procedures do not cause legal uncertainty among participants due to a lack
of clarity, completeness, or conflicts with applicable laws and judicial precedent.

400

See infra Part II.C (further discussing the purpose, scope, and application of proposed
Rule 17Ab2-2) and Part VII (proposed text of Rule 17Ab2-2).
401

Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) would require covered clearing agencies to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce certain written policies and procedures that would be used,
among other things, in connection with staff examinations.

402

See supra Part II.B.1 (discussing proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1)) and infra Part VII
(providing the proposed rule text).

207

b. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide
for governance arrangements that are clear and transparent, clearly prioritize the safety and
efficiency of the covered clearing agency, and support the public interest requirements of Section
17A of the Exchange Act, and the objectives of owners and participants. Proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(2) would also require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide for governance
arrangements reasonably designed to establish that the covered clearing agency’s board of
directors and senior management have appropriate experience and skills to discharge their duties
and responsibilities. 403
The purpose of this collection of information is to promote boards of directors that are
composed of qualified members and that exercise oversight of the covered clearing agency’s
management, while also prioritizing the safety and efficiency of the covered clearing agency and
supporting the public interest.
c. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
maintain a sound risk management framework for comprehensively managing legal, credit,
liquidity, operational, general business, investment, custody, and other risks that arise in or are
borne by the covered clearing agency. Under the proposed rule, risk management policies,
403

See supra Part II.B.2 (discussing proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2)) and infra Part VII
(providing the proposed rule text).

208

procedures, and systems must provide for the identifying, measuring, monitoring, and managing
of risks that arise in or are borne by the covered clearing agency. Such policies and procedures
must be subject to review on a specified periodic basis and be approved by the board of directors
annually. The proposed rule would require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide for plans
for the recovery and orderly wind-down of the covered clearing agency in the event of credit
losses, liquidity shortfalls, losses from general business risk, or any other losses. The proposed
rule would also require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to establish that risk management and
internal audit personnel have sufficient resources, authority, and independence from
management. The proposed rule would further require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
establish that risk management and internal audit personnel have a direct reporting line to, and
are overseen by, a risk management committee and an audit committee of the board of directors,
respectively. The proposed rule would also require policies and procedures providing for an
independent audit committee. 404
The purpose of this collection of information is to enhance a covered clearing agency’s
ability to identify, monitor, and manage the risks clearing agencies face, including by subjecting
the relevant policies and procedures to regular review, and to facilitate an orderly recovery and
wind-down process in the event that a covered clearing agency is unable to continue operating as
a going concern.
404

See supra Part II.B.3 (discussing proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)) and infra Part VII
(providing the proposed rule text).

209

2. Proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4) through (7): Financial Risk Management
a. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
effectively identify, measure, monitor, and manage its credit exposures to each participant and
those exposures arising from payment, clearing, and settlement processes. Proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(4)(i) would require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to maintain sufficient financial
resources to cover its credit exposure to each member fully with a high degree of confidence. To
the extent not already maintained pursuant to proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i), a covered clearing
agency that provides CCP services would also have to establish, implement, maintain, and
enforce written policies and procedures to meet either the “cover one” requirement under
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(iii) or, if it is a complex risk profile clearing agency or
systemically important in multiple jurisdictions, the “cover two” requirement under proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(ii).
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(iv) would require covered clearing agencies to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to cover
its credit exposures by including prefunded financial resources and excluding assessments for
additional guaranty fund contributions or other resources that are not prefunded, when
calculating financial resources available to meet the requirements under proposed Rules 17Ad22(e)(4)(i) through (iii), as applicable. 405
405

See supra Part II.B.4.c (discussing proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)) and infra Part VII
(providing the proposed rule text).

210

Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(v) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
maintain the financial resources required under proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i) through (iii), as
applicable, in combined or separately maintained clearing or guaranty funds, and to test the
sufficiency of its total financial resources by conducting a stress test of total financial resources
once each day using standard predetermined parameters and assumptions.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to test the
sufficiency of its total financial resources available to meet the minimum financial resource
requirements under proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i) through (iii), as applicable, by conducting
stress tests and other comprehensive analyses. Specifically, those would include conducting a
stress test of its total financial resources once each day using standard predetermined parameters
and assumptions. It would also include conducting a comprehensive analysis on at least a
monthly basis of the existing stress testing scenarios, models, and underlying parameters and
assumptions, and considering modifications to ensure that they are appropriate for determining
the covered clearing agency’s required level of default protection in light of current market
conditions. It would also include conducting a comprehensive analysis of stress testing
scenarios, models, and underlying parameters and assumptions more frequently than monthly
when the products cleared or markets served display high volatility, become less liquid, or when
the size or concentration of positions held by its participants increases significantly. It would
also include reporting the results of this analysis to appropriate decision makers, including its
risk management committee or board of directors, and to use these results to evaluate the
adequacy of and adjust its margin methodology, model parameters, models used to generate

211

clearing or guaranty fund requirements, and any other relevant aspects of its credit risk
management policies and procedures, in supporting compliance with the minimum financial
resources requirements discussed above.
Finally, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vii) would require a covered clearing agency to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to require the covered clearing agency to perform a conforming model validation for its credit
risk models at least annually, or more frequently if dictated by the covered clearing agency’s risk
management policies and procedures established under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3). 406
b. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5)
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5) would require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to limit the assets it
accepts as collateral to those with low credit, liquidity, and market risks. It also would require
policies that set and enforce appropriately conservative haircuts and concentration limits if the
covered clearing agency requires collateral to manage its or its participants’ credit exposure and
would require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to require a not-less-than-annual review of the
sufficiency of its collateral haircut and concentration limits. 407
c. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) would require a covered clearing agency that provides
CCP services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures

reasonably designed to cover its credit exposures to its participants by establishing a risk-based
margin system. The proposed rule would require such margin system to consider, and produce
margin levels commensurate with, the risks and particular attributes of each relevant product,
portfolio, and market. Furthermore, under the proposed rule the margin system would mark
participant positions to market and collect margin, including variation margin or equivalent
charges if relevant, at least daily, and include the authority and operational capacity to make
intraday margin calls in defined circumstances. The proposed rule also requires policies and
procedures with respect to the following: the calculation of margin sufficient to cover a covered
clearing agency’s potential future exposure to participants in the interval between the last margin
collection and close out of positions following a participant default; the use of reliable sources of
timely price data and procedures and sound valuation models for addressing circumstances in
which pricing data are not readily available or reliable; and the use of an appropriate method for
measuring credit exposure that accounts for relevant product risk factors and portfolio effects
across products. 408
In addition to requiring policies and procedures with respect to a risk-based margin
system, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
regularly review, test, and verify risk-based margin systems by conducting backtests at least once
each day and, at least monthly, a conforming sensitivity analysis of its margin resources and its
parameters and assumptions for backtesting, and consider modifications to ensure the backtesting
practices are appropriate for determining the adequacy of its margin resources. Such review,
408

See supra Part II.B.4.e (discussing proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)) and infra Part VII
(providing the proposed rule text).

213

testing, and verification would include conducting a conforming sensitivity analysis more
frequently than monthly when the products cleared or markets served display high volatility,
become less liquid, or when the size or concentration of positions held by participants increase or
decrease significantly. The proposed rule would also require a covered clearing agency
providing CCP services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to report the results of such conforming sensitivity analysis to
appropriate decision makers, including its risk management committee or board of directors, and
use these results to evaluate the adequacy of and adjust its margin methodology, model
parameters, and any other relevant aspects of its credit risk management policies and procedures.
Finally, under such policies and procedures, a not less than annual conforming model validation
would be required for the covered clearing agency’s margin system and related models. 409
d. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
effectively measure, monitor, and manage the liquidity risk that arises in or is borne by the
covered clearing agency, including measuring, monitoring, and managing its settlement and
funding flows on an ongoing and timely basis and its use of intraday liquidity. Under the
proposed rule, a covered clearing agency would be required to establish, implement, maintain
and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to maintain sufficient liquid
resources in all relevant currencies to effect same-day and, where appropriate, intraday and
multiday settlement of payment obligations with a high degree of confidence under a wide range
of potential stress scenarios that includes the default of the participant family that would generate
409

214

the largest aggregate payment obligation for it in extreme but plausible market conditions.
Under such policies and procedures, use of access to accounts and services at a Federal Reserve
Bank, pursuant to Section 806 of the Clearing Supervision Act, 410 or other relevant central bank,
when available and where determined to be practical by the board of directors of the covered
clearing agency, would be required. 411
For the purposes of meeting such liquid resource requirements, a covered clearing agency
would be required to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to require the holding of qualifying liquid resources in each relevant
currency for which clearing activities are performed, limited to (i) cash at the central bank of
issue or at creditworthy commercial banks; (ii) assets that are readily available and convertible
into cash through prearranged funding arrangements without material adverse change provisions,
such as committed lines of credit, committed foreign exchange swaps, committed repurchase
agreements, and other prearranged funding arrangements determined to be highly reliable even
in extreme but plausible market conditions by the board of directors, following an annual review
conducted for this purpose; and (iii) other assets that are readily available and eligible for
pledging to (or conducting other appropriate forms of transactions with) a relevant central bank,
provided that the covered clearing agency had access to routine credit at the central bank.
With respect to a covered clearing agency’s sources of liquidity, the proposed rule would
require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies
and procedures reasonably designed to undertake due diligence to confirm that it has a

215

reasonable basis to believe each of its liquidity providers, whether or not such liquidity provider
is a clearing member, has sufficient information to understand and manage the liquidity
provider’s liquidity risks, and the capacity to perform as required under its commitments to
provide liquidity. Furthermore, under such policies and procedures, on at least an annual basis, a
covered clearing agency would be required to maintain and test with each liquidity provider to
the extent practicable the covered clearing agency’s procedures and operational capacity for
accessing each type of liquidity resource by conducting stress testing of its liquidity resources
using standard and predetermined parameters and assumptions at least once each day.
Additionally, a covered clearing agency would be required to establish, implement, maintain and
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to determine the amount and
regularly test the sufficiency of the liquid resources held for purposes of meeting the minimum
liquid resource requirement by (i) conducting a stress test of its liquidity resources using standard
and predetermined parameters and assumptions at least once each day; and (ii) conducting a
comprehensive analysis of the existing stress testing scenarios, models, and underlying
parameters and assumptions used in evaluating liquidity needs and resources, and considering
modifications to ensure they are appropriate in light of current and evolving market conditions at
least once a month and more frequently when products cleared or markets served display high
volatility, become less liquid, or when the size or concentration of positions held by participants
increase significantly. 412
Under such policies and procedures required by the proposed rule, stress test results must
be reported to appropriate decision makers, including the risk management committee or board
of directors, at the covered clearing agency for use in evaluating the adequacy of and adjusting
412

See id.

216

its liquidity risk management policies and procedures. A covered clearing agency would also be
required to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to perform an annual conforming model validation of its liquidity risk
models and would be required to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to address foreseeable liquidity shortfalls that would not be
covered by its liquid resources and to seek to avoid unwinding, revoking, or delaying the sameday settlement of payment obligations. Additionally, a covered clearing agency would be
required to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures that
describe the covered clearing agency’s process to replenish any liquid resources that may be
employed during a stress event. 413
Finally, a covered clearing agency would be required to establish, implement, maintain
and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to require the covered clearing
agency to undertake an analysis at least once a year that evaluates the feasibility of maintaining
sufficient liquid resources at a minimum in all relevant currencies to effect same-day and, where
appropriate, intraday and multiday settlement of payment obligations with a high degree of
confidence under a wide range of foreseeable stress scenarios that includes, but is not limited to,
the default of the two participant families that would potentially cause the largest aggregate
credit exposure for the covered clearing agency in extreme but plausible market conditions if the
covered clearing agency provides central counterparty services and is either systemically
important in multiple jurisdictions or a clearing agency involved in activities with a more
complex risk profile.

413

See id.

217

The purpose of this information collection is to enable a covered clearing agency to be
able to effectively identify and limit exposures to participants, to maintain sufficient collateral or
margin, and to satisfy all of its settlement obligations in the event of a participant default.
3. Proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(8) through (10): Settlement
a. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to define
the point at which settlement is final no later than the end of the day on which the payment or
obligation is due and, where necessary or appropriate, either intraday or in real time. 414
b. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(9)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(9) would require covered clearing agencies to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to have
the covered clearing agency conduct its money settlements in central bank money, where
available and determined to be practical by the board of directors of the covered clearing agency,
and minimize and manage credit and liquidity risk arising from the clearing agency’s money
settlements in commercial bank money where central bank money is not used. 415
c. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(10)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(10) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies reasonably designed to set forth transparent
written standards regarding a clearing agency’s obligations with respect to the delivery of

218

physical instruments, as well as operational practices that identify, monitor, and manage the risk
associated with such physical deliveries. 416
The purpose of this information collection is to promote consistent standards of timing
and reliability in the settlement process, promote reliability in a covered clearing agency’s
settlement operations, and to provide a covered clearing agency’s participants with information
necessary to evaluate the risks and costs associated with participation in the covered clearing
agency.
4. Proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(11) through (12): CSDs and Exchange-ofValue Settlement Systems
The purpose of this collection of information is to reduce securities transfer processing
costs and risks associated with securities settlement and custody, increase the speed and
efficiency of the settlement process, and eliminate risk in transactions with linked obligations.
a. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11) would require a covered CSD to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to implement internal
auditing and other controls to safeguard the rights of securities issuers and holders and prevent
the unauthorized creation or deletion of securities. A covered CSD would also be required to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to conduct periodic and at least daily reconciliation of securities issues that the CSD maintains.
Additionally, the proposed rule would require a covered CSD to establish, implement, maintain
and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to maintain securities in an
immobilized or dematerialized form, ensure the integrity of securities issues, and minimize and

See supra Part II.B.7 (discussing proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(10)) and infra Part VII
(providing the proposed rule text).

219

manage the risks associated with the safekeeping and transfer of securities, as well as protect
assets against custody risk. 417
b. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12) would require a covered clearing agency that settles
transactions involving the settlement of two linked obligations to establish, implement, maintain
and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to eliminate principal risk by
conditioning the final settlement of one obligation upon the final settlement of the other,
irrespective of whether the covered clearing agency settles on a gross or net basis and when
finality occurs. 418
5. Proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(13) through (14): Default Management
The purpose of this collection of information is to facilitate the functioning of a covered
clearing agency in the event that a participant fails to meet its obligations, as well as limit the
extent to which a participant’s failure can spread to other participants or the covered clearing
agency itself, and to ensure the safe and effective holding and transfer of customers’ positions
and collateral in the event of a participant’s default or insolvency.
a. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) would require covered clearing agencies providing CCP
services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to ensure that a covered clearing agency subject to this rule has sufficient

authority and operational capability to contain losses and liquidity demands in a timely fashion
and continue to meet its own obligations. The proposed rule would also require that a covered
clearing agency subject to the rule establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies
and procedures reasonably designed to address the allocation of credit losses it may face if its
collateral or other resources are insufficient to fully cover its credit exposures, describe the
process whereby the clearing agency would replenish any financial resources it may use
following a default or other event in which the use of such resources is contemplated, and require
participants and other stakeholders, to the extent applicable, to participate in the testing and
review of its default procedures, including any close out procedures. Under such policies and
procedures, the testing and review must occur at least annually and following any material
changes thereto. 419
b. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) would require a covered clearing agency that provides
CCP services for security-based swaps or engages in activities that the Commission has
determined to have a more complex risk profile to establish, implement, maintain and enforce
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to enable the segregation and portability of
positions of a participant’s customers and collateral and effectively protect such positions and
collateral from the default or insolvency of that participant. 420

6. Proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(15) through (17): General Business and
Operational Risk Management
The purpose of this collection of information is to mitigate the potential impairment of a
covered clearing agency as a result of a decline in revenues or increase in expenses, to limit
disruptions that may impede the proper functioning of a covered clearing agency, and to improve
the ability of a covered clearing agency to meet its settlement obligations.
a. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
identify, monitor, and manage general business risk and hold sufficient liquid net assets funded
by equity to cover potential general business losses so that the covered clearing agency can
continue operations and services as a going concern if losses materialize. Covered clearing
agencies would also be required to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies
and procedures reasonably designed to determine the amount of liquid net assets funded by
equity based upon the general risk profile of that clearing agency and the length of time
necessary to achieve recovery or orderly wind-down. The proposed rule would also require a
covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to hold liquid net assets funded by equity in an amount equal to
the greater of either six months of current operating expenses or the amount determined by the
agency’s board of directors to be sufficient to ensure a recovery or orderly wind-down of critical
operations and services. Under such policies and procedures, these resources are to be held in
addition to resources held to cover participant default or other risks and must be of high quality
and sufficiently liquid. Furthermore, under such policies and procedures, a covered clearing
agency would be required to maintain a viable plan for raising additional equity in the event that
222

its equity falls close to, or below, the required amount, and the plan would be required to be
approved by the board of directors and updated at least annually. 421
b. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
safeguard its own assets, as well as the assets of its participants, and to minimize the risk of loss
and delay in access to such assets. A covered clearing agency would be required to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to invest
such assets in instruments with minimal credit, market and liquidity risks. 422
c. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to manage
operational risk. A covered clearing agency would be required to establish, implement, maintain
and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify the plausible sources
of operational risk, both internal and external, and mitigate their impact through the use of
appropriate systems, policies, procedures, and controls. A covered clearing agency would also
be required to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to ensure that systems have a high degree of security, resiliency, operational
reliability, and adequate, scalable capacity. The proposed rule would also require a covered
clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures

reasonably designed to establish and maintain a business continuity plan that addresses events
posing a significant risk of disrupting operations. 423
7. Proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(18) through (20): Access
The purpose of the collection of information is to enable a covered clearing agency to
ensure that only entities with sufficient financial and operational capacity are direct participants
in the covered clearing agency while ensuring that all qualified persons can access a covered
clearing agency’s services; to enable a covered clearing agency to monitor that participation
requirements are met on an ongoing basis and to identify a participant experiencing financial
difficulties before the participant fails to meet its settlement obligations; and to enable a covered
clearing agency to identify and manage risks posed by non-member entities.
a. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
establish objective, risk-based, and publicly disclosed criteria for participation, which permit fair
and open access by direct and, where relevant, indirect participants and other FMUs, and require
participants to have sufficient financial resources and robust operational capacity to meet
obligations arising from participation in the clearing agency. A covered clearing agency would
also be required to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to monitor compliance with such participation requirements on an ongoing
basis. 424

b. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
identify, monitor, and manage the material risks to the covered clearing agency arising from
arrangements in which firms that are indirect participants rely on services provided by direct
participants to access the covered clearing agency’s payment, clearing, or settlement facilities. 425
c. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
identify, monitor, and manage risks related to any link with one or more other clearing agencies,
FMUs, or trading markets. 426
8. Proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(21) through (22): Efficiency
The purpose of this collection of information is to ensure that the services provided by a
covered clearing agency do not become inefficient and to promote the sound operation of a
covered clearing agency. The collection of information is also intended to ensure the prompt and
accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions by enabling participants to
communicate with a clearing agency in a timely, reliable, and accurate manner.
a. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to require

the covered clearing agency to be efficient and effective in meeting the requirements of its
participants and the markets it serves. Additionally, the rule would require a covered clearing
agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to have the management of a covered clearing agency regularly review the efficiency
and effectiveness of the covered clearing agency’s (i) clearing and settlement arrangement; (ii)
operating structure, including risk management policies, procedures, and systems; (iii) scope of
products cleared, settled, or recorded; and (iv) use of technology and communications
procedures. 427
b. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to use, or
at a minimum, accommodate, relevant internationally accepted communication procedures and
standards in order to facilitate efficient payment, clearing, and settlement. 428
9. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23): Disclosure
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
maintain clear and comprehensive rules and procedures that provide for (i) publicly disclosing all
relevant rules and material procedures, including key aspects of default rules and procedures; (ii)
providing sufficient information to enable participants to identify and evaluate the risks, fees,
and other material costs incurred by participating in a covered clearing agency; and (iii) publicly

226

disclosing relevant basic data on transaction volume and values. The proposed rule would also
require a covered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies
and procedures reasonably designed to maintain clear and comprehensive rules and procedures
that provide for a comprehensive public disclosure of its material rules, policies, and procedures
regarding governance arrangements and legal, financial, and operational risk management that is
accurate in all material respects at the time of publication and to update this public disclosure
every two years, or more frequently following changes to the clearing agency’s system or the
environment in which it operates to the extent necessary to ensure that previous statements
remain accurate in all material respects. 429 The purpose of the collection of information is to
ensure that participants, as well as prospective participants, are provided with a complete picture
of the covered clearing agency’s operations and risk mitigation procedures in order to be able to
fully and clearly understand the risks and responsibilities of participation in a clearing agency.
10. Proposed Rule 17Ab2-2
Proposed Rule 17Ab2-2 establishes a process for making determinations regarding
whether a clearing agency is a covered clearing agency and whether a covered clearing agency is
either involved in activities with a more complex risk profile or systemically important in
multiple jurisdictions. 430 Each of these determinations may be initiated by a registered clearing
agency, a member of the clearing agency, or upon the Commission’s own initiative. 431 In each
case, under proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(d), the Commission would publish notice of its intention to
429

See supra Part II.B.20 (discussing proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)) and infra Part VII
(providing the proposed rule text).
430

See infra Part II.C (further discussing the purpose, scope, and application of proposed
Rule 17Ab2-2) and Part VII (proposed text of Rule 17Ab2-2).
431

See proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(a), infra Part VII.

227

consider such determinations, together with a brief statement of the grounds under consideration,
and provide at least a 30-day public comment period prior to any determination. Under proposed
Rule 17Ab2-2(e), notice of determinations in each case would be given prompt publication by
the Commission, together with a statement of written reasons supporting the determination.
C. Respondents
The Commission estimates that the majority of the proposed requirements under
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) would apply to five registered clearing agencies. The proposed
requirements in proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(1) through (23) would impose a PRA burden on
covered clearing agencies. A covered clearing agency is defined under proposed Rule 17Ad22(a)(7) as any designated clearing agency, clearing agency involved in activities with a more
complex risk profile for which the CFTC is not the supervisory agency as defined in Section
803(8) of the Clearing Supervision Act, or a clearing agency determined by the Commission to
be a covered clearing agency pursuant to proposed Rule 17Ab2-2. 432 A designated clearing
agency is defined under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(8) as a registered clearing agency that has
been designated systemically important by the FSOC. 433 The FSOC has designated six
registered clearing agencies as systemically important. 434 The Commission is the supervisory
agency with respect to four of these designated clearing agencies, and the CFTC is the

the scope of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) and defining “covered clearing agency”).
433

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(8), infra Part VII; see also supra Part II.A.1 (describing
the scope of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) and defining “designated clearing agency”); supra Part
I.B.2 (describing designation as systemically important by the FSOC under the Clearing
Supervision Act).
434

See supra note 38 and accompanying text.

228

supervisory agency for the remaining two. 435 Accordingly, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) would
apply to the four designated clearing agencies for which the Commission is the supervisory
agency. 436
In addition to the four designated clearing agencies for which the Commission is the
supervisory agency, a fifth clearing agency would also be subject to the proposed rules as a
complex risk profile clearing agency that provides CCP services for security-based swaps for
which the CFTC is not the supervisory agency under the Clearing Supervision Act. 437
While the proposed rules would be applicable to the five registered clearing agencies
currently captured by the definition of covered clearing agency, the Commission estimates that
two additional entities may seek to register with the Commission and that one of these entities
may seek to register in order to provide CCP services for security-based swaps. Upon
registration, these two entities may be deemed covered clearing agencies and would be subject to
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e).
The number of covered clearing agencies subject to proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) could
increase if the FSOC designates additional clearing agencies as systemically important. 438
Additionally, the Commission could determine additional clearing agencies to be covered
clearing agencies under proposed Rule 17Ab2-2, 439 subjecting them to the provisions of

435

229

proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e). While the number of clearing agencies subject to proposed Rule
17Ad-22(e) could increase, the Commission is not able to predict whether the FSOC will
exercise its authority in the future to designate additional clearing entities as systemically
important FMUs or whether the Commission will determine additional clearing agencies to be
covered clearing agencies. As a result, for the purposes of the PRA analysis, the Commission is
preliminarily estimating that there would be seven respondents for a majority of the proposed
requirements under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e). With regard to proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6),
the number of respondents would be six because the proposed rule would apply to covered
clearing agencies that provide CCP services. With regard to proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11), the
number of respondents would be one because the proposed rule would apply to covered clearing
agencies that provide CSD services. With regard to proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14), the number
of respondents would be two because the proposed rule would apply to covered clearing agencies
that provide CCP services for security-based swaps.
With regard to proposed Rule 17Ab2-2, the Commission preliminarily estimates for
purposes of the PRA analysis that two registered clearing agencies or their members on their
behalf will apply for a Commission determination, or may be subject to a Commission-initiated
determination, regarding whether the registered clearing agency is a covered clearing agency,
whether a registered clearing agency is involved in activities with a more complex risk profile, or
whether a covered clearing agency is systemically important in multiple jurisdictions.
D. Total Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burden for Proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)
The Commission preliminarily believes that the potential PRA burden imposed by the
requirements under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) will vary depending on the requirement in
question because registered clearing agencies are subject to existing requirements under Rule
230

17Ad-22 that, in some cases, are similar to those in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e), as discussed in
Part II.
First, because proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(1), (8) through (10), (12), (14), 440 (16), and
(22) 441 contain requirements that are either substantially similar to those under existing Rule
17Ad-22 or have current practices that the Commission understands largely conform with the
proposed rules, the Commission preliminarily believes that covered clearing agencies may need
to make only limited changes to update their policies and procedures to satisfy these proposed
requirements. In these cases, as an example, a covered clearing agency may need to conduct a
review of the proposed rule against its existing policies and procedures to confirm that it satisfies
the proposed requirements. 442

440

In the case of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14), the Commission preliminarily believes that
the current practices of covered clearing agencies already largely conform to the proposed
requirement, and accordingly believes that covered clearing agencies may need to make only
limited changes to update their policies and procedures pursuant to the proposed rule. See infra
note 508 and accompanying text; see also infra Parts IV.B.3.e.ii and IV.C.3.a.ix (discussing the
current practices at registered clearing agencies regarding segregation and portability and the
anticipated economic effect of the proposed rule, respectively).
441

In the case of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22), the Commission preliminarily believes that
the current practices of covered clearing agencies already largely conform to the proposed
requirement, and accordingly believes that covered clearing agencies may need to make only
limited changes to update their policies and procedures pursuant to the proposed rule. See supra
Part II.B.19 (discussing the requirements under the proposed rule) and infra Parts IV.B.3.h.ii and
IV.C.3.a.xv (discussing the current practices at registered clearing agencies regarding
communication procedures and standards and the anticipated economic effect of the proposed
rule, respectively).
442

In this regard, the Commission notes that its estimates for the initial one-time and
ongoing burdens for proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(8) through (10) and (12) are the same across
each of the proposed rules because the Commission preliminarily believes that the burdens
associated with each would primarily constitute a review of the covered clearing agency’s
policies and procedures to confirm that those policies and procedures satisfy the proposed
requirement.

231

Second, because proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(2), (3), (5), (11), (13), (17), (18), (20), and
(21) contain provisions that are similar to those under existing Rule 17Ad-22 but would impose
additional requirements that do not appear in existing Rule 17Ad-22, the Commission
preliminarily believes that covered clearing agencies may need to make changes to update their
policies and procedures to satisfy the proposed requirements. In these cases, as an example, a
covered clearing agency may need to review and amend its existing rule book, policies, and
procedures but may not need to develop, design, or implement new operations and practices to
satisfy the proposed requirements.
Third, for proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4), (6), (7), (15), (19), and (23), for which no
similar existing requirements under Rule 17Ad-22 have been identified, 443 the Commission
preliminarily believes that covered clearing agencies may need to make more extensive changes
to their policies and procedures (or implement new policies and procedures), and may need to
take other steps to satisfy the proposed requirements. In these cases, the PRA burden would be
greater since a covered clearing agency may need to, as an example, develop, design, and
implement new operations and practices. With respect to these provisions, the PRA burden may
be greater since these proposed requirements may not reflect established practices of covered
clearing agencies or reflect the normal course of their activities, and the PRA burden for these
proposed rules may therefore entail initial one-time burdens to create new written policies and
procedures and ongoing burdens, including burdens associated with disclosure requirements.
443

In the case of Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23), registered clearing agencies are subject to existing
requirements for disclosure under existing Rule 17Ad-22, but new requirements under the
proposed rule would impose greater burdens relative to other proposed rules that have similar
requirements to those under existing Rule 17Ad-22. See supra Part II.B.20 (discussing the
requirements under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) and their relationship to requirements under
existing Rule 17Ad-22(d)(9)).

232

The Commission requests comment regarding the accuracy of the estimates discussed
below.
1. Proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(1) through (3): General Organization
a. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1) contains substantially the same requirements as Rule
17Ad-22(d)(1). 444 As a result, a respondent clearing agency would already have written rules,
policies, and procedures substantially similar to the requirements that would be imposed under
the proposed rule. The PRA burden imposed by the proposed rules would therefore be minimal
and would likely be limited to the review of current policies and procedures and updating
existing policies and procedures where appropriate in order to ensure compliance with the
proposed rule. Accordingly, based on the similar policies and procedures requirements and the
corresponding burden estimates previously made by the Commission for Rule 17Ad-22(d)(1), 445
the Commission preliminarily believes that respondent clearing agencies would incur an
aggregate one-time burden of approximately 56 hours to review and update existing policies and
procedures. 446
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1) would also impose ongoing burdens on a respondent
clearing agency. The proposed rule would require ongoing monitoring and compliance activities

444

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(1); proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1), infra Part VII; see also
supra Part II.B.1 (discussing the requirements under the proposed rule).
445

See Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra note 5, at 66260.

446

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 2 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney for 6 hours)) = 8 hours x 7 respondent clearing agencies = 56 hours.

233

with respect to the written policies and procedures created in response to the proposed rule. 447
Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and compliance burdens
with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 448 the Commission preliminarily estimates that the
ongoing activities required by proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1) would impose an aggregate annual
burden on respondent clearing agencies of 21 hours. 449
b. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) contains some provisions that are similar to Rule 17Ad22(d)(8), but also adds additional requirements that do not appear in existing Rule 17Ad-22. 450
As a result, a respondent clearing agency is required to have some written rules, policies, and
procedures substantially similar to the requirements that would be imposed under proposed Rule
17Ad-22(e)(2) and would need to establish and implement a limited number of new policies and
procedures. The PRA burden imposed by the proposed rule would therefore be associated with
reviewing current policies and procedures and updating those policies and procedures or
establishing new policies and procedures, where appropriate, in order to ensure compliance with
the proposed rule. Accordingly, based on the similar policies and procedures requirements and
the corresponding burden estimates previously made by the Commission for Rule 17Ad447

Where the Commission refers to anticipated burdens related to “enforcement activities,”
the Commission notes that such policies and procedures contemplate enforcement by the
respondent clearing agency itself. See Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra note 5, at
66246 (stating that “the clearing agency must be able to enforce its policies and procedures that
contemplate enforcement by the clearing agency”).
448

See Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra note 5, at 66260–63.

449

This figure was calculated as follows: (Compliance Attorney for 3 hours) x 7 respondent
clearing agencies = 21 hours.

450

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(8); proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2), infra Part VII; see also
supra Part II.B.2 (discussing the requirements under the proposed rule).

234

22(d)(8), 451 the Commission preliminarily believes that respondent clearing agencies would
incur an aggregate one-time burden of approximately 154 hours to review and update existing
policies and procedures and to create new policies and procedures, as necessary. 452
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) would also impose ongoing burdens on a respondent
clearing agency. The proposed requirement would require ongoing monitoring and compliance
activities with respect to the written policies and procedures created in response to the proposed
rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and compliance
burdens with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 453 the Commission preliminarily estimates that
the ongoing activities required by proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) would impose an aggregate
annual burden on respondent clearing agencies of 28 hours. 454
c. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3) would require a covered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide
for a sound risk management framework. 455 Under Rule 17Ad-22(d), registered clearing
agencies are required to have policies and procedures to manage certain risks faced by these

451

452

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 24 hours) +

This figure was calculated as follows: (Compliance Attorney for 4 hours) x 7 respondent
clearing agencies = 28 hours.

235

entities, 456 but the proposed rule would require a comprehensive framework for risk management
that would require risk management policies and procedures be designed holistically, be
consistent with each other, and work effectively together. Accordingly, the proposed rule may
impose a PRA burden that would require respondent clearing agencies to update current policies
and procedures in order to develop a more comprehensive framework that would include a
periodic review thereof and a plan for orderly recovery and wind-down of the covered clearing
agency. As a result, the Commission preliminarily estimates that respondent clearing agencies
would incur an aggregate one-time burden of 399 hours to review and update existing policies
and procedures and to create new policies and procedures, as necessary. 457
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3) would also impose ongoing burdens on a respondent
clearing agency. The proposed requirement would require ongoing monitoring and compliance
activities with respect to the written policies and procedures created in response to the proposed
rule and activities related to preparing documents facilitating a periodic review of the risk
management framework. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring
and compliance burdens with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 458 the Commission preliminarily
estimates that the ongoing activities required by proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3) would impose an

456

proposed rule and their relationship to existing requirements under Rule 17Ad-22).
457

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 25 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney for 18 hours) + (Senior Risk Management Specialist for 7 hours) +
(Computer Operations Manager for 7 hours)) = 57 hours x 7 respondent clearing agencies = 399
hours.
458

See Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra note 5, at 66260–63.

236

aggregate annual burden on respondent clearing agencies of 343 hours. 459 The Commission
notes that the estimated ongoing burden for Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3) is similar to the initial
one-time burden because the proposed rule includes a specific requirement that policies and
procedures for comprehensive risk management include review on a specified periodic basis and
approval by the board of directors annually.
2. Proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4) through (7): Financial Risk Management
a. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)
The Commission preliminarily believes that the estimated PRA burdens for proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) would be more significant, as changes to existing policies and procedures
would involve more than adjustments and may require a respondent clearing agency to make
substantial changes to its policies and procedures. 460 In addition, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)
would require one-time systems adjustments related to the capability to test the sufficiency of
financial resources and to perform an annual conforming model validation. As a result, the
Commission preliminarily estimates that respondent clearing agencies would incur an aggregate
one-time burden of 1,400 hours. 461
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) would also impose ongoing burdens on a respondent
clearing agency. The proposed rule would require ongoing monitoring and compliance activities
459

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Compliance Attorney for 8 hours) +
(Administrative Assistant for 3 hours) + (Senior Business Analyst for 5 hours) + (Risk
Management Specialist for 33 hours)) = 49 hours x 7 respondent clearing agencies = 343 hours.

460

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4), infra Part VII; see also supra Part II.B.4.c (discussing
the requirements under the proposed rule).
461

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 60 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney for 40 hours) + (Senior Risk Management Specialist for 30 hours) +
(Computer Operations Manager for 45 hours) + (Chief Compliance Officer for 15 hours) +
(Senior Programmer for 10 hours)) = 200 hours x 7 respondent clearing agencies = 1,400 hours.

237

with respect to the written policies and procedures created in response to the proposed rule and
ongoing activities with respect to testing the sufficiency of financial resources and model
validation. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and
compliance burdens with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 462 the Commission preliminarily
estimates that the ongoing activities required by proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) would impose an
aggregate annual burden on respondent clearing agencies of 420 hours. 463
b. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5)
Respondent clearing agencies that would be subject to proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5) may
already have some written policies and procedures designed to address the collateral risks borne
by these entities. 464 As a result, the Commission preliminarily believes that a respondent
clearing agency may need to review and update existing policies and procedures as necessary
and may need to adopt new policies and procedures with respect to an annual review of the
sufficiency of collateral haircuts and concentration limits. Accordingly, based on the similar
policies and procedures requirements in and the Commission’s previous corresponding burden
estimates for existing Rule 17Ad-22(d)(3), 465 the Commission preliminarily believes that
respondent clearing agencies would incur an aggregate one-time burden of approximately 294

463

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Compliance Attorney for 24 hours) +

238

hours to review and update existing policies and procedures and to create new policies and
procedures, as necessary. 466
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5) would also impose ongoing burdens on a respondent
clearing agency. The proposed requirement would require ongoing monitoring and compliance
activities with respect to the written policies and procedures created in response to the proposed
rule and would also result in an annual review of collateral haircuts and concentration limits.
Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and compliance burdens
with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 467 the Commission preliminarily estimates that the
ongoing activities required by proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5) would impose an aggregate annual
burden on respondent clearing agencies of 252 hours. 468 The Commission notes that the
estimated ongoing burden for Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5) is similar to the initial one-time
burden because the proposed rule includes a specific requirement that policies and procedures for
collateral include a not-less-than-annual review of the sufficiency of a covered clearing agency’s
collateral haircuts and concentration limits.
c. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)
The Commission preliminarily believes that the estimated PRA burdens for proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) would be more significant and may require a respondent clearing agency to

make substantial changes to its policies and procedures. 469 In addition, proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(6) would require one-time systems adjustments related to the capability to perform daily
backtesting and monthly (or more frequent than monthly) conforming sensitivity analyses. As a
result, the Commission preliminarily estimates that respondent clearing agencies would incur an
aggregate one-time burden of 1,080 hours to review and update existing policies and
procedures. 470
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) would also impose ongoing burdens on a respondent
clearing agency. The proposed requirement would require ongoing monitoring and compliance
activities with respect to the written policies and procedures created in response to the proposed
rule and activities associated with the daily backtesting and monthly (or more frequent)
sensitivity analysis requirements and annual model validation. Based on the Commission’s
previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to existing Rule
17Ad-22, 471 the Commission preliminarily estimates that the ongoing activities required by
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) would impose an aggregate annual burden on respondent clearing
agencies of 360 hours. 472

469

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6), infra Part VII; see also supra Part II.B.4.e (discussing
the requirements under the proposed rule, including those that do not appear in existing Rule

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 50 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney for 40 hours) + (Senior Risk Management Specialist for 25 hours) +
(Computer Operations Manager for 40 hours) + (Chief Compliance Officer for 15 hours) +
(Senior Programmer for 10 hours)) = 180 hours x 6 respondent clearing agencies = 1,080 hours.

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Compliance Attorney for 24 hours) +

Management Specialist for 30 hours)) = 60 hours x 6 respondent clearing agencies = 360 hours.

240

d. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)
The Commission preliminarily believes that the estimated PRA burdens for proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) would be more significant and may require a respondent clearing agency to
make substantial changes to its policies and procedures. 473 In addition, proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(7) would require one-time systems adjustments related to the capability to perform an
annual conforming model validation, the testing of sufficiency of liquid resources and the testing
of access to liquidity providers. As a result, the Commission preliminarily estimates that
respondent clearing agencies would incur an aggregate one-time burden of 2,310 hours to review
and update existing policies and procedures. 474
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) would also impose ongoing burdens on a respondent
clearing agency. The proposed requirement would require ongoing monitoring and compliance
activities with respect to the written policies and procedures created in response to the proposed
rule as well as activities related to the testing of sufficiency of liquidity resources and the testing
of access to liquidity providers. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing
monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 475 the Commission

would impose an aggregate annual burden on respondent clearing agencies of 896 hours. 476
3. Proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(8) through (10): Settlement
a. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8) contains substantially similar provisions to Rule 17Ad22(d)(12). 477 As a result, a respondent clearing agency would already have written rules,
policies, and procedures substantially similar to the requirements that would be imposed under
the proposed rule. In this regard, the Commission preliminarily believes that respondent clearing
agencies would incur the incremental burdens of reviewing and updating existing policies and
procedures as necessary. Accordingly, based on the similar policies and procedures
requirements and the corresponding burden estimates previously made by the Commission for
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(12), 478 the Commission preliminarily believes that respondent clearing
agencies would incur an aggregate one-time burden of approximately 84 hours to review and
update existing policies and procedures. 479
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8) would also impose ongoing burdens on a respondent
clearing agency. The proposed requirements would require ongoing monitoring and compliance

activities with respect to the written policies and procedures created in response to the proposed
rules. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and compliance
burdens with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 480 the Commission preliminarily estimates that
the ongoing activities required by proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(8) would impose an aggregate
annual burden on respondent clearing agencies of approximately 35 hours. 481
b. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(9)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(9) contains substantially similar provisions to Rule 17Ad22(d)(5). 482 As a result, a respondent clearing agency would already have written rules, policies,
and procedures substantially similar to the requirements that would be imposed under the
proposed rule. In this regard, the Commission preliminarily believes that respondent clearing
agencies would incur the incremental burdens of reviewing and updating existing policies and
procedures as necessary. Accordingly, based on the similar policies and procedures
requirements and the corresponding burden estimates previously made by the Commission for

Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(9) would also impose ongoing burdens on a respondent
clearing agency. The proposed requirement would require ongoing monitoring and compliance
activities with respect to the written policies and procedures created in response to the proposed
rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and compliance
burdens with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 485 the Commission preliminarily estimates that
the ongoing activities required by proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(9) would impose an aggregate
annual burden on respondent clearing agencies of approximately 35 hours. 486
c. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(10)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(10) contains substantially similar provisions to Rule 17Ad22(d)(15). 487 As a result, a respondent clearing agency would already have written rules,
policies, and procedures substantially similar to the requirements that would be imposed under
the proposed rule. In this regard, the Commission preliminarily believes that a respondent
clearing agency would incur the incremental burdens of reviewing and updating existing policies

agencies would incur an aggregate one-time burden of approximately 84 hours to review and
update existing policies and procedures. 489
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(10) would also impose ongoing burdens on a respondent
clearing agency. The proposed requirement would require ongoing monitoring and compliance
activities with respect to the written policies and procedures created in response to the proposed
rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and compliance
burdens with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 490 the Commission preliminarily estimates that
the ongoing activities required by proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(10) would impose an aggregate
annual burden on respondent clearing agencies of approximately 35 hours. 491
4. Proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(11) through (12): CSDs and Exchange-ofValue Settlement Systems
a. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11) contains similar provisions to Rule 17Ad-22(d)(10). 492 As
a result, a respondent clearing agency providing CSD services would already have written rules,
policies, and procedures similar to the requirements that would be imposed under the proposed

and accordingly a covered clearing agency providing CSD services may need to update or amend
existing policies and procedures, as necessary, to satisfy the proposed requirements and may
need to create new policies and procedures. Based on the similar policies and procedures
requirements and the corresponding burden estimates previously made by the Commission for
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(10), 494 the Commission preliminarily believes that the respondent clearing
agency would incur a one-time burden of approximately 55 hours to review and update existing
policies and procedures and to create new policies and procedures, as necessary. 495
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11) would also impose ongoing burdens on the respondent
clearing agency providing CSD services. The proposed requirement would require ongoing
monitoring and compliance activities with respect to the written policies and procedures created
in response to the proposed rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing
monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 496 the Commission
preliminarily estimates that the ongoing activities required by proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(11)
would impose a total annual burden on the respondent clearing agency of approximately 8
hours. 497

Business Analyst for 5 hours) + (Computer Operations Manager for 5 hours)) = 55 hours x 1
respondent clearing agency = 55 hours.

b. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12) contains substantially similar provisions to Rule 17Ad22(d)(13). 498 As a result, a respondent clearing agency would already have written rules,
policies, and procedures substantially similar to the requirements that would be imposed under
the proposed rule. In this regard, the Commission preliminarily believes that a respondent
clearing agency would incur the incremental burdens of reviewing and updating existing policies
and procedures as necessary. Accordingly, based on the similar policies and procedures
requirements and the corresponding burden estimates previously made by the Commission for
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(13), 499 the Commission preliminarily believes that respondent clearing
agencies would incur an aggregate one-time burden of approximately 84 hours to review and
update existing policies and procedures. 500
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12) would also impose ongoing burdens on a covered clearing
agency. The proposed requirement would require ongoing monitoring and compliance activities
with respect to the written policies and procedures created in response to the proposed rule.
Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and compliance burdens
with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 501 the Commission preliminarily estimates that the

ongoing activities required by proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12) would impose an aggregate annual
burden on respondent clearing agencies of approximately 35 hours. 502
5. Proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(13) through (14): Default Management
a. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) would require a respondent clearing agency to have
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to address participant default and ensure
that the clearing agency can contain losses and liquidity demands and continue to meet its
obligations. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) contains similar provisions to Rule 17Ad-22(d)(11)
but would also impose additional requirements that do not appear in existing Rule 17Ad-22. 503
As a result, the Commission preliminarily believes that a respondent clearing agency would incur
burdens of reviewing and updating existing policies and procedures in order to comply with the
provisions of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) and, in some cases, may need to create new policies
and procedures. Accordingly, based on the similar policies and procedures requirements and the
corresponding burden estimates previously made by the Commission for Rule 17Ad22(d)(11), 504 the Commission preliminarily believes that respondent clearing agencies would

existing Rule 17Ad-22(d)(11).

248

incur an aggregate one-time burden of approximately 420 hours to review and update existing
policies and procedures and to create new policies and procedures, as necessary. 505
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) would also impose ongoing burdens on a respondent
clearing agency. Specifically, the proposed rule would require annual review and testing of a
clearing agency’s default policies and procedures. Based on the Commission’s previous
estimates for ongoing monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to existing Rule 17Ad22, 506 the Commission preliminarily believes that the ongoing activities required by proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) would impose an aggregate annual burden on respondent clearing agencies
of approximately 63 hours. 507
b. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14)
Registered clearing agencies that provide CCP services for security-based swaps
generally have written policies and procedures regarding the segregation and portability of
customer positions and collateral as a result of applicable regulations but not existing Rule 17Ad22. 508 As a result, respondent clearing agencies providing CCP services for security-based
swaps would incur burdens of reviewing and updating existing policies and procedures as

505

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 20 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney for 16 hours) + (Senior Business Analyst for 12 hours) + (Computer
Operations Manager for 12 hours)) = 60 hours x 7 respondent clearing agencies = 420 hours.

506

This figure was calculated as follows: (Compliance Attorney for 9 hours) x 7 respondent

See, e.g., 77 FR 6336 (Feb. 7, 2012) (CFTC adopting rules imposing LSOC on DCOs for
cleared swaps); see also supra Part II.B.11, in particular note 297 and accompanying text.
Because the affected clearing agencies are subject to the CFTC’s segregation and portability
requirements with respect to cleared swaps under LSOC, the Commission preliminarily believes
the burden imposed by proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) would be limited.

necessary in order to comply with the proposed rule. The Commission preliminarily estimates
that Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) would impose on respondent clearing agencies an aggregate one-time
burden of 72 hours to review and update existing policies and procedures. 509
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) would also impose ongoing burdens on a respondent
clearing agency that provides CCP services for security-based swaps. Based on the
Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and compliance burdens with respect
to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 510 the Commission preliminarily believes that the ongoing activities
required by proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) would impose an aggregate annual burden on
respondent clearing agencies of approximately 12 hours. 511
6. Proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(15) through (17): General Business and
Operational Risk Management
a. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)
Respondent clearing agencies would be required to establish, implement, maintain and
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify and manage general
business risks borne by the clearing agency. Policies and procedures governing the identification
and mitigation of general business risk are not currently required under existing Rule 17Ad-22
and, as a result, the Commission preliminarily believes that the estimated PRA burdens for
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) would be more significant and may require a respondent clearing

509

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 12 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney for 10 hours) + (Computer Operations Manager for 7 hours) + (Senior
Business Analyst for 7 hours)) = 36 hours x 2 respondent clearing agency that provide, or would
potentially provide, CCP services with respect to security-based swaps = 72 hours.

agency to make substantial changes to its policies and procedures. 512 The Commission
preliminarily estimates that proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) would impose an aggregate one-time
burden on respondent covered clearing agencies of 1,470 hours to review and update existing
policies and procedures and to create new policies and procedures, as necessary. 513
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) would also imposed ongoing burdens on a respondent
clearing agency. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) would require a respondent clearing agency to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to maintain a viable plan, approved by its board of directors and updated at least annually, for
raising additional equity in the event that the covered clearing agency’s liquid net assets fall
below the level required by the proposed rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates
for ongoing monitoring and compliance burdens with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 514 the
Commission preliminarily estimates that the ongoing activities required by proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(15) would impose an aggregate annual burden on respondent clearing agencies of 336
hours. 515

(Compliance Attorney for 30 hours) + (Computer Operations Manager for 10 hours) + (Senior
Business Analyst for 10 hours) + (Financial Analyst for 70 hours) + (Chief Financial Officer for
50 hours)) = 210 hours x 7 respondent clearing agencies = 1,470 hours.

514

respondents clearing agencies = 336 hours.

b. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16)
A registered clearing agency is currently required to have written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to address, in large part, the safeguarding of assets of its assets and those of
its participants under Rule 17Ad-22(d)(3). 516 Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16) contains
substantially similar provisions. As a result, the Commission preliminarily believes that a
respondent clearing agency would be required to conduct a review of current policies and
procedures and update these existing policies and procedures where appropriate in order to
ensure compliance with the proposed rule and that the PRA burden imposed by the proposed rule
would be limited. Accordingly, based on the similar policies and procedures requirements and
the corresponding burden estimates previously made by the Commission for Rule 17Ad22(d)(3), 517 the Commission preliminarily estimates that all respondent clearing agencies would
incur an aggregate one-time burden of approximately 140 hours to review and update existing
policies and procedures. 518
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16) would also impose ongoing burdens on a respondent
clearing agency. It would require ongoing monitoring and compliance activities with respect to
the policies and procedures implemented in response to the requirements of the proposed rule.
Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and compliance burdens

516

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(3); proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16), infra Part VII; see also

517

See Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra note 5, at 66260.

518

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 4 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney for 8 hours) + (Senior Business Analyst for 4 hours) + (Computer
Operations Manager for 4 hours)) = 20 hours x 7 respondent clearing agencies = 140 hours.

252

with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 519 the Commission preliminarily estimates that the
ongoing activities required by proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16) would impose an aggregate annual
burden on respondent clearing agencies of 42 hours. 520
c. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17) contains similar requirements to those under Rule 17Ad22(d)(4) but would also impose additional requirements that do not appear in existing Rule
17Ad-22. 521 As a result, a respondent clearing agency is currently required to have some written
rules, policies and procedures containing provisions similar to the requirements that would be
imposed under the proposed rule, but it would also need to review and update existing policies
and procedures, where necessary, and may need to create policies and procedures to address the
additional requirements. Accordingly, based on the similar policies and procedures requirements
and the corresponding burden estimates previously made by the Commission for Rule 17Ad22(d)(4), 522 the Commission preliminarily estimates that respondent clearing agencies would
incur an aggregate one-time burden of 196 hours to review and update existing policies and
procedures and to create new policies and procedures, as necessary. 523

519

for 2 hours)) = 28 hours x 7 respondent clearing agency = 196 hours.

253

Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17) would also impose ongoing burdens on a respondent
clearing agency. Specifically, the proposed rule would require ongoing monitoring and
compliance activities with respect to the written policies and procedures created in response to
the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and compliance
burdens with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 524 the Commission preliminarily estimates that
the ongoing activities required by proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17) would impose an aggregate
annual burden on respondent clearing agencies of 112 hours. 525
7. Proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(18) through (20): Access
a. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18) contains similar requirements to those in existing Rules
17Ad-22(b)(5) through (7) and (d)(2). 526 As a result, a respondent clearing agency is currently
required to have written rules, policies, and procedures containing provisions similar to the
requirements that would be imposed under the proposed rule. Thus, for certain portions of
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18), the Commission preliminarily believes that a respondent clearing
agency would need to review and update existing policies and procedures where necessary.
Because proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18) also imposes additional requirements that do not appear
in existing Rule 17Ad-22, however, 527 a respondent clearing agency may be required to create
policies and procedures to address these additional requirements. Accordingly, based on the

similar policies and procedures requirements and the corresponding burden estimates previously
made by the Commission for Rules 17Ad-22(b)(5) through (7) and (d)(2), 528 the Commission
preliminarily estimates that respondent clearing agencies would incur an aggregate one-time
burden of 308 hours to review and update existing policies and procedures and to create new
policies and procedures, as necessary. 529
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18) would also impose ongoing burdens on a respondent
clearing agency. Specifically, the proposed rule would require ongoing monitoring and
compliance activities with respect to the written policies and procedures created in response to
the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and compliance
burdens with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 530 the Commission preliminarily estimates that
the ongoing activities required by the proposed rule would impose an aggregate annual burden
on respondent clearing agencies of 49 hours. 531
b. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19)
Respondent clearing agencies would be required to establish, implement, maintain and
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to address material risks associated
from tiered participation arrangements as required by proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19). Tiered
participation arrangements are not addressed in existing Rule 17Ad-22. To the extent that a

respondent clearing agency has not addressed tiered participation arrangements in its policies and
procedures, the Commission preliminarily believes that the respondent clearing agency would
need to create policies and procedures to address these proposed requirements. In this regard,
the PRA burden for proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) would impose one-time initial burdens to
create policies and procedures. The Commission preliminarily estimates that proposed Rule
17Ad-22(e)(19) would impose an aggregate one-time burden on respondent clearing agencies of
308 hours to create said policies and procedures. 532
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) would also impose ongoing burdens on a respondent
clearing agency. Specifically, the proposed rule would require ongoing monitoring and
compliance activities with respect to the written policies and procedures created in response to
the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and compliance
burdens with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 533 the Commission preliminarily estimates that
the ongoing activities required by the proposed rule would impose an annual aggregate burden
on respondent clearing agencies of 49 hours. 534
c. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20)
Registered clearing agencies are currently required to have written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to manage risks related to links between the clearing agency and
others under Rule 17Ad-22(d)(7). Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20) contains similar requirements,

This figure was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 10 hours) +
(Compliance Attorney for 7 hours) + (Computer Operations Manager for 15 hours) + (Senior

but also imposes additional requirements. 535 As a result, a respondent clearing agency may need
to review and update existing policies and procedures or establish new policies and procedures,
as necessary, to satisfy the proposed requirement. Accordingly, based on the similar policies and
procedures requirements and the corresponding burden estimates previously made by the
Commission for Rule 17Ad-22(d)(7), 536 the Commission preliminarily believes that respondent
clearing agencies would incur an aggregate one-time burden of approximately 308 hours to
review and update existing policies and procedures. 537
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20) would also impose ongoing burdens on a respondent
clearing agency. Specifically, the proposed rule would require ongoing monitoring and
compliance activities with respect to the written policies and procedures created in response to
the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and compliance
burdens with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 538 the Commission preliminarily estimates that
the ongoing activities required by the proposed rule would impose an aggregate annual burden
on respondent clearing agencies of 49 hours. 539

8. Proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(21) through (22): Efficiency
a. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21)
Registered clearing agencies are currently required to have written policies and
procedures requiring the clearing agency to be cost effective with respect to meeting the
requirements of its participants and the markets it serves under Rule 17Ad-22(d)(6), and
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21) contains similar requirements but also imposes new
requirements. 540 As a result, a respondent clearing agency would likely incur the burdens of
reviewing and updating existing policies and procedures and may need to create new policies and
procedures to satisfy the proposed rule, as necessary. Accordingly, based on the similar policies
and procedures requirements and the corresponding burden estimates previously made by the
Commission for Rule 17Ad-22(d)(6), 541 the Commission preliminarily estimates that that
respondent clearing agencies would incur an aggregate one-time burden of approximately 224
hours to review and update existing policies and procedures. 542
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21) would also impose ongoing burdens on a respondent
clearing agency. The proposed rule would require ongoing monitoring and compliance activities
with respect to the written policies and procedures required under the proposed rule. Based on
the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and compliance burdens with
respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 543 the Commission preliminarily estimates that the ongoing

activities required by proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21) would impose an aggregate annual burden
on respondent clearing agencies of 77 hours. 544
b. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22)
Respondent clearing agencies would be required to establish, implement, maintain and
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to implement the requirements of
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22) with respect to the use of relevant internationally accepted
communication procedures and standards. Although registered clearing agencies are not subject
to an existing similar requirement under Rule 17Ad-22, the Commission understands that
covered clearing agencies currently use the relevant internationally accepted communication
procedures and standards and expects a covered clearing agency would need to make only
limited changes to satisfy the requirements under the proposed rule. 545 Accordingly, the
Commission preliminarily estimates that proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22) would impose an
aggregate one-time burden on respondent clearing agencies of 168 hours to review and update
existing policies and procedures. 546
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22) would also impose ongoing burdens on a respondent
clearing agency. Specifically, the proposed rule would require ongoing monitoring and
compliance activities with respect to the written policies and procedures created in response to

the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and compliance
burdens with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 547 the Commission preliminarily estimates that
the ongoing activities required by proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22) would impose an aggregate
annual burden on respondent clearing agencies of 35 hours. 548
9. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23): Disclosure
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) contains similar requirements to Rule 17Ad-22(d)(9) but
also imposes substantial new requirements. 549 As a result, although a respondent clearing
agency is already required to have written rules, policies and procedures containing provisions
similar to some of the requirements in the proposed rule, for some provisions of proposed Rule
17Ad-22(e)(23), a respondent clearing agency would be required to establish policies and
procedures to address the additional requirements. Accordingly, based on the similar policies
and procedures requirements and the corresponding burden estimates previously made by the
Commission for Rule 17Ad-22(d)(9), 550 the Commission preliminarily estimates that respondent
clearing agencies would incur an aggregate one-time burden of 966 hours to review and update
existing policies and procedures and to create policies and procedures, as necessary. 551

for 8 hours)) = 138 hours x 7 respondent clearing agencies = 966 hours.

260

Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) would also impose ongoing burdens on a respondent
clearing agency. Specifically, the proposed rule would require ongoing monitoring and
compliance activities with respect to the written policies and procedures created in response to
the rule. Based on the Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and compliance
burdens with respect to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 552 the Commission preliminarily estimates that
the ongoing activities required by proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) would impose an aggregate
annual burden on respondent clearing agencies of 238 hours. 553
10. Total Burden for Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)
The aggregate initial burden for respondent clearing agencies under proposed Rule 17Ad22(e) would be 10,664 hours. The aggregate ongoing burden for respondent clearing agencies
under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) would be 3,460 hours.
E. Total Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burden for Proposed Rule 17Ab2-2
Proposed Rule 17Ab2-2 would govern Commission determinations as to whether a
registered clearing agency is a covered clearing agency and whether a covered clearing agency is
either involved in activities with a more complex risk profile or systemically important in
multiple jurisdictions.554 Because such determinations may be made upon request of a clearing
agency or its members, the respondents would have the burdens of preparing such requests for
submission to the Commission. The Commission preliminarily notes that, to the extent such
determinations are carried out by the Commission on its own initiative pursuant to proposed Rule
552

See Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra note 5, at 66260.

553

This figure was calculated as follows: (Compliance Attorney for 34 hours) x 7 respondent
clearing agencies = 238 hours.

See infra Part II.C (further discussing the purpose, scope, and application of proposed
Rule 17Ab2-2) and Part VII (proposed text of Rule 17Ab2-2).

261

17Ab2-2, the PRA burdens on the respondents would be limited. Accordingly, based on the
Commission’s previous estimates for ongoing monitoring and compliance burdens with respect
to existing Rule 17Ad-22, 555 the Commission preliminarily believes that respondent clearing
agencies would incur an aggregate one-time burden of approximately 24 hours to draft and
review a determination request to the Commission. 556
F. Collection of Information is Mandatory
The collection of information relating to proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(1) through (3),
17Ad-22(e)(4)(ii) through (v), 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) through (ix), and 17Ad-22(e)(8) through (23)
would be mandatory for all respondent clearing agencies. The collection of information
requirement relating to proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i) and 17Ad-22(e)(7)(x) would be
mandatory for a respondent clearing agency that provides CCP services and that is designated by
the Commission either as systemically important in multiple jurisdictions or as a complex risk
profile clearing agency. The collection of information requirement relating to proposed Rule
17Ad-22(e)(6) would be mandatory for a respondent clearing agency that provides CCP services.
The collection of information requirement relating to proposed Rule 17Ab2-2 is
voluntary.
G. Confidentiality
The Commission preliminarily expects that the written policies and procedures generated
pursuant to proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) would be communicated to the members, subscribers, and
employees (as applicable) of all entities covered by the proposed rule and the public (as

not be kept confidential. Such policies and procedures would be required to be preserved in
accordance with, and for periods specified in, Exchange Act Rules 17a-1 557 and 17a-4(e)(7). 558
To the extent that the Commission receives confidential information pursuant to this collection
of information, such information would be kept confidential subject to the provisions of
applicable law. 559
To the extent that the Commission receives confidential information pursuant to the
collection of information under proposed Rule 17Ab2-2, the Commission preliminarily expects
such information would be kept confidential subject to the provisions of applicable law. 560

The Commission invites comments on all of the above estimates. Pursuant to 44 U.S.C.
3506(c)(2)(B), the Commission requests comment in order to (a) evaluate whether the collection
of information is necessary for the proper performance of our functions, including whether the
information will have practical utility; (b) evaluate the accuracy of our estimates of the burden of
the collection of information; (c) determine whether there are ways to enhance the quality,

IV. Economic Analysis
A. Introduction
The purpose of the proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and of proposed Rule 17Ab22 is to establish requirements for the operation and governance of registered clearing agencies
that meet the definition of a “covered clearing agency.” Registered clearing agencies have
become an essential part of the infrastructure of the U.S. securities markets. Many securities
transactions are centrally cleared and settled, and central clearing and settlement is becoming
more prevalent in the security-based swap markets. For example, DTCC reported processing
264

$1.6 quadrillion in transactions in 2012. 561 For the same period, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.
reported $10.2 trillion in gross notional CDS cleared and settled. 562 While clearing agencies
generally benefit the markets they serve, such entities can pose substantial risk to the financial
system as a whole, due in part to the fact that clearing agencies concentrate risk. Disruption to a
clearing agency’s operations, or failure on the part of a clearing agency to meet its obligations,
could serve as a potential source of contagion, resulting in significant costs not only to the
clearing agency and its members but also the broader economy and market participants. 563 As a

in clearing a large quantity of derivatives trades, the CCP is itself a systemically important
financial institution. The failure of a CCP could suddenly expose many major market participants
to losses. Any such failure, moreover, is likely to have been triggered by the failure of one or
more large clearing members, and therefore to occur during a period of extreme market
fragility.”); Pirrong, The Inefficiency of Clearing Mandates, Policy Analysis, No. 655, at 11–14,
16–17, 24–26 (2010), available at http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/PA665.pdf, at 11–14, 16–17,
24–26 (stating, among other things, that “CCPs are concentrated points of potential failure that
265

result, proper management of the risks associated with central clearing and settlement is
necessary to ensure the stability of U.S. securities markets.
The mandated central clearing and settlement of security-based swaps wherever possible
and appropriate, a core component of Title VII, reinforces this need. 564 Where a clearing agency
provides CCP services, clearing and settlement of security-based swap contracts replaces
bilateral counterparty exposures with exposures against the clearing agency providing CCP
services. Consequently, a move from voluntary central clearing and settlement of security-based
swap contracts to mandatory clearing of security-based swap contracts, holding the volume of
security-based swap transactions constant, will increase economic exposures against CCPs that
clear security-based swaps. Increased exposures in turn raise the possibility that these CCPs may
serve as a transmission mechanism for systemic events.
Clearing agencies have several incentives to implement comprehensive risk management
programs. First, the ongoing viability of a clearing agency depends on its reputation and the
confidence that market participants have in its services. Clearing agencies therefore have an
incentive to minimize the likelihood that a member default or operational outage would disrupt
settlement. Second, some clearing agencies, including those that mutualize default risks,
can create their own systemic risks,” that “[a]t most, creation of CCPs changes the topology of
the network of connections among firms, but it does not eliminate these connections,” that
clearing may lead speculators and hedgers to take larger positions, that a CCP’s failure to
effectively price counterparty risks may lead to moral hazard and adverse selection problems,
that the main effect of clearing would be to “redistribute losses consequent to a bankruptcy or
run,” and that clearinghouses have failed or come close to failing in the past, including in
connection with the 1987 market break); Manmohan Singh, Making OTC Derivatives Safe—A

contribute a portion of their own capital as part of their contingent resources. Clearing agencies
with such capital contributions to their contingent resources thus have an economic interest in
sound risk management. Registered clearing agencies are SROs that enforce applicable rules and
requirements under Commission oversight and are also in certain instances subject to CFTC
oversight. 565 Registered clearing agencies consequently also face a legal requirement that their
rules be designed to protect the public interest in the process of clearing securities or
derivatives. 566
Nevertheless, clearing agencies’ incentives for sound risk management may be tempered
by pressures to reduce costs and maximize profits that are distinct from the public interest goals
set forth in governing statutes, such as financial stability, and may result in clearing agencies
choosing tradeoffs between the costs and benefits of risk management that are not socially
efficient. Because the current market for clearing services is characterized by high barriers to
entry and limited competition, 567 the market power exercised by clearing agencies in the markets
they serve may blunt incentives to invest in risk management systems. 568 Further, even if
clearing agencies do internalize costs that they impose on their clearing members, they may fail
to internalize the consequences of their risk management decisions on other financial entities that

are connected to them through relationships with clearing members. 569 Such a failure represents
a financial network externality imposed by clearing agencies on the broader financial markets
and suggests that financial stability, as a public good, may be under-produced in equilibrium.
As discussed in more detail below, the proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 represent
a strengthening of the Commission’s regulation of registered clearing agencies. The Commission
preliminarily believes that the more specific requirements imposed by the proposed amendments
will further mitigate potential moral hazard associated with risk management at covered clearing
agencies. For instance, in the absence of policies and procedures that require periodic stresstesting and validation of credit and liquidity risk models, clearing agencies could potentially
choose to recalibrate models in periods of low volatility and avoid recalibration in periods of
high volatility, causing them to underestimate the risks they face.
The Commission also preliminarily believes that the additional specificity of proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e), along with proposed testing requirements, would be more effective at
mitigating these particular manifestations of incentive misalignments than existing Rule 17Ad22. The Commission preliminarily believes, as a result, that a general benefit of the proposed
amendments would be reductions in the likelihood of CCP failure that result from improved
safeguards. This general benefit would be realized to the extent that clearing agencies do not
already conform to new requirements under the proposed amendments. Despite the potential
incentive problems noted above and perhaps in anticipation of regulatory efforts, some registered
clearing agencies have taken steps to update their policies and procedures in accordance with the
standards contained in the proposed rules. The Commission notes that in some instances the

Stability in Financial Networks (NBER Working Paper No. 18727, Jan. 2013), available at

268

proposed rules establish as a minimum regulatory requirement certain current practices at some
registered clearing agencies. In these cases, the Commission preliminarily believes that
imposing the proposed requirements on covered clearing agencies will have the effect of
imposing consistent, higher minimum risk management standards across covered clearing
agencies.
In analyzing the economic consequences and effects of the rules proposed in this release,
the Commission has been guided by the objectives of Section 17A of the Exchange Act to have
due regard for the public interest, the protection of investors, the safeguarding of securities and
funds, the maintenance of fair competition, and to otherwise further the purposes of the
Exchange Act through the registration and regulation of clearing agencies. 570 It has also been
guided by the objectives of the Dodd-Frank Act to mitigate risks to the U.S. financial system,
promote counterparty protection, increase market transparency for OTC derivatives, and
facilitate financial stability. 571 The Commission has also taken into account the importance of
maintaining a well-functioning security-based swap market and the objectives of the Clearing
Supervision Act to establish an enhanced supervisory and risk control system for systemically
important clearing agencies and other FMUs. 572 In addition, as directed by the Clearing
Supervision Act, the Commission makes this proposal after giving careful consideration to the

Exchange Act).

See supra note 13 and accompanying text (noting the purpose of the Dodd-Frank Act to,

OTC derivatives markets).

standards set forth in the PFMI Report as the relevant international standard. Proposing rules
that maintain consistency with the standards set forth in the PFMI Report may reduce the
likelihood that market participants, including members of covered clearing agencies, would
restructure in an effort to operate in less-regulated markets.
The Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22
and proposed Rule 17Ab2-2 are consistent with the goals of Section 17A of the Exchange Act, to
promote the prompt and accurate clearing and settlement of transactions in securities, of the
Clearing Supervision Act, to enhance the supervision and oversight of clearing entities, and of
Title VII, to create a robust regulatory structure for security-based swaps. In proposing these
rules, the Commission is also mindful of the benefits that would accrue through maintaining
consistency with regulations adopted by the Board and the CFTC.
The Commission is sensitive to the economic consequences and effects of the proposed
rules, including their benefits and costs. In proposing these rules, the Commission has been
mindful of the economic consequences of the decisions it makes regarding the scope of applying
the proposed rules to covered clearing agencies. Moreover, the Commission acknowledges that,
since many of the proposed rules require a covered clearing agency to adopt new policies and
procedures, the economic effects and consequences of the proposed rules include those flowing
from the substantive results of those new policies and procedures. Under Section 3(f) of the
Exchange Act, whenever the Commission engages in rulemaking under the Exchange Act and is
required to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public
interest, it must consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action will

270

promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. 573 Further, as noted above, Section 17A
of the Exchange Act directs the Commission to have due regard for the public interest, the
protection of investors, the safeguarding of securities and funds, and maintenance of fair
competition among brokers and dealers, clearing agencies, and transfer agents when using its
authority to facilitate the establishment of a national system for clearance and settlement
transactions in securities. 574 In addition, Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act requires the
Commission, when making rules under the Exchange Act, to consider the impact such rules
would have on competition. 575 Section 23(a)(2) also prohibits the Commission from adopting
any rule that would impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance
of the purposes of the Exchange Act. 576
The Commission has attempted, where possible, to quantify the benefits and costs
anticipated to flow from the proposed rules. In some cases, as indicated below, data to quantify
the benefits and costs associated with the proposed rules are unavailable. For example,
implementing policies and procedures that require stress testing of financial resources available
to a covered clearing agency at least once each day may require additional investment in
infrastructure, but the particular infrastructure requirements will depend on existing systems and
a covered clearing agency’s choice of modeling techniques. In other cases, quantification
depends heavily on factors outside the control of the Commission, particularly with regard to the

number of potential new entrants affected by the proposed rules that in the future may be
designated systemically important by the FSOC.
Overall, the Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed rules represent
improvements in risk management, be it systemic, legal, credit, liquidity, general business,
custody, investment, or operational risk, in keeping with the requirements of Section 17A of the
Exchange Act and the Dodd-Frank Act. The Commission preliminarily believes that the
proposed rules will result in an increase in financial stability insofar as they result in minimum
standards at covered clearing agencies that are higher than those standards implied by current
practices at covered clearing agencies. In particular cases, such as new requirements related to
management of liquidity risk and general business risk, stability may arise as a result of higher
risk management standards at covered clearing agencies that effectively lower the probability
that either covered clearing agencies or their members default. As explained in Part IV.C.2,
reduced default probabilities for covered clearing agencies may, in turn, improve efficiency and
capital formation.
Request for Comments. The Commission requests comment on all aspects of the
economic analysis of the proposed rules, including their benefits and costs, as well as any effect
these proposed rules may have on competition, efficiency, and capital formation.
Acknowledging the data limitations noted above, the Commission encourages commenters to
provide data and analysis to help further quantify or estimate the potential benefits and costs of
the proposed rules.
B. Economic Baseline
1. Overview
To assess the economic effects of the proposed rules, including possible effects on
efficiency, competition, and capital formation, the Commission is using a baseline composed of
272

(1) the current regulatory framework under which registered clearing agencies operate, 577 and (2)
the current practices of registered clearing agencies as they relate to the rules being proposed
today.
More specifically, the baseline includes existing legal requirements applicable to
registered clearing agencies providing CCP or CSD services as they exist at the time of this
proposal, including applicable rules adopted by the Commission. Rule 17Ad-22 established a
regulatory framework for registered clearing agencies, including security-based swap clearing
agencies deemed registered pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. 578 Section 17A of the Exchange
Act generally regulates the national system for clearance and settlement, while Section 19 of the
Exchange Act describes the registration, responsibilities, and oversight of SROs. Further,
clearing agencies are subject to new requirements related to security-based swaps under the
Dodd-Frank Act.
In terms of current practice, registered clearing agencies are required to operate in
compliance with the requirements set forth in Rule 17Ad-22, though they may vary in the
particular ways they meet these requirements. Some variation in practices across clearing
agencies derives from the products they clear and the markets they serve. Additionally, the
Commission understands that certain registered clearing agencies have already adopted practices
consistent with several of the standards set forth in the PFMI Report. Accordingly, because
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) and proposed Rule 17Ab2-2 result in general consistency with the
standards set forth in the PFMI Report, the Commission preliminarily believes the resulting
577

A brief summary of the regulatory framework appears in Part IV.B.2. For a more
detailed summary of the current regulatory framework, see Part I.

578

See Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra note 5; see also supra note 25 and
accompanying text (discussing the deemed registered provision).

273

benefits and costs to covered clearing agencies would, in some cases, be incremental because of
the relationship between existing requirements applicable to registered clearing agencies, 579 the
anticipation of new requirements consistent with the standards set forth in the PFMI Report, 580
and the CPSS-IOSCO Recommendations that preceded the PFMI Report. 581 In certain other
cases, such as management of liquidity risk and general business risk, registered clearing
agencies that are covered clearing agencies would be required to make changes to current
policies and procedures, so the resulting costs, benefits and economic effects may be significant.
In order to consider the broader implications of these proposed rules on market activity,
including possible effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation, the baseline also
considers the current state of clearing and settlement services, including the number of
registered clearing agencies, the distribution of members across these clearing agencies, and the
volume of transactions these clearing agencies process. There are currently six registered
clearing agencies that provide CCP services and one registered clearing agency that provides
CSD services. As shown in Table 1, membership rates vary across these clearing agencies.
Together, registered clearing agencies processed over $2 quadrillion in financial market
transactions in 2012. 582

Registered clearing agencies are currently characterized by specialization and limited
competition. Clearing and settlement services exhibit high barriers to entry and economies of
scale. These features of the existing market, and the resulting concentration of clearing and
settlement within a handful of entities, informs our examination of effects of the proposed
amendments and rules on competition, efficiency, and capital formation. 584

2. Current Regulatory Framework for Clearing Agencies
The proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and proposed Rule 17Ab2-2 fit within the
Commission’s broad approach to regulation of the national system for clearance and settlement
that comprises the baseline for the Commission’s economic analysis. Key elements of the
current regulatory framework for registered clearing agencies are Section 17A of the Exchange
Act, 585 Titles VII and VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act, and existing Rule 17Ad-22. Section 17A of
the Exchange Act directs the Commission to facilitate the establishment of a national system for
the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions, having due regard for
the public interest, the protection of investors, the safeguarding of securities and funds, and the
maintenance of fair competition among brokers and dealers, clearing agencies, and transfer
agents. 586
Title VII, in response to the 2008 financial crisis, provides the Commission and the
CFTC with authority to regulate the mandatory exchange trading and central clearing and
settlement of swaps that formerly may have been OTC derivatives. 587 Title VII amended Section
17A of the Exchange Act by adding new paragraphs (g) through (j) requiring the registration of
clearing agencies serving the security-based swap market, giving the Commission authority to
adopt rules governing security-based swap clearing agencies, and requiring compliance by
registered clearing agencies with said rules. New Section 17A(i) of the Exchange Act provides

that the Commission may conform standards for and oversight of clearing agencies to reflect
evolving international standards.
The Clearing Supervision Act, adopted in Title VIII, provides for enhanced regulation of
FMUs, such as clearing agencies, and for enhanced coordination between the Commission, the
CFTC, and the Board by facilitating examinations and information sharing. 588 It also requires
the Commission and the CFTC to coordinate with the Board to develop risk management
supervision programs for clearing agencies designated systemically important. Section 805(a) of
the Clearing Supervision Act further provides that the Commission, considering relevant
international standards and existing prudential requirements, may prescribe regulations that
contain risk management standards for designated clearing agencies or the conduct of designated
activities by a financial institution.
Rule 17Ad-22 under the Exchange Act, adopted in 2012, requires a registered clearing
agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures that are
reasonably designed to meet certain minimum requirements for their operations and risk
management practices on an ongoing basis. These requirements are designed to work in tandem
with the SRO rule filing process and the requirement in Section 17A that the Commission must
make certain determinations regarding a clearing agency’s rules and operations for purposes of
initial and ongoing registration. 589 In its economic analysis of the rule, the Commission noted

that the economic characteristics of clearing agencies, including economies of scale, barriers to
entry, and the particulars of their legal mandates, may limit competition and confer market power
on such clearing agencies, which may lead to lower levels of service, higher prices, or underinvestment in risk management systems. 590 To address these potential market failures, Rule
17Ad-22 was adopted to strengthen the substantive regulation of clearing agencies, promote the
safe and reliable operation of clearing agencies, improve efficiency, transparency, and access to
clearing agencies, and promote consistency with international standards. 591 Part IV.B.3
discusses current practices at registered clearing agencies related to the requirements under Rule
17Ad-22.
a. Basel III Capital Requirements
In addition to requirements under the Exchange Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, and Rule
17Ad-22, other regulatory efforts are relevant to our analysis of the economic effects of proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e). In July 2012, the BCBS published the Basel III capital requirements, which
set forth interim rules governing the capital charges arising from bank exposures to CCPs related
to OTC derivatives, exchange-traded derivatives, and securities financing transactions. 592 Once
in effect, the Basel III capital requirements will create incentives for banks to clear derivatives
and securities financing transactions with CCPs licensed in a jurisdiction where the relevant
regulator has adopted rules or regulations consistent with the standards set forth in the PFMI
Report. Specifically, the Basel III capital requirements introduce new capital charges based on

counterparty risk for banks conducting derivatives transactions or securities financing
transactions through a CCP. 593
New capital charges under the Basel III framework relate to a bank’s trade exposure and
default fund exposure to a CCP and are a function of multiplying these exposures by a
corresponding risk weight. Historically, these exposures have carried a risk weight of zero. As
banking regulators adopt rules consistent with the Basel III capital requirements, however, these
weights will increase. The risk weight assigned under the Basel III capital requirements varies
depending on whether the counterparty is a QCCP. For example, risk weights for trade
exposures to a CCP generally would vary between 20% and 100% depending on the CCP’s
credit quality, while trade exposures to a QCCP would carry only a 2% risk weight. 594 In
addition, bank exposures to CCP default funds would carry a risk weight of 1250%. While bank
exposures to QCCP default funds will also carry a 1250% risk weight at low levels, under the
Basel III framework, default fund exposures’ contribution to a bank’s risk weighed assets will be
limited to at most 18% of the bank’s trade exposures to a given QCCP.
In some jurisdictions, banking regulators have already adopted rules that implement
many requirements under the Basel III framework. For example, in its Capital Requirements
Directive IV, which went into effect on July 17, 2013, the E.U. incorporated into its own legal
593

Since the Basel III framework applies lower capital requirements only to bank exposures
related to OTC and exchange-traded derivatives activity and securities financing transactions, the
Commission currently expects that, among all registered clearing agencies, FICC, ICEEU, and
OCC would be those affected by the Basel III capital requirements. Each would meet the
proposed definition of “covered clearing agency.”

594

The Basel III framework and rules adopted by the Board and the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency consistent with that framework apply lower risk weights of 2% or
4% to indirect exposures of banks to QCCPs. See Basel III capital requirements, supra note 59,
paras. 114–15; Regulatory Capital Rules, supra note 53, at 62103.

framework the Basel III framework. Article 301 contains rules governing bank exposures to
CCPs that are consistent with the Basel III framework. Similarly, the BCBS reports that the
Basel III capital requirements, with the exception of capital conservation buffers and
countercyclical buffers, are currently in force for Japanese banks. 595 Canada and Switzerland
also have risk-based capital rules in place. 596
In the United States, on July 9, 2013, the Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency jointly issued regulatory capital rules for U.S. banks consistent with the Basel III
framework. Upon its effective date of January 1, 2014, the Regulatory Capital Rules subject
bank exposures to CCPs and QCCPs to increased risk weights as specified in the Basel III
framework. 597 In addition to specifying risk weights, the rules define the term QCCP for banks
supervised by the Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. 598 According to
these rules, QCCP status applies to any CCP that is a designated FMU. Further, any CCP that (i)
requires full collateralization of contracts on a daily basis, and (ii), as demonstrated to the
satisfaction of its supervisory regulator, is in sound financial condition, is subject to supervision
by the Commission, and meets or exceeds the risk management standards established by the
Commission under Titles VII and VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act, is a QCCP. Based on this
definition, for banks regulated by the Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,

all covered clearing agencies, with the exception of ICEEU, 599 will be considered QCCPs for
purposes of calculating risk weights for trade exposures and default fund exposures.
In Europe, under EMIR, legal persons incorporated under the law of an E.U. member
state will only be able to use non-E.U. CCPs if those CCPs have been recognized under EMIR.
Further, only non-E.U. CCPs recognized under EMIR will meet the conditions necessary to be
considered a QCCP for E.U. purposes. Article 25 of EMIR outlines a recognition procedure for
non-E.U. CCPs and Article 89 provides a timeline for recognition. 600 FICC, NSCC, and OCC
applied for recognition under EMIR prior to a September 15, 2013 deadline. 601 As a result of
applying for recognition, these covered clearing agencies will be permitted to continue to offer
clearing services to existing E.U. clearing members until their applications are accepted or
rejected.
Additionally, the Basel III capital requirements, as adopted by the Board, the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency, and banking regulators in other jurisdictions, impose new

Although ICEEU would not be subject to QCCP treatment as a designated FMU, it would
nonetheless be considered a QCCP because it is subject to regulation by the Commission. See
Regulatory Capital Rules, supra note 53, at 62166 (defining “Qualifying Central Counterparty”
at 1.iii(B)(2)).

capital requirements related to unconditionally cancellable commitments and other off-balance
sheet exposures. For example, the Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will
require banks to include 10% of the notional amount of unconditionally cancellable
commitments in their calculation of total leverage exposure. 602 The rules cap the ratio of tier one
capital to total leverage exposure at 3% for banks subject to advanced approaches risk-based
capital rules. 603 To the extent that clearing agencies rely on financial resources from banks as
part of their risk management activities, new constraints on off-balance sheet exposures could
raise the cost of these activities.
b. Other Regulatory Efforts
Efforts by the Board and the CFTC to adopt rules that are consistent with the standards
set forth in the PFMI Report are also relevant to the economic analysis of the proposed rules. 604
In 2012, the Board adopted Regulation HH setting forth risk management standards for
designated FMUs, and, on January 10, 2014, the Board proposed amendments to Regulation HH
and its PSR Policy based upon the standards set forth in the PFMI Report. 605 Similarly, the
CFTC has published final rules intended to be consistent with the standards set forth in the PFMI
Report. 606

602

In proposing the amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and new Rule 17Ab2-2, the Commission
is mindful of these regulations proposed by the Board and adopted by the CFTC, which seek to
establish standards for designated FMUs and establish standards for certain DCOs,
respectively. 607 Section 712(a)(2) of Title VII requires the Commission, before commencing any
rulemaking regarding, among other things, security-based swap clearing agencies, to consult and
coordinate to the extent possible with the CFTC and prudential regulators for the purposes of
assuring regulatory consistency and comparability where possible. 608 In addition, as directed by
the Clearing Supervision Act, the Commission is proposing these amendments to Rule 17Ad-22
and Rule 17Ab2-2 after giving careful consideration to the PFMI Report as the relevant
international standard.
3. Current Practices
Current industry practices are a critical element of the economic baseline for registered
clearing agencies. Registered clearing agencies are required to operate in compliance with
existing Rule 17Ad-22 and, the Commission understands, have begun implementing some of the
standards set forth in the PFMI Report. Because proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) is consistent with
those standards and furthers the objectives of Section 17A of the Exchange Act, the Clearing
Supervision Act, and Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commission preliminarily believes
that the proposed rule represents, where it imposes higher minimum standards on covered
clearing agencies, an additional step towards improved risk management.

standards set forth in the PFMI Report).

An overview of current practices is set forth below and includes discussion of covered
clearing agency policies and procedures regarding general organization and risk management,
including the management of legal, credit, liquidity, business, custody, investment, and
operational risk. This discussion is based on the Commission’s general understanding of current
practices as of the date of this proposal, reflects the Commission’s experience supervising
registered clearing agencies, and is intended solely for the purpose of analyzing the economic
effects of the Commission’s proposal. The Commission notes that in each case, as SROs,
registered clearing agencies are required to submit any proposed rule or any proposed change in,
addition to, or deletion from the rules of the clearing agency to the Commission for review. 609
The Exchange Act also requires a registered clearing agency to enforce its rules, subject to
Commission oversight, and empowers the Commission to enforce the rules of a registered
clearing agency. 610
a. General Organization
i. Legal Risk
Legal risk is the risk that a registered clearing agency’s rules, policies, or procedures may
not be enforceable and concerns, among other things, its contracts, the rights of members, netting
arrangements, discharge of obligations, and settlement finality. Cross-border activities of a
registered clearing agency may also present elements of legal risk.

609

See supra Part I.A and note 95 (describing the Commission’s framework for regulation of
SROs and the SRO rule filing process).
610

See supra Part I.A, in particular notes 8–10 (describing the requirements applicable to
registered clearing agencies under the Exchange Act and the supervisory and enforcement tools
available to the Commission to facilitate compliance with those requirements under the
Exchange Act).

284

Rule 17Ad-22(d)(1) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to provide for a wellfounded, transparent, and enforceable legal framework for each aspect of its activities in all
relevant jurisdictions. 611 Each registered clearing agency makes a large portion of these policies
and procedures available to members and participants. In addition, each also publishes their rule
books and other key procedures publicly in order to promote the transparency of their legal
framework. 612
ii. Governance
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(8) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to have governance
arrangements that are clear and transparent to fulfill the public interest requirements in Section
17A of the Exchange Act applicable to clearing agencies, to support the objectives of owners and
participants, and to promote the effectiveness of the clearing agency’s risk management
procedures. 613 Important elements of a registered clearing agency’s governance arrangements
include its ownership structure; its charter, bylaws, and charters for committees of its board and
management committees; its rules, policies, and procedures; the composition and role of its
board, including the structure and role of board committees; reporting lines between

procedures, are publically available on each registered clearing agency’s website.

management and the board; and the processes that provide for management accountability with
respect to the registered clearing agency’s performance.
Each registered clearing agency has a board that governs its operations and supervises
senior management. Each registered clearing agency also has an independent audit committee of
the board and has established a board committee or committee of members tasked with
overseeing the clearing agency’s risk management functions. The boards of registered clearing
agencies that would be subject to proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) as covered clearing agencies
currently include non-management members.
iii. Framework for the Comprehensive Management of Risks
Rules 17Ad-22(b) and (d) require registered clearing agencies to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to measure and
mitigate credit exposures, identify operational risks, evaluate risks arising in connection with
cross-border and domestic links for the purpose of clearing or settling trades, achieve DVP
settlement, and implement risk controls to cover the clearing agency’s credit exposures to
participants. 614 Rule 17Ad-22(d)(4) requires a registered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
establish business continuity plans setting forth procedures for the recovery of operations in the
event of a disruption. 615 Rule 17Ad-22(d)(11) further requires a registered clearing agency to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to make key aspects of the clearing agency’s default procedures publicly available and establish

default procedures that ensure that the clearing agency can take timely action to contain losses
and liquidity pressures and to continue meeting its obligations in the event of a participant
default. 616
In addition to meeting these requirements, the Commission understands that registered
clearing agencies also specify actions to be taken when their resources are insufficient to cover
losses faced by the registered clearing agency. 617 These actions may include assessment rights
on clearing members, forced allocation, and contract termination.
b. Financial Risk Management
Registered clearing agencies that provide CCP services have a variety of options
available to mitigate the financial risks to which they are exposed. While the manner in which a
CCP chooses to mitigate these financial risks depends on the precise nature of the CCP’s
obligations, a common set of procedures have been implemented by many CCPs to manage
credit and liquidity risks. Broadly, these procedures enable CCPs to manage their risks by
reducing the likelihood of member defaults, limiting potential losses and liquidity pressure in the
event of a member default, implementing mechanisms that allocate losses across members, and
providing adequate resources to cover losses and meet payment obligations as required.
Registered clearing agencies that provide CCP services must be able to effectively
measure their credit exposures in order to properly manage those exposures. A CCP faces the
risk that its exposure to a member can change as a result of a change in prices, positions, or both.
616

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(11).

287

CCPs can ascertain current credit exposures to each member by, in some cases, marking each
member’s outstanding contracts to current market prices and, to the extent permitted by their
rules and supported by law, by netting any gains against any losses. Rule 17Ad-22 includes
certain requirements related to financial risk management by CCPs, including requirements to
measure credit exposures to members and to use margin requirements to limit these exposures.
These requirements are general in nature and provide registered clearing agencies flexibility to
measure credit risk and set margin. Within the bounds of Rule 17Ad-22, CCPs may employ
models and choose parameters that they conclude are appropriate to the markets they serve.
The current practices of registered clearing agencies that provide CCP services generally
include the following procedures: (1) measuring credit exposures at least once a day; (2) setting
margin coverage at a 99% confidence level over some set period; (3) using risk-based models;
(4) establishing a fund that mutualizes losses of defaults by one or more participants that exceed
margin coverage; (5) maintaining sufficient financial resources to withstand the default of at
least the largest participant family, 618 and (6), in the case of security-based swap transactions,

i. Credit Risk
Rule 17Ad-22(b)(1) requires a registered clearing agency that provides CCP services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to measure their credit exposures at least once per day. 620 Several CCPs have policies and
procedures designed to require measuring credit exposures multiple times per day.
Rule 17Ad-22(b)(3) requires a registered clearing agency that provides CCP services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to maintain sufficient financial resources to withstand, at a minimum, a default by the participant
family to which it has the largest exposure in extreme but plausible market conditions. 621 It
further requires CCPs for security-based swaps to establish, implement, maintain and enforce
written policies and procedures reasonably designed to maintain additional financial resources
sufficient to withstand, at a minimum, a default by the two participant families to which it has
the largest exposures in extreme but plausible market conditions, in its capacity as a CCP for

security-based swaps. 622 Accordingly, the Commission notes that Rule 17Ad-22(b)(3) imposes a
“cover two” requirement on CCPs for security-based swaps in order to protect such CCPs from
the extreme jump-to-default risk and nonlinear payoffs associated with the nature of the financial
products they clear and the participants in the markets they serve. Meanwhile, CCPs that clear
products other than security-based swaps are subject to a “cover one” requirement. 623 Rule
17Ad-22(b)(3) also states that such policies and procedures may provide that additional financial
resources be maintained by the CCP in combined or separately maintained funds. 624
Under existing rules, CCPs collect contributions from their members for the purpose of
establishing guaranty or clearing funds to mutualize losses under extreme but plausible market
conditions. Currently, the guaranty funds or clearing funds consist of liquid assets and their sizes
vary depending on a number of factors, including the products the CCP clears and the
characteristics of CCP members. In particular, the guaranty funds for CCPs that clear securitybased swaps are relatively larger, as measured by the size of the fund as a percentage of the total
and largest exposures, than the guaranty or clearing funds maintained by CCPs for other
financial instruments. CCPs generally take the liquidity of collateral into account when
determining member obligations. Applying haircuts to assets posted as margin, among other
things, mitigates the liquidity risk associated with selling margin assets in the event of a
participant default.

See id.

290

ii. Collateral and Margin
Rule 17Ad-22(b)(2) requires a registered clearing agency that provides CCP services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to use margin requirements to limit their exposures to participants. 625 This margin can also be
used to reduce a CCP’s losses in the event of a participant default.
Registered clearing agencies that provide CCP services take positions as substituted
counterparties once their trade guarantee goes into effect. Therefore, if a counterparty whose
obligations the registered clearing agency has guaranteed defaults, the covered clearing agency
may face market risk, which can take one of two forms. First, a covered clearing agency is
subject to the risk of movement in the market prices of the defaulting member’s open positions.
Where a seller defaults and fails to deliver a security, the covered clearing agency may need to
step into the market to buy the security in order to complete settlement and deliver the security to
the buyer. Similarly, where a buyer defaults, the covered clearing agency may need to meet
payment obligations to the seller. Thus, in the interval between when a member defaults and
when the covered clearing agency must meet its obligations as a substituted counterparty in order
to complete settlement, market price movements expose the covered clearing agency to market
risk. Second, the covered clearing agency may need to liquidate non-cash margin collateral
posted by the defaulting member. The covered clearing agency is therefore exposed to the risk
that erosion in market prices of the collateral posted by the defaulting member could result in the
covered clearing agency having insufficient financial resources to cover the losses in the
defaulting member’s open positions.

625

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(b)(2).

291

To manage their exposure to market risk resulting from fulfilling a defaulting member’s
obligations, registered clearing agencies compute margin requirements using inputs such as
portfolio size, volatility, and sensitivity to various risk factors that are likely to influence security
prices. Moreover, since the size of price movements is, in part, a function of time, registered
clearing agencies may limit their exposure to market risk by marking participant positions to
market daily and, in some cases, more frequently. CCPs also use similar factors to determine
haircuts applied to assets posted by members in satisfaction of margin requirements. To manage
market risk associated with collateral liquidation, CCPs consider the current prices of assets
posted as collateral and price volatility, asset liquidity, and the correlation of collateral assets and
a member’s portfolio of open positions. Further, because CCPs need to value their margin assets
in times of financial stress, their rulebooks may include features such as market-maker
domination charges that increase clearing fund obligations regarding open positions of members
in securities in which the member serves as a dominant market maker. The reasoning behind this
charge is that, should a member default, liquidity in products in which the member makes
markets may fall, leaving these positions more difficult to liquidate for non-defaulting
participants.
Rule 17Ab-22(b)(2) also requires a registered clearing agency that provides CCP services
to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to provide for risk-based models and parameters to set margin requirements. 626 The
generally recognized standard for such models and parameters is, under normal market
conditions, price movements that produce changes in exposures that are expected to breach
margin requirements or other risk controls only 1% of the time (i.e., at a 99% confidence
626

See id.

292

interval) over a designated time horizon. 627 Currently, CCPs use margin models to ensure
coverage at a single-tailed 99% confidence interval. Losses beyond this level are typically
covered by the CCP’s guaranty fund. This standard comports with existing international
standards for bank capital requirements, which require banks to measure market risks at a 99%
confidence interval when determining regulatory capital requirements. 628
Rule 17Ad-22(b)(2) also requires a registered clearing agency that provides CCP services
to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to review such margin requirements and the related risk-based models and parameters

627

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(a)(4). The Commission notes that because it is proposing to
add new definitions to Rule 17Ad-22(a), “normal market conditions” would appear in Rule
17Ad-22(a)(12) in the event the proposed rules are adopted. The Commission is not proposing
to alter the definition of “normal market conditions.”

Revised Framework (June 2004), available at http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs107.pdf; see also

Mortgage Mkts, Sept. 1998), available at
http://www.freddiemac.com/finance/smm/july98/pdfs/hen_hirt.pdf.
Prior to this standard, banks measured value-at-risk using a range of confidence intervals
from 90–99%. See BCBS, An Internal Model-Based Approach to Market Risk Capital
Requirements, at 12 (Apr. 1995), available at http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs17.pdf. When
determining the minimum quantitative standards for calculating risk measurements, the BCBS
noted then the importance of specifying “a common and relatively conservative confidence
level,” choosing the 99% confidence interval over other less conservative measures. See id.
Since its adoption in 1998, the standard has become a generally recognized practice of
banks to quantify credit risk as the worst expected loss that a portfolio might incur over an
appropriate time horizon at a 99% confidence interval. See Kenji Nishiguchi, Hiroshi Kawai &

evaluates the adequacy of margin models, parameters, and assumptions. Additionally, CCPs are
required to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to provide for an annual model validation consisting of evaluating the
performance of the CCPs’ margin models and the related parameters and assumptions associated
with such models by a qualified person who is free from influence from the persons responsible
for the development or operation of the models being validated. 630
iii. Liquidity Risk
In addition to credit risk and the aforementioned market risk, registered clearing agencies
also face liquidity or funding risk. Currently, to complete the settlement process, registered
clearing agencies that employ netting rely on incoming payments from participants in net debit
positions in order to make payments to participants in net credit positions. If a participant does
not have sufficient funds or securities in the form required to fulfill a payment obligation
immediately when due (even though it may be able to pay at some future time), or if a settlement
bank is unable to make an incoming payment on behalf of a participant, a registered clearing
agency may face a funding shortfall. Such funding shortfalls may occur due to a lack of
financial resources necessary to meet delivery or payment obligations, however even registered
clearing agencies that do hold sufficient financial resources to meet their obligations may not
carry those in the form required for delivery or payments to participants.
A registered clearing agency that provides CCP services may hold additional financial
resources to cover potential funding shortfalls in the form of collateral. As noted above, CCPs
629

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(b)(2).

630

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(b)(4).

294

may take the liquidity of collateral into account when determining member obligations.
Applying haircuts to illiquid assets posted as margin mitigates the liquidity risk associated with
selling margin assets in the event of participant default. Some registered CCPs also arrange for
liquidity provision from other financial institutions using lines of credit. Additionally, some
registered clearing agencies enter into prearranged funding agreements with their members
pursuant to their rules. For example, members of one registered clearing agency are obligated to
enter into repurchase agreements against securities that would have been delivered to a
defaulting member.
No rule under the Exchange Act currently requires a registered clearing agency through
its written policies and procedures to address liquidity risk.
c. Settlement
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(5) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to employ money
settlement arrangements that eliminate or strictly limit the clearing agency’s settlement bank
risks and require funds transfers to the clearing agency to be final when effected. 631 Rule 17Ad22(d)(12) further requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that final settlement
occurs no later than the end of the settlement day. 632 Accordingly, for example, certain
registered clearing agencies provide for final settlement of securities transfers no later than the
end of the day of the transaction. Rule 17Ad-22(d)(15) also requires a registered clearing agency
to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
631

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(5).

632

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(12).

295

designed to state to its participants the clearing agency’s obligations with respect to physical
deliveries and identify and manage the risks from these obligations. 633
d. CSDs and Exchange-of-Value Settlement Systems
i. CSDs
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(10) requires a registered clearing agency that provides CSD services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to maintain securities in an immobilized or dematerialized form for transfer by book entry to the
greatest extent possible. Currently, some securities, such as mutual fund securities and
government securities, are issued primarily or solely on a dematerialized basis. Dematerialized
shares do not exist as physical certificates but are held in book entry form in the name of the
owner (which, where the master security holder file is not maintained on paper due to the use of
technology, is also referred to as electronic custody). Other types of securities may be issued in
the form of one or more physical security certificates, which could be held by the CSD to
facilitate immobilization. Alternatively, securities may be held by the beneficial owner in record
name, in the form of book-entry positions, where the issuer offers the ability for a security holder
to hold through the direct registration system. Whether immobilization occurs at the CSD or
through direct registration depends on what is provided for by the issuer.
When a trade occurs, the depository’s accounting system credits one participant account
and debits another participant account. Transactions between counterparties in dematerialized
shares are recorded by the registrar responsible for maintaining the paper or electronic register of
security holders, such as by a transfer agent, and reflected in customer accounts.

633

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(15).

296

Registered CSDs currently reconcile ownership positions in securities against CSD
ownership positions on the security holders list daily, mitigating the risk of unauthorized creation
or deletion of shares.
ii. Exchange-of-Value Settlement Systems
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(13) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to eliminate principal
risk by linking securities transfers to funds transfers in a way that achieves delivery versus
payment, 634 which serves to link obligations by conditioning the final settlement of one upon the
final settlement of the other. One registered clearing agency, for example, operates a Model 2
DVP system that provides for gross securities transfers during the day followed by an end-of-day
net funds settlement. Under the rules governing the clearing agency’s system, the delivering
party in a DVP transaction is assured that it will be paid for the securities once they are credited
to the receiving party’s securities account. DVP eliminates the risk that a buyer would lose the
purchase price of a security purchased from a defaulting seller or that a seller would lose the sold
security without receiving payment for a security acquired by a defaulting buyer.
For example, one registered clearing agency has rules governing its continuous net
settlement (“CNS”) system, under which it becomes the counterparty for settlement purposes at
the point its trade guarantee attaches, thereby assuming the obligation of its members that are
receiving securities to receive and pay for those securities, and the obligation of members that
are delivering securities to make the delivery. Unless the clearing agency has invoked its default
rules, it is not obligated to make those deliveries until it receives from members with delivery
634

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(13); see also Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra
note 5, at 66256.

297

obligations deliveries of such securities; rather, deliveries that come into CNS ordinarily are
promptly redelivered to parties that are entitled to receive them through an allocation algorithm.
Members are obligated to take and pay for securities allocated to them in the CNS process.
These rules also provide mechanisms to allow receiving members a right to receive high priority
in the allocation of deliveries, and also permit a member to buy-in long positions that have not
been delivered to it by the close of business on the scheduled settlement date.
e. Default Management
i. Participant-Default Rules and Procedures
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(11) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to make key aspects of
its default procedures publicly available and establish default procedures that ensure it can take
timely action to contain losses and liquidity pressures and to continue meeting its obligations in
the event of a participant default. The rules of registered clearing agencies typically state what
constitutes a default, identify whether the board or a committee of the board may make that
determination, and describe what steps the clearing agency may take to protect itself and its
members. In this regard, registered clearing agencies typically attempt, among other things, to
hedge and liquidate a defaulting member’s positions. Rules of registered clearing agencies also
include information about the allocation of losses across available financial resources.
ii. Segregation and Portability
No rule under the Exchange Act currently requires a registered clearing agency through
its written policies and procedures to enable the portability of positions of a member’s customers
and the collateral provided in connection therewith. Additionally, no rule under the Exchange

298

Act currently requires a registered clearing agency through its written policies and procedures to
protect the positions of a member’s customers from the default or insolvency of the member. 635
f. General Business and Operational Risk Management
i. General Business Risk
Business risk refers to the risks and potential losses arising from a registered clearing
agency’s administration and operation as a business enterprise that are neither related to member
default nor separately covered by financial resources designated to mitigate credit or liquidity
risk. While Rule 17Ad-22 sets forth requirements for registered clearing agencies to identify,
monitor, and mitigate or eliminate a broad array of risks through written policies and procedures,
no rule under the Exchange Act expressly requires a registered clearing agency through its
written policies and procedures to identify, monitor, and manage general business risk or to meet
a capital requirement. Nonetheless, registered clearing agencies currently have certain internal
controls in place to mitigate business risk. Some clearing agencies, for instance, have policies
and procedures that identify an auditor who is responsible for examining accounts, records, and
transactions, as well as other duties prescribed in the audit program. Other registered clearing
agencies allow members to collectively audit the books of the clearing agency on an annual
basis, at their own expense.
ii. Custody and Investment Risks
Registered clearing agencies face default risk from commercial banks that they use to
effect money transfers among participants, to hold overnight deposits, and to safeguard
collateral. Rule 17Ad-22(d)(3) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement,
635

See supra note 293 (discussing existing rules applicable to registered broker-dealers that
address customer security positions and funds in cash securities and listed option markets,
thereby promoting segregation and portability at the broker-dealer level).

299

maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to (i) hold assets in a
manner that minimizes risk of loss or delay in its access to them; and (ii) invest assets in
instruments with minimal credit, market, and liquidity risks. 636 Registered clearing agencies
currently seek to minimize the risk of loss or delay in access by holding assets that are highly
liquid (e.g., cash, U.S. Treasury securities, or securities issued by a U.S. government agency) and
by engaging banks to custody the assets and facilitate settlement. Typically, registered clearing
agencies take steps to ensure that assets held in custody are protected from claims from the
custodian’s creditors using trust accounts or equivalent arrangements. Additionally, designated
clearing agencies may gain access to account services at a Federal Reserve Bank, to the extent
such services are not already available as the result of other laws and regulations. 637
iii. Operational Risk
Operational risk refers to a broad category of potential losses arising from deficiencies in
internal processes, personnel, and information technology. Registered clearing agencies face
operational risk from both internal and external sources, including human error, system failures,
security breaches, and natural or man-made disasters. Rule 17Ad-22(d)(4) requires a registered
clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to identify sources of operational risk and to minimize those risks through
the development of appropriate systems, controls and procedures. 638 It also requires a registered

636

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(3).

637

See supra Part II.B.4.f.iii (discussing the requirement under proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(7)(iii) for a covered clearing agency to have policies and procedures reasonably designed
to ensure it has access to account services at a Federal Reserve Bank or other relevant central
bank).
638

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(4).

300

clearing agency to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to (i) implement systems that are reliable and secure, and have adequate,
scalable capacity; and (ii) have business continuity plans that allow for timely recovery of
operations and fulfillment of a clearing agency’s obligations. 639
As a result, registered clearing agencies have developed and currently maintain plans to
assure the safeguarding of securities and funds, the integrity of automated data processing
systems, and the recovery of securities, funds, or data under a variety of loss or destruction
scenarios. 640 These plans may include turning operations over to a secondary site that is located
a sufficient distance from the primary location to ensure a distinct geographic risk profile. In
addition, registered clearing agencies generally maintain an internal audit department to review
the adequacy of their internal controls, procedures, and records with respect to operational risks.
Some registered clearing agencies also engage independent accountants to perform an annual
study and evaluation of the internal controls relating to their operations. 641
g. Access
i. Access and Participation Requirements
Rule 17Ad-22(b)(5) requires a registered clearing agency that provides CCP services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to provide the opportunity for a person that does not perform any dealer or security-based swap
639

See id.

640

Many of these practices had been previously developed pursuant to prior Commission
guidelines. See ARP I and II, supra note 324; see also supra note 326 (discussing related
requirements under proposed Regulation SCI).

301

dealer services to obtain membership on fair and reasonable terms at the clearing agency to clear
securities for itself or on behalf of other persons. 642 Rule 17Ad-22(b)(6) requires a registered
clearing agency that provides CCP services to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to have membership standards that do not require
participants to maintain a portfolio of any minimum size or a minimum transaction volume. 643
Rule 17Ad-22(b)(7) requires a registered clearing agency that provides CCP services to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to provide a person that maintains net capital equal or greater than $50 million with the ability to
obtain membership at the clearing agency, provided such persons are able to comply with
reasonable membership standards, with higher net capital requirements permissible subject to
Commission approval. 644
In addition, Rule 17Ad-22(d)(2) requires a registered clearing agency to establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to require
participants to have sufficient financial resources and robust operational capacity to meet
obligations arising from participation in the clearing agency, have procedures in place to monitor
that participation requirements are met on an ongoing basis, and have participation requirements
that are objective and publicly disclosed, and permit fair and open access. 645 Typically, a
registered clearing agency’s rulebook requires applicants for membership to provide certain
financial and operational information prior to being admitted as a member and on an ongoing
642

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(b)(5).

643

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(b)(6).

302

basis as a condition of continuing membership. Registered clearing agencies review this
information to ensure that the applicant has the operational capability to meet the other demands
of interfacing with the clearing agency. In particular, registered clearing agencies typically
require that an applicant demonstrate that it has adequate personnel capable of handling
transactions with the clearing agency and adequate physical facilities, books and records, and
procedures to fulfill its anticipated commitments to, and to meet the operational requirements of,
the clearing agency and other members with necessary promptness and accuracy. As a result, an
applicant needs to demonstrate that it has adequate personnel capable of handling transactions
with the clearing agency and adequate physical facilities, books and records, and procedures to
conform to conditions or requirements in these areas that the clearing agency reasonably may
deem necessary for its protection. Registered clearing agencies have published these
requirements on their websites.
Registered clearing agencies use an ongoing monitoring process to help them understand
relevant changes in the financial condition of their members and to mitigate credit risk exposure
of the clearing agency to its members. The risk management staff analyzes financial statements
filed with regulators, as well as information obtained from other SROs and gathered from
various financial publications, so that the clearing agency may evaluate, for instance, whether
members maintain sufficient financial resources and robust operational capacity to meet their
obligations as participants in the clearing agency pursuant to existing Rule 17Ad-22(d)(2)(i).
Table 1 contains membership statistics for registered clearing agencies. 646 Current
membership generally reflects features of cleared markets. The decision to become a clearing
member depends on the products being cleared, the structure of these asset markets as well as the
646

See supra Part IV.B.1.

303

current state of regulation for cleared markets. For example, the structure of security-based swap
markets and the payoffs to security-based swap contracts differs markedly from that of equity
markets and common stock, which may explain some of the differences between the
concentrated membership of certain clearing agencies and the relatively broader membership of
others.
ii. Tiered Participation Arrangements
Tiered participation arrangements occur when clearing members (direct participants)
provide access to clearing services to third parties (indirect participants). No rule under the
Exchange Act currently requires a registered clearing agency through its written policies and
procedures to identify, monitor, and manage material risks arising from tiered participation
arrangements. The Commission understands, however, that certain registered clearing agencies
have policies and procedures currently in place in order to identify, monitor, or manage such
arrangements. Specifically, such clearing agencies rely on information gathered from, and
distributed by, direct participants in order to manage these tiered participation arrangements. For
example, under some covered clearing agencies’ rules, direct participants generally have the
responsibility to indicate to the clearing agency whether a transaction submitted for clearing
represents a proprietary or customer position. Such rules further require direct participants to
calculate, and notify the clearing agency of the value of, each customer’s collateral. Direct
participants also communicate with indirect participants regarding the clearing agency’s margin
and other requirements.
iii. Links
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(7) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to evaluate the
potential sources of risks that can arise when the clearing agency establishes links either cross304

border or domestically to clear or settle trades, and ensure that the risks are managed prudently
on an ongoing basis. 647
Each registered clearing agency is linked to other clearing organizations, trading
platforms, and service providers. For instance, a link between U.S. and Canadian clearing
agencies allows U.S. members to clear and settle valued securities transactions with participants
of a Canadian securities depository. The link is designed to facilitate cross-border transactions
by allowing members to use a single depository interface for U.S. and Canadian dollar
transactions and eliminate the need for split inventories. 648 Registered clearing agencies that
provide CCP services currently establish links to allow members to realize collateral and other
operational efficiencies.
h. Efficiency
i. Efficiency and Effectiveness
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(6) requires a registered clearing agency to establish, implement,
maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to require the clearing
agency to be cost-effective in meeting the requirements of participants while maintaining safe
and secure operations. 649 Registered clearing agencies have procedures to control costs and to
regularly review pricing levels against operating costs. These clearing agencies may use a
formal budgeting process to control expenditures, and may review pricing levels against their

647

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(7).

648

See Exchange Act Release No. 52784 (Nov. 16, 2005), 71 FR 70902 (Nov. 23, 2005);

649

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(6).

305

costs of operation during the annual budget process. Registered clearing agencies also analyze
workflows in order to make recommendations to improve their operating efficiency.
ii. Communication Procedures and Standards
Although no rule under the Exchange Act expressly requires a registered clearing agency
through its written policies and procedures to use or accommodate relevant internationally
accepted communication procedures and standards, the Commission believes that registered
clearing agencies already use these standards. Registered clearing agencies typically rely on
electronic communication with market participants, including members. For example, some
registered clearing agencies have rules in place stating that clearing members must retrieve
instructions, notices, reports, data, and other items and information from the clearing agency
through electronic data retrieval systems. Some registered clearing agencies have the ability to
rely on signatures transmitted, recorded, or stored through electronic, optical, or similar means.
Other clearing agencies have policies and procedures that provide for certain emergency
meetings using telephonic or other electronic notice.
i. Transparency
Transparency requirements and disclosures by registered clearing agencies serve to limit
the size of potential information asymmetries between registered clearing agencies, their
members, and market participants. Rule 17Ad-22(d)(9) requires a registered clearing agency to
establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to provide market participants with sufficient information for them to identify and evaluate risks
and costs associated with using the clearing agency’s services. 650 Information regarding the
operations and services of each registered clearing agency can be viewed publicly either on the
650

See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(9).

306

clearing agency’s website or a website maintained by an affiliate of the clearing agency.
Because registered clearing agencies are SROs, 651 changes to their rules are published by the
Commission and are available for public viewing on each clearing agency’s website. 652
Besides providing market participants with information on the risks and costs associated
with their services, registered clearing agencies regularly provide information to their members
to assist them in managing their risk exposures and potential funding obligations. Some of these
disclosures may be common to all members—such as information about the composition of
clearing fund assets—while other disclosures that concern particular positions or obligations may
only be made to individual members.
4. Determinations by the Commission
Currently, although Rule 17Ad-22(d) applies to registered clearing agencies, no mechanism
exists for the Commission to make determinations with regard to covered clearing agencies of
the type that would occur under proposed Rule 17Ab2-2. 653
C. Consideration of Benefits, Costs, and the Effect on Competition, Efficiency, and
Capital Formation
The discussion below sets forth the potential economic effects stemming from the
proposed rules. The section begins by framing more general economic issues related to the
proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and proposed Rule 17Ab2-2. The discussion that
follows considers the effects of the proposed rules on efficiency, competition, and capital

651

See supra Part I.A and note 95 (describing the Commission’s framework for regulation of
SROs and the SRO rule filing process).
652

See supra note 362 (discussing requirements under Rule 19b-4(i)).

653

See proposed Rule 17Ab2-2, infra Part VII.

307

formation. The section ends with a discussion of the benefits and costs flowing from specific
provisions of the proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and proposed Rule 17Ab2-2.
1. General Economic Considerations
The proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22, taken as a whole, would likely produce
economic effects that are either conditioned on multiple provisions of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)
being implemented as a set or are simply common to multiple provisions of the proposal. Since
these economic effects are attributable in some way to each of the individual subsections of
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e), this section considers potential impacts of the proposed amendments,
as a whole, through their effects on systemic risk, the discretion with which covered clearing
agencies operate, market integrity, concentration in the market for clearing services and among
clearing members, and QCCP status.
a. Systemic Risk
A large portion of financial activity in the United States ultimately flows through one or
more registered clearing agencies that would become covered clearing agencies under the
proposed rules. These clearing agencies have direct links to members and indirect links to the
customers of members. They are also linked to each other through common members,
operational processes, and in some cases cross-margining and cross-guaranty agreements. These
linkages allow covered clearing agencies to provide opportunities for risk-sharing but also allow
them to serve as potential conduits for risk transmission. Covered clearing agencies play an
important role in fostering the proper functioning of financial markets. If they are not effectively
managed, however, they may transmit financial shocks, particularly on days of market stress.
The centralization of clearance and settlement activities at covered clearing agencies
allows market participants to reduce costs, increase operational efficiency, and manage risks

308

more effectively. 654 While providing benefits to market participants, the concentration of these
activities at a covered clearing agency implicitly exposes market participants to the risks faced
by covered clearing agencies themselves, making risk management at covered clearing agencies
a key element of systemic risk mitigation.
b. Discretion
The Commission recognizes that the degree of discretion permitted by the proposed rules
partially determines their economic effect. Even where current practices at covered clearing
agencies would not need to change significantly to comply with the proposed rules, covered
clearing agencies could still potentially face costs associated with the limitations on discretion
that will result from the proposed rules, including costs related to limiting a clearing agency’s
flexibility to respond to changing economic environments. For example, to the extent that
covered clearing agencies currently in compliance with the proposed rules value the ability to
periodically allow net liquid assets to drop below the minimum level specified by the proposed
rules, they may incur additional costs because under the proposed rules they lose the option to do
so.
Although there may be costs to limiting the degree of discretion covered clearing
agencies have over risk management policies and procedures, the Commission preliminarily
believes there are also potential benefits. As discussed above, clearing agencies may not fully
internalize the social costs of poor internal controls and thus, given additional discretion, may not
craft appropriate risk management policies and procedures. For example, even if existing
regulation provides clearing agencies with the incentives necessary to manage risks appropriately
in a static sense, they may not provide clearing agencies with incentives to update their risk
654

Cf. PFMI Report, supra note 1, at 9.

309

management programs in response to dynamic market conditions. Additionally, efforts at cost
reduction or profit maximization could encourage clearing agencies to reduce the quality of risk
management by, for example, choosing to update parameters and assumptions rapidly in periods
of low volatility while maintaining stale parameters and assumptions in periods of high
volatility. By reducing covered clearing agencies’ discretion over their policies and procedures,
the proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 may reduce the likelihood that risk management
practices lag behind changing market conditions by requiring periodic analysis of model
performance while paying particular attention to periods of high volatility or low liquidity.
Subjecting covered clearing agencies to more specific requirements may have other
benefits for cleared markets as well. Recent academic research has explored the ways in which
regulation affects liquidity in financial markets when participants are “ambiguity averse,” where
ambiguity is defined as uncertainty over the set of payoff distributions for an asset. 655 Such
investors may heavily weigh worst-case scenarios when they decide whether to hold the asset.
The Commission preliminarily believes that regulation aimed at enhancing standards for covered
clearing agencies while reducing their discretion may reduce the ambiguity associated with
holding cleared assets in the presence of credit risk and settlement risk 656 and thus may allow
investors to rule out worst-case states of the world. In this regard, more specific rules may

655

See e.g., Itzhak Gilboa & David Schmeidler, Maxmin Expected Utility with Non-Unique
Prior, 18 J. Mathematical Econ. 141 (1989) (proposing an axiomatic foundation of a decision
rule based on maximizing expected minimum payoff of a strategy).
656

Specifically, by performing key roles in the transaction process, clearing agencies serve
to maintain higher minimum payoffs in poor states of the world, by, for example, immobilizing
securities or adopting DVP systems.
310

encourage participation in cleared markets by investors that benefit from resulting risk-sharing
opportunities. 657
c. Market Integrity
The Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22
could provide the benefit of reduced potential for market fragmentation that may arise from
different requirements across regulatory regimes. These benefits would flow to markets that are
also supervised by the Board and the CFTC, and internationally, since cleared markets are global
in nature and linked to one another through common participants.
Based on its consultation and coordination with other regulators, the Commission
preliminarily believes its proposal is consistent and comparable, where possible and appropriate,
with the rules and policy statement proposed by the Board and the rules adopted by the CFTC.
The Board’s proposed revisions to its PSR Policy incorporate only the headline principles
contained in the PFMI Report and are consistent with the Commission’s approach in proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e). 658
With respect to the rules proposed by the Board and adopted by the CFTC, in many
instances the rules proposed by the Commission are consistent with these regulatory provisions,
as each of the three rule sets are intended to be consistent with the headline principles contained
657

See e.g., David Easley & Maureen O’Hara, Microstructure and Ambiguity, 65 J. Fin.
1817 (2010) (using a theoretical model of trade on venues that differ in rules, the authors show
how rules that reduce market-related ambiguity may induce a participatory equilibrium).
658

The Commission preliminarily notes that the Commission’s proposal provides a greater
level detail than the proposed PSR Policy and is tailored to take into account considerations
particular to covered clearing agencies, consistent with the Commission’s role as the supervisory
agency under the Clearing Supervision Act. The Commission further notes that, in contrast to
the Board’s PSR Policy, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) would constitute an enforceable federal
regulation if adopted. See proposed PSR Policy, supra note 53, at 2841 (distinguishing the legal
effect of proposed Reg. HH from the proposed PSR Policy).

311

in the PFMI Report, 659 but the Commission’s proposals differ from those requirements proposed
by the Board and adopted by the CFTC in terms of the specific portions of the key considerations
and explanatory text contained in the PFMI Report that are, or are not, referenced or emphasized.
In some cases, the Commission is proposing more specific requirements than those proposed by
the Board or adopted the CFTC, and, in others, it is proposing rules with fewer additional
specific requirements.
The following discussion provides examples of proposed rule provisions that are
representative of the differences between the Commission’s proposal and the Board’s proposal
and the CFTC’s final rules, where the Commission is proposing more detailed requirements than
those proposed by the Board or adopted by the CFTC:
•

In proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4), the Commission would explicitly permit a covered
clearing agency’s policies and procedures to be reasonably designed to maintain financial
resources either in combined or separately maintained clearing or default funds. Rules
proposed by the Board and adopted by the CFTC do not include a comparable provision.
The Commission preliminarily believes this requirement is appropriate because

659

For example, the Commission preliminarily believes that proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23),
requiring disclosure of rules, key procedures, and market data, contains the same substantive
requirements as rules proposed by the Board and adopted by the CFTC. See proposed Reg. HH,
supra note 53, at 3686–88, 3693 (the Board proposing Sec. 234.3(a)(23)); DCO Int’l Standards
Release, supra note 53, at 72493–94, 72521 (CFTC adopting Sec. 39.37).
In this case, the Commission notes that regulators have taken slightly different
approaches to achieving disclosure of rules, key procedures, and market data. The CFTC
requires disclosure through the CPSS-IOSCO Disclosure Framework. See DCO Int’l Standards
Release, supra note 53, at 72493–94, 72521 (CFTC adopting Sec. 39.37(a)); see also CPSSIOSCO, Disclosure Framework for Financial Market Infrastructures (Apr. 2012), available at
http://www.bis.org/publ/cpss101c.pdf. The Commission and the Board have proposed to require
disclosure through a comprehensive public disclosure set forth in their proposed rules. The
Commission preliminarily believes, however, that the three disclosure regimes impose the same
substantive requirements.

312

permitting a covered clearing agency to maintain a separate default fund for purposes of
complying with proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(ii) and (iii) increases the range of options
available to covered clearing agencies when complying with this requirement and, when
used appropriately, will allow a covered clearing agency to distribute the costs and
responsibilities of clearing membership more equitably among clearing members.
•

In proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7), the Commission would permit a covered clearing
agency’s policies and procedures to include as qualifying liquid resources (i) assets that
are readily available and convertible into cash through prearranged funding arrangements
determined to be highly reliable even in extreme but plausible market conditions by the
board of directors of the covered clearing agency, following a review conducted for this
purpose not less than annually, and (ii) other assets that are readily available and eligible
for pledging to a relevant central bank, if the covered clearing agency has access to
routine credit at such central bank that permits said pledges or other transactions by the
covered clearing agency. Rules proposed by the Board do not include a provision
comparable to either of these two proposed requirements, and rules adopted by the CFTC
do not include a provision including as qualifying liquid resources assets readily available
and eligible for pledging to a central bank. 660
The Commission preliminarily believes this requirement is appropriate given the
specific circumstances of the U.S. securities markets. U.S. securities markets are among
the largest and most liquid in the world, and CCPs operating in the United States are also
among the largest in the world. The resulting peak liquidity demands of CCPs are

660

See proposed Reg. HH, supra note 53, at 3677–78, 3691 (the Board proposing Sec.
234.3(a)(7)); DCO Int’l Standards Release, supra note 53, at 72487–91, 72518 (CFTC adopting
Sec. 39.33(c)).

313

therefore proportionately large on both an individual and an aggregate basis, and the
ability of CCPs to satisfy a requirement limiting qualifying liquid resources to committed
facilities could be constrained by the capacity of traditional liquidity sources in the U.S.
banking sector in certain circumstances. The Commission preliminarily believes that
limiting the funding arrangements that are included within the definition of qualifying
liquid resources to committed funding arrangements is not appropriate in the case of the
U.S. securities markets and expanding the concept of qualifying liquid resources to
include other highly reliable funding arrangements is necessary and appropriate to ensure
the proper functioning of covered clearing agencies under the Exchange Act. For similar
reasons, the Commission preliminarily believes it is appropriate to include in the
definition of qualifying liquid resources assets that a central bank would permit a covered
clearing agency to use as collateral, to the extent such covered clearing agency has access
to routine credit at such central bank.
•

In proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13), the Commission would explicitly require a covered
clearing agency’s policies and procedures to be reasonably designed to ensure that the
covered clearing agency has the authority and operational capacity to contain losses and
liquidity demands in a timely manner and to continue to meet its obligations by, among
other things, addressing the allocation of credit losses the covered clearing agency may
face. Rules proposed by the Board and adopted by the CFTC do not include a
comparable provision to address the allocation of credit losses. 661 The Commission
preliminarily believes this requirement is appropriate to help ensure that credit losses a

661

See 17 CFR 39.16; proposed Reg. HH, supra note 53, at 3680–81, 3692 (the Board
proposing Sec. 234.3(a)(13)); see also DCO Principles Release, supra note 53, at 69395–97,
69442 (CFTC adopting Sec. 39.16).

314

covered clearing agency may reasonably be expected to experience are capable of
allocation through pre-established practices of the covered clearing agency. The
proposed rule would also facilitate the orderly handling of member defaults and provide
certainty and transparency by enabling members to understand their obligations to the
covered clearing agency in extreme circumstances ex ante.
•

In proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18), the Commission would explicitly require a covered
clearing agency’s policies and procedures to be reasonably designed to require
monitoring of compliance with access and participation requirements. Rules proposed by
the Board and adopted by the CFTC do not include a comparable provision. The
Commission preliminarily believes this requirement is consistent with Exchange Act
provisions requiring registered clearing agencies to have rules designed to not permit
unfair discrimination in the admission of participants because it helps ensure that a
covered clearing agency complies with its own membership requirements.

•

In proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19), the Commission would explicitly require a covered
clearing agency’s policies and procedures to be reasonably designed to require regular
review of its tiered participation arrangements. Rules proposed by the Board and adopted
by the CFTC do not include a comparable provision. The Commission preliminarily
believes this requirement is consistent with Exchange Act provisions requiring registered
clearing agencies to have rules designed to not permit unfair discrimination in the
admission of participants because it helps ensure that a covered clearing agency
periodically reconsiders whether in practice its membership requirements may result in
either an inappropriately broad or narrow membership.

315

The following discussion provides examples of proposed rule provisions that are
representative of the differences between the Commission’s proposal and the Board’s proposal
and the CFTC’s final rules, where the Commission is proposing requirements that are more
general than those proposed by the Board or adopted by the CFTC:
•

In proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2), the Commission would not require a covered clearing
agency’s policies and procedures to be reasonably designed to include requirements for
disclosure of board decisions, review of the performance of the board of directors and
individual directors, documentation and disclosure of governance arrangements,
procedures for managing conflicts of interests involving board members, and oversight of
the risk function. Rules adopted by the CFTC include such requirements. 662 The
Commission preliminarily believes that such requirements would in part be duplicative of
existing Exchange Act requirements applicable to covered clearing agencies grounded in
the broad definition of the term “rules of a clearing agency” in Section 3(a)(27) of the
Exchange Act, 663 and otherwise have been contemplated by the Commission’s proposed
Regulation MC. 664 Accordingly any further requirements in this respect would be
considered by the Commission separately.

•

In proposing Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4) and (e)(7), the Commission would not require a
covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures for stress testing its financial resources

662

See DCO Int’l Standards Release, supra note 53, at 72480–81, 72515 (CFTC adopting
Sec. 39.30).
663

See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(27).

See supra note 111 (discussing rules for governance arrangements proposed by the
Commission to, among other things, mitigate conflicts of interest at registered clearing agencies
that provide CCP services for security-based swaps).

316

and liquid resources, respectively, to cover specific stress scenarios, as rules adopted by
the CFTC do. 665 The Commission preliminarily believes it is appropriate to provide
discretion to the covered clearing agencies to identify the stress scenarios most
appropriate for their needs given their status as SROs subject to the Commission’s
oversight, and to rely upon other tools available to the Commission through its
supervisory and examination programs to ensure the responsibilities of covered clearing
agencies in this regard are fulfilled.
•

In proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5), the Commission would not specifically require, as the
CFTC does in its rules, a covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to be
reasonably designed to (i) establish prudent valuation practices and develop haircuts that
are tested regularly and take into account stressed market conditions (including to reduce
the need for procyclical adjustments); (ii) avoid concentrated holdings of certain assets
where it could significantly impair the ability to liquidate such assets quickly without
significant adverse price effects; and (iii) use a collateral management system that is well
designed and operationally flexible, such that it, among other things, accommodates
changes in the ongoing monitoring and management of collateral; and (iv) allow for the
timely valuation of collateral and execution of any collateral or margin calls. 666 While
the Commission preliminarily agrees that these requirements may facilitate prudent
practices, the Commission preliminarily observes that consideration of these practices
would fall within the general responsibilities of a covered clearing agency and its board

665

See DCO Int’l Standards Release, supra note 53, at 72492–93, 72520 (CFTC adopting
Sec. 39.36(c)).

adopting Secs. 39.11 and 39.13).

317

of directors. The Commission therefore preliminarily believes that proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(5) strikes the appropriate balance in establishing policies and procedures
requirements with respect to collateral management.
•

In proposing Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6), the Commission also would not require a covered
clearing agency’s policies and procedures to be reasonably designed to determine the
appropriate historic time period for the margin methodology based on the characteristics
of each product, spread, account, or portfolio or to require specifying minimum
liquidation periods for different types of derivatives. Rules adopted by the CFTC include
such requirements. 667 While the Commission preliminarily agrees that these
requirements may facilitate prudent practices, the Commission preliminarily observes
that consideration of these practices would fall within the general responsibilities of a
covered clearing agency and its board of directors. The Commission therefore
preliminarily believes that proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) strikes the appropriate balance
in establishing policies and procedures requirements with respect to risk management.
These differences between the Commission’s proposal and the Board’s proposed rules

and the CFTC’s final rules are provided here as examples of the differences observed between
the respective rule sets and do not constitute an exhaustive list. In preliminarily formulating the
specific requirements of the proposed rules in furtherance of Section 17A of the Exchange Act,
the Commission was guided by its experience in supervising registered clearing agencies,
including through the SRO rule filing process under Section 19(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule
19b-4, periodic inspections and examinations, and other monitoring of the activities of registered
667

See 17 CFR 39.13(g)(2); see also DCO Principles Release, supra note 53, at 69364–79,
69438 (CFTC adopting Sec. 39.13(g)(2)).

318

clearing agencies. 668 The Commission also took into account the particular circumstances of the
U.S. securities markets, including but not limited to business models of and current practices at
covered clearing agencies, characteristics of the products cleared, the nature of the covered
clearing agencies’ participant base, and other factors. The Commission preliminarily believes
the differences between its proposal and the Board’s proposed rules and the CFTC’s final rules
are appropriate for the reasons noted above. The Commission further preliminarily notes that
some of the differences between the Commission’s proposal and the CFTC’s final rules is
attributable to differences between the scope of the Commission’s and the CFTC’s regulatory
authority. 669
Further, CPSS-IOSCO members are also in various stages of implementing the standards
set forth in the PFMI Report into their own regulatory regimes, and the Commission
preliminarily believes that proposing a set of requirements generally consistent with the relevant
international standards would result in diminished likelihood that participants in cleared markets
would restructure and operate in less-regulated markets. 670 Additionally, international standards
such as the Basel III framework could create complications for U.S. clearing agencies not subject
to regulations based on the standards set in the PFMI Report as a result of the Basel III
framework’s treatment of QCCPs. In particular, if U.S. clearing agencies do not obtain QCCP
668

See supra Part I.A and note 96 (describing the Commission’s framework for regulation of
SROs and the SRO rule filing process).
669

For example, the Commission is proposing Rules 17Ad-22(e)(11) and (12) to establish
requirements for covered clearing agencies that provide CSD services and for exchange-of-value
settlement systems. See supra Parts II.B.8–9 and infra Part VII (discussing the proposed rules
and providing rule text, respectively). The CFTC has not proposed comparable rules because
CSDs and securities settlement systems do not fall within the scope of its regulatory authority.

status from foreign banking regulators who have adopted rules conforming to the Basel III
framework because, for instance, the regulatory framework is not consistent with the standards
set forth in the PFMI Report, foreign bank members of U.S. clearing agencies may have
incentives to move their clearing business to clearing agencies in jurisdictions where they might
obtain lower capital requirements under the Basel III framework. 671
Failure to maintain consistency with other regulators may disrupt cleared markets in a
number of ways. Significant differences across regulatory regimes may encourage participants
to restructure their operations in order to avoid a particular regulatory regime. 672 Such
differences may reduce the liquidity of cleared products in certain markets if they result in an
undersupply of clearing services. Further, inconsistency in regulation across jurisdictions may
increase the likelihood that restructuring by market participants in response such inconsistency
results in concentrating clearing activity in regimes with a weaker commitment to policies and
procedures for sound risk management.
In the case of clearing agency standards, there are additional motivations for consistency
with other regulatory requirements. The Commission preliminarily believes that such
consistency would prevent the application of inconsistent regulatory burdens and thereby reduce
the likelihood that participants in cleared markets would restructure and operate in less-regulated

markets. Additionally, such consistency would allow foreign bank clearing members and foreign
bank customers of clearing members of covered clearing agencies to be subject to lower capital
requirements under the Basel III framework. 673
d. Concentration
The economic effects associated with the proposed rules may also be partially determined
by the economic characteristics of clearing agencies. Generally, the economic characteristics of
FMIs, including clearing agencies, include specialization, economies of scale, barriers to entry,
and a limited number of competitors. 674 Such characteristics, coupled with the particulars of an
FMI’s legal mandate, could result in market power, leading to lower levels of service, higher
prices, and under-investment in risk management systems. 675
The centralization of clearing activities in a relatively small number of clearing agencies
somewhat insulated from market forces may result in a reduction in their incentives to innovate
and to invest in the development of appropriate risk management practices on an ongoing basis,
particularly when combined with the cost reduction pressures noted above in Part IV.A. 676
However, the Commission notes that the inverse may not necessarily hold. In other words,
additional competition in the market for clearing services may not necessarily result in improved
risk management. For instance, aggressive price-cutting in a “race to the bottom” may result in
clearing agencies accepting lower-quality collateral, requiring lower margin and default fund

contributions, lowering access requirements, or holding lower reserves, potentially undermining
their risk management efforts. 677
Market power may raise particular issues with respect to the allocation of benefits and
costs flowing from these proposed rules and precipitate changes in the structure of the financial
networks that are served by covered clearing agencies. For example, as a result of limited
competition, 678 existing covered clearing agencies may easily pass the incremental costs
associated with enhanced standards on to their members, who may share these costs with their
customers, potentially resulting in increased transaction costs in cleared securities.
If incremental increases in costs lead clearing agencies to charge higher prices for their
services, then certain clearing members may choose to terminate membership and cease to clear
transactions for their customers. Should this occur the result may be further concentration

among clearing members, where each remaining member clears a higher volume of transactions.
In this case, clearing agencies and the financial markets they serve would be more exposed to
these larger clearing members. These remaining clearing members may, however, each
internalize more of the costs their activity in cleared markets imposes on the financial system.
The increased importance of a small set of clearing members, in turn, may result in firms
not previously systemically important increasing in systemic importance. This is particularly
true for clearing members that participate in multiple markets, both cleared and not cleared. 679
However, adequate regulation of capital levels and margin amounts at surviving clearing
members could mean that, though shocks to these members may be larger, the propagation of
shocks may be limited to a smaller set of entities and their equity holders.
e. Qualifying CCP Status and Externalities on Clearing Members
An effect of the proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 is that covered clearing agencies
required to comply with the proposed rules may be more likely to qualify as QCCPs in non-U.S.
jurisdictions that have adopted the Basel III framework’s QCCP definition. Under the Basel III
framework, a QCCP is defined as an entity operating as a CCP that is prudentially supervised in
a jurisdiction where the relevant regulator has established, and publicly indicated that it applies
to the CCP on an ongoing basis, domestic rules and regulations that are consistent with the
standards set forth in the PFMI Report. 680 Because the proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22
are intended to be in line with the standards set forth in the PFMI Report, the Commission
preliminarily believes that foreign bank clearing members of certain covered clearing agencies
679

See, e.g., Roe, supra note 172 (arguing that counterparty risk concentrated within CCPs
may be transferred to the broader financial system through links between clearing members and
their clients).
680

See supra note 48 (discussing the Basel III capital requirements).

323

and foreign banks clearing indirectly through clearing members of covered clearing agencies
may benefit from covered clearing agencies obtaining QCCP status. In particular, bank clearing
members and bank indirect participants of covered clearing agencies that could attain QCCP
status would face lower capital requirements with respect to cleared derivatives and repurchase
agreement transactions because, under the Basel III framework, capital requirements for bank
exposures to QCCPs are lower than capital requirements for bank exposures to non-qualifying
CCPs for these products. Although the Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
have already adopted rules implementing the Basel III capital requirements that would identify
all covered clearing agencies (with the exception of ICEEU) as QCCPs for the purposes of
applying risk weights to assets at U.S. banks, 681 the proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 may
result in non-U.S. bank clearing members experiencing lower capital requirements related to
exposures against covered clearing agencies relative to a baseline scenario in which foreign
banking regulators do not determine that a covered clearing agency is a QCCP. 682
The Basel III framework affects capital requirements for bank exposures to central
counterparties in two important ways. The first relates to trade exposures, defined under the
Basel III capital requirements as the current and potential future exposure of a clearing member
or indirect participant in a CCP arising from OTC derivatives, exchange-traded derivatives
transactions, and securities financing transactions. If these exposures are held against a QCCP,
they will be assigned a risk weight of 2%. In contrast, exposures against non-qualifying CCPs
do not receive lower capital requirements relative to bilateral exposures and are assigned risk
681

See infra Part IV.C.1.e.

682

The Commission notes that benefits to banks that may arise as a result of the proposed
rules may be contingent upon regulators in other jurisdictions taking action to recognize the
QCCP status of covered clearing agencies.

324

weights between 20% and 100%, depending on counterparty credit risk. Second, the Basel III
capital requirements impose a cap on risk weights applied to default fund contributions, limiting
risk-weighted assets (subject to a 1250% risk weight) to a cap of 20% of a clearing member’s
trade exposures against a QCCP. This is in contrast to treatment of exposures against nonqualifying CCPs, which are uncapped and subject to a 1250% risk weight. Because QCCP status
generally impacts capital treatment, any benefits of attaining QCCP status will likely accrue, at
least in part, to foreign clearing members or foreign indirect participants subject to the Basel III
capital requirements. 683 As a result of lower risk weights applied to exposures and a cap on
capital requirements against default fund obligations, clearing members of QCCPs subject to
Basel III capital requirements may experience an improved capital position relative to bank
members of non-QCCPs. This may lower the costs of debt capital for bank members of
QCCPs.684
Non-U.S. banks that are constrained by Basel III tier one capital requirements would face
a shock to risk-weighted assets once capital rules come into force. 685 The size of the shock
depends on regulators’ determinations with regard to QCCP status. Regardless of the size of the
shock and in order to come into compliance with capital rules, however, affected banks will have
683

For a discussion of the effects of QCCP status on competition between bank and nonbank clearing members, see Part IV.C.2.a.

684

See supra note 593 (noting that the Commission currently expects the lower capital
treatment under the Basel III framework to affect registered clearing agencies FICC, ICEEU, and
OCC, each of which would meet the definition of a “covered clearing agency” under the
proposed rules).
685

As discussed above, the Board and Office of Comptroller of the Currency have adopted
rules implementing capital requirements under Basel III that make capital treatment for
exposures to CCPs independent of the proposed rules for U.S. banks regulated by these two
agencies, and therefore the Commission preliminarily believes no benefits would accrue to U.S.
bank clearing members of FICC and OCC.

325

to raise capital or reduce leverage. In the absence of perfect markets, these banks may incur
ongoing costs as a result.
In quantifying the benefits of achieving QCCP status, the Commission based its estimate
on publicly available information with regard to OCC. 686 To estimate the upper bound for the
potential benefits accruing to bank clearing members at OCC as a result of QCCP status, the
Commission identified a sample of 20 bank clearing members at OCC and, for each bank,
collected information about total assets, risk weighted assets, net income and tier one capital
ratio at the holding company level for 2012. 687 The Commission then allocated trade exposures
and default fund exposures across the sample of bank clearing members based on the level of
risk-weighted assets. 688 The Commission measured the impact on risk-weighted assets for non686

Under the Basel III framework ICCEU and FICC’s repurchase agreement segment would
also be eligible for QCCP status. However, FICC does not report counterparties to repo
agreements, and ICEEU does not separately report exposures related to security-based swap
clearing, so we are currently unable to quantify potential benefits related to QCCP status for
these entities.
687

The Commission used the set of entities it identified as banks on OCC’s member list,
available at http://www.optionsclearing.com/membership/member-information/. For U.S. bank
holding companies, 2012 total assets, risk weighted assets, net income, and tier 1 capital ratios
were collected from Y-9C reports available at the National Information Center,
http://www.ffiec.gov/nicpubweb/nicweb/nichome.aspx. For non-U.S. bank holding companies,
Commission staff obtained corresponding data from financial statements and supplementary
financial materials posted to bank websites. Where necessary, values were converted back to
U.S. dollars at appropriate exchange rates obtained from Thomson Reuters Datastream and the
Federal Reserve, http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h10/hist/.
688

For example, one bank in the sample, with 6.25% of total risk-weighted assets, was
assigned 6.25% of the total trade and default fund exposures while another bank in the sample,
with 3.43% of total risk weighted assets, was assigned 3.43% of these exposures. Because trade
exposures of OCC members against OCC are nonpublic, the Commission used the balance of
OCC margin deposits and deposits in lieu of margin held at OCC, $57.48 billion, as a proxy for
trade exposures. OCC’s 2012 clearing fund deposits were valued at $2.66 billion. See OCC,
2012 Annual Report, available at
http://www.optionsclearing.com/components/docs/about/annualreports/occ_2012_annual_report.pdf.
326

U.S. bank clearing members under two different capital treatment regimes. The first regime is in
the absence of QCCP status, assuming a 100% risk weight applied to trade exposures and 1250%
risk weight applied to default fund exposures for non-U.S. members. In the second regime, OCC
obtains QCCP status, and banks are allowed to apply a 2% risk weight applied to trade exposures
and a 1250% risk weight to default fund exposures up to a total exposure cap of 20% of trade
exposures. 689 If OCC is determined to be a QCCP, then the increase in risk weighted assets will
be smaller in magnitude, implying a smaller adjustment at lower cost. The Commission
preliminarily estimates that benefits associated with OCC obtaining QCCP status stemming from
lower capital requirements against trade exposures to QCCPs as a result of the proposed rules to
have an upper bound of $600 million per year, or approximately 0.60% of the total 2012 net
income reported by bank clearing members at OCC.
The Commission’s analysis is limited in several respects and relies on several
assumptions. First, a limitation of our proxy for trade exposures and our use of OCC’s clearing
fund is that the account balances include deposits by bank clearing members, who would
experience lower capital requirements under the Basel III framework, and non-bank clearing
members who would not. The Commission preliminarily assumes, for the purposes of
establishing an upper bound for the benefits to market participants that are associated with QCCP
status for OCC under the proposed rules, that the balance of both OCC’s margin account and
OCC’s default fund are attributable only to bank clearing members. Additionally, we assume an
689

The Basel III framework allows banks to compute default fund exposures in two ways.
Method 1 involves computing capital requirements for each member proportional to its share of
an aggregate capital requirement for all clearing members in a scenario where to average clearing
members default. The Commission currently lacks data necessary to compute default fund
exposures under this approach, instead we use Method 2, which caps overall exposure to a
QCCP at 20% of trade exposures. See Basel III framework, supra note 48, Annex 4, paras. 121–
25 (outlining two methods for computing default fund exposures).

327

extreme case where, in the absence of QCCP status, trade exposures against a CCP would be
assigned a 100% risk weight, causing the largest possible shock to risk-weighted assets for
affected banks.
Concluding that lower capital requirements on trade exposures to OCC would produce
effects in the real economy also requires that certain conditions exist. Agency problems, taxes, or
other capital market imperfections could result in banks targeting a particular capital structure.
Further, capital constraints on bank clearing members subject to the Basel III framework should
bind so that higher capital requirements on bank clearing members subject to the Basel III
framework in the absence of QCCP status would cause these banks to exceed capital constraints
if they chose to redistribute capital to shareholders or invest capital in projects with returns that
exceed their cost of capital. Using publically available data, however, it is not currently possible
to determine whether capital constraints will bind for bank clearing members when rules
applying Basel III capital requirements come into force, so to estimate an upper bound for the
effects of QCCP status on bank clearing members we assume that tier one capital constraints for
all bank clearing members of OCC would bind in an environment with zero weight placed on
bank exposures to CCPs.690
For the purposes of quantifying potential benefits from QCCP status, the Commission has
also assumed that banks choose to adjust to new capital requirements by deleveraging. In
690

The Commission notes that, at present, no bank in its sample of bank clearing members
of OCC is bound by capital requirements under the Basel III framework. Bank holding company
risk-weighted assets, adjusted total assets, and capital ratio data have been taken from
http://www2.fdic.gov/SDI/. The Commission used data from 2009–2012 for its sample of bank
clearing members and assumed no bank-specific countercyclical capital buffers for these banks.
This suggests a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 9.6%, exceeding the Basel III minimum by 1.1%.
The same analysis suggests a minimum total capital ratio of 12.3%, exceeding the Basel III
minimum by 1.8%.

328

particular, the Commission assumed that banks would respond by reducing risk-weighted assets
equally across all risk classes until they reach the minimum tier one capital ratio under the Basel
framework of 8.5%. We measure the ongoing costs to each non-U.S. bank by multiplying the
implied change in total assets by each bank’s return on assets, estimated using up to 12 years of
annual financial statement data. 691
The Basel III capital requirements for exposures to CCPs yield additional benefits for
QCCPs that the Commission is currently unable to quantify due to lack of data concerning client
clearing arrangements by banks. For client exposures to clearing members, the Basel III capital
requirements allow participants to reflect the shorter close-out period of cleared transactions in
their capitalized exposures. The Basel III framework’s treatment of exposures to CCPs also
applies to client exposures to CCPs through clearing members. This may increase the likelihood
that bank clients of bank clearing members that are subject to the Basel III capital requirements
share some of the benefits of QCCP status.
Furthermore, the fact that the Basel III capital requirements apply to bank clearing
members may have important implications for competition and concentration. While the
proposed rules may extend lower capital requirements against exposures to CCPs to non-U.S.
bank clearing members of covered clearing agencies, 692 the benefits of QCCP status will still be
limited to bank clearing members. However, the costs associated with compliance with the
proposed rules may be borne by all clearing members, regardless of whether or not they are
691

This data has been taken from Compustat. Due to data limitations, for certain banks a
shorter window was used for this calculation. The minimum sample window was nine years.

and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency would treat covered clearing agencies as
QCCPs for the purposes of calculating regulatory capital ratios).

supervised as banks. A potential consequence of this allocation of costs and benefits may be
“crowding out” of members of QCCPs that are not banks and will not experience benefits with
respect to the Basel III framework. This may result in an unintended consequence of increased
concentration of clearing activity among bank clearing members. As noted in Part IV.C.1.d, this
increased concentration could mean that each remaining clearing member becomes more
important from the standpoint of systemic risk transmission.
In addition to benefits for bank clearing members, certain benefits resulting from QCCP
status may also accrue to covered clearing agencies. If banks value lower capital requirements
attributable to QCCP status, bank clearing members may prefer membership at QCCPs to
membership at CCPs that are not QCCPs. A flight of clearing members from covered clearing
agencies in the absence of QCCP status would result in default-related losses being mutualized
across a narrower member base. If the flight from covered clearing agencies results in lower
transactional volume at these clearing agencies, then economies of scale may be lost, resulting in
higher clearing fees and higher transaction costs in cleared products.
2. Effect on Competition, Efficiency, and Capital Formation
The proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and proposed Rule 17Ab2-2 have the
potential to affect competition, efficiency, and capital formation. As with the rest of the benefits
and costs associated with the proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22, the Commission
preliminarily believes that several of the effects described below only occur to the extent that
covered clearing agencies do not already have operations and governance mechanisms that
conform to the requirements in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e). Additionally, the Commission
preliminarily believes that consistency with international regulatory frameworks, as embodied by
the standards set forth in the PFMI Report, which may promote the integrity of cleared markets,
could have substantial effects on competition, efficiency, and capital formation.
330

a. Competition
Two important characteristics of the market for clearance and settlement services are high
fixed costs and economies of scale. Large investments in risk management and information
technology infrastructure costs, such as financial data database and network maintenance
expenses, are components of high fixed costs for clearing agencies. Consequently, the clearance
and settlement industry exhibits economies of scale in that the average total cost per transaction,
which includes fixed costs, diminishes with the increase in transaction volume as high fixed
costs are spread over a larger number of transactions.
Furthermore, high fixed costs translate into barriers to entry that preclude competition.
Lower competition is an important source of market power for clearing agencies. As a result,
clearing agencies possess the ability to exert market power and influence the fees charged for
clearance and settlement services in the markets they serve. 693 Any costs resulting from the
proposed amendments may have the effect of raising already high barriers to entry. As the
potential entry of new clearing agencies becomes more remote, existing clearing agencies may
be able to reduce service quality, restrict the supply of services, or increase fees above marginal
cost in an effort to earn economic rents from participants in cleared markets. 694
Even if they could not take advantage of a marginal increase in market power, clearing
agencies may use their market power to pass any increases in costs that flow from the proposed
amendments to their members. This may be especially true in the cases of member-owned
clearing agencies, such as DTC, FICC, NSCC, and OCC, where members lack the opportunity to
pass costs through to outside equity holders. Allowing clearing members to serve on the board

331

of directors of a covered clearing agency may align a covered clearing agency’s incentives with
its membership. Certain complications may also arise, however, when clearing members sit on
boards of covered clearing agencies as members of the board and may choose to allocate the
costs of enhanced risk management inefficiently across potential competitors, in an effort to
reduce their own share of these costs.
Members who are forced to internalize the costs of additional requirements under the
proposed rules may seek to terminate their membership. Additionally, prospective clearing
members may find it difficult to join clearing agencies, given the additional costs they must
internalize. 695 Remaining clearing members may gain market power as a result, enabling them to
extract economic rents from their customers. Rent extraction could take the form of higher
transaction costs in cleared markets, thereby reducing efficiency, as discussed below.
The Commission also acknowledges that proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) may affect
competition among firms that choose to become clearing members, and those who provide
clearing services indirectly, through a clearing member. Monitoring and managing the risks
associated with indirect participation in clearing may be costly. If monitoring and managing the
risks associated with indirect participation in clearing proves costly for clearing agencies and if
clearing agencies are able to pass the additional costs related to monitoring and managing risks
to clearing members, it may cause marginal clearing members unable to absorb these additional
costs to exit. While these exits may be socially efficient, since they reflect the internalization of
costs otherwise imposed upon other participants in cleared markets through increased probability
of clearing agency default, they may nevertheless result in lower competition among clearing
695

See supra Part IV.C.1.d (discussing concentration both in the market for clearing services
and among clearing members).

332

members for market share, potentially providing additional market power to the clearing
members that remain.
The Commission preliminarily believes, however, that management of risks from indirect
participation is important in mitigating the risks that clearing agencies pose to financial stability.
The tiered participation risk exposures, including credit, liquidity, and operational risks inherent
in indirect participation arrangements, may present risks to clearing agencies, their members, and
to the broader financial markets. For instance, if the size of an indirect participant’s positions is
large relative to a clearing member’s capacity to absorb risks, this may increase the clearing
member’s default risk. Consequently, a clearing agency with indirect participation arrangements
may be exposed to the credit risk of an indirect participant through its clearing members.
Similarly, a margin call on, or a default by, an indirect participant could constrain liquidity of its
associated clearing members, making it more difficult for these members to manage their
positions at the clearing agency.
The consistency across regulatory frameworks contemplated by the proposed rules may
also affect competition. Financial markets in cleared products are global, encompassing many
countries and regulatory jurisdictions. Consistency with international regulatory frameworks may
facilitate entry of clearing agencies into new markets. By contrast, conflicting or duplicative
regulation across jurisdictions, or even within jurisdictions, may cause competitive friction that
inhibits entry and helps clearing agencies behave like local monopolists. Consistency in
regulation can facilitate competition among clearing agencies so long as regulation is not so
costly as to discourage participation in any market. Additionally, the Commission preliminarily
believes that proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) may facilitate competition among clearing agencies

333

across jurisdictions by requiring public disclosures that enable market participants to compare
clearing agencies more easily.
The consistency across regulatory requirements contemplated by the proposed rules may
affect competition among banks in particular. Clearing derivative and repurchase agreement
transactions through QCCPs will result in lower capital requirements for banks under the Basel
III capital requirements. Therefore, consistency with the standards set forth in the PFMI Report
may allow banks that clear these products through covered clearing agencies to compete on equal
terms with banks that clear through other clearing agencies accorded QCCP status. This effect
potentially countervails higher barriers to entry that enhanced risk management standards may
impose on clearing members by lowering the marginal cost of clearing these transactions.
Furthermore, covered clearing agencies potentially compete with one another for volume from
clearing members. Since clearing members receive better treatment for exposures against
QCCPs, clearing members will find it less costly to deal with QCCPs. Failure to establish
requirements consistent with the standards set forth in the PFMI Report may place U.S. covered
clearing agencies at a competitive disadvantage globally.
The ability of covered clearing agencies to obtain QCCP status may also affect
competition among clearing agencies. Under the Basel III framework, QCCP status would have
practical relevance only for covered clearing agencies providing CCP services for derivatives,
security-based swaps, and securities financing transactions. To the extent that the proposed rules
increase the likelihood that banking regulators that have implemented the Basel III framework in
their jurisdiction recognize covered clearing agencies as QCCPs, banks that clear at covered
clearing agencies will experience lower capital requirements. Since clearing agencies may
compete for volume from clearing members that are also banks, the proposed rules may remove

334

a competitive friction between covered clearing agencies and other clearing agencies that enjoy
recognition as QCCPs by banking regulators. As a corollary, the proposed rules could
potentially disadvantage any registered clearing agencies that are not covered clearing
agencies. 696 The Commission also preliminarily notes that the ability of registered clearing
agencies to voluntarily apply for covered clearing agency status under proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(a)
may potentially allow entrants to achieve QCCP status if the Commission determines they
should receive covered clearing agency status and they otherwise meet the requirements of the
Basel III framework.
Further competitive effects may flow from the proposal as a result of the determinations
under proposed Rule 17Ab2-2 for clearing agencies engaged in activities with a more complex
risk profile and clearing agencies that are systemically important in multiple jurisdictions. These
entities will be responsible for maintaining additional financial resources sufficient to cover the
default of the two participant families that would potentially cause the largest aggregate credit
exposures in extreme but plausible market conditions as well as undertake an annual feasibility
analysis for extending liquidity risk management from “cover one” to “cover two.” These
clearing agencies will have to collect these resources from participants, either through higher
margin requirements or guaranty fund contributions, or indirectly through third-party borrowing
arrangements secured by member resources. Regardless of how clearing agencies obtain these
additional resources, the requirement to do so potentially raises the costs to use services provided
by covered clearing agencies which could, at the margin, shift transactional volume to clearing
696

See supra note 593 (noting that the Commission currently expects the lower capital
treatment under the Basel III framework to affect registered clearing agencies FICC, ICEEU, and
OCC, each of which would meet the definition of a “covered clearing agency” under the
proposed rules).

335

agencies that fall outside the scope determined by proposed Rule 17Ab2-2, where competing
clearing agencies exist, or opt out of clearing altogether.
b. Efficiency
The proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 may affect efficiency in a number of ways,
though as discussed previously, most of these effects will only flow to the extent that covered
clearing agencies do not already comply with the proposed amendments. First, because the
proposed amendments result in general consistency with the standards set forth in the PFMI
Report and requirements proposed by the Board and adopted by the CFTC, consistency likely
fosters efficiency by reducing the risk that covered clearing agencies will be faced with
conflicting or duplicative regulation when clearing financial products across multiple regulatory
jurisdictions.
Consistency across regulatory regimes in multiple markets may also result in efficiency
improvements. Fully integrated markets would allow clearing agencies to more easily exploit
economies of scale because clearing agencies tend to have low marginal costs and, thus, could
provide clearance and settlement services over a larger volume of transactions at a lower average
cost. Differences in regulation, on the other hand, may result in market fragmentation, allowing
clearing agencies to operate as local monopolists. The resulting potential for segmentation of
clearing and settlement businesses along jurisdictional lines may lead to overinvestment in the
provision of clearing services and reductions in efficiency as clearing agencies open and operate
solely within jurisdictional boundaries. If market segmentation precludes covered clearing
agencies from clearing transactions for customers located in another jurisdiction with a market
too small to support a local clearing agency, fragmentation may result in under-provisioning of
clearing and settlement services in these areas, in turn reducing the efficiency with which market
participants share risk.
336

The proposed amendments may also affect efficiency directly if they mitigate covered
clearing agencies’ incentives to underinvest in risk management and recovery and wind-down
procedures. CCP default and liquidation is likely a costly event, so to the extent that the proposed
rules mitigate the risk of CCP default and prescribe rules for orderly recovery and wind-down,
they will produce efficiency benefits. Another direct effect on efficiency may come if registered
clearing agencies attempt to restructure their operations in ways that would allow them to fall
outside of the scope of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e).
Finally, price efficiency and the efficiency of risk sharing among market participants may
be affected by the proposed amendments. On one hand, the cost of a transaction includes costs
related to counterparty default that are typically unrelated to fundamental asset payoffs.
Academic research using credit default swap transaction data has revealed a statistically
significant, though economically small, relationship between the credit risk of a counterparty and
the spreads implicit in transaction prices. 697 Enhanced risk management by clearing agencies
may reduce this component of transaction costs. By reducing deviations of prices from
fundamental value, the proposed amendments may increase price efficiency. If lower transaction
costs or reduced ambiguity facilitates participation in cleared markets by investors who would

697

See e.g., Navneet Arora, Priyank Gandhi & Francis Longstaff, Counterparty Credit Risk
and the Credit Default Swap Market, 103 J. Fin. Econ. 280 (2012). Using transaction prices and
quotes by 14 different CDS dealers, the authors identified how dealers’ credit risk affects
transaction prices. They observed a relationship between spreads and credit risk implying that a
645-basis-point increase in a dealer’s credit spread would produce a one-basis-point increase in
transaction prices. They explain the magnitude of this relationship by noting that their sample
included transactions that were mostly collateralized, which would diminish the sensitivity of
transaction prices to counterparty credit risk.

337

benefit from opportunities for risk-sharing in these markets, 698 then this transmission channel
may result in more efficient allocation of risk. On the other hand, the proposed amendments may
have adverse implications for price efficiency in cleared markets if they drive up transaction
costs as higher costs of risk management enter asset prices. An increase in transaction costs
could cause certain market participants to avoid trading altogether, reducing liquidity in cleared
products and opportunities for risk sharing among investors in these markets.
c. Capital Formation
The implications for capital formation that flow from these proposed rules stem mainly
from incremental costs that result from compliance with more specific standards and benefits in
the form of more efficient risk sharing.
In cases where current practice falls short of the proposed amendments, covered clearing
agencies may have to invest in infrastructure or make other expenditures to come into
compliance, which may divert capital from other uses. In line with our previous discussion of
cost allocation in the market for clearing services, these resources may come from clearing
members and their customers. 699
At the same time, the Commission preliminarily believes that the standards contemplated
under the proposed rules may foster capital formation. As mentioned earlier, clearing agencies
that are less prone to failure may help reduce transaction costs in the markets they clear. 700
698

If investors who might benefit from risk-sharing in cleared markets are ambiguity-averse,
then regulation that addresses payoffs in times of financial strain may induce their participation.
See supra note 655 and accompanying text.

699

See supra Part IV.C.1 (discussing the economic effects of the proposed rules on the
market for clearing services generally).
700

See supra Part IV.C.1.a (discussing the general economic effects of the proposed rules on
systemic risk).
338

Conceptually, the component of transaction costs that reflects counterparty credit risk insures
one counterparty against the default of another. 701 Reductions in counterparty default risk allow
the corresponding portion of transaction costs to be allocated to more productive uses by market
participants who otherwise would bear these costs.
If, on balance, the proposed amendments cause transaction costs to decrease in cleared
markets, then the expected value of trade may increase. Counterparties that are better able to
diversify risk through participation in cleared markets may be more willing to invest in the real
economy rather than choosing to engage in precautionary savings.
3. Effect of Proposed Amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and Proposed Rule
17Ab2-2
The discussion below outlines the costs and benefits preliminarily considered by the
Commission as they relate to the rules being proposed today. These specific costs and benefits
are in addition to the more general costs and benefits anticipated under the Commission’s
proposal discussed in Part IV.C.1 and include, in particular, the costs and benefits stemming
from the availability of QCCP status under the Basel III capital requirements. Many of the costs
and benefits discussed below are difficult to quantify. This is particularly true where clearing
agency practices are anticipated to evolve and adapt to changes in technology and other market
developments. The difficulty in quantifying costs and benefits of the proposed rules is further
exacerbated by the fact that in some cases the Commission lacks information regarding the
specific practices of clearing agencies that could assist in quantifying certain costs. For example,
as noted in Part IV.C.3.a.iv(4), without detailed information about the composition of illiquid
assets held by clearing agencies and their members, the Commission cannot provide reasonable
701

See supra note 697.

339

estimates of costs associated with satisfying substantive requirements under proposed Rules
17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) and (ii). Another example, discussed in Part IV.C.3.a.iv(5), is testing and
validation of financial risk models, where the Commission is only able to estimate that costs will
fall within a range. In this case, the costs associated with substantive requirements under the
proposed rules may depend on the types of risk models employed by clearing agencies, which
are, in turn, dictated by the markets they serve. As a result, much of the discussion is qualitative
in nature, though where possible, the costs and benefits have been quantified.
a. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)
The Commission recognizes that the scope of the proposed rules is an important
determinant of their economic effect. Having considered the anticipated costs associated with
the proposed rules, the Commission preliminarily believes that it is appropriate to limit the
application of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) to covered clearing agencies, as these are the registered
clearing agencies for which the benefits of the proposed rules are the greatest. In particular, as
discussed below, the Commission preliminarily believes that an important benefit resulting from
the enhanced risk management requirements in the proposed rules is a reduction in the risk of a
failure of a covered clearing agency. For example, for designated clearing agencies these
benefits may be significant due to their size, exposure to, and interconnectedness with market
participants, and the effect their failure may have on markets, market participants, and the
broader financial system. For complex risk profile clearing agencies, significant benefits may
flow as a result of their higher baseline default risk.
As an alternative, the Commission could have proposed to extend the scope of proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e) to cover all registered clearing agencies. The Commission preliminarily
acknowledges, however, that costs of compliance with the proposed rules may represent barriers
to entry for clearing agencies. By continuing to apply Rule 17Ad-22(d) to registered clearing
340

agencies that are not covered clearing agencies, the Commission preliminary believes that the
proposed scope Rule 17Ad-22(e) appropriately preserves the potential for innovation in the
establishment and operation of registered clearing agencies. 702 Moreover, including CME and
ICE in the set of covered clearing agencies would potentially subject them to requirements that
would be duplicative of CFTC requirements.
i. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1): Legal Risk
Because, as noted above, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1) would require substantially the
same set of policies and procedures as Rule 17Ad-22(d)(1), 703 the Commission preliminarily
believes that proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1) would likely impose limited material additional costs
on covered clearing agencies and produce limited benefits, in line with the general economic
considerations discussed in Part IV.C.1.
ii. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2): Governance
Each covered clearing agency has a board of directors that governs its operations and
oversees its senior management. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2) would establish more detailed
requirements for governance arrangements at covered clearing agencies relative to those imposed
on registered clearing agencies under Rule 17Ad-22(d)(8). 704

702

The Commission notes that under proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(a), a registered clearing
agency that is not involved in activities with a more complex risk profile and is not a designated
clearing agency may apply for covered clearing agency status, which would subject them to the
requirements of Rule 17Ad-22(e). The Commission preliminarily believes that this may occur if
the registered clearing agency believes such status may credibly signal the quality of the services
it provides or if it is seeking to obtain QCCP status under the Basel III framework.

703

See supra note 107; supra Part II.B.1 (discussing the full set of requirements under
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(1)); supra Part IV.B.3.a.i (discussing current practices among
registered clearing agencies regarding legal risk); see also 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(1).

341

The Commission understands that any covered clearing agency subject to the proposed
rule has policies and procedures in place that clearly prioritize the risk management and
efficiency of the clearing agency. However, the Commission preliminarily believes that covered
clearing agencies do not already have in place policies and procedures with respect to other
requirements under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2). Based its supervisory experience, the
Commission preliminarily believes that some covered clearing agencies may need to update their
policies and procedures to comply with proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(2)(iv). These updates will
entail certain basic compliance costs, and covered clearing agencies may also incur assessment
costs related to analyzing current governance arrangements in order to determine the extent to
determine which they do not meet the requirements of the proposed amendments. The estimated
costs in terms of paperwork are discussed in Part III.D.1. If, as a result of new policies and
procedures, a covered clearing agency is required to recruit new directors, the Commission
preliminarily estimates a cost per director of $73,000. 705
While there are potential costs associated with compliance, the Commission preliminarily
believes that benefits would potentially accrue from these requirements. Specifically, the
Commission preliminarily believes that enhanced governance arrangements would further
promote safety and efficiency at the clearing agency—motives that may not be part of a clearing
agency’s governance arrangements in the absence of regulation. Policies and procedures
required under the proposed rules would also reinforce governance arrangements at covered
proposed rule would complement other proposed requirements concerning governance at
clearing agencies that may apply separately).
705

The Commission estimated a cost per director of $68,000 in proposing Regulation MC.
See Exchange Act Release No. 34-63107 (Oct. 14, 2010), 75 FR 65881, 65921 & n.215 (Oct. 26,
2010). The $73,000 estimate reflects this amount in 2013 dollars, using consumer price inflation
data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

342

clearing agencies by requiring board members and senior management to have appropriate
experience and skills to discharge their duties and responsibilities.
Compliance with these proposed requirements could reduce the risk that insufficient
internal controls within a covered clearing agency endanger broader financial stability. While
the benefits of compliance are difficult to quantify, the Commission preliminarily believes that
they flow predominantly from a reduced probability of covered clearing agency default.
iii. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3): Comprehensive Framework
for the Management of Risks
The Commission preliminarily believes that proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3) would aid
covered clearing agencies in implementing a systematic process to examine risks and assess the
probability and impact of those risks. 706 Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(i) specifies that a risk
management framework include policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify,
measure, monitor, and manage the range of risks that arise in or are borne by the covered
clearing agency. Critically, these policies and procedures would be subject to review on a
specified basis and approval by the board of directors annually. A sound framework for
comprehensive risk management under regular review would have the benefits of providing
covered clearing agencies with a better awareness of the totality of risks they face in the dynamic
markets they serve. In addition, the requirement to have policies and procedures that provide for
an independent audit committee of the board and that provide internal audit and risk management
functions with sufficient resources, authority, and independence from management, as well as
access to risk and audit committees of the board, would reinforce governance arrangements
directly related to risk management at covered clearing agencies. A holistic approach to risk
706

See supra Part II.B.3 (discussing the full set of requirements under proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(3)).

343

management could help ensure that policies and procedures that covered clearing agencies adopt
pursuant to the proposed rules work in tandem with one another. For example, such an approach
could result in risk-based membership standards under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18) that are
consistent with policies and procedures related to the allocation of credit losses under proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13)(i). The Commission preliminarily believes ensuring that a covered
clearing agency’s risk management activities fit within a unified framework could mitigate the
risk of financial losses to covered clearing agencies’ members and participants in the markets
they serve.
Additionally, the proposed rule extends requirements under Rules 17Ad-22(d)(4) and
17Ad-22(d)(11) by requiring plans for recovery and wind-down. 707 To the extent that covered
clearing agencies do not already have such plans in place, they may incur additional incremental
costs. Plans for recovery and wind-down benefit both clearing members and, more generally,
participants in markets where products are cleared. Many of the costs and benefits of such plans
depend critically on the specific recovery and wind-down tools that covered clearing agencies
choose to include in their rules. The presence of such plans could reduce uncertainty over the
allocation of financial losses to clearing members in the event that a covered clearing agency
faces losses due to member default or for other reasons that exceed its prefunded default
resources. Further, recovery and wind-down plans that detail the circumstances under which
clearing services may be suspended or terminated may mitigate the risk of market disruption in
periods of financial stress. Market participants who face the possibility that the assets they trade
may no longer be cleared and settled by a CCP may be unwilling to trade such assets at times
707

See supra Part II.B.3.b (discussing the requirements for recovery and orderly wind-down
plans under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(3)(ii)).

344

when risk sharing is most valuable. While the effects are difficulty to quantify, the Commission
preliminarily believes that recovery and wind-down plans may support liquidity in times of
financial stress.
Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission preliminarily believes that all
covered clearing agencies have an independent audit committee of the board and most covered
clearing agencies already have some rules governing recovery and wind-down of clearing
operations but have plans that vary in their degree of formality. As a result, the benefits and
costs associated with these requirements will likely be limited to incremental changes associated
with covered clearing agencies’ review of their policies and procedures for recovery and winddown and to registered clearing agencies that move into the set of covered clearing agencies.
iv. Proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4) through (7): Financial Risk
Management
(1) Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4): Credit Risk
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4) would establish requirements for credit risk management
by covered clearing agencies. 708 Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission
preliminarily believes that all entities that would be covered clearing agencies are already in
compliance with proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i) through (iv). Pursuant to Rule 17Ad-22(b)(3),
registered clearing agencies that provide CCP services currently maintain additional financial
resources to meet the “cover one” requirement, and registered clearing agencies that would be
complex risk profile clearing agencies under the proposed rules currently maintain financial

708

See supra Part II.B.4.c (discussing the full set of requirements under proposed Rule
17Ad-22(e)(4)).

345

resources to meet the “cover two” requirement. 709 All covered clearing agencies exclude
resources that are not prefunded when calculating this coverage. 710 As a result, the Commission
preliminarily believes little or no additional direct costs or benefits will result from these
requirements unless registered clearing agencies were to become covered clearing agencies and
include resources that are not prefunded towards their resource requirements. The requirement
to include only prefunded resources when calculating the financial resources available to meet
the standards under proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(i) through (iii) potentially reduces the risk
that covered clearing agencies request financial resources from their members in times of
financial stress, when members are least able to provide these resources.
While requiring “cover two” for complex risk profile clearing agencies and for covered
clearing agencies designated systemically important in multiple jurisdictions would place
additional burdens on the affected clearing agencies, the Commission preliminarily believes that
the requirement is appropriate because disruption to these entities due to member default carries
relatively higher expected costs than for other covered clearing agencies. These relatively higher
expected costs arise from the fact that covered clearing agencies designated systemically
important in multiple jurisdictions are exposed to foreign financial markets and may serve as a
conduit for the transmission of risk; for complex risk profile clearing agencies, high expected

709

The Commission also notes that no covered clearing agency would be systemically
important in multiple jurisdictions unless and until the Commission made such a determination
pursuant to proposed Rule 17Ab2-2. See supra Part II.C and infra Part VII (discussing the
determinations process under proposed Rule 17Ab2-2 and providing proposed rule text,
respectively).
710

See supra Part IV.B.3.b.i (discussing current practices regarding credit risk management
at registered clearing agencies).

346

costs may arise from discrete jump-to-default price changes in the products they clear and higher
correlations in the default risk of members. 711
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi) and (vii) would also impose additional costs by
requiring additional measures to be taken with respect to the testing of a covered clearing
agency’s financial resources and model validation of a covered clearing agency’s credit risk
models. These requirements do not currently exist as part of the standards applied to registered
clearing agencies. 712 Covered clearing agencies may incur additional costs under expanded and
more frequent testing of total financial resources if the formal requirement that results of
monthly testing be reported to appropriate decision makers is a practice not currently used by
covered clearing agencies. A range of costs for these new requirements is discussed in Part
IV.C.3.a.iv(5).
Frequent monitoring and stress testing of total financial resources, conforming model
validations, and reporting of results of the monitoring and testing to appropriate personnel within
the clearing agency could help rapidly identify any gaps in resources required to ensure stability,
even in scenarios not anticipated on the basis of historical data. Moreover, the requirement to
test and, when necessary, update the assumptions and parameters supporting models of credit
risk will support the adjustment of covered clearing agency financial resources to changing
financial conditions, and mitigate the risk that covered clearing agencies will strategically
manage updates to their risk models in support of cost reduction or profit maximization.

Rule 17Ad-22(b)(4) requires a registered clearing agency’s policies and procedures be
reasonably designed to provide for an annual validation of its margin models and the related
parameters and assumptions. See 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(b)(4).

347

(2) Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5): Collateral
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(5) would require a covered clearing agency to have policies
and procedures reasonably designed to limit the assets it accepts as collateral to those with low
credit, liquidity, and market risks, and to set and enforce appropriately conservative haircuts and
concentration limits. Collateral haircut and concentration limit models would be subject to a notless-than-annual review of their sufficiency. 713 Rule 17Ad-22(d)(3) currently requires registered
clearing agencies to have policies and procedures reasonably designed to hold assets in a manner
that minimizes risk of loss or risk of delay in access to them and invest assets in instruments with
minimal credit, market, and liquidity risk.
By focusing on the nature of assets and not on accounts, the Commission preliminarily
believes the proposed rule may allow covered clearing agencies the ability to manage collateral
more efficiently. In particular, under the proposed rule, a covered clearing agency would have
the option of accepting collateral that is riskier than cash and holding this collateral at
commercial banks, potentially increasing default risk exposure. On the other hand, the
requirement to regularly review concentration limits and haircuts mitigates the risk that a
covered clearing agency’s collateral policies fail to respond to changing economic conditions.
Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission understands that all registered clearing
agencies that would meet the definition of a covered clearing agency already conform to the
requirements under the proposed rule related to the nature of assets they may accept as collateral
and the haircuts and concentration limits they apply to collateral assets, so the associated costs

713

See supra Part II.B.4.d (discussing the full set of requirements under proposed Rule
17Ad-22(e)(5)).

348

and benefits that would result from these requirements would apply only if registered clearing
agencies not already in compliance were to become covered clearing agencies.
As a result of the proposed rule, these covered clearing agencies and registered clearing
agencies that become covered clearing agencies may experience additional costs as a result of the
proposed annual review requirements for the sufficiency of collateral haircut and concentration
limit models. Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission preliminarily believes that
many clearing agencies that require collateral would need to develop policies and procedures to
review haircuts and concentration limits annually. Enforcement of the proposed haircut
requirement would also require additional resources. A range of costs for these new
requirements is discussed in Part IV.C.3.a.iv(5). Adherence to the new requirements by these
entrants could extend the benefits of prompt loss coverage, incentive alignment, and systemic
risk mitigation to a larger volume of cleared transactions.
(3) Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6): Margin
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6) would require a covered clearing agency that provides
CCP services to have policies and procedures reasonably designed to require it to cover credit
exposures using a risk-based margin system and to establish minimum standards for such a
system. It would require these policies and procedures to cover daily collection of variation
margin. The proposed rule also requires a set of policies and procedures generally designed to
support a reliable margin system. Among these are policies and procedures to ensure the use of
reliable price data sources and appropriate methods for measuring credit exposure, which could
improve margin system accuracy. Finally, covered clearing agencies would be required to have

349

policies and procedures related to the testing and verification of margin models. 714 Proposed
Rules 17Ad-22(a)(6) and (14) support these requirements by addressing the means of verification
for margin models and the level of coverage required of a margin system against potential future
exposures, respectively. Based on its supervisory experience, however, the Commission
understands that all current covered clearing agencies have policies and procedures that conform
to the requirements under proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(6)(i) through (v) and (vii), and some will
have to update their policies and procedures to comply with proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(6)(vi).
Similar to proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4) and (7), covered clearing agencies that do not
already engage in backtesting of margin resources at least once each day or engage in a monthly
analysis of assumptions and parameters, as well as registered clearing agencies that enter into the
set of covered clearing agencies in the future, may incur incremental compliance costs as a result
of the proposed rule. Since margin plays a key role in clearing agency risk management,
however, requiring that margin be periodically verified and modified as a result of changing
market conditions may mitigate the risks posed by covered clearing agencies to financial markets
in periods of financial stress. Further, periodic review of model specification and parameters
reduces the likelihood that covered clearing agencies opportunistically update margin models in
times of low volatility and fail to update margin models in times of high volatility. A range of
costs for verification and modification of margin models is discussed in Part IV.C.3.a.iv(5).
Further, since risk-based initial margin requirements may cause market participants to internalize
some of the costs borne by the CCP as a result of large or risky positions, 715 ensuring that margin

models are well-specified and correctly calibrated with respect to economic conditions will help
ensure that they continue to align the incentives of clearing members with the goal of financial
stability.
(4) Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7): Liquidity Risk
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7) would require a covered clearing agency to have policies
and procedures reasonably designed to effectively monitor, measure, and manage liquidity
risk. 716 Parties to securities and derivatives transactions rely on clearing agencies for prompt
clearance and settlement of transactions. Market participants in centrally cleared and settled
markets are often linked to one another through intermediation chains in which one party may
rely on proceeds from sales of cleared products to meet payment obligations to another party. If
insufficient liquidity causes a clearing agency to fail to meet settlement or payment obligations to
its members, consequences could include the default of a clearing member who may be
depending on these funds to make a payment to another market participant, with losses then
transmitted to others that carry exposure to this market participant if the market participant is
depending on payments from the clearing members to make said payments to others. Therefore,
the benefits related to liquidity risk management generally flow from the reduced risk of
systemic risk transmission by covered clearing agencies as a result of liquidity shortfalls, either
in the normal course of operation or as a result of member default.
Enhanced liquidity risk management may produce additional benefits. Clearing members
would face less uncertainty over whether a covered clearing agency has the liquidity resources
default fund, considering collateral costs, clearing member default probability, and the extent to
which margin requirements are associated with risk mitigating incentives).
716

See supra Part II.B.4.f (discussing the full set of requirements under proposed Rule
17Ad-22(e)(7)).

351

necessary to make prompt payments which would reduce any need to hedge the risk of
nonpayment. Potential benefits from enhanced liquidity risk management may also extend
beyond members of covered clearing agencies or markets for centrally cleared and settled
securities. Clearing members are often members of larger financial networks, and the ability of a
covered clearing agency to meet payment obligations to its members can directly affect its
members’ ability to meet payment obligations outside of the cleared market. Thus, management
of liquidity risk may mitigate the risk of contagion between asset markets.
Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission preliminarily believes that some
covered clearing agencies would need to create new policies and procedures, or update existing
policies and procedures, to meet requirements under the various subsections of proposed Rule
17Ad-22(e)(7). These actions would entail compliance costs, as noted in Part III.B.2. Further,
the Commission preliminarily believes that for some covered clearing agencies the proposed
requirements would require them to establish new practices. The cost of adherence to the
proposed rule would likely be passed on to market participants in cleared markets, as discussed
in more detail below.
Under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i), a covered clearing agency would be required to
have policies and procedures reasonably designed to require maintaining sufficient resources to
achieve “cover one” for liquidity risk. This requirement mirrors the “cover one” requirement for
credit risk in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(4)(iii). Based on its supervisory experience, the
Commission preliminarily believes that many covered clearing agencies do not currently meet a
“cover one” requirement for liquidity and thus will likely incur costs to comply with this
proposed rule. As discussed earlier, whether covered clearing agencies choose to gather liquidity
directly from members or instead choose to rely on third-party arrangements, the costs of

352

liquidity may be passed on to other market participants, eventually increasing transaction
costs. 717 The requirement may, however, reduce the procyclicality of covered clearing agencies’
liquidity demands, which may reduce costs to market participants in certain situations. For
instance, the requirement would reduce the likelihood that a covered clearing agency would have
to call on its members to contribute additional liquidity in periods of financial stress, when
liquidity may be most costly.
Under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ii), a covered clearing agency would be required to
have policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that it meets the minimum liquidity
resource requirement in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) with qualifying liquid resources. 718
Qualifying liquid resources would include cash held at the central bank or at a creditworthy
commercial bank, assets that are readily converted into cash pursuant to committed lines of
credit, committed foreign exchange swaps, committed repurchase agreements or other highly
reliable prearranged funding agreements, or assets that may be pledged to a central bank in
exchange for cash (if the covered clearing agency has access to routine credit at a central bank).
The Commission notes that the proposed rules allow covered clearing agencies some measure of
flexibility in managing qualifying liquid resources and that covered clearing agencies would be
able to use creditworthy commercial bank services where appropriate.
Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission preliminarily believes that some
covered clearing agencies currently do not meet the proposed liquidity requirements with
qualifying liquid resources. As an alternative to the proposed rules, the Commission could have

See supra Part IV.C.1.d (discussing the effect of the proposed rules on concentration in
the market for clearing services and among clearing members).
718

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(15), infra Part VII (defining “qualifying liquid
resources”).

353

restricted the definition of qualifying liquid resources to assets held by covered clearing
agencies. These covered clearing agencies and the markets they serve would benefit from the
proposed minimum requirements for liquidity resources in terms of the reduced risk of liquidity
shortfalls and associated contagion risks described above. However, qualifying liquid resources
may be costly for covered clearing agencies to maintain on their own balance sheets. Such
resources carry an opportunity cost. Assets held as cash are, by definition, not available for
investment in less liquid assets that may be more productive uses of capital. This cost may
ultimately be borne by clearing members who contribute liquid resources to covered clearing
agencies to meet minimum requirements under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ii) and their
customers.
The Commission notes that, under the proposed rules, covered clearing agencies have
flexibility to meet their qualifying liquid resource requirements in a number of ways. In perfect
capital markets, maintaining on-balance-sheet liquidity resources should be no more costly than
entering into committed lines of credit or prearranged funding agreements backed by less-liquid
assets that would allow these assets to be converted into cash. However, market frictions, such
as search frictions, may enable banks to obtain liquidity at lower cost than other firms. In the
presence of such frictions, obtaining liquidity using committed and uncommitted funding
arrangements provided by banks may prove a less costly option for some covered clearing
agencies than holding additional liquid resources on their balance sheets. In particular, the
Commission preliminarily believes that requiring covered clearing agencies to enter into
committed or uncommitted funding arrangements would decrease the costs that would be
experienced by them in the event they sought to liquidate securities holdings during periods of

354

market disruptions and increase the likelihood that they meet funding obligations to market
participants by reducing the risk of delay in converting non-cash assets into cash.
The Commission notes that committed or uncommitted funding arrangements would only
count towards minimum requirements to the extent that covered clearing agencies had securities
available to post as collateral, so use of these facilities may require covered clearing agencies to
require their members to contribute more securities. If these securities are costly for clearing
members to supply, then additional required contributions to meet minimum requirements under
proposed Rule proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ii) may impose burdens on clearing members and
their customers. Similarly, prearranged funding arrangements may entail implicit costs to
clearing members. Prearranged funding arrangements could impose costs on clearing members
if they are obligated to contribute securities towards a collateral pool that the covered clearing
agency would use to back borrowing. Alternatively, clearing members may be obligated under a
covered clearing agency’s rules to act as counterparties to repurchase agreements. Under the
latter scenario, clearing members would bear costs associated with accepting securities in lieu of
cash. Additionally, the Commission notes certain explicit costs specifically associated with these
arrangements outlined below.
Counterparties to committed arrangements allowable under proposed Rule 17Ad22(a)(15) charge covered clearing agencies a premium to provide firm liquidity commitments
and additional out-of-pocket expenses will be incurred establishing and maintaining committed
liquidity arrangements. The Commission preliminarily estimates that the total cost of committed
funding arrangements will be approximately 30 basis points per year, including upfront fees,

355

legal fees, commitment fees, and collateral agent fees. 719 Furthermore, the Commission is aware
of other potential consequences of these arrangements. In some instances, they may cause
entities outside of a covered clearing agency to bear risks ordinarily concentrated within the
covered clearing agency, while, in others, these arrangements may result in increased exposure
of covered clearing agencies to certain members. 720 Financial intermediaries that participate in
committed credit facilities may be those least able to provide liquidity in times of financial stress,
so these commitments may represent a route for risk transmission. 721 Finally, the Commission
notes that covered clearing agencies may face constraints in the size of credit facilities available
to them. Recent market statistics have estimated the total size of the committed credit facility
market in the U.S. at $1.2 trillion with only 12 of 1800 facilities exceeding $10 billion in size. 722
Given the volume of activity at covered clearing agencies, it is possible that they may only be
able to use committed credit facilities to meet a portion of their liquidity requirements under
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ii).
A covered clearing agency may alternatively use a prearranged funding arrangement
determined to be highly reliable in extreme but plausible market conditions to raise liquid

Secretariat, CFTC, Sept. 16, 2013, at 13 & n.48 (noting CME’s assumption that the cost of

356

resources backed by non-cash assets but that does not require firm commitments from liquidity
providers. This strategy would avoid certain of the explicit fees associated with firm
commitments, while incurring costs related to the annual review and maintenance of such
arrangements. Based on its supervisory experience and discussions with market participants, the
Commission preliminarily believes the cost associated with commitment fees to be between 5
and 15 basis points per year. Given the 30 basis point cost associated with committed funding
arrangements, mentioned above, uncommitted facilities could entail costs of between 15 and 25
basis points. 723 Prearranged funding arrangements may ultimately prove less costly than holding
cash and may be more widely available than committed arrangements, while still reducing the
likelihood of delay faced by covered clearing agencies that attempt to market less-liquid assets.
As mentioned above in the context of committed credit facilities, the Commission acknowledges
that financial institutions who offer to provide liquidity to covered clearing agencies on an
uncommitted basis may be least able to do so in times of financial stress, when access to liquidity
is most needed by the covered clearing agency. Without a commitment in place, counterparties
retain the option to fail to provide liquidity during stressed conditions, when liquidity is most
valuable to clearing agencies and the markets they serve. To the extent covered clearing
agencies may establish requirements for clearing members to provide liquidity to ensure
compliance with the Commission’s proposed rules, the costs experienced by members indirectly
may exceed those associated with committed credit facilities.

723

Subtracting the lower bound of commitment fees (5 basis points) from the estimated total
cost of a committed facility (30 basis points) yields an estimate of the upper bound of the fees
associated with an uncommitted facility (30 - 5 = 25 basis points). We estimate the lower bound
of fees associated with an uncommitted facility analogously (30 - 15 = 15 basis points).

357

Finally, covered clearing agencies that have access to routine credit at a central bank
could meet the qualifying liquid resources requirement with assets that are pledgeable to a
central bank. The Commission notes that this may represent the lowest cost option for covered
clearing agencies, but understands that this latter provision would represent an advantage only if
and when a covered clearing agency receives the benefit of access to routine central bank
borrowing. The Commission anticipates that at such future time access to routine credit at a
central bank would provide covered clearing agencies with additional flexibility with respect to
resources used to comply with the liquidity risk management requirements of proposed Rules
17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) and (ii).
The total cost of maintaining qualifying liquid resources pursuant to proposed Rules
17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) and (ii) is composed of the cost of each liquidity source including assets held
by covered clearing agencies, committed credit facilities and prearranged funding agreements,
multiplied by the quantity of each of these liquidity sources held by covered clearing agencies.
The Commission is unable to quantify the cost of cash held by clearing agencies and securities
required to back credit facilities since such estimates would require detailed information about
additional required contributions of clearing members under the proposed rules, as well as
clearing members’ best alternative to holding cash and securities. 724 As mentioned above,
however, the Commission has limited information about the costs associated with committed and
uncommitted credit facilities. Based on this information, we are able to quantify the costs
associated with committed credit facilities that will result from the requirement to maintain
724

Covered clearing agencies may choose to allocate liquidity burdens based on a number of
factors related to the markets they serve and their membership. See, e.g., Exchange Act Release
No. 34-70999 (Dec. 5, 2013), 78 FR 75400 (Dec. 11, 2013) (Commission order approving NSCC
rule change to institute supplemental liquidity deposits to its clearing fund designed to increase
liquidity resources to meet its liquidity needs).

358

qualifying liquid resources. The Commission preliminarily estimates that the cost of compliance
with the proposed rules will be between $133 million and $225 million per year as a result of the
requirement to enter into prearranged funding agreements for non-cash assets used to meet
liquidity requirements under proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) and (ii). This analysis assumes
that covered clearing agencies will enter into such agreements at arm’s length on an
uncommitted basis. Based on staff discussions with market participants, the Commission
understands that alternative arrangements between covered clearing agencies and their members
may be obtained at lower cost, though these arrangements may come with increased wrong-way
risk. 725
U.S. Treasury securities would not fall under the proposed definition of qualifying liquid
resources. The Commission understands that U.S. Treasury markets represent some of the
largest and most liquid markets in the world, see Part IV.B.3.f.ii, and that, in “flights to quality”
and “flights to liquidity” in times of financial stress, U.S. Treasuries trade at a premium to other
725

To produce this range, the Commission used a combination of publicly available
information from SRO rule filings, comment letters, and 2012 annual financial statements, and
non-public information gathered as a result of its regulatory role. For each covered clearing
agency, the Commission assumed that the covered clearing agency’s guaranty fund represents
the sole source of liquidity used to satisfy its minimum liquidity requirements under the proposed
rules. To compute the level of qualifying liquid resources currently held by each covered
clearing agency, the Commission assumed that cash in the covered clearing agency’s guaranty
fund remains fixed at current levels and added to this any amount from credit facilities that could
be backed by the value of securities held in the covered clearing agency’s guaranty funds.
Taking the sum of these current qualifying liquid resources over all covered clearing
agencies and subtracting this from the sum of the “cover one” guaranty fund requirement over all
covered clearing agencies results in the total shortfall relative to minimum requirements under
proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) and (ii). The Commission further assumed that covered
clearing agencies would cover this shortfall using prearranged funding agreements backed by
additional securities posted to guaranty funds by clearing members. Finally, the Commission
multiplied the total prearranged funding amount by between 0.15% and 0.25% to arrive at a
range of ongoing costs.

359

assets. 726 If, as an alternative to the proposed rules, the Commission included U.S. government
securities in the definition of qualifying liquid resources, the Commission preliminarily estimates
the cost of complying with requirements under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) and (ii) would be
reduced by between $9 million and $225 million per year. 727 The Commission preliminarily
believes, however, that there are benefits to including government securities only if prearranged
funding agreements exist. In particular, given the quantity of these securities financed by the
largest individual dealers, fire-sale conditions could materialize if collateral is liquidated in a

727

The Commission re-estimated the level of prearranged funding agreements required to
meet requirements under proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) and (ii) using the data and
methodology described in note 725, except in this case the Commission assumed that all nondefaulting member resources applied to funding obligations were a mix of cash and U.S.
Treasuries for a lower bound, and assumed that all resources applied to funding obligations were
a mix of cash and U.S. Treasuries for an upper bound.
Taking the sum of these current qualifying liquid resources over all covered clearing
agencies and subtracting this from the sum of cover one guaranty fund requirement over all
covered clearing agencies results in the total shortfall relative to minimum requirements under
proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(7)(i) and (ii) if U.S. government and agency securities were
considered qualifying liquid resources. As above, the Commission further assumed that covered
clearing agencies would cover this shortfall using prearranged funding agreements backed by
additional securities posted to guaranty funds by clearing members and multiplied this amount
by between 0.15% and 0.25% to arrive at a range of ongoing costs.

360

disorderly manner, which could prevent covered clearing agencies from meeting payment
obligations. 728
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(iii) concerns access to accounts and services at a central
bank, when available and where practical. 729 The Commission preliminarily believes that it may
be beneficial for covered clearing agencies to use central bank account services because doing so
would reduce exposure to commercial bank default risk. Moreover, for some covered clearing
agencies, central bank services may represent the lowest-cost admissible funding arrangement
under the proposed rule. The Commission understands, however, that central bank services are
only currently available to a subset of covered clearing agencies, and the proposed rule only
requires policies and procedures to ensure use of central bank accounts and services when
practical and available.
Proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(7)(iv) and (v) address relations between covered clearing
agencies and their liquidity providers. The Commission preliminarily believes that a key benefit
of these proposed rules would be an increased level of assurance that liquidity providers would
be able to supply liquidity to covered clearing agencies on demand. Such assurance is especially
important because of the possibility that covered clearing agencies may rely on outside liquidity
providers to convert non-cash assets into cash using prearranged funding arrangements or
committed facilities, pursuant to proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ii) and the definition of
qualifying liquid resources in proposed Rule 17Ad-22(a)(15). The required policies and
procedures would ensure the covered clearing agency undertakes due diligence to confirm that it

361

has a reasonable basis to believe each of its liquidity providers understand the liquidity risk
borne by the liquidity provider, and that the liquidity provider would have the capacity to provide
liquidity under commitments to the covered clearing agency. Finally, covered clearing agencies
would be required, under the proposed rule, to maintain and test the covered clearing agency’s
procedures and operational capacity for accessing liquidity under their agreements. The
Commission preliminarily believes that, besides the costs associated with new or updated
policies and procedures discussed in Part III.B.2, covered clearing agencies and liquidity
providers may experience costs associated with the proposed rules as a result of the requirement
to test liquidity resources, such as, for example, fees associated with conducting test draws on a
covered clearing agency’s credit lines. Costs associated with ongoing monitoring and
compliance related to testing are included in the Commission’s estimate of quantifiable costs
presented in Part IV.C.3.d.
Proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(7)(vi) and (vii) may impose costs on covered clearing
agencies as a result of requirements for testing the sufficiency of liquidity resources and
validating models used to measure liquidity risk. The testing and model validation requirements
of these proposed rules are similar to requirements for testing and model validation for credit risk
in proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4)(vi) and (vii), and the Commission preliminarily believes that
these proposed rules would yield similar benefits. Frequent monitoring and testing liquidity
resources could help rapidly identify any gaps in resources required to meet payment obligations.
Moreover, the requirement to test and, when necessary, update the assumptions and parameters
supporting models of liquidity risk will support the adjustment of covered clearing agency
liquidity resources to changing financial conditions and mitigate the risk that covered clearing

362

agencies will strategically manage updates to their liquidity risk models in support of costreduction or profit-maximization.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(viii) addresses liquidity shortfalls at a covered clearing
agency, and the Commission preliminarily believes the proposed rule would reduce ambiguity
related to settlement delays in the event of liquidity shocks. Among other things, by requiring
procedures that seek to avoid delay of settlement payments, this proposed rule would require
covered clearing agencies to address liquidity concerns in advance rather than relying on
strategies of delaying accounts payable in the event of liquidity shocks. As discussed previously,
effective liquidity risk management by covered clearing agencies that serves to eliminate
uncertainty on the part of clearing members that payments by the covered clearing agency will
be made on time may allow these clearing members to allocate their liquidity resources to more
efficient uses than holding precautionary reserves. 730 The Commission preliminarily believes the
proposed rule may reduce some of the flexibility covered clearing agencies have in the absence
of the proposed rule, which could impose additional burdens on these clearing agencies as
discussed in Part IV.C.1.b.
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ix) would require a covered clearing agency to have
policies and procedures reasonably designed to describe its process for replenishing any liquid
resources that it may employ during a stress event. 731 The ability to replenish liquidity resources
is critical to ensure that covered clearing agencies are able to continue operations after a stress
event. Beyond the general benefits associated with liquidity risk management noted earlier, this
proposed rule would yield particular benefits insofar as it would reduce uncertainty about

731

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(ix), infra Part VII.

363

covered clearing agency liquidity resources at precisely those times when information about
liquidity may be most important to market participants.
Finally, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(x) would require a covered clearing agency that
provides CCP services and is either systemically important in multiple jurisdictions or is a
clearing agency involved in activities with a more complex risk profile to conduct a feasibility
analysis for “cover two.” 732 The primary cost associated with this rule will be an annual analysis
by the affected covered clearing agencies. Costs associated with a feasibility study would likely
include the cost of staffing and consulting, which will depend on the scope of products cleared
and the particular approach taken by each covered clearing agencies. The costs associated with
this requirement are included in Part IV.C.3.d.
(5) Testing and Validation of Risk Models
Proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4) through (7) include requirements for covered clearing
agencies to have policies and procedures reasonably designed to test and validate models related
to financial risks. Covered clearing agencies may incur additional costs under expanded and
more frequent testing of financial resources if the proposed requirements for testing and
validation do not conform to practices currently used by covered clearing agencies. 733 These
costs are composed of two portions. The first encompasses startup costs related to collection and
storage of data elements necessary to implement testing and validation, along with investments

732

See proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(x), infra Part VII.

733

The Commission notes that while the stress testing provisions in proposed Rules 17Ad22(e)(4) through (7) include new requirements for covered clearing agencies, Rule 17Ad22(b)(4) requires registered clearing agencies that provide CCP services for security-based swaps
to have policies and procedures for a general margin model validation requirement. See supra
note 712.

364

in software tools and human capital to support these functions. The second portion of costs
includes the ongoing, annual costs of conducting testing and validation under the proposed rules.
Based on its supervisory experience and discussions with industry participants, the
Commission preliminarily believes that startup costs to support testing and validation of credit
risk, margin, and liquidity risk models at covered clearing agencies could fall in the range of $5
million to $25 million for each covered clearing agency. This range primarily reflects
investments in information technology to process data already available to covered clearing
agencies for stress testing and validation purposes. The range’s width reflects differences in
markets served by, as well as the scope of operations of, each covered clearing agency. Based on
its supervisory experience and discussions with industry participants, the Commission estimates
a lower bound of $1 million per year for ongoing costs related to testing of risk models.
Should each covered clearing agency choose to hire external consultants for the purposes
of performing model validation required under proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4) and 17Ad-22(e)(7)
through written policies and procedures, the Commission preliminarily estimates the ongoing
cost associated with hiring such consultants would be approximately $4,388,160 in the
aggregate. 734
The Commission acknowledges that it could have, as an alternative, proposed rules that
would require testing and validation of financial risk models at covered clearing agencies at
734

This figure was calculated as follows: 2 Consultants for 40 hours per week at $653 per
hour = $52,240 x 12 weeks = $626,880 per clearing agency x 7 covered clearing agencies =
$4,388,160. The $653 per hour figure for a consultant was calculated using www.payscale.com,
modified by Commission staff to account for an 1800-hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to
account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead.
The Commission previously estimated that ongoing costs associated with hiring external
consultants to fulfill the requirements of Rule 17Ad-22(b)(4) would be approximately $3.9
million per year. See Clearing Agency Standards Release, supra note 5, at 66261.

365

different frequencies. For example, the Commission could have required backtesting of margin
resources less frequently than daily. Such a policy could imply less frequent adjustments in
margin levels that may result in over- or under-margining. The Commission preliminarily
believes that the frequencies of testing and validation of financial risk models that it has
proposed are appropriate given the risks faced by covered clearing agencies and current market
practices related to frequency of meetings of risk management committees and boards of
directors at covered clearing agencies.
v. Proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(8) through (10): Settlement and
Physical Delivery
Proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(8) through (10) require covered clearing agencies to have
policies and procedures reasonably designed to address settlement risk. Many of the issues raised
by settlement are similar to those raised by liquidity. Uncertainty in settlement may make it
difficult for clearing members to fulfill their obligations to other market participants within their
respective financial networks if they hold back precautionary reserves, as discussed above.
Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission preliminarily believes that the benefits and
costs for the majority of covered clearing agencies will likely be limited. Registered clearing
agencies that enter into the set of covered clearing agencies in the future, by contrast, may bear
more significant costs as a result of the enhanced standards.
Settlement finality is important to market participants for a number of reasons. Reversal
of transactions can be costly to participants. For example, if transactions are reversed, buyers
and sellers of securities may be exposed to additional market risk as they attempt to reestablish
desired positions in cleared products. Similarly, reversal of transactions may render participants
expecting to receive payment from the covered clearing agency unable to fulfill payment
obligations to their counterparties, exposing these additional parties to the transmitted credit risk.
366

Finally, settlement finality can help facilitate default management procedures by covered
clearing agencies since they improve transparency of members’ positions. Unless settlement
finality is established by covered clearing agencies, market participants may attempt to hedge
reversal risk for themselves. This could come at the cost of efficiency if it means that, on the
margin, participants are less likely to use cleared products as collateral in other financial
transactions.
In addition, settlement in central bank money, where available and determined to be
practical by the board of directors of the covered clearing agency, as the proposed rules would
require, greatly reduces settlement risk related to payment agents. Using central bank accounts
to effect settlement rather than settlement banks removes a link from the intermediation chain
associated with clearance and settlement. As a result, a covered clearing agency would be less
exposed to the default risk of its settlement banks. In cases where settlement banks maintain
links to other covered clearing agencies, for example as liquidity providers or as members,
reducing exposure to settlement bank default risk may be particularly valuable.
As in the case of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(7)(iii), the Commission acknowledges there
may be circumstances in which covered clearing agencies either do not have access to central
bank account services or the use of such services is impractical. Accordingly, the Commission
preliminarily believes it is appropriate to allow covered clearing agencies the flexibility to also
use commercial bank account services to effect settlement, subject to a requirement that covered
clearing agencies monitor and manage the risks associated with such arrangements.
vi. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(11): CSDs
CSDs play a key role in modern financial markets. For many issuers, many transactions
in their securities involve no transfer of physical certificates.

367

Paperless trade generally improves transactional efficiency. Book-entry transfer of
securities may facilitate conditional settlement systems required by proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(12). For example, book-entry transfer in a delivery versus payment system allows
securities to be credited to an account immediately upon debiting the account for the payment
amount. Institutions and individuals may elect to no longer hold and exchange certificates that
represent their ownership of securities. An early study showed that the creation of DTC resulted
in a 30–35% reduction in the physical movement of certificates. 735 Among other benefits, to the
extent that delays in exchanging paper certificates result in settlement failures, immobilization
and dematerialization of shares reduces the frequency of these failures. 736
For markets to realize the transactional benefits of paperless trade, however, requires
confidence that CSDs can correctly account for the number of securities in their custody and for
the book entries that allocate these securities across participant accounts. In order to realize
these benefits, the proposed rules also require covered CSDs to establish, implement, maintain
and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure the integrity of
securities issues, minimize the risks associated with transfer of securities, and protect assets
against custody risk. Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission preliminarily
believes that registered CSDs already have infrastructure in place to meet these requirements.
However, CSDs may face incremental compliance costs in instances where they must modify

process for paper certificates were a principal cause of failures to deliver and receive during the
“paperwork crisis” of the late 1960s).

368

their rules in order to implement appropriate controls. Compliance costs may be higher for
potential new CSDs that are determined to be covered clearing agencies in the future.
vii. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12): Exchange-of-Value
Settlement Systems
Clearance and settlement of transactions between two parties to a trade involves an
exchange of one obligation for another. Regarding transactions in securities, these claims can be
securities or payments for securities. A particular risk associated with transactions is principal
risk, which is the risk that only one obligation is successfully transferred between counterparties.
For example, in a purchase of common stock, a party faces principal risk if, despite successfully
paying the counterparty for the purchase, the counterparty may fail to deliver the shares.
The proposed requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12) are substantially the same as
those in Rule 17Ad-22(d)(13). 737 As a result, covered clearing agencies that have been in
compliance with Rule 17Ad-22(d)(13) face no substantially new requirements under Proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(12). The Commission preliminary expects the proposed rule would likely
impose limited material additional costs on covered clearing agencies. It would also produce
benefits in line with the general economic considerations discussed in Part IV.C.1. The
economic effects may differ for registered clearing agencies that enter into the set of covered
clearing agencies in the future.

737

See supra note 274; supra Part II.B.9 (discussing the full set of requirements under
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13)); supra Part IV.B.3.d.ii (discussing current practices among
registered clearing agencies regarding exchange-of-value settlement systems); see also 17
CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(13).

369

viii. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13): Participant-Default Rules
and Procedures
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) would require covered clearing agencies to have policies
and procedures for participant default with additional specificity relative to current requirements
for registered clearing agencies under Rule 17Ad-22(d)(11). In particular, proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(13) requires policies and procedures that address the allocation of credit losses that exceed
default resources, repayment of liquidity providers, replenishment of financial resources, and
testing and review of default procedures.
Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission preliminarily believes all covered
clearing agencies currently test and review default procedures at least annually, so the costs of
this requirement would apply only to registered clearing agencies that may enter into the set of
covered clearing agencies in the future. Most covered clearing agencies, however, will be
required to update their policies and procedures as a result of proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(13)(i)
and (ii). Clearing members may experience benefits from proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13)(i),
which requires covered clearing agencies to provide disclosure to members regarding the
allocation of default losses when these losses exceed the level of financial resource it has
available. As a result of this additional transparency, clearing members may experience an
improved ability to manage their expectations of potential obligations against the covered
clearing agency, which may increase the likelihood of orderly wind-downs in the event of
member default. Crafting such allocation plans by covered clearing agencies may entail certain
compliance costs, as previously discussed in Part III.D.5.a and as discussed further in Part
IV.C.3.d. Further, covered clearing agencies may allocate default losses in a number of ways

370

that may themselves have implications for participation, competition, and systemic risk. 738 For
example, if, as a part of a default resolution plan, selective tear-up is contemplated after a failed
position auction, then clearing members who expect low loss exposure in the tear-up may not
have adequate incentives to participate in the position auction, even if they are better able to
absorb losses than clearing members who expect high exposure in the tear-up plan. This would
increase the chances of a failed auction and the chances of a protracted and more disruptive
wind-down. Thus, the total costs of any loss allocation plan may depend largely on the particular
choices embedded in covered clearing agencies’ plans.
As an alternative to the proposed rules, the Commission could have proposed more
prescriptive requirements for default procedures at covered clearing agencies. The Commission
preliminarily believes that differences in cleared assets and in the characteristics of clearing
members supports allowing each covered clearing agency flexibility in choosing its own default
procedures pursuant to proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13).
In addition to loss allocation plans, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(13) contains new
provisions related to the replenishment of financial resources and testing and review of default
procedures that do not appear in Rule 17Ad-22(d)(11). The Commission preliminarily believes
that proposed rules related to replenishment of financial resources may reduce the potential for
systemic risk and contagion in cleared markets, as they facilitate covered clearing agencies’
prompt access to these resources in times of financial stress. The Commission also preliminarily
believes that broad-based participation in the testing of default procedures could reduce
disruption to cleared markets in the event of default. However, to the extent that testing of these
738

See, e.g., Elliot, supra note 617 (discussing various loss-allocation rules and CCP
recovery and wind-down).

371

procedures requires participation by members of covered clearing agencies, members’
customers, and other stakeholders, these parties may bear costs under the proposed rules. The
Commission is unable to quantify the economic effects of participation in these tests at this time.
ix. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14): Segregation and Portability
Segregation and portability of customer positions serves a number of useful purposes in
cleared markets. In the normal course of business, the ability to efficiently identify and move an
individual customer’s positions and collateral between clearing members enables customers to
easily terminate a relationship with one clearing member and initiate a relationship with another.
This may facilitate competition between clearing members by ensuring customers are free to
move their accounts from one clearing member to another based on their preferences, without
being unduly limited by operational barriers. 739
Segregation and portability may be especially important in the event of participant
default. By requiring that customer collateral and positions remain segregated, covered clearing
agencies can facilitate, in the event of a clearing member’s insolvency, the recovery of customer
collateral and the movement of customer positions to one or more other clearing members.
Further, portability of customer positions may facilitate the orderly wind down of a defaulting
member if customer positions may be moved to a non-defaulting member. Porting of positions
in a default scenario may yield benefits for customers if the alternative is closing-out positions at
one clearing member and reestablishing them at another clearing member. The latter strategy

739

See, e.g., Paul Klemperer, Competition When Consumers Have Switching Costs: An
Overview with Applications to Industrial Organization, Macroeconomics, and International
Trade, 62 Rev. Econ. Stud. 515 (1995) (presenting an overview of switching costs and their
effects on competition).

372

would cause customers to bear transactions costs, which might be especially high in times of
financial stress.
The Commission notes that, in its preliminary view, these proposed rules are flexible in
their approach to implementing segregation and portability requirements. The most efficient
means of implementing these requirements may depend on the products that a covered clearing
agency clears as well as other business practices at a covered clearing agency. For example, a
clearing agency’s decision whether or not to collect margin on a gross or net basis may bear on
its decision to port customer positions and collateral on an individual or omnibus basis, and
while an individual account structure may provide a higher degree of protection from a default
by another customer, it may be operationally and resource intensive for a covered clearing to
implement and may reduce the efficiency of its operations.
As a result, the costs and benefits of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(14) will depend on
specific rules implemented by covered clearing agencies as well as how much these rules differ
from current practice. Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission preliminarily
believes that the current practices at covered clearing agencies to which the proposed rule would
apply already meets segregation requirements under the proposed rule, so any costs and benefits
for covered clearing agencies would flow from implementing portability requirements, though it
potentially raises a barrier to entry for security-based swap clearing agencies or clearing agencies
involved in activities with a more complex risk profile that seek to become covered clearing
agencies.
x. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15): General Business Risk
While proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4) and 17Ad-22(e)(7) require that covered clearing
agencies have policies and procedures reasonably designed to address credit risk and liquidity
risk, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) requires that covered clearing agencies have policies and
373

procedures reasonably designed to address general business risk. The Commission preliminarily
believes that general business losses experienced by covered clearing agencies represent a
distinct risk to cleared markets, given limited competition and specialization of clearing
agencies. In this regard, the loss of clearing services due to general business losses would likely
result in major market disruption. The proposed rule requires a covered clearing agency to have
policies and procedures reasonably designed to mitigate the risk that business losses result in the
disruption of clearing services. Under these policies and procedures covered clearing agencies
would hold sufficient liquid resources funded by equity to cover potential general business
losses, which at a minimum would constitute six months of operating expenses. The
Commission preliminarily believes that the benefits of such policies and procedures would flow
primarily from covered clearing agencies that would be required to increase their holdings of
liquid net assets funded by equity, enabling them to sustain their operations for sufficient time
and achieve orderly wind-down if such action is eventually necessary.
The Commission could have proposed a higher or lower minimum level of resources, for
example, corresponding to one quarter of operating expenses or one year of operating expenses.
The Commission preliminarily believes, however, that the rules, as proposed, afford covered
clearing agencies sufficient flexibility in determining the level of resources to hold while
maintaining a minimum standard that supports continued operations in the event of general
business losses. As another alternative, the Commission could have allowed covered clearing
agencies additional flexibility in determine the nature of the financial resources held to mitigate
the effects of general business risk or the means by which these resources are funded. The
Commission preliminarily believes, however, that by specifying that these resources be liquid in
nature, the proposed rule would limit any delays by covered clearing agencies that suffer

374

business losses from paying expenses required for continued operations. Additionally, by
specifically requiring that a covered clearing agency draw liquid net resources from members as
equity capital, the proposed rules may also encourage members to more closely monitor the
business operations of a covered clearing agency, which may reduce the likelihood of losses.
Based on its supervisory experience Commission preliminarily believes that certain
covered clearing agencies would be required to establish and maintain policies and procedures
providing for specified levels of equity capital and higher levels of liquid net assets than they
would in the absence of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15). 740 Table 2 contains summary
information from five registered clearing agencies and estimates, solely for purposes of
evaluating the costs and benefits of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15), the amount of additional
capital these entities would be required to establish and maintain to comply with the proposed
rule. As the Commission has not previously had such a capital requirement, the estimate is based
on one half of the average annual operating expenses for each covered clearing agency as
reflected in their annual financial statements over the five-year period ending December 31,
2012. 741
Table 2 identifies cash and cash equivalents as liquid assets and averages this over the
same five-year period. A key shortcoming of using publicly available financial data is the
difficulty in determining how much of a firm’s cash and cash equivalents are funded by either

740

Additional equity capital may be raised through share issuance or by retaining earnings.

741

In the case of DTCC, to obtain an estimate of annual operating expense, the Commission
made minor adjustments to the total expense by excluding expenses not related to DTCC’s core
operations, since its annual income statement does not explicitly show the operating expense.

375

equity or liabilities, or both. To this end, the Commission considered two different cases. 742 In
Case 1, the Commission assumed that cash on each clearing agency’s balance sheet was funded
by liabilities first, with the residual funded by equity. In Case 2, the Commission assumed that
cash on each clearing agency’s balance sheet was funded pro-rata by equity and liabilities. 743
This procedure likely yields an upper bound for estimates of additional equity necessary to meet
the minimum reserve requirements.

The Commission notes that these two cases are provided as estimates of cash and cash
equivalents funded by equity for existing covered clearing agencies for limited purposes of the
economic analysis but are not methods the Commission would necessarily accept if used by a
covered clearing agency to comply with proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15). Nor should the two
cases presented be viewed as interpretive guidance regarding proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15).

743

For example, in Case 2, for DTC we arrive at a pro-rata allocation of cash by computing
the ratio of Average Equity to the sum of Average Equity and Average Liabilities (282/3646 =
7.73%,) and applying this to Average Cash and Cash Equivalents (7.73% x 3151 = 243.71) to
arrive at a proxy of the level of liquid net assets funded by equity.

744

The figures in Table 2 are based on financial data taken from the 2008–2012 annual
reports of DTC, FICC, ICEEU, NSCC, and OCC. The Commission notes that these figures are
presented for the limited purposes of conducting this economic analysis and do not represent
methods the Commission would necessarily accept if used by a covered clearing agency to
comply with proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15).

376

Absent market frictions, a change in capital structure should have no effect on the value
of a covered clearing agency. 745 The Commission acknowledges that market imperfections such
as asymmetric information, moral hazard, and regulation may imply that covered clearing
agencies that would need to raise additional equity capital incur opportunity costs for holding
this additional capital rather than investing it in projects or distributing it back to equity holders
who might, in turn, invest in projects.
To estimate these costs, the Commission applied the capital asset pricing model to
observed returns for CME and ICE, two clearing agencies that have publicly-traded equity
outstanding. 746 This methodology yielded an estimate of the cost of equity for these two clearing
agencies of approximately 10%. Applying estimated cost of equity to the lower bound of
additional equity required under the proposed rule suggests an annual cost of $16 million, while
applying this cost to the upper bound of additional equity needed suggests an annual cost of $50
million. 747 These estimates are subject to a number of caveats. In particular, this exercise does

and the Theory of Investment, 48 Am. Econ. Rev. 261 (1958) (showing the irrelevance of capital
structure in perfect markets).
746

See Eugene F. Fama & Kenneth R. French, The Cross-Section of Expected Stock
Returns, 47 J. Fin. 427 (1992). For CME, the Commission used monthly return data from
January 2003 to December 2012, and for ICE, from December 2005 to December 2012.
The Commission calculated this data using Daily/Monthly U.S. Stock Files © 2012
Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP), The University of Chicago Booth School of
Business, and Thomson Reuters Datastream.
747

The Commission based this estimate on the 2012 financial statements for DTC, CME,
FICC, ICE, NSCC, and OCC. To ensure comparability, the Commission estimated leverage
ratios for each of these clearing agencies by adjusting assets for clearing and guaranty funds and
dividing by shareholders’ equity. While DTC, NSCC, FICC, ICE, and CME all have estimated
leverage ratios of between 1 and 2, the Commission computed a higher leverage ratio of 5 for
OCC. As a result, the Commission computed OCC’s cost of capital by first “unlevering” CME’s
estimated beta of 1.14 using 2012 financial statement information to arrive at an unlevered beta

not take into account the possibility that equity finance may reduce the cost of equity due to the
resulting decrease in leverage, 748 or that clearing agencies might simultaneously raise equity
while reducing liabilities. Both of these possibilities would likely reduce the cost to covered
clearing agencies of increased equity capital. Finally, this analysis presumes that covered
clearing agencies will choose to comply with the requirements in proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(15)(iii) at the lower bound of six months’ operating expenses.
Clearing agencies that issue equity in order to satisfy the new requirements would
additionally face costs related to issuance. The Commission preliminarily recognizes that the
cost of maintaining additional equity resembles an insurance premium against the losses
associated by market disruption in the absence of clearing services.
xi. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16): Custody and Investment
Risks
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16) requires a covered clearing agency to have policies and
procedures reasonably designed to safeguard both their own assets as well as the assets of
participants, broadening the requirement applicable to registered clearing agencies in Rule 17Ad22(d)(3) to the protection of participants’ assets.

of 0.87 and levering this using OCC’s 2012 financial statement information to arrive at a levered
beta of 3.36. Finally, the Commission applied the current Fama-French monthly risk premium at
a 10-year horizon, annualized, and added the current 10 year risk-free rate to arrive at a levered
cost of equity of approximately 26% for OCC.
748

See e.g., Anat R. Admati, Peter M. DeMarzo, Martin F. Hellwig & Paul Pfleiderer,
Fallacies, Irrelevant Facts, and Myths in the Discussion of Capital Regulation: Why Bank Equity
is Not Expensive (Working Paper, Mar. 23, 2011), available at
http://www.coll.mpg.de/pdf_dat/2010_42online.pdf (addressing the statement that “[i]ncreased
bank equity requirements increase the funding costs for banks because they must use more
equity, which has a higher required return”).

378

The Commission preliminarily believes that this may have benefits in terms of protecting
against systemic risk, to the extent that covered clearing agencies to this point have treated their
own assets differently by applying greater safeguards to those assets than with respect to assets
of their members and members’ clients. Protection of member assets is important to cleared
markets because, for example, the assets of a member in default serve as margin and represent
liquidity supplies that a covered clearing agency may access to cover losses. If covered clearing
agencies can quickly access these liquidity sources, they may be able to limit losses to nondefaulting members.
Participants may benefit from proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(16) in other ways. Requiring a
covered clearing agency’s policies and procedures to safeguard its assets and participant assets
and to invest in assets with minimal credit, liquidity, and market risk may reduce uncertainty in
the value of participant assets and participants’ exposure to mutualized losses. This may allow
participants to deploy their own capital more efficiently. Furthermore, easy access to their own
capital enables members to more freely terminate their participation in covered clearing
agencies.
Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission preliminarily believes that current
practices at covered clearing agencies meet the requirements under proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(16) in most cases, so the additional costs and benefits flowing from these requirements
would be generally limited to registered clearing agencies that may enter the set of covered
clearing agencies in the future.

379

xii. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17): Operational Risk
Management
Because, as noted above, proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17) would require substantially the
same set of policies and procedures as Rule 17Ad-22(d)(4), 749 the Commission preliminarily
believes that proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(17) would likely impose limited material additional
costs on covered clearing agencies and produce limited benefits, in line with the general
economic considerations discussed in Part IV.C.1.
xiii. Proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(18) through (20): Membership
Requirements, Tiered Participation, and Linkages
As discussed earlier, covered clearing agencies play an important role in the markets they
serve. They often enjoy a central place in financial networks that enables risk sharing, but may
also enable them to serve as conduits for the transmission of risk throughout the financial system.
Proposed Rules (18) through (20) require covered clearing agencies to have policies and
procedures reasonably designed to explicitly consider and manage the risks associated with the
particular characteristics of their network of direct members, the broader community of
customers, and other parties that rely on the services provided by the covered clearing agencies
or other partners that the covered clearing agency is connected to through relevant linkages. The
Commission preliminarily believes that these efforts carry benefits insofar as they reduce the
extent to which covered clearing agencies may impose negative externalities on financial
markets.
As economies of scale contribute to the business dynamics of clearing and settlement,
there is often only one clearing agency or a small number of clearing agencies for a particular
749

See supra Part II.B.14 (discussing the full set of requirements under proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(17)); see also 17 CFR 240.17Ad-22(d)(4).

380

class of security. Consequently, membership in a clearing agency may influence competitive
dynamics between members and indirect participants, such as intermediaries, in cleared markets.
Members and indirect participants may compete for the same set of customers, but indirect
participants must have relationships with members to access clearing services. Members,
therefore, may have incentives in place to extract economic rents from indirect participants by
imposing higher fees or restricting access to clearing services.
Permitting fair and open access to clearing agencies and their services may promote
competition among market participants and may result in lower costs and efficient clearing and
settlement services. Open access to clearing agencies may reduce the likelihood that credit and
liquidity risk become concentrated among a small number of clearing members, each of which
retain a large number of indirect participants through tiered arrangements. Further, links
between clearing agencies may facilitate risk management across multiple security classes and
improve the efficiency of collateral arrangements.
(1) Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(18): Member
Requirements
While fair and open access to clearing agencies may promote competition and enhance
the efficiency of clearing and settlement services, these improvements should not come at the
expense of prudent risk management. The soundness of clearing members contributes directly to
the soundness of a clearing agency and mutualization of losses within clearing agencies expose
each clearing member to the default risk of every other clearing member. Accordingly, it is
important for clearing agencies to control and effectively manage the risks to which they are
exposed by their direct and indirect participants by establishing risk-related requirements for
participation.

381

Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission preliminarily believes that current
practices among most covered clearing agencies involve a mix of objective financial and
business requirements stipulated in publicly-available rulebooks and discretion exercised by the
covered clearing agency. As a result and based on its supervisory experience, the Commission
preliminarily believes that some changes to policies and procedures at covered clearing agencies
may be required under the proposed rule.
(2) Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19): Tiered Participation
Arrangements
The Commission preliminarily believes that proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(19) may improve
covered clearing agencies’ ability to manage its exposure to market participants that are not
clearing members, but access payment, clearing, or settlement facilities through their
relationships with clearing members. A covered clearing agency that is able to effectively
manage its exposure to its members but fails to identify, monitor, and manage its exposures to
non-member firms may overlook dependencies that are critical to the stability of cleared markets.
This is particularly true if indirect participants in the covered clearing agency are large and might
potentially precipitate the default of one or more direct members.
The data necessary to compute summary statistics that would be helpful in quantifying
the costs and benefits of the proposed rule, including those that would indicate the size of
indirect participants and the volume of transactions in which they are involved, are not available.
Nevertheless, the Commission is sensitive to the fact that costs associated with the proposed
rules may result in concentration of clearing services among fewer clearing members. Part of
this process of consolidation may mean an increase in the volume of trading activity that
involves indirect members, making identification of risks associated with indirect members even
more critical. Based on its supervisory experience, however, the Commission preliminarily
382

believes that certain covered clearing agencies already have policies and procedures in place that
would satisfy the requirements of the proposed rule even in the absence of such explicit
requirements under existing rules. Costs and benefits from the proposed rule would come from
those other registered clearing agencies that require updates to their policies and procedures to
come into compliance with the proposed rule.
The Commission is sensitive to the fact that indirect participants play a key role in
maintaining competition in markets for intermediation of trading in securities insofar as they
offer investors a broader choice of intermediaries to deal with in centrally cleared and settled
securities markets. If elements of policies and procedures under this rule make indirect
participation marginally more costly, then transactions costs for investors may increase.
(3) Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20): Links
Links between clearing agencies and their members are only one way that clearing
agencies interface with the financial system. A clearing agency may also establish links with
other clearing agencies and FMUs through a set of contractual and operational arrangements.
For a clearing agency, the primary purpose of establishing a link would be to expand its clearing
and settlement services to additional financial instruments, markets, and institutions. Established
links among clearing agencies and FMUs may enable direct and indirect market participants to
have access to a broader spectrum of clearing and settlement services.
Sound linkages between clearing agencies that provide CCP services may also provide
their customers with more efficient collateral arrangements and cross-margining benefits. Crossmargining potentially relaxes liquidity constraints in the financial system by reducing total
required margin collateral. Resources that would otherwise be posted as margin may be
allocated to more productive investment opportunities.

383

A clearing agency that establishes a link or multiple links may also impose costs on
participants in markets it clears by indirectly exposing them to systemic risk from linked entities.
The Commission acknowledges that clearing agencies that form linkages may be exposed to
additional risks, including credit and liquidity risks, as a consequence of these links. Links may,
however, produce benefits for members to the extent that diversification and hedging across their
combined portfolio reduces their margin requirements. At the same time, because such an
agreement requires the linked clearing agencies to each guarantee cross-margining participants’
obligations to the other clearing agency, cross-margining potentially exposes members of one
clearing agency to default risk from members of the other.
By requiring that covered clearing agencies have policies and procedures reasonably
designed to identify, monitor, and manage risks related to any link, proposed Rule 17Ad22(e)(20), like Rule 17Ad-22(d)(7), reduces the likelihood that such links serve as channels for
systemic risk transmission. Because proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20) differs only marginally from
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(7), the Commission preliminarily believes that the costs and benefits flowing
from the proposed rule will be incremental, to the extent that the additional specificity in
proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(20) causes covered clearing agencies to modify current practices.
The Commission has aggregated these costs below.
xiv. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21): Efficiency and
Effectiveness
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(21) would impose on covered clearing agencies requirements
in addition to those currently applied to registered clearing agencies under Rule 17Ad-22(d)(6)
by also requiring covered clearing agencies to have policies and procedures that ensure that a
covered clearing agency’s management review efficiency and effectiveness in four key areas:

384

•

Efficiency and effectiveness in clearing and settlement arrangements may reduce
participants’ transaction costs and enhance liquidity by reducing the amount of
collateral that customers must provide for transactions and the opportunity cost
associated with providing such collateral. Where appropriate, net settlement
arrangements can reduce collateral requirements. Similarly, clearing arrangements
that include a broad scope of products enable clearing members to take advantage
of netting efficiencies across positions.

•

Efficient and effective operating structures, including risk management policies,
procedures, and systems, may reduce the likelihood of failures that may lead to
impairment of a clearing agency’s capacity to complete settlement and interfering
with its ability to monitor and manage credit exposures.

•

An efficient scope of products that a clearing agency clears, settles, or records
may provide its participants and customers with more efficient collateral
arrangements and cross-margining benefits that ultimately reduce transaction
costs and improve liquidity in cleared markets.

•

Efficient and effective use of technology and communication procedures
facilitates effective payment, clearing and settlement, and recordkeeping.

The Commission preliminarily believes that requirements related to efficient operation of
covered clearing agencies are appropriate given the market power enjoyed by these entities, as
discussed in Part IV.C.1.d. Limited competition in the market for clearing services may blunt
incentives for covered clearing agencies to cost effectively provide high quality services to
market participants in the absence of regulation.

385

Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission preliminarily believes that some
covered clearing agencies would be required to make updates to their policies and procedures as
a result of the proposed rule. As a result, the Commission expects incremental costs and benefits
to flow from the proposed rule only to the extent that this additional specificity causes covered
clearing agencies to modify current practices.
xv. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22): Communication Procedures
and Standards
Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission preliminarily believes that some
changes to policies and procedures would be necessary to meet requirements under proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22). 750 These costs are included as a part of implementation costs, as discussed
below. However, the Commission understands that covered clearing agencies already
accommodate internationally accepted communication procedures and standards and
preliminarily anticipates only incremental costs resulting from the proposed rule, in addition to
the above discussed benefits. Registered clearing agencies that may enter into the set of covered
clearing agencies in the future may need to conform their practices to internationally accepted
communication procedures and standards, as well as adopt new policies and procedures as a
result of the proposed rule, resulting in more substantial costs.
xvi. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23): Disclosure of Rules, Key
Procedures, and Market Data
Enhanced disclosure may also improve the efficiency of transactions in cleared products
and improve financial stability more generally by improving the ability of members of covered
clearing agencies to manage risks and assess costs. Additional information would reduce the
750

See supra Parts II.B.19 and VII(discussing the requirements for communication
procedures and standards under Rule 17Ad-22(e)(22) and providing the rule text, respectively).

386

potential for uncertainty on the part of clearing members regarding their obligations to covered
clearing agencies. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) requires a covered clearing agency to
establish, implement, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to require specific disclosures. As in Rules 17Ad-22(d)(9) and (11), covered clearing agencies
would be required under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23) to disclose default procedures to the
public and disclose sufficient information to participants to allow them to manage the risks, fees,
and other material costs associated with membership.
Under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23), a covered clearing agency must establish,
implement, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to update,
on a biannual basis, public disclosures that describe the covered clearing agency’s market and
activities, along with information about the agency’s legal, governance, risk management, and
operating frameworks, including specifically covering material changes since the last disclosure,
a general background on the covered clearing agency, a rule-by-rule summary of compliance
with proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(1) through (22), and an executive summary. The proposed rule
adds a new requirement, relative to existing requirements for registered clearing agencies under
Rule 17Ad-22(d)(9), to update the disclosure biannually and to include, among other things,
specific data elements, including details about system design and operations, transaction values
and volumes, average intraday exposure to participants, and statistics on operational reliability.
Additional transparency may have benefits for participants and cleared markets more
generally. For example, if information about the systems that support a covered clearing agency
is public, investors may be more certain that the market served by this agency is less prone to
disruption and more accommodating of trade. Furthermore, public disclosure of detailed
operating data may facilitate evaluation of each covered clearing agency’s operating record by

387

market participants. Further, under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(23)(iv), these disclosures would
be made about specific categories that potentially facilitate comparisons between covered
clearing agencies. Additional availability of information on operations may increase the
likelihood that clearing agencies compete to win market share from participants that value
operational stability. This additional market discipline may provide additional incentives for
covered clearing agencies to maintain reliability. Finally, updating the public disclosure every
two years or more frequently following certain changes as required pursuant to proposed Rule
17Ad-22(e)(23)(v) would support the benefits of enhanced public disclosures by ensuring that
information provided to the public remains up-to-date. The Commission preliminarily believes
this would reduce the likelihood that market participants are forced to evaluate covered clearing
agencies on the basis of stale data.
Clearing members, in particular, may benefit from additional disclosure of risk
management and governance arrangements. These details potentially have significant bearing on
clearing members’ risk management because they may remove uncertainty surrounding
members’ potential obligations to a covered clearing agency. In certain circumstances,
additional disclosures may reveal to members that the expected costs of membership exceed the
expected benefits of membership, and that exit from the clearing agency may be privately
optimal. In addition to the costs of concentration among members discussed in earlier sections,
the Commission also recognizes the potential for systemic benefits from termination. Member
exit on the basis of more precise information may reduce the risk posed to other financial market
participants by members who, given additional information, might prefer to terminate their
membership, due to an inability to manage the risks to which a covered clearing agency exposes
them. While exit from clearing agencies may have consequences for competition among

388

clearing members, the Commission preliminarily believes that encouraging the participation of
firms that are not able to bear the risks of membership is not an appropriate means of mitigating
the effects of market power on participants in cleared markets.
Based on its supervisory experience, the Commission preliminarily believes that some
covered clearing agencies will require changes to policies and procedures as a result of the
proposed rules. Compliance costs associated with changes to policies and procedures, biannual
review and disclosure of additional data are included in implementation costs, below.
b. Proposed Rule 17Ab2-2
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) would subject covered clearing agencies to requirements that
are in many instances more specific than requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(d) and in some cases
produce new obligations to establish, implement, maintain and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to test, report, and disclose key elements of a covered clearing
agency’s performance, risk management, and operations.
Proposed Rule 17Ab2-2 provides procedures for the Commission to determine on its own
initiative, or upon voluntary application by a registered clearing agency, whether a registered
clearing agency is a covered clearing agency and therefore is subject to proposed Rule 17Ad22(e). It also provides procedures for the Commission to determine whether a covered clearing
agency is systemically important in multiple jurisdictions or has a complex risk profile and
therefore should be subject to stricter risk management standards under proposed Rule 17Ad22(e).
Proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(a) provides procedures for the Commission to determine
whether a registered clearing agency that is otherwise not a designated clearing agency or a
complex risk profile clearing agency is a covered clearing agency on the basis of the products it
clears or other characteristics the Commission may deem appropriate under the circumstances.
389

While the Commission preliminarily believes the current scope of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) is
appropriate, 751 proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(a) would provide the Commission with latitude in
adjusting the scope of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) in response to financial innovation and
changing economic circumstances. Proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(a) contemplates voluntary
application of registered clearing agencies to become covered clearing agencies.
Proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(b) includes criteria the Commission may consider in determining
whether a covered clearing agency is systemically important in multiple jurisdictions. Two of
these criteria are based on input from a set of other bodies comprised of FSOC and regulators in
other jurisdictions. As a result, it is possible that the flow of costs and benefits from proposed
Rule 17Ad-22(e) may be partially determined by the decisions of other regulatory bodies.
Proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(c), by contrast, suggests characteristics of the financial products
that a clearing agency clears as a basis upon which the Commission may determine that a
clearing agency’s activity has a complex risk profile.
The impact of proposed rules that determine the application of enhanced requirements
could have direct costs on registered clearing agencies in the form of legal or consulting costs
incurred as a result of seeking a determination from the Commission. In instances where these
clearing agencies choose to apply to the Commission for status as a covered clearing agency
under proposed Rule 17Ab2-2(a), the Commission preliminarily believes that a registered
clearing agency’s voluntary application would suggest that the applicant’s private benefits from
regulation under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) justify its costs.
Quantifiable costs related to determinations under proposed Rule a17Ab2-2 are noted in
751

See supra Part IV.C.3.a (discussing the appropriateness of the proposed scope of Rule
17Ad-22(e)).

390

Part IV.C.3.d.
Indirect effects of the determination process may have important economic effects on the
ultimate volume of clearing activity, beyond the economic effects of the proposed requirements
themselves. An important feature of proposed Rule 17Ab2-2 is providing transparency for the
determinations process. On one hand, transparency may allow clearing agencies to plan for new
obligations under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e); on the other, transparency may allow clearing
agencies to restructure their business to avoid falling within the scope of proposed Rule 17Ad22(e).
To the extent that proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e), if adopted as proposed, may increase costs
relative to their peers for covered clearing agencies, clearing agencies whose activities have a
more complex risk profile, and clearing agencies systemically important in multiple jurisdictions,
clearing agencies may have incentives to restructure their businesses strategically to avoid these
Commission determinations or otherwise exit any services made prohibitively expensive by such
determinations. Such potential consequential effects would be among the considerations for the
Commission to review in connection with any specific decision under proposed Rule 17Ab2-2.
Restructuring may involve spinning off business lines into separate entities, limiting the scope of
clearing activities to certain markets, or limiting the scale of clearing activities within a single
market. 752
Any one of these responses could result in inefficiencies. As suggested in Part IV.C.2.b,
registered clearing agencies may incur costs as a result of attempts to restructure. Clearing
agencies that break up along product lines or fail to consolidate when consolidation is efficient
752

See Exchange Act Release No. 34-63107 (Oct. 14, 2010), 75 FR 65881, 65919 & n.206
(Oct. 26, 2010).

391

may fail to take advantage of economies of scope and result in inefficient use of collateral. 753
Similarly, clearing agencies that limit their scale may provide lower levels of clearing services to
the markets that they serve.
c. Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(f)
Proposed Rule 17Ad-22(f) includes a provision that specifies Commission authority over
designated clearing agencies for which it is the supervisory agency. Since this provision codifies
existing statutory authority, the Commission does not anticipate any economic effects from this
proposed rule.
d. Quantifiable Costs and Benefits
As discussed above, the proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and proposed Rule
17Ab2-2 would impose certain costs on covered clearing agencies. As discussed in Part
IV.C.3.a.ii, if a covered clearing agency is required to recruit new directors, the Commission
preliminarily estimates a cost per director of $73,000. 754 As discussed in Part IV.C.3.a.iv(4), the
Commission preliminarily estimates costs associated with liquidity resources under proposed
Rules 17Ad-22(e)(7) and (a)(15) would likely fall between $133 million and $225 million per
year across all covered clearing agencies. As discussed in Part IV.C.3.a.iv(5), the Commission
preliminarily believes that startup costs related to financial risk management systems for existing
covered clearing agencies, related to new testing and model validation requirements to be
between $5 million to $25 million. The Commission also estimates a lower bound on ongoing
costs related to these requirements of $1 million per year. If covered clearing agencies were to
753

See, e.g., Darrell Duffie & Haoxiang Zhu, Does a Central Clearing Counterparty Reduce
Counterparty Risk?, 1 Rev. Asset Pricing Stud. 74 (2011) (addressing potential inefficiencies
resulting from fragmented clearing along product lines).
754

See supra note 705.

392

hire external consultants for the purposes of performing model validation required under
proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(4) and (7) through policies and procedures, the Commission
preliminarily estimates the ongoing cost associated with hiring such consultants would be about
$4,388,160 in the aggregate. 755 As discussed in Part IV.C.3.a.x, the Commission expects
quantifiable economic costs as a result of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15) to be between $16
million and $50 million per year across covered clearing agencies.
In addition, proposed Rules 17Ad-22(e)(3), (4), (6), (7), (15) and (21) all include
elements of review by either a covered clearing agency’s board or its management on an ongoing
basis. The Commission preliminarily estimates the cost of ongoing review for these proposed
rules at approximately $39,312 per year. 756 The proposed rules would also impose certain
implementation burdens and related costs on covered clearing agencies. 757 These costs generally
755

See supra Part IV.C.3.a.iv(5), in particular note 734.

756

To monetize the cost of board review, the Commission used a recent report by
Bloomberg stating that the average director works 250 hours and earns $251,000, resulting in an
estimated $1000 per hour for board review. As a proxy for the cost of management review, the
Commission is estimating $457 per hour, based upon the Director of Compliance cost data from
the SIFMA table, see infra note 778. The Commission estimates the total cost of review for each
clearing agency as follows: ((Board Review for 32 hours at $1000 per hour) + (Management
Review for 16 hours at $457 per hour)) = $39,312. The Commission requests comment on this
estimate.
757

To monetize the internal costs the Commission staff used data from the SIFMA
publications, Management and Professional Earnings in the Security Industry—2012, and Office
Salaries in the Securities Industry—2012, modified by the Commission staff to account for an
1800 hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35 (professionals) or 2.93 (office) to account for
bonuses, firm size, employee benefits and overhead. Commission staff also estimated an hourly
rate for a Chief Financial Officer. The website www.salary.com reports that median CFO annual
salaries in 2012 were $307,554. A Grant Thornton LLP survey estimated that in 2012 public
company CFOs received an average annual salary of $286,500. Using an approximate midpoint
of these two estimates of $300,000 per year, and dividing by an 1800-hour work year and
multiplying by the 5.35 factor which normally is used to include benefits but here is used as an
approximation to offset the fact that New York salaries are typically higher than the rest of the
country, the result is $892 per hour. The Commission requests comment on this estimate.
393

include assessment costs to determine compliance with the proposed rules and costs related to
new policies and procedures and updates to existing policies and procedures required by the
proposed rules. In Part III, the Commission estimated the burdens of these implementation
requirements for covered clearing agencies.
For a new entrant into the set of covered clearing agencies from the set of registered
clearing agencies, the Commission preliminarily estimates the startup compliance costs
associated with policies and procedures to be $592,215, 758 and compliance costs associated with
the determinations process under proposed Rule 17Ab2-2 to be $9,148. 759 Based on its
supervisory experience, the Commission preliminarily believes that in many cases registered
clearing agencies are already in compliance with many of the requirements included in the
proposed rules, so this cost represents an upper bound on upfront costs. Conditioned on its
current understanding of current market practice at covered clearing agencies, the Commission
preliminarily estimates that the total costs across all existing covered clearing agencies will be
$4,032,720. 760 The Commission preliminarily estimates that in the aggregate existing covered
758

The total initial cost for an entrant that is not a CSD and does engage in activities with a
more complex risk profile was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 428 hours
at $467 per hour) + (Compliance Attorney for 365 hours at $310 per hour) + (Administrative
Assistant for 2 hours at $72 per hour) + (Computer Operations Department Manager for 300
hours at $361 per hour) + (Senior Business Analyst for 85 hours at $245 per hour) + (Senior Risk
Management Specialist for 114 hours at $249 per hour) + (Chief Compliance Office for 102
hours at $441 per hour) + (Senior Programmer for 53 hours at $282 per hour) + (Chief Financial
Officer for 50 hours at $892 per hour) + (Financial Analyst for 70 hours at $245 per hour)) =
$592,215.

759

The total cost associated with determinations under proposed Rule 17Ab2-2 was
calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 2 hours at $467 per hour) + (Compliance
Attorney for 4 hours at $310 per hour) + (Outside Counsel for 6 hours at $400 per hour)) x 2
registered clearing agencies = $9,148.

760

The total initial cost was calculated as follows: ((Assistant General Counsel for 2,906
hours at $467 per hour) + (Compliance Attorney for 2,475 hours at $310 per hour) +
394

clearing agencies would be subject to ongoing costs associated with the proposed rule in the
amount of approximately $801,980 per year. 761
A benefit of the proposed rules that the Commission is able to quantify is the impact of
QCCP status of OCC to non-U.S. bank clearing members at OCC. This benefit comes as a result
of lower capital requirements against exposures to QCCPs relative to non-qualifying CCPs. In
Part IV.C.1.e, the Commission provided an estimate of the upper bound of this benefit, $600
million per year, or 0.60% of the aggregate 2012 net income reported by bank clearing members
at OCC. The Commission preliminarily believes that the actual benefits flowing from QCCP
status would likely be higher due to benefits for foreign bank members of FICC and ICEEU, in
addition to the benefits with respect to OCC discussed above. 762
The Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed rules will result in an increase
in financial stability insofar as they result in minimum standards at covered clearing agencies
that are higher than those standards implied by current practices at covered clearing agencies.
Some of this increased stability may come as a result of lower activity as the proposed rules
cause participants to internalize a greater proportion of the costs that their activity imposes on the

(Administrative Assistant for 14 hours at $72 per hour) + (Computer Operations Department
Manager for 2,030 hours at $361 per hour) + (Senior Business Analyst for 565 hours at $245 per
hour) + (Senior Risk Management Specialist for 773 hours at $249 per hour) + (Chief
Compliance Office for 699 hours at $441 per hour) + (Senior Programmer for 361 hours at $282
per hour) + (Chief Financial Officer for 350 hours at $892 per hour) + (Financial Analyst for 490
hours at $245 per hour) + (Intermediate Accountant for 15 hours at $155 per hour)) =
$4,032,720.
761

The total ongoing cost was calculated as follows: ((Compliance Attorney for 1,851 hours
at $310 per hour) + (Administrative Assistant for 137 hours at $72 per hour) + (Senior Business
Analyst for 151 hours at $245 per hour) + (Senior Risk Management Specialist for 70 hours at
$249 per hour) + (Risk Management Specialist for 1,251 hours at $131 per hour)) = $801,980.
762

See supra note 686 and accompanying text.

395

financial system, reducing the costs of default, conditional on a default event occurring.
Increased stability may also come as a result of higher risk management standards at covered
clearing agencies that effectively lower the probability that either covered clearing agencies or
their members default.
The Commission preliminarily believes that clearance and settlement of securities and
security-based swaps is fundamental to the stability of financial markets. As discussed above,
clearing agencies may not fully consider the costs they could impose on financial market
participants. 763 As a result of the potential negative externalities associated with their activities,
enhanced risk management standards are particularly important for those clearing agencies that
pose the greatest risk to financial markets and the U.S. financial system.
D. Request for Comments
The Commission generally requests comment about its preliminary analysis of the
economic effects of the proposed rules and any qualitative and quantitative data that would
facilitate an evaluation and assessment of the economic effects of this proposal. In addition, the
Commission requests comment on the following specific issues:
•

Has the Commission appropriately identified the relevant costs and benefits associated
with each requirement under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)? Why or why not?

763

See Duffie, Li & Lubke, supra note 563 (noting that the failure of a CCP could suddenly
expose many major market participants to losses); see also Cecchetti, Gyntelberg & Hollanders,
supra note 19 (“[A] CCP concentrates counterparty and operational risks and the responsibilities
for risk management. Therefore it is critical that CCPs have both effective risk control and
adequate financial resources.”); supra note 278 and accompanying text (asserting that delays and
breakdowns in the payments and clearance process and the perception that the clearing system
might not be able to meet obligations may have contributed to price declines during the October
20, 1987 market crash).

396

• Are there any provisions of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) for which the costs of enhanced
risk management standards appear inappropriate relative to the benefits of such standards,
particularly given existing requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(d)? Please explain.
•

Would particular provisions of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) improve or diminish
competition between covered clearing agencies? Which provisions are likely to have
such effects and through what transmission channels?

•

Would the scope of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) have implications for competition
between covered clearing agencies and registered clearing agencies that are not covered
clearing agencies?

•

Would particular provisions of proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) improve or diminish
competition between members of covered clearing agencies? Are there any provisions
that would allow a subset of members to compete on better terms than other members?

•

How would the effects of QCCP status will be allocated across members? Can market
participants provide any qualitative or quantitative data to help the Commission evaluate
the effects of QCCP status on clearing members and any heterogeneity in trade exposures
and default fund exposures to covered clearing agencies across bank and non-bank
clearing members?

•

Would bank clearing members to be constrained by the Basel III capital requirements?
Do bank clearing members typically target tier one or total capital ratios as a business
practice?

•

In areas where existing requirements under Rule 17Ad-22(d) could be viewed as being
consistent with the PFMI, and so could potentially earn QCCP status for covered clearing
agencies, do the costs of additional requirements under proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e) appear
397

appropriate relative to benefits of these requirements, aside from QCCP status? Please
explain.
•

Does the Commission’s proposed definition of qualifying liquid resources adequately
reflect the ability with which covered clearing agency assets may be used to meet funding
obligations? Has the Commission adequately assessed the costs and benefits of requiring
funding arrangements before considering non-cash resources “qualifying”?

•

What would be the potential costs and benefits of requiring covered clearing agencies to
hold liquid net assets in accordance with proposed Rule 17Ad-22(e)(15)? Can you
provide qualitative and quantitative data to aid the Commission in evaluating these
potential costs and benefits?

•

Has the Commission adequately assessed the risks posed by indirect participation at
covered clearing agencies? Can you provide qualitative and quantitative data to aid the
Commission in evaluating the level of indirect participation in cleared markets, the
heterogeneity of indirect participation across clearing members and the implications for
networks of exposures in cleared markets?

V. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”) requires the Commission, in promulgating rules,
to consider the impact of those rules on small entities. 764 Section 603(a) of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 765 as amended by the RFA, generally requires the Commission to undertake a
regulatory flexibility analysis of all proposed rules to determine the impact of such rulemaking

764

See 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.

765

5 U.S.C. 603(a).

398

on “small entities.” 766 Section 605(b) of the RFA states that this requirement shall not apply to
any proposed rule which, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities. 767
A. Registered Clearing Agencies
The proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and proposed Rule 17Ab2-2 would apply to
covered clearing agencies, which would include registered clearing agencies that are designated
clearing agencies, complex risk profile clearing agencies, or clearing agencies that otherwise
have been determined to be covered clearing agencies by the Commission. For the purposes of
Commission rulemaking and as applicable to the proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and
proposed Rule 17Ab2-2, a small entity includes, when used with reference to a clearing agency,
a clearing agency that (i) compared, cleared, and settled less than $500 million in securities
transactions during the preceding fiscal year, (ii) had less than $200 million of funds and
securities in its custody or control at all times during the preceding fiscal year (or at any time that
it has been in business, if shorter), and (iii) is not affiliated with any person (other than a natural
person) that is not a small business or small organization. 768
Based on the Commission’s existing information about the clearing agencies currently
registered with the Commission,769 the Commission preliminarily believes that such entities

766

Section 601(b) of the RFA permits agencies to formulate their own definitions of “small
entities.” See 5 U.S.C. 601(b). The Commission has adopted definitions for the term “small
entity” for the purposes of rulemaking in accordance with the RFA. These definitions, as
relevant to this proposed rulemaking, are set forth in Rule 0-10, 17 CFR 240.0-10.
767

See 5 U.S.C. 605(b).

768

See 17 CFR 240.0-10(d).

In 2012, DTCC processed $1.6 quadrillion in financial transactions, subsidiary DTC
settled $110.3 trillion of securities and held securities valued at $37.2 trillion, subsidiary NSCC
399

exceed the thresholds defining “small entities” set out above. While other clearing agencies may
emerge and seek to register as clearing agencies, the Commission preliminarily does not believe
that any such entities would be “small entities” as defined in Exchange Act Rule 0-10. 770 In any
case, clearing agencies can only become subject to the new requirements under proposed Rule
17Ad-22(e) should they meet the definition of a covered clearing agency, as described above.
Accordingly, the Commission preliminarily believes that any such registered clearing agencies
will exceed the thresholds for “small entities” set forth in Exchange Act Rule 0-10.
B. Certification
For the reasons described above, the Commission certifies that the proposed amendments
to Rule 17Ad-22 and proposed Rule 17Ab2-2 would not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities for purposes of the RFA. The Commission requests
processed an average daily value of $742.7 billion in equity securities, subsidiary FICC cleared
$1.116 quadrillion in government securities, and FICC’s Mortgage-Backed Securities Division
cleared $104 trillion of transactions in agency mortgage-backed securities. See DTCC, 2012
Annual Report, available at http://www.dtcc.com/about/annual-report.aspx and
http://www.dtcc.com/annuals/2012/br-settlement-and-asset-services.html; FSOC, 2013 Annual
Report, supra note 39, at 99.
In addition, OCC cleared more than 4 billion contracts and held margin of $78.8 billion at
the end of 2012. See OCC, 2012 Annual Report, available at
http://www.optionsclearing.com/components/docs/about/annualreports/occ_2012_annual_report.pdf. CME Group had total contract volume of 2.89 billion
contracts (in round turn trades) with a total notional value of $806 trillion. See CME Group,
2012 Annual Report, available at
http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/CME/2635449816x0x653543/02DB7C7F-ACF0-4D739AD7-1ACCEF68559A/CME_Group_2012_Annual_Report.pdf. ICE and ICEEU together
cleared CDS with a total notional value of $10.24 trillion. See Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.,
2012 Annual Report, available at
http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/ICE/2623237906x0x649669/DFB49A9C-152C-4287848C-7CCDDA42D61E/ICE_2012_Annual_Report_FINAL.pdf.
770

See 17 CFR 240.0-10(d). The Commission based this determination on its review of
public sources of financial information about registered clearing agencies and lifecycle event
service providers for OTC derivatives.

comment regarding this certification. The Commission requests that commenters describe the
nature of any impact on small entities, including clearing agencies and counterparties to security
and security-based swap transactions, and provide empirical data to support the extent of the
impact.
VI. Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act
Under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, 771 a rule is
considered “major” where, if adopted, it results or is likely to result in (i) an annual effect on the
economy of $100 million or more (either in the form of an increase or a decrease); (ii) a major
increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries; or (iii) significant adverse
effect on competition, investment, or innovation. The Commission requests comment on the
potential impact of the proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-22 and proposed Rule 17Ab2-2 on
the economy on an annual basis, any potential increase in costs or prices for consumers or
individual industries, and any potential effect on competition, investment, or innovation.
Commenters are requested to provide empirical data and other factual support for their views to
the extent possible.
VII. Statutory Authority and Text of Amended Rule 17Ad-22 and Proposed Rule 17Ab2-2
Pursuant to the Exchange Act, particularly Section 17A thereof, 15 U.S.C. 78q-1, and
Section 805 of the Clearing Supervision Act, 12 U.S.C. 5464, the Commission proposes to
amend Rule 17Ad-22 and proposes new Rule 17Ab2-2.

3. Section 240.17Ab2-2 is added to read as follows:
§ 240.17Ab2-2 Determinations affecting covered clearing agencies.
(a) The Commission may, if it deems appropriate, upon application by any clearing
agency or member of a clearing agency, or on its own initiative, determine whether a registered
clearing agency should be considered a covered clearing agency. In determining whether a
clearing agency should be considered a covered clearing agency, the Commission may consider:
(1) Characteristics such as the clearing of financial instruments that are characterized by
discrete jump-to-default price changes or that are highly correlated with potential participant
defaults; or
(2) Such other characteristics as it deems appropriate in the circumstances.

421

(b) The Commission may, if it deems appropriate, upon application by any clearing
agency or member of a clearing agency, or on its own initiative, determine whether a covered
clearing agency is systemically important in multiple jurisdictions. In determining whether a
covered clearing agency is systemically important in multiple jurisdictions, the Commission may
consider:
(1) Whether the covered clearing agency is a designated clearing agency;
(2) Whether the clearing agency has been determined to be systemically important by one
or more jurisdictions other than the United States through a process that includes consideration
of whether the foreseeable effects of a failure or disruption of the designated clearing agency
could threaten the stability of each relevant jurisdiction’s financial system; or
(3) Such other factors as it may deem appropriate in the circumstances.
(c) The Commission may, if it deems appropriate, determine whether any of the activities
of a clearing agency providing central counterparty services, in addition to clearing agencies
registered with the Commission for the purpose of clearing security-based swaps, have a more
complex risk profile. In determining whether a clearing agency’s activity has a more complex
risk profile, the Commission may consider:
(1) Characteristics such as the clearing of financial instruments that are characterized by
discrete jump-to-default price changes or that are highly correlated with potential participant
defaults; or
(2) Such other characteristics as it deems appropriate in the circumstances, as factors
supporting a finding of a more complex risk profile.
(d) The Commission shall publish notice of its intention to consider making a
determination under paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, together with a brief statement of

422

the grounds under consideration therefor, and provide at least a 30-day public comment period
prior to any such determination, giving all interested persons an opportunity to submit written
data, views, and arguments concerning such proposed determination. The Commission may
provide the clearing agency subject to the proposed determination opportunity for hearing
regarding the proposed determination.
(e) Notice of determinations under paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section shall be given
by prompt publication thereof, together with a statement of written reasons therefor.
(f) For purposes of this rule, the terms central counterparty, covered clearing
agency, designated clearing agency, and systemically important in multiple jurisdictions shall
have the meanings set forth in § 240.17Ad-22(a).

By the Commission.
