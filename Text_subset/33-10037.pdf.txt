Respondents.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate ceaseand-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act
of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange
Act”) against Monsanto Company (“Monsanto”), Sara M. Brunnquell, Anthony P. Hartke, and
Jonathan W. Nienas; and that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted
against Brunnquell and Hartke pursuant to Exchange Act Section 4C and Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) of
the Commission’s Rules of Practice.
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondents have submitted Offers
of Settlement (the “Offers”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the

findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of
these proceedings, which are admitted, Respondents consent to the entry of this Order, as set
forth below.
III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offers, the Commission finds1 that:
SUMMARY
1.
Monsanto is an agricultural seed and chemical company that manufactures and
sells glyphosate, a herbicide, under the trade name “Roundup.” During fiscal years 2009, 2010,
and 2011,2 Monsanto improperly accounted for millions of dollars of rebates offered to Roundup
distributors and retailers in the U.S. and Canada to incent them to purchase Roundup. Monsanto
also improperly accounted for rebate payments to Roundup customers in Canada, France, and
Germany as selling, general, and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) rather than rebates, which
boosted Roundup gross profit in those countries. Monsanto did not have sufficient internal
accounting controls to identify and properly account for rebate payments promised to customers.
2.
As a result, Monsanto materially misstated its consolidated earnings, and its
revenues and earnings for its Roundup business lines,3 in its periodic reports filed with the
Commission for fiscal years 2009, 2010, and 2011.4 As a result of the improper accounting,
Monsanto met consensus earnings-per-share analyst estimates for fiscal year 2009.
3.
On November 14, 2011, Monsanto restated its 2009 and 2010 annual reports on
Form 10-K and its 2011 quarterly reports on Form 10-Q (collectively “the Restatement”).
4.
As a result of the conduct described herein, Monsanto violated Securities Act
Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3), the reporting provisions of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules
12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13, the books and records provisions of Exchange Act Section
13(b)(2)(A), and the internal accounting control provisions of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(B).
5.
Sara M. Brunnquell, Monsanto’s External Reporting Lead, Anthony P. Hartke, a
U.S. Business Analyst at Monsanto, and Jonathan W. Nienas, Monsanto’s former U.S. Strategic
Account Lead, caused Monsanto to violate Securities Act Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3),
Exchange Act Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A), and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13.
These individuals also violated Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and Nienas violated Exchange Act
Section 13(b)(5).

1

The findings herein are made pursuant to the Respondents’ Offers of Settlement and are not binding on
any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.
2

Monsanto’s fiscal year runs from September 1 to August 31.

3

Monsanto’s periodic filings report the results of its Roundup business as part of the Agricultural
Productivity segment.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
10.
The accounting standard governing Monsanto’s rebate programs is set forth in
Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 01-9, “Accounting for Consideration Given by a
Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products),” codified as ASC 60550.5 Specifically, Issue 6 of EITF 01-9 (ASC 605-50-25-7) requires a vendor like Monsanto to
recognize a rebate obligation as a reduction of revenue based on a systematic or rational
allocation of the cost of honoring the rebate offer to each underlying transaction that results in
progress by the customer towards earning the rebate. Issue 4 of EITF 01-9 (ASC 605-50-25-3)
requires a vendor to recognize the cost of certain sales incentives at the later of the date at which
the related revenue is recognized or the date at which the sales incentive is offered.
11.
Issue 1 of EITF 01-9 (ASC 605-50-45-1) addresses the circumstances in which a
vendor may record payments to customers as a cost or expense (e.g., under the SG&A
accounting classification) rather than as a reduction of revenue. EITF 01-9 (ASC 605-50-45-1)
requires a vendor like Monsanto to recognize payments to customers to perform services on its
behalf (and which provide an identifiable benefit to the vendor) as a reduction of revenue for the
amount of the payments that exceeds the estimated fair value of the services rendered. If the
services provided by customers do not provide a benefit to the vendor, it should recognize the
total amount as a reduction of revenue.

5

EITF 01-9 was the applicable accounting guidance during Monsanto’s fiscal year 2009 and was codified
into the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) within ASC 605-50 for fiscal years 2010 and 2011.

FACTS
Monsanto Loses Roundup Market Share to Generic Producers in Fiscal Year 2009
12.
Roundup historically was one of Monsanto’s most profitable products, and the
company sells it to both retailers and distributors.6 After the patent expired in 2000, competition
from generic glyphosate producers began to erode Monsanto’s profit margins. By fiscal year
2009, generic competitors were undercutting Monsanto’s prices in the U.S. and Canada by more
than 70%. Monsanto was losing share in these markets as customers – concerned that they could
not profitably sell high-priced Roundup – shifted their purchases to generic brands. By the end
of fiscal year 2009, Monsanto had lost more than half of its share of the glyphosate market
(dropping from 55% market share to less than 25%).
13.
Monsanto faced significant glyphosate price competition in fiscal year 2009.
Instead of lowering Roundup prices in the U.S., the company rolled out several price protection
programs in the second and third fiscal quarters to address customers’ concerns about the
relatively high price of Roundup. Customers believed that Monsanto would soon lower
Roundup prices and were concerned that their high-priced Roundup inventories would be
unprofitable. The price protection programs were intended to persuade customers to purchase
more Roundup. By the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, Monsanto was well short of its annual
gross profit goals for Roundup in the U.S., and many of its retailers held significant volumes of
Roundup purchased at uncompetitive price levels.
The 2010 U.S. Loyalty Bonus Program
14.
To address the channel inventory problem for retailers while still meeting
Monsanto’s earnings goals for fiscal year 2009, Monsanto’s marketing group began developing a
sales incentive program to provide rebates to customers to lower their inventory costs while
encouraging them to purchase Roundup in fiscal year 2009.
15.
In late May 2009, Monsanto’s sales force began telling retailers in the U.S. that, if
they “maximized” their Roundup purchases during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009,
Monsanto would allow them to participate in a loyalty program to be released in the first quarter
of fiscal year 2010. The sales force told retailers that this program, officially known as the 2010
U.S. Loyalty Bonus Program (“LBP”), would make their inventories profitable despite
anticipated Roundup price cuts. In making these communications to retailers, Monsanto’s sales
force used talking points on the LBP that Tony Hartke, an accountant working in the Roundup
Division, had helped to develop and that Sara Brunnquell, the company’s External Reporting
Lead at that time, had approved.
16.
Telling retailers about the LBP incented them to purchase Roundup in the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2009, despite the fact that generic alternatives were significantly less
expensive at the time. Customers purchased approximately 8.7 million Roundup Equivalent

Monsanto does not sell Roundup directly to growers.

Gallons (“REGs”)7 in the fourth quarter, which represented approximately 33% of the Roundup
that Monsanto sold in the U.S. in fiscal year 2009.
17.
Monsanto did not officially release the written details of the LBP in the U.S. until
August 20 and September 10, 2009.8 Under the LBP, if retailers achieved a 2010 sales target,
they would be entitled to a rebate for each REG of Roundup held in their inventory at the end of
fiscal year 2009. The amount of the rebate was equal to the difference between the price retailers
paid for Roundup in fiscal year 2009 and the new fiscal year 2010 prices, which Monsanto
released in late August and early September 2009. The Roundup prices released at the beginning
of fiscal year 2010 were approximately 50% lower than they had been in fiscal year 2009. The
program documents for the LBP required retailers to complete certain activities in order to
receive payments under the program (hereinafter “the LBP Requirements”). For example, the
LBP required retailers to fill their tanks with Roundup in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 and
to make Roundup their lead recommendation to growers.
18.
Monsanto prepaid the LBP rebates to retailers in the second quarter of fiscal year
2010, well before they met their volume targets, if retailers had made “substantial progress”
toward completing the LBP Requirements. These payments totaled approximately $194 million.
The program included a clawback mechanism by which Monsanto could recover any rebates
from retailers that missed their annual volume targets by August 31, 2010. Nevertheless, in May
2010, Monsanto announced that it was waiving the LBP Requirements and would not clawback
any unearned payments under the LBP.
19.
Monsanto improperly accounted for the LBP under EITF 01-9 (Issue 4) by
recognizing the related revenue reductions in fiscal year 2010 and ignoring the fact that the
company used the program to incent sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009.
20.
Hartke helped to prepare the program documents and obtain approval for the
LBP, and Brunnquell approved the improper accounting methodology for the program. In
justifying this accounting treatment, Brunnquell indicated to the company’s outside auditor that
the company had not communicated the LBP to customers until August 20, 2009. That
statement influenced the auditor’s conclusion that the LBP did not incent more than a de minimis
amount of sales during fiscal year 2009, which ended on August 31, 2009.
21.
Brunnquell and Hartke knew or should have known that Monsanto’s sales force
had used the LBP to incent retailers to purchase material amounts of Roundup in the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2009 and that EITF 01-9 (Issue 4) required Monsanto to record the portion
of LBP costs related to those sales in fiscal year 2009.9
7

The Roundup Equivalent Gallon is a benchmark to compare glyphosate products that have different
concentration levels.
8

Monsanto released a version of the LBP for a small customer base of its lowest quality of Roundup on
August 20, 2009, and then it released another version of the LBP for the bulk of its Roundup products on September
10, 2009. The two different versions of the LBP were virtually identical.
9

In the Restatement, Monsanto treated the LBP as a five quarter program starting in the fourth quarter of
fiscal year 2009 and, allocating the program costs based on actual and estimated sales, recognized $24 million in
additional rebate costs during fiscal year 2009.

5

The 2010 Earnback Program
22.
In fiscal year 2009, Monsanto offered distributors a rebate on their total purchases
of Roundup if they met agreed-upon volume targets. Monsanto offered these rebates pursuant to
separate agreements with each distributor called Long Term Agreements (“LTAs”). LTAs
generally contained a three-tiered volume target that allowed distributors to earn a progressively
larger rebate percentage as their volume of purchases increased. Distributors generally needed
the LTA rebates in order to sell Roundup profitably.
23.
Throughout fiscal year 2009, Monsanto accrued substantial amounts pursuant to
EITF 01-9 (Issue 6) to allocate LTA rebates to the underlying revenue transactions reflecting the
distributors’ progress toward earning the LTA rebates. It planned to recognize the rebates as a
reduction in Roundup revenue generated in fiscal year 2009 consistent with a systematic and
rational allocation required by GAAP.
24.
In the last few months of fiscal year 2009, Monsanto reversed approximately
$57.3 million of these accruals because seven customers did not achieve their LTA targets and
did not qualify for the LTA rebates. The accrual reversal boosted Monsanto’s reported revenues
and gross profit reported on a consolidated and segment basis for fiscal year 2009.
25.
Monsanto created the “2010 Earnback Program” to allow the seven distributors to
“earn back” their LTA rebates in fiscal year 2010. On paper, the program required these
distributors to meet fiscal year 2010 volume targets and to complete a series of activities, such as
promoting Roundup to retailers. As with the LBP, Monsanto made prepayments to several of
these distributors in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 (December 2009), which were subject
to clawback if the customers failed to meet their volume targets by the end of that fiscal year. As
with the LBP, Monsanto later waived the Earnback Program requirements in May 2010,
including its right to clawback the prepayments.
26.
In fiscal year 2009, Monsanto’s second largest customer, Customer A, had a
three-tiered LTA target, with minimum and maximum targets of 5.0 million and 5.7 million
REGs. The minimum rebate percentage was 6.5% and the maximum percentage was 10.5%.
Customer A was approximately 200,000 REGs short of meeting its minimum LTA target (5.0
million REGs) in August 2009, and it had submitted orders for enough additional REGs to meet
the top-tier target (5.7 million REGs) and earn the 10.5% rebate.
27.
On August 10, 2009, Jon Nienas10 offered Customer A the opportunity to be paid
an amount calculated with the maximum LTA rebate percentage of 10.5%, if it agreed to
purchase less than the minimum target of 5.0 million REGs. As recorded in the
contemporaneous notes of the Customer A negotiator, Nienas asked Customer A to “not trigger
[the] LTA” and indicated that “4,980[,000 REGs] will pay [the] LTA in full [at] 10.5%” with
“[p]ayment by end of calendar year.” He asked Customer A to hold its pending orders for
Roundup to “appear as if [it] didn't make” its minimum LTA volume target for fiscal year 2009.
He told Customer A that the 10.5% rebate payment would be tied to “activities” but that it should

Division.

easily achieve them.
28.
Customer A accepted Monsanto’s offer and earned the top-tier LTA rebate of
10.5%, for a total payment of $20.2 million, while missing its minimum LTA target by less than
100,000 REGs. This rebate was paid under the Earnback Program.
29.
Monsanto prepaid the Earnback payment to Customer A in the second quarter of
fiscal year 2010. At the time of payment, Nienas sent a confirmation letter to Customer A
stating that it had earned the payment (even though it had not met any fiscal year 2010 volume
targets under the Earnback Program). The purpose of the confirmation letter was to enable
Customer A to record the payment in its fiscal year 2009. Nienas knew that as of the date of the
confirmation letter Customer A had not yet met any fiscal year 2010 volume targets under the
Earnback Program.
30.
Similarly, at the end of fiscal year 2009, Monsanto’s largest Roundup customer,
Customer B, was approximately 621,000 REGs from its minimum LTA target and about 2.5
million REGs from its maximum target. To achieve its maximum LTA rebate, Customer B
requested, and Monsanto initially agreed, to a “bill and hold” transaction,11 because Customer B
lacked the capacity to store the volume of Roundup needed to qualify for the maximum LTA
rebate. During the last week of the fiscal year, Nienas informed Customer B that the transaction
would not be necessary. Nienas said that Monsanto would pay Customer B its LTA rebate using
the maximum percentage rate of 9.1% (resulting in a rebate of $24.3 million).
31.
Customer B asked for a written confirmation of Monsanto’s commitment to pay
the maximum LTA rebate. Upon learning of the request, Nienas told Hartke that Monsanto had
agreed to pay Customer B at its maximum LTA rebate rate. Hartke informed Nienas that the
confirmation was not in accordance with the company’s delegation of authority policy, but did
not take further action to ensure that the payment was properly recorded.
32.
On October 7, 2009, Customer B provided a draft confirmation letter to Nienas.
Nienas executed the letter the following day promising that Monsanto would pay Customer B the
maximum LTA rebate rate on fiscal year 2009 purchases of Roundup. The rebate totaled $24.3
million, and Monsanto later paid it in December 2009 under the Earnback Program.
33.
Monsanto relied upon the failures of Customers A and B to meet their minimum
LTA volume targets as the basis for reversing LTA accruals in the fourth quarter of fiscal year
2009. Hartke participated in recording the reversal of these accruals. The oral and written side
agreements to pay Customers A and B their 2009 LTA rebates created rebate obligations for
Monsanto in fiscal year 2009 and contradicted the basis for reversing the accruals, which Nienas
and Hartke should have known. Monsanto improperly increased its fiscal year 2009 revenues
and gross profits by approximately $44.5 million when it deferred recording these liabilities until

they remain with the vendor for a certain period of time.

fiscal year 2010.12
The 2011 Earnback Program
34.
The next year, Monsanto offered a second iteration of the Earnback Program for
fiscal year 2011 to Customer B and its third-largest Roundup distributor, Customer C. Both
companies missed their 2010 LTA targets, but received their maximum LTA rebates in the form
of Earnback payments in fiscal year 2011 (December 2010). Monsanto reversed fiscal year 2010
LTA accruals for these customers, which increased its reported revenues and gross profits on a
consolidated and segment basis for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010.
35.
As with the 2010 Earnback Program, Monsanto prepaid the 2011 Earnback
rebates to Customers B and C more than eight months before the program was scheduled to end.
Although the 2011 Earnback program obligated the distributors to perform certain activities and
to purchase Roundup in the future, Nienas provided confirmations to Customers B and C, at the
time of prepayment, stating that they had met all program requirements necessary to earn the
payments. Nienas knew that the customers had not met the requirements of the 2011 Earnback
Program in December 2010 when he signed the confirmations. The 2011 Earnback payments to
Customers B and C totaled approximately $48 million.
36.
The manner in which Monsanto administered the previous Earnback Program in
2010 – by using side agreements with the customers and subsequently waiving the clawback
provisions – demonstrated that Monsanto also lacked the intent to enforce the terms of the 2011
Earnback Program. By the end of fiscal year 2010, competitive pressures in the Roundup
business also made it highly unlikely that Monsanto would deny LTA payments to large
distributors that relied upon the LTA payments to sell Roundup profitably (as they would likely
shift their glyphosate purchases to generic manufacturers if Monsanto actually withheld their
LTA payments). In these circumstances, all $48 million of the rebate costs for the “2011”
Earnback Program should have been recorded in fiscal year 2010, as Monsanto lacked an
appropriate basis under ASC 605-50 to recognize any of these costs to fiscal year 2011.13
The 2010 Loyalty Bonus Program in Canada
37.
Low-priced generic glyphosate had the same effect in Canada in early 2009 as it
had in the U.S., and Monsanto responded similarly by announcing a price protection program in
April 2009 without actually lowering prices. The program was called the Price Risk Protection
Program (“PRPP”), and it covered Roundup purchased in Canada through the end of calendar
year 2009 (spanning fiscal years 2009 and part of 2010) that remained in a customer’s inventory
at the time of any price decrease that year.
38.
When Monsanto lowered U.S. prices in September 2009, it did not immediately
follow suit in Canada because the PRPP would have triggered significant payment obligations
12

In the Restatement, Monsanto recognized the costs of the 2010 Earnback Program over fiscal years 2009
and 2010, based upon actual and projected sales volume. Monsanto recorded approximately $20 million in
Earnback rebates in fiscal year 2009 and approximately $41 million in fiscal year 2010.
13

In its Restatement, Monsanto recorded the $48 million as a reduction of revenue in fiscal year 2010.

8

that year. Under EITF 01-9 and ASC 605-50-25-1, Monsanto would have been required to
accrue for payment obligations under the PRPP if it expected to lower prices in 2009. Monsanto
represented to its auditor that it did not intend to lower Roundup prices in Canada during
calendar year 2009 (the term of the PRPP). Before the end of fiscal year 2009, Monsanto began
planning to cancel the PRPP so it could lower Canadian prices without triggering the accrual
obligation. Monsanto, however, could not cancel the PRPP unilaterally – it needed customers to
surrender their rights under the program as they had relied on the PRPP in purchasing Roundup
during fiscal year 2009. Monsanto thus offered them an inducement to cancel the PRPP.
Specifically, Monsanto’s sales and marketing employees promised customers that, if they signed
cancellation forms, it would pay them amounts equivalent to the amounts payable under the
PRPP through a sales incentive program similar to the U.S. LBP (hereinafter “the LBP Canada”).
Customers responsible for purchasing approximately 89% of the Roundup that Monsanto sold in
Canada agreed to the program switch and executed written cancellation forms in late September
2009.
39.
Shortly thereafter, Monsanto’s External Reporting Lead, Sara Brunnquell, asked
the company’s auditor what the effect of cancelling the PRPP would be, without disclosing that
certain customers had already signed the cancellation forms. The lead client service partner for
the audit firm told Brunnquell that there could be accounting consequences in fiscal year 2009,
because presumably Monsanto would have to pay customers consideration for their agreement to
cancel the PRPP. After this discussion with the company’s auditor, she decided to treat the
cancellations as being ineffective for accounting purposes. Brunnquell later made written
representations to the auditor that the PRPP was still in effect several weeks after certain
customers had signed the cancellation forms.
40.
Monsanto rolled out the LBP Canada to customers in late September 2009 and
began paying rebates under the program in January 2010. Monsanto calculated these rebates by
multiplying the number of gallons in each customer’s ending inventory as of September 9, 2009
by the difference between the prices customers originally paid for Roundup and the new prices
that Monsanto expected to release in January 2010.
41.
Monsanto improperly recorded approximately $43 million in rebates under the
LBP Canada as a reduction of revenue in fiscal year 2010. Brunnquell approved this accounting
treatment, even though she knew or should have known that customers had signed the PRPP
cancellations and that Monsanto had offered the LBP Canada to induce them to do so. She
should have known that EITF 01-9 and ASC 605-50-25 required Monsanto to record the rebate
obligations under the LBP Canada as a reduction in revenue during fiscal year 2009.14
The 2010 SG&A Program in Canada
42.
When Monsanto eventually lowered Roundup prices in Canada in January 2010,
it had to lower them further than it had originally planned when it released the LBP Canada. The
reason was that the price of competitors’ glyphosate had fallen further than Monsanto had
expected. But lowering Roundup prices by an additional increment meant that the fixed rebates
under the LBP Canada were insufficient to make the Roundup volumes held by customers
14

Monsanto did not address the LBP Canada in its Restatement.

9

competitive. To bridge this unexpected gap, Monsanto offered and paid a second round of
rebates to Canadian customers through a program it called the “LBP2.”
43.
In early March 2010, executives at Monsanto approved the LBP2, which was
budgeted to rebate customers approximately $18 million. Monsanto planned to account for the
LBP2 as a reduction in revenue which would have decreased its net sales and gross profits in
Canada. Monsanto began paying the LBP2 rebates to customers by issuing them credits on
account or, in some cases, checks.
44.
In April 2010, Monsanto’s executives, with assistance from Brunnquell, decided
to convert the LBP2 from a rebate program to a program where the payments would be recorded
as SG&A expenses. Certain expenses related to SG&A programs, in which a vendor pays its
customers to perform marketing services on its behalf, are not recorded as reductions of revenue
and therefore do not affect gross profit.
45.
Monsanto’s employees in Canada created program documents that detailed
certain marketing services that customers were supposed to perform for Monsanto. They
internally set the value of the services at approximately $18 million, with a pre-determined
amount for each customer that exactly equaled the rebates that the approved LBP2 had already
paid them.
46.
Monsanto obtained a fair value estimate of the services from an independent
marketing company, and it showed the services were worth approximately $6 million. Monsanto
did not use the estimate and instead its employees created an internal cost estimate to set the
amount at approximately $18 million. There is no evidence that the internal cost estimate
accurately reflected the fair value of the services.
47.
To obtain payments under the SG&A program, customers had to certify that they
performed the marketing services described in the program documents. Customers signed the
certifications, but there is no other evidence that they performed these marketing services for
Monsanto.
48.
To account for the SG&A payments, Monsanto reversed the LBP2 rebate credits
on customer accounts and then re-posted these same amounts to the customer accounts as SG&A
payments consistent with the amounts in the unsupported internal cost estimate.
49.
In the end, the SG&A program in Canada cost approximately $14 million, and not
$18 million, because one customer refused to sign the program certification.15 Monsanto
improperly accounted for these program costs as SG&A expenses in fiscal year 2010.
Brunnquell approved the accounting treatment, even though she should have known that the
payments were rebates and that Monsanto did not receive an identifiable benefit from the
customers under ASC 605-50-45-2. Monsanto was required to record these rebate payments as a

At the time, Monsanto nevertheless paid the rebate to the customer and recorded the payment as a

The 2010 SG&A Programs in France and Germany
50.
In France and Germany, Monsanto’s customers had large inventories of Roundup
bought at the high fiscal year 2009 prices that they could not profitably sell in fiscal year 2010.
Without some form of rebate, these customers were unlikely to purchase more Roundup.
51.
Monsanto decided to make payments to customers in France and Germany
through an SG&A program.17 Monsanto’s employees drafted a program in which customers
received $5 for each liter of Roundup that they sold from inventory. The program’s budget was
$24 million for France and $8.5 million for Germany. Customers were supposed to treat 25% of
the payments as compensation for providing marketing services to Monsanto. Monsanto
expected customers to use the other 75% of the money for “price supports,” which were
essentially rebates.
52.
Monsanto offered the same SG&A program in Germany in fiscal year 2011
(approximately $10 million).
53.
There is no evidence that customers performed any marketing services on
Monsanto’s behalf.
54.
Monsanto improperly accounted for the payments in France and Germany as
SG&A expenses. Monsanto knew or should have known that it did not receive an identifiable
benefit from the customers under ASC 605-50-45-2. Therefore, it was required to record these
rebate costs as a reduction of revenue in the fiscal years in which the payments were made (i.e.,
2010 and 2011).18
Monsanto Offered Securities During the Relevant Time Period
55.
Monsanto offered securities in fiscal years 2009, 2010, and 2011 pursuant to a
Form S-8 that it originally filed on January 21, 2005. The Form S-8 incorporated by reference
all subsequent periodic filings under the Exchange Act for securities sold under this registration
statement. Thus, it incorporated Monsanto’s Forms 10-K for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 and its
Forms 10-Q for fiscal year 2011.
56.
Monsanto also filed a Form S-3ASR (automatic shelf registration) on October 31,
2008, which incorporated by reference subsequent periodic filings under the Exchange
Act. When Monsanto filed a Form 424B2 prospectus supplement on April 13, 2011, it
incorporated by reference the company’s Form 10-K for fiscal year 2010.

16

In its Restatement, Monsanto recorded the payments under this program as a reduction of revenue in
fiscal year 2010 and not as SG&A.
17

Monsanto could not use a rebate program like the U.S. LBP because of concerns that it might violate
antitrust laws in the European Union.
18

Monsanto’s Restatement did not address the programs in France or Germany.

MONSANTO’S REMEDIAL EFFORTS
In determining to accept Monsanto’s Offer, the Commission considered remedial acts
undertaken by Monsanto and cooperation afforded the Commission staff in connection with its
investigation.
IV.
Respondent Monsanto has undertaken to:
A.

Retain, at Monsanto’s expense within 30 days of issuance of this Order, a qualified
independent ethics and compliance consultant (the “Consultant”) with extensive
experience in developing, implementing and overseeing organizational compliance and
ethics programs, not unacceptable to the staff, to conduct an ethics and compliance
program assessment of Monsanto’s Crop Protection business focused on the components
of the program delineated in (1)-(2) below. The Consultant shall also have expertise in,
or retain someone with expertise in, internal accounting controls and public company
financial reporting as well as vendor rebate and market funding programs. Taking into
account the Company’s remedial actions to date, Monsanto shall cause the Consultant to
analyze whether the components of Monsanto’s ethics and compliance program for its
Crop Protection business as they relate to the areas described in (1)-(2) below have been
implemented successfully and are having the desired effects. The Consultant will
determine whether the culture is supportive of ethical and compliant conduct, including
strong, explicit, and visible support and commitment by the Board and senior
management. In discharging this undertaking, the Consultant shall:
1.

evaluate and assess the effectiveness of the internal accounting controls and
financial reporting policies and procedures with respect to Monsanto’s rebate and
market funding programs for its Crop Protection business, including but not
limited to:

19

This use of the word “willfully” does not reflect a finding that Respondent acted with the intent to violate
the law or knowledge that she was doing so. A willful violation of the securities laws means “‘that the person
charged with the duty knows what he is doing.’” Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting
Hughes v. SEC, 174 F.2d 969, 977 (D.C. Cir. 1949)). There is no requirement that the actor “‘also be aware that he
is violating one of the Rules or Acts.’” Id. (quoting Gearhart & Otis, Inc. v. SEC, 348 F.2d 798, 803 (D.C. Cir.
1965)).
20

See fn. 19, supra.

13

2.

a.

whether Monsanto’s internal accounting controls with respect to
Monsanto’s rebate and market funding programs for its Crop Protection
business are sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that the
company is maintaining fair and accurate books, records and accounts,
with particular emphasis on whether they are designed to address the
integrity of its revenue accounting and ensure consistent accuracy and
integrity given the global nature of Monsanto’s business; and

b.

whether Monsanto has specific accounting and financial reporting
controls and procedures sufficient to ensure that all rebate and/or market
funding programs for its Crop Protection business comply with
applicable accounting rules and policies.

evaluate whether there are proper resources, oversight and independence of the
compliance and ethics function for the Crop Protection business, including
seniority of corporate executives responsible for implementation and oversight,
reporting lines, autonomy and independence, compensation and rewards,
consistent discipline, resources, and access to information and personnel. The
review shall consider the sufficiency of training and guidance overall as well as
specifically related to anti-retaliation and whistleblowing policies.

B.

Provide the Consultant with complete access and resources to review key documents
(e.g., business principles, Code of Conduct, policies and procedures, risk assessments,
performance evaluation forms, relevant internal training materials and internal
communications). In reviewing the creation, administration and implementation of the
compliance and ethics program as it relates to the areas addressed in paragraph A, the
Consultant shall conduct an assessment survey and interview relevant personnel. The
assessment need not be a comprehensive review of all business lines, activities and
markets, but may use a risk-based approach. The Consultant shall consider, however, the
breakdown of internal controls in multiple markets in which the Crop Protection business
operated during the relevant time period of this action;

C.

Provide a report to Commission staff and Monsanto’s General Counsel and Chief Ethics
and Compliance Officer, as described below, regarding the Consultant’s findings and
recommendations;

D.

Provide a copy of the engagement letter detailing the Consultant’s responsibilities to
Brian O. Quinn, Assistant Director, Division of Enforcement, U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549;

E.

Cooperate fully with the Consultant, including providing the Consultant with access to its
files, books, records and personnel as reasonably requested for the above-described
review except to the extent such files, books, or records are protected from disclosure by
any applicable protection or privilege such as the attorney-client privilege or the attorney
work product doctrine. To the extent that the Consultant believes that documents are
being withheld unreasonably, Monsanto shall work cooperatively with the Consultant to
resolve the matter, and if they are unable to reach agreement, the Consultant shall
14

promptly notify Commission staff. To ensure the independence of the Consultant,
Monsanto shall not have the authority to terminate the Consultant without prior written
approval of Commission staff and shall compensate the Consultant and persons engaged
to assist the Consultant for services rendered pursuant to this Order at their reasonable
and customary rates;
F.

Require the Consultant to report to Commission staff on his/her activities as the staff
shall request;

G.

Permit the Consultant to engage such assistance, clerical, legal or expert, as necessary
and at reasonable cost, to carry out his/her activities, and the cost, if any, of such
assistance shall be borne exclusively by Monsanto;

H.

Require, within 120 days of the issuance of this Order (unless otherwise extended by
Commission staff for good cause), the Consultant to complete the review and report to
Commission staff and Monsanto’s General Counsel and Chief Ethics and Compliance
Officer concerning:

I.

1.

the scope and methodologies used by the Consultant in order to complete the
review;

2.

Monsanto’s compliance with the review;

3.

the adequacy of Monsanto’s existing policies, practices and procedures regarding
the matters assessed; and

4.

the Consultant’s recommendations, if necessary, regarding modification or
supplementation of Monsanto’s policies, practices and procedures related to the
matters assessed (the “Recommendations”).

Adopt and implement, within 120 days of Monsanto’s receipt of the Recommendations,
all of the Recommendations; provided, however, that as to any Recommendation that
Monsanto considers to be, in whole or in part, unduly burdensome or impractical,
Monsanto may submit in writing to the Consultant and Commission staff (at the address
set forth above), within 60 days of receiving the Recommendations, an alternative policy,
practice or procedure designed to achieve the same objective or purpose. Monsanto and
the Consultant shall then attempt in good faith to reach an agreement relating to each
Recommendation that Monsanto considers to be unduly burdensome or impractical and
the Consultant shall reasonably evaluate any alternative policy, practice or procedure
proposed by Monsanto. Such discussion and evaluation shall conclude within 90 days
after Monsanto’s receipt of the Recommendations, whether or not Monsanto and the
Consultant have reached an agreement. Within 14 days after the conclusion of the
discussion and evaluation by Monsanto and the Consultant, Monsanto shall require that
the Consultant inform Monsanto and Commission staff (at the address set forth above) of
his/her final determination concerning any Recommendation that Monsanto considers to
be unduly burdensome or impractical. Monsanto shall abide by the determinations of the
Consultant and, within 60 days after final agreement between Monsanto and the
15

Consultant or final determination by the Consultant, whichever occurs first, Monsanto
shall adopt and implement all of the Recommendations that the Consultant deems
appropriate;
J.

Require the Consultant to enter into an agreement that provides that, for the period of
engagement and for a period of two years from completion of the engagement, the
Consultant shall not enter into any employment, consultant, attorney-client, auditing or
other professional relationship with Monsanto or any of its present or former affiliates,
directors, officers, employees or agents acting in their capacity as such. The agreement
will also provide that the Consultant will require that any firm with which he/she is
affiliated or of which he/she is a member, and any person engaged to assist the
Consultant in the performance of his/her duties under this Order shall not, without the
prior written consent of Commission staff, enter into any employment, consultant,
attorney-client, auditing or other professional relationship with Monsanto, or any of its
present or former affiliates, directors, officers, employees or agents acting in their
capacity as such, for the period of the engagement and for a period of two years after the
engagement;

K.

Certify, in writing, compliance with the undertakings set forth above, including
implementation of all Recommendations. The certification shall identify the
undertakings, provide written evidence of compliance in the form of a narrative, and be
supported by exhibits sufficient to demonstrate compliance. The Commission staff may
make reasonable requests for further evidence of compliance, and Respondent agrees to
provide such evidence. The certification and supporting material shall be submitted to
Brian O. Quinn, with a copy to the Office of Chief Counsel of the Enforcement Division,
no later than sixty (60) days from the date of the completion of the undertakings.

Monsanto may apply to Commission staff for an extension of the deadlines described above
before their expiration, and upon a showing of good cause by Monsanto, Commission staff may,
in its sole discretion, grant such extensions for whatever time period it deems appropriate.
V.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondents’ Offers.
Accordingly, pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act, Section 21C of the Exchange
Act, and Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, it is hereby ORDERED,
effective immediately, that:
A.

Respondent Monsanto cease and desist from committing or causing any violations
and any future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act,
Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b20, 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder;

B.

Respondent Brunnquell cease and desist from committing or causing any
violations and any future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the
16

Securities Act, Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, and Rules
12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 13b2-1 thereunder; and
C.

Brunnquell is denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the
Commission as an accountant.

D.

After two years from the date of this Order, Brunnquell may request that the
Commission consider her reinstatement by submitting an application (attention:
Office of the Chief Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the
Commission as:

E.

1.

a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or
review, of any public company’s financial statements that are filed with
the Commission. Such an application must satisfy the Commission that
Brunnquell’s work in her practice before the Commission will be reviewed
either by the independent audit committee of the public company for
which she works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as she
practices before the Commission in this capacity; and/or

2.

an independent accountant. Such an application must satisfy the
Commission that:
a.

Brunnquell, or the public accounting firm with which she is
associated, is registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (“Board”) in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002, and such registration continues to be effective;

b.

Brunnquell, or the registered public accounting firm with which she
is associated, has been inspected by the Board and that inspection
did not identify any criticisms of or potential defects in the
respondent’s or the firm’s quality control system that would indicate
that the respondent will not receive appropriate supervision;

c.

Brunnquell has resolved all disciplinary issues with the Board, and
has complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions imposed
by the Board (other than reinstatement by the Commission); and

d.

Brunnquell acknowledges her responsibility, as long as she appears
or practices before the Commission as an independent accountant, to
comply with all requirements of the Commission and the Board,
including, but not limited to, all requirements relating to registration,
inspections, concurring partner reviews and quality control
standards.

The Commission will consider an application by Brunnquell to resume appearing
or practicing before the Commission provided that her state CPA license is
current and she has resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state
boards of accountancy. However, if state licensure is dependent on reinstatement
17

by the Commission, the Commission will consider an application on its other
merits. The Commission’s review may include consideration of, in addition to the
matters referenced above, any other matters relating to Brunnquell’s character,
integrity, professional conduct, or qualifications to appear or practice before the
Commission.
F.

Respondent Hartke cease and desist from committing or causing any violations
and any future violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act,

13a-11, 13a-13, and 13b2-1 thereunder; and

G.

Hartke is denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission
as an accountant.

H.

After one year from the date of this Order, Hartke may request that the
Commission consider his reinstatement by submitting an application (attention:
Office of the Chief Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the
Commission as:
1.

a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or
review, of any public company’s financial statements that are filed with
the Commission. Such an application must satisfy the Commission that
Hartke’s work in his practice before the Commission will be reviewed
either by the independent audit committee of the public company for
which he works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as he
practices before the Commission in this capacity; and/or

2.

an independent accountant. Such an application must satisfy the
Commission that:
a.

Hartke, or the public accounting firm with which he is associated, is
registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(“Board”) in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and
such registration continues to be effective;

b.

Hartke, or the registered public accounting firm with which he is
associated, has been inspected by the Board and that inspection did
not identify any criticisms of or potential defects in the respondent’s
or the firm’s quality control system that would indicate that the
respondent will not receive appropriate supervision;

c.

Hartke has resolved all disciplinary issues with the Board, and has
complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions imposed by
the Board (other than reinstatement by the Commission); and

d.

Hartke acknowledges his responsibility, as long as he appears or
practices before the Commission as an independent accountant, to
comply with all requirements of the Commission and the Board,
18

including, but not limited to, all requirements relating to registration,
inspections, concurring partner reviews and quality control
standards.
I.

The Commission will consider an application by Hartke to resume appearing or
practicing before the Commission provided that his state CPA license is current
and he has resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of
accountancy. However, if state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the

professional conduct, or qualifications to appear or practice before the
Commission.
