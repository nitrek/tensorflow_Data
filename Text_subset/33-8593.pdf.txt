The safe harbor provisions of Section 27A(c) of the Securities Act and Section 21E(c) of
the Exchange Act are not available for any forward looking statement that is “made with respect
to the business or operations of an issuer, if the issuer . . . during the 3-year period preceding the
date on which the statement was first made . . . has been made the subject of an . . .
administrative decree or order arising out of a governmental action that (I) prohibits future
violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws; (II) requires that the issuer
cease and desist from violating the antifraud provisions of the securities laws; or (III) determines
that the issuer violated the antifraud provisions of the securities laws[.]” Section 27A(b)(1)(A)(ii)
of the Securities Act and Section 21E(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Exchange Act. The disqualifications
may be waived “to the extent otherwise specifically provided by rule, regulation, or order of the
Commission.” Section 27A(b) of the Securities Act and Section 21E(b) of the Exchange Act.
Based on the representations set forth in CIBC’s request, the Commission has determined
that, under the circumstances, the request for a waiver of the disqualifications resulting from the
entry of the Order is appropriate and should be granted.
