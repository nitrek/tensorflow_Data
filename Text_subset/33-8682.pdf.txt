IN THE MATTER OF DAVID HENRY DISRAELI
AND LIFEPLAN ASSOCIATES, INC.
On May 5, 2006, the Commission entered an Order Instituting Administrative and Ceaseand-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections
15(b)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Sections 203(e), 203(f) and 203(k)
of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 against David Henry Disraeli (Disraeli) and
Lifeplan Associates, Inc. (Lifeplan).
The Division of Enforcement alleges, among other things, that Disraeli made various
false claims in SEC filings regarding his eligibility for SEC registration as an investment
adviser, that Disraeli and Lifeplan defrauded Disraeli’s advisory clients by making
various false claims during a stock offering by Lifeplan, that Disraeli failed to make
required disclosures to his advisory clients, and that Disraeli failed to maintain required
records regarding his investment advisory business.
A hearing will be scheduled before an Administrative Law Judge to determine whether
the allegations contained in the order are true, to provide Disraeli and Lifeplan an
opportunity to dispute the allegations, to determine whether Disraeli and Lifeplan should
be ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing future securities law
violations, to determine whether Disraeli should pay disgorgement, and to determine
what remedial sanctions against Disraeli, if any, are appropriate and in the public interest.
The Order requires the Administrative Law Judge to issue an initial decision no later than
300 days from the date of service of the Order, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2) of the
Commission’s Rules of Practice.
