AND FRED ALGER & COMPANY,
INCORPORATED,

NOTICE OF PROPOSED PLAN OF
DISTRIBUTION AND OPPORTUNITY
FOR COMMENT

Respondents.
Notice is hereby given, pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s
(“Commission”) Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1103, that the
Division of Enforcement has submitted to the Commission a proposed plan (“Distribution Plan”) for
the distribution of monies paid in the above-captioned matter.
On January 18, 2007, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative and
Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Ceaseand-Desist Order Pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
Sections 203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Sections 9(b) and 9(f) of
the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“Order”) against Fred Alger Management, Inc. and Fred
Alger & Company, Incorporated (collectively, “Respondents” or “Alger”) (Exchange Act Rel.
No. 55118). The Order stated that Respondents allowed market timing and late trading of
mutual funds in the Alger Fund Group (“Alger Fund”), which contradicted representations set
out in the Statement of Additional Information (“SAI”) attached to the Alger Fund’s prospectuses
that limited shareholders to six exchanges per year. Additionally, Alger failed to disclose that
Alger Inc. had entered into numerous arrangements with select investors, including “sticky asset”
arrangements, to permit them to time the Alger Fund portfolios. The Order required the
Respondents to pay $30,000,000 in disgorgement and $10,000,000 as a civil penalty for a total of
$40,000,000, and created a Fair Fund pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, as amended.
The Fair Fund has been deposited at the United States Department of the Treasury’s
Bureau of the Fiscal Service (“BFS”) for investment. Other than potential interest income from
the BFS investment, the Commission does not anticipate that the Fair Fund will receive
additional funds. The assets of the Fair Fund are subject to the continuing jurisdiction and
control of the Commission.

OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMENT

DISTRIBUTION PLAN
The Fair Fund is comprised of $40,000,000 in disgorgement and a civil penalty paid by
Respondents, plus any accumulated interest and less any federal, state, or local taxes and fees and
expenses. The Distribution Plan seeks to distribute to accountholders, in order of priority: (1) a
proportionate share of the Fair Fund as compensation for dilution losses they may have suffered
as a result of market timing and late trading during the period spanning September 12, 2001
through October 15, 2003, in the Alger Fund portfolios and (2) a proportionate share of advisory
fees paid by Alger Fund portfolios that suffered such losses during the period of such market
timing and late trading.
The Distribution Plan describes the procedures by which eligible accountholders are
identified, the procedures used to calculate the amounts to be paid, and how these amounts will
be distributed. Accordingly, eligible accountholders will not need to go through a claims
process.
By the Commission.
