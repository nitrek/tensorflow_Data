SECTION 3(b) OF THE SECURITIES ACT
OF 1933 AND REGULATION A
THEREUNDER, STATEMENT OF REASONS
FOR ENTRY OF ORDER, AND NOTICE OF
AND OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING

Med-X, Inc.,

Respondent.

I.
The public official files of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) show
that:
Med-X, Inc. (“Med-X”), a Nevada corporation with its principal office at 8236 Remmet
Avenue, Canoga Park, California, 91304, filed with the Commission on August 27, 2015, a Form
1-A: Tier 2 Regulation A Offering Statement under the Securities Act of 1933 (“Offering
Statement”). The Offering Statement was submitted to obtain an exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), as amended, pursuant to Section
3(b)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation A thereunder. The Offering Statement of $15 million
of common stock offered on a continuous basis was qualified by the staff pursuant to delegated
authority on November 3, 2015.
II.
The Commission has reason to believe, on the basis of information reported to it by its
staff, that:
A. Med-X failed to comply with a term, condition and requirement of Regulation A as
follows:
1. The Commission’s Notice of Qualification of Med-X’s Offering Statement was

issued on November 3, 2015.
2. Pursuant to Rule 257, an issuer whose offering statement has been qualified under
Tier 2 must file with the Commission an annual report on Form 1-K for the fiscal
year in which the offering statement became qualified and for any fiscal year
thereafter. 17 C.F.R. § 230.257(b)(1). Having been qualified on November 3,
2015, Med-X was required to file an annual report on Form 1-K for the fiscal year
2015.
3. Annual reports on Form 1-K must be filed within 120 calendar days after the end
of the fiscal year covered by the report. 17 C.F.R. § 239.91; General Instruction
A.(2) of Form 1-K. Med-X operates on a fiscal year ending December 31. As
such, Med-X was required to file its annual report on Form 1-K by April 30,
2016.
4. Med-X has not filed the required annual report on Form 1-K.
III.
IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Rule 258(a) of the General Rules and Regulations under the
Securities Act, that the exemption of Med-X under Regulation A be, and hereby is, temporarily
suspended.
NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that any person having an interest in this matter may, within
thirty calendar days after the entry of this Order, file with the Secretary of the Commission a written
request for a hearing; that within twenty days after the receipt of such request the Commission will,
or at any time upon its own motion the Commission may, set the matter for hearing at a place to be
designated by the Commission, for the purpose of determining whether this order should be vacated
or made permanent, without prejudice, however, to the presentation and consideration of additional
matters at the hearing; and that notice of the time and place of the hearing will be promptly given by
the Commission. If no hearing is requested and none is ordered by the Commission, this Order
shall become permanent on the thirtieth day after its entry, and will remain in effect unless and until
it is modified or vacated by the Commission.

By the Commission.

Secretary
