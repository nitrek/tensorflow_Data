OTHER RELEVANT ENTITIES AND INDIVIDUALS

1.
1st Global Financial, Inc. a Nevada corporation with its principal
place of business in Las Vegas, Nevada is purportedly in the real estate investment or

OTC Pink under the symbol “FGBF,” but its symbol changed to “PROD” on August 28,

C.

KICKBACK SCHEME

1.
These proceedings arise out of a fraudulent scheme in which insiders
of publicly-traded penny stock companies paid secret kickbacks to a purported corrupt
hedge fund manager, who was in fact an undercover agent with the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (“Fund Manager”), in exchange for the Fund Manager’s purchase of restricted
stock of the penny stock companies on behalf of his purported hedge fund (“the Fund”),
which did not actually exist.
2.
At some time prior to June 29, 2011, Black-White arranged for Reda to
meet with the Fund Manager to discuss funding for 1st Global.
3.
On or about June 29, 2011, Reda met with the Fund Manager (the
"June 29 Meeting"). The Fund Manager explained to Reda that he was prepared to invest Fund
monies of up to $5 million in 1st Global stock in exchange for a secret fifty percent kickback to
him, enabling the Fund Manager to keep for himself half of the money he was supposedly
investing on behalf of the Fund.
4.
At the June 29 Meeting, the Fund Manager also explained the
mechanics of the funding, informing Reda that while the Fund Manager could commit to an
investment of $5 million of the Fund's money, with $2.5 million being kicked back to the Fund

2

Manager, the Fund Manager did not want to invest the entire amount at once. Therefore, the
Fund Manager told Reda he would invest the money over time in tranches, or installments, of
increasing amounts.
5.
At the June 29 Meeting, the Fund Manager further discussed with Reda
the mechanics of how monies would be kicked back to the Fund Manager. The Fund Manager
arranged with Reda that 1st Global would execute a consulting agreement with a nominee
consulting company that the Fund Manager purportedly controlled, but that the Fund Manager
would not actually provide any consulting services. Reda was told that invoices would be
issued by the Fund Manager's nominee company to 1st Global in order to disguise the
kickbacks.
6.

At the June 29 Meeting, Reda agreed to the funding/kickback

arrangement.
7.
On various dates between June 30, 2011 and July 5, 2011, Reda sent
the Fund Manager documents related to the kickback transaction, including a consulting
agreement between 1st Global and the Fund Manager's nominee consulting company and stock
purchase agreements between 1st Global and the Fund.
8.
On or about July 5, 2011, in accordance with wiring instructions
provided by Reda, $32,000 was sent by wire transfer from a bank account maintained in
Massachusetts, purportedly belonging to the Fund, to a 1st Global corporate bank account
outside of Massachusetts. This wire transfer represented the first tranche of funding to 1st
Global.
9.
On or about July 5, 2011, Reda caused a stock certificate representing
the purchase by the Fund of 1st Global shares to be sent to the Fund Manager.
10.
On or about July 6, 2011, Reda caused a total of $16,000 to be sent by
wire transfer from a 1st Global corporate bank account outside of Massachusetts to a Citizens
bank account held in the name of the Fund Manager's nominee company in Massachusetts.
This wire transfer represented Reda's kickback to the Fund Manager from the first tranche of
funding to 1st Global.
