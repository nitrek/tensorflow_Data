On September 19, 2013, the Commission entered an order against JPMorgan Chase & Co.
(“JPMorgan”) finding that JPMorgan violated the federal securities laws when it made material
misstatements in filings with the Commission, failing to accurately disclose losses in the first
quarter of 2012 on a timely basis and failing to disclose that its disclosure controls and procedures
were ineffective. 1 Pursuant to the Order, the Commission imposed sanctions, including a ceaseand-desist order and requiring JPMorgan to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $200,000,000 to
the Commission. This payment was made on September 19, 2013.
On March 5, 2014, the Commission entered an order establishing a Fair Fund for the
purpose of distributing the civil penalty back to injured investors.2
The Division of Enforcement now seeks the appointment of RCB Fund Services, LLC
(“RCB”) as the fund plan administrator and requests that the administrator’s bond be set at
$200,000,000, as required by Rules 1105(a) and 1105(c) of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund
