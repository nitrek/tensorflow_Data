1.
Tigon (“Tigon”) filed a Form S-1 registration statement with the
Commission on February 2, 2015 and amended it on July 29, 2015, September 11,
2015, and October 7, 2015 (collectively the “Registration Statement”). The

On February 9, 2016, Tigon filed an application to withdraw the
Registration Statement pursuant to Rule 477 of Regulation C of the Commission’s
General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), 17
C.F.R. § 230.477.
3.
On October 19, 2015, the Commission issued an order pursuant to
Section 8(e) of the Securities Act authorizing the making of an examination to
determine whether a stop order should be issued against the Registration Statement
pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Securities Act.
4.
After considering Tigon’s application and the ongoing examination, the
Commission has determined that the granting of the withdrawal request is not
consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. Accordingly, it is
hereby:
ORDERED that Tigon’s application to withdraw its Registration Statement on
Form S-1 filed February 9, 2016, is denied in accordance with Rule 477.
By the Commission.
