In the Matter of

EXTENSION ORDER

The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has requested an extension of time, until
January 31, 2013, to submit a proposed Plan of Distribution under Rule 1101(a) of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans.
In its request, the Division states that since the issuance of the Commission’s May 1,
2012, Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings pursuant to Section
8A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order, the
Division has engaged in consultations with Commission staff in preparation of drafting a
proposed Plan of Distribution.

The Division requires additional time to continue its

consultations to develop a plan methodology and draft a proposed Plan of Distribution.
Additionally, the Division will require the assistance of a fund administrator for a potential
distribution to approximately 2,500 investors and will need time to take the necessary steps to
have a fund administrator appointed by the Commission.

Accordingly, for good cause shown, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Division’s
request for an extension of time until January 31, 2013, to submit a proposed Plan of
Distribution is granted.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Elizabeth M. Murphy
Secretary
