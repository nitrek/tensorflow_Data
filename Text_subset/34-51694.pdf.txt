I.
FACTS

1.
On May 20, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”)
issued an Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings,
and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and Cease-and-Desist Orders Pursuant to Sections 15(b)(4),
15(b)(6), 15B(c)(4), 17A(c)(3) and 17A(c)(4)(C) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(“Exchange Act”), Sections 203(e), 203(f) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
(“Advisers Act”), and Sections 9(b) and 9(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940
(“Investment Company Act”) (“May 20, 2004 Order”) against Strong Capital Management, Inc.
(“SCM”), Strong Investor Services, Inc. (“SIS”), Strong Investments, Inc. (“SII”), Richard S.
Strong (“Strong”), Thomas A. Hooker, Jr. and Anthony J. D’Amato. The May 20, 2004 Order,
among other things, ordered that Strong be barred from association with any broker, dealer,
municipal securities dealer, transfer agent or investment adviser, and be prohibited from serving




or acting as an employee, officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser or
depositor of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment company or affiliated person of
such investment adviser, depositor, or principal underwriter, provided however, that Strong may
continue to hold his ownership interest in SCM, SII and SIS (“the Strong entities”) until March
1, 2005. SCM is a registered investment adviser, SII is a registered broker-dealer and SIS is a
registered transfer agent.
2.
The Strong entities have requested that the March 1, 2005 deadline concerning
Strong’s ownership interest in the Strong entities be extended to May 31, 2005, to permit the
Strong entities sufficient time to complete an operational transition, cease their operations as
regulated entities and deregister with the Commission. The Commission deems it appropriate in
the public interest to grant the requested extension.
3.
The Commission further deems it appropriate in the public interest that SII’s
notice of withdrawal from registration as a broker or dealer become effective on May 31, 2005 if
filed no later than May 9, 2005.
II.
In view of the foregoing, it is ORDERED that:
1.
Section IV, paragraph I. of the May 20, 2004 Order be modified as follows:
Pursuant to Section 15(b)(6), 15B(c)(4) and 17A(c)(4)(C) of the Exchange Act, Section 203(f) of
the Advisers Act and Section 9(b) of the Investment Company Act, Richard S. Strong be, and
hereby is barred from association with any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, transfer
agent or investment adviser, and is prohibited from serving or acting as an employee, officer,
director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser or depositor of, or principal
underwriter for, a registered investment company or affiliated person of such investment adviser,
depositor, or principal underwriter, provided however, that Strong may continue to hold his
ownership interest in SCM, SII and SIS until May 31, 2005.
2.
SII’s notice of withdrawal from registration as a broker or dealer become
effective on May 31, 2005 if filed no later than May 9, 2005.

By the Commission.
