ORDER APPROVING PLAN,
APPOINTING A FUND
ADMINISTRATOR, AND
WAIVING BOND

On July 6, 2007, the Commission entered an Order instituting settled
administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings against Haidar Capital Management,
LLC, Haidar Capital Advisors, LLC, and Said N. Haidar (collectively, “Respondents”)
in this matter (“Order”). In the Matter of Haidar Capital Management, LLC, et al.,
Admin. Proc. File No. 3-12678, Securities Act Release No. 8820 (July 6, 2007). In the
Order, the Commission authorized the establishment of a Fair Fund, comprised of
$4,580,000 in disgorgement, interest, and penalties paid by Respondents, for
distribution to mutual funds affected by certain market timing trading by Respondents.
The Order provided that the Fair Fund was to be distributed pursuant to a distribution
plan developed by an Independent Distribution Consultant (“IDC”). The Respondents
retained Gordon J. Alexander as the IDC, who has developed a proposed distribution
plan (the “Plan”) in consultation with the Division of Enforcement and Respondents.
On April 13, 2010, the Commission published a “Notice of Proposed Plan of
Distribution and Opportunity for Comment” (“Notice”) pursuant to Rule 1103 of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F. R. § 201.1103
(Exchange Act Release No. 61897). The Notice advised all interested parties that they
may obtain a copy of the Plan from the Commission’s public website, or by requesting
one from Stephen Webster, Assistant Regional Director, Fort Worth Regional Office.
The Notice also advised all persons desiring to comment on the Plan that they
may submit their written comments no later than 30 days from the date of the Notice by
sending them to the Office of the Secretary, by using the Commission’s Internet
comment form, or by e-mailing rule-comments@sec.gov. The Commission received

no comments on the Plan, and no modification has been made to the Plan since the
publication of the Notice.
The Plan provides for distribution of the Fair Fund to eligible mutual funds that
were harmed by the actions of certain market timers that Respondents permitted to
market time. The Plan describes the procedures to be used to identify the eligible
mutual funds that will receive distributions. The Plan further describes the procedures
to be used to calculate the amounts to be paid, and distributed to, the eligible mutual
funds. Eligible mutual funds will not be required to make a claim or submit
documentation to establish their eligibility.
The Plan also proposes Rust Consulting, Inc. as the Fund Administrator and sets
forth, among other things, procedures for the administration of the Fair Fund, including
a proposed timeframe for the termination of the Plan.
Rust Consulting, Inc. has not posted the bond generally required of third parties
under Fair Fund Rule 1105(c). Pursuant to Rule 1105, the bond requirement may be
waived for good cause shown. The Fair Fund will be held at the U.S. Department of
the Treasury and will be disbursed by Treasury. All distributions in this matter will be
made by the Treasury’s Financial Management Service (“FMS”) directly to the eligible
mutual funds, with no handling of money by the Fund Administrator or any nongovernmental entity. The payees, and the relative amounts to be paid by FMS to each,
will have been reviewed and approved by the Commission prior to the distributions.
The staff requests that the Commission approve the Plan, appoint Rust
Consulting, Inc. as the Fund Administrator, and waive the bond requirement of the
Fund Administrator for the good cause shown in the Plan.
Accordingly, pursuant to Fair Fund Rule 1104, it is hereby ORDERED that the
Plan is approved.
It is hereby FURTHER ORDERED, pursuant to Fair Fund Rules 1105(a) and (c)
that Rust Consulting, Inc. is appointed as the Fund Administrator in accordance with the
terms of the Plan and that the bond requirement is waived for good cause shown.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Elizabeth M. Murphy
Secretary
