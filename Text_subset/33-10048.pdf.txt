In the Matter of
ORDER SCHEDULING BRIEFS
RICHARD D. FELDMANN
Richard D. Feldmann (“Feldmann”) has submitted a letter seeking to modify the
disgorgement and prejudgment interest ordered against him in a 2014 settled order (“Order”).1
Feldmann, formerly a registered representative at McGinn, Smith & Co., Inc., originally
was one of ten respondents in an administrative proceeding instituted in 2013.2 When he settled
with the Commission in 2014, the Order found that Feldmann willfully violated Sections 5(a),
5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933,3 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.4 The Commission ordered him to cease and desist from

15 U.S.C. § 78j(b); 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5. Among other things, the Commission found
that Feldmann “offered and sold notes to accredited and unaccredited investors alike for which
no registration statements were in effect, and no exemptions applied,” and “knowingly or
recklessly: (a) failed to perform adequate due diligence to form a reasonable basis for his
recommendations to customers and ignored a number of red flags concerning the offerings; and
(b) made misrepresentations and omissions in selling . . . fraudulent note offerings to investors
from 2003 to 2009.” 2014 WL 1320384, at *3.

Investment Company Act, and penny stock bars; and ordered him to pay disgorgement of
$299,000, prejudgment interest of $55,384.87, and a civil penalty of $130,000.5
After Feldmann settled with the Commission, the law judge issued an initial decision in
2015 addressing the claims against the non-settling respondents.6 Feldmann requests that the
Commission adjust the amount of disgorgement and prejudgment interest he was ordered to pay
in light of the disgorgement the non-settling respondents were ordered to pay in the initial
decision. We direct that the parties file opposing and reply briefs on this issue pursuant to Rule
of Practice 154(b).7
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that the Division of Enforcement file a brief in opposition
by March 14, 2016, and that Richard D. Feldmann file a reply brief by March 21, 2016.
For the Commission, by the Office of General Counsel, pursuant to delegated authority.
