the public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby
are, instituted pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and
Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), against Orrstown
Financial Services, Inc. (“Orrstown”), Thomas R. Quinn (“Quinn”), Bradley S. Everly, CPA
(“Everly”), Jeffrey W. Embly (“Embly”) and Douglas P. Barton, CPA (“Barton”) (collectively,
“Respondents”), and that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against

Rules of Practice.

II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondents have submitted Offers
of Settlement (the “Offers”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the
findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of
these proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V, Respondents
consent to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings
Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 4C and 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings
and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and Cease-and-Desist Orders (“Order”), as set forth below.
III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offers, the Commission finds1 that:
SUMMARY
1.
Orrstown Financial Services, Inc., is a publicly traded bank holding company
whose principal business activity consists of owning and supervising its wholly owned
subsidiary, Orrstown Bank (collectively, “Orrstown” or the “Bank”). Orrstown provides banking
and bank related services, which include, among other things, commercial lending. As of
December 31, 2010, approximately 75% of the Bank’s $964 million loan portfolio consisted of
commercial loans.
2.
In 2010, as Orrstown’s primary lending markets were experiencing a significant
decline in real estate values, Orrstown incorrectly accounted for its commercial loans by not
disclosing as much as approximately $69.5 million in loans as “impaired” in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
3.
GAAP states that a loan is “impaired” when, based on current information and
events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the
contractual terms of the loan agreement. For purposes of its periodic reporting requirements, a
company is required by GAAP to evaluate whether or not a loan is impaired and disclose the
total amount of impaired loans. Once a loan is determined to be impaired, GAAP requires a
company to estimate the uncollectible portion of the loan and record that amount as impairment
loss in its financial statements.
4.
Here, Orrstown did not comply with GAAP’s impaired loan disclosure
requirements due to certain Respondents’ negligence and Orrstown’s lack of sufficient internal
accounting controls. This failure resulted in material misstatements in Orrstown’s impaired loan

1

The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents’ Offers and are not binding on any other person or
entity in this or any other proceeding.

2

disclosures in its quarterly filings for the periods ended June 30, 2010 through September 30,
2011, and its annual filings for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011 (the “Relevant
Period”).
5.
Additionally, Orrstown (i) did not calculate loan losses in accordance with GAAP
in connection with the filing of its Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2011, (ii) incorrectly
implemented a newly issued GAAP accounting pronouncement in connection with the filing of
its Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2011 in a manner that was not consistent with the
new standard, and (iii) incorrectly applied GAAP when calculating fair value for certain
collateral in connection with its impairment analyses for its Form 10-Q for the periods ended
June 30, 2010 and September 30, 2010.
6.
As a result of the conduct described herein, Orrstown violated Sections 17(a)(2)
and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, the reporting provisions of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act
and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder, the books and records provisions of Section
13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, and the internal accounting control provisions of Section
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.
7.
As a result of the conduct described herein, Respondents Thomas R. Quinn, Jr.,
Orrstown’s Chief Executive Officer, Bradley S. Everly, Orrstown’s former Chief Financial
Officer, and Jeffrey W. Embly, Orrstown’s former Chief Credit Officer, violated Securities Act
Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and caused Respondent Orrstown
to violate Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and (B), and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a13 thereunder. Respondents Quinn and Everly also violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-14.
Respondent Douglas P. Barton, Orrstown’s Chief Accounting Officer, violated Exchange Act
Rule 13b2-1 and caused Orrstown to violate Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and (B),
and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-13 thereunder.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
16.
The relevant accounting standards governing Orrstown’s identification,
assessment and measurement of impaired loans are set forth in Accounting Standards
Codification (“ASC”) Subtopic 310-10-35, Receivables – Subsequent Measurement. The
relevant accounting standards providing guidance on disclosure of loans that are individually
deemed to be impaired are set forth in ASC 310-10-50 Receivables – Disclosure.
17.
ASC 310-10-50-15 requires that an entity disclose, as of the date of each
statement of financial position presented, its recorded investment in impaired loans.
18.
ASC 310-10-35-14 requires that a creditor apply its normal loan review
procedures in identifying loans to be evaluated for collectability and includes certain criteria that
are useful in identifying loans for evaluation.
19.
ASC 310-10-35-16 requires a creditor to identify a loan as impaired if, based on
current information and events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts
due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
4

20.
ASC 310-10-35-22 requires a creditor to measure an impaired loan’s impairment
based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective
interest rate, except that as a practical expedient, a creditor may measure impairment based on a
loan’s observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is a collateraldependent loan.
21.
Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2011-02, A Creditor’s Determination
of Whether a Restructuring is a Troubled Debt Restructuring (“ASU 2011-02”), codified as ASC
310-40, Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors, clarified existing troubled debt restructuring
(“TDR”) guidance by providing guidelines for determining when a restructuring constitutes a
concession and when a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties. A restructuring of a debt
constitutes a TDR if the creditor for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor’s financial
difficulties grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider. ASU 2011-02
was issued in April 2011 and was effective for the first interim or annual reporting period
beginning on or after June 15, 2011 and should have been applied retroactively to the beginning
of the annual period of adoption (i.e., restructurings occurring on or after the beginning of the
fiscal year of adoption).
FACTS
Orrstown’s Loan Review Process
22.
During the Relevant Period, Orrstown’s loan review process was governed by its
loan policy. The loan review was performed by a Loan Review Officer who was supervised by
Embly and Orrstown’s Credit Administration Committee. The Credit Administration Committee
consisted of non-employee directors, though Quinn, Everly and Embly regularly attended
meetings as non-voting members.
23.
Orrstown’s loan policy required the Loan Review Officer to conduct a risk review
of forty-five percent to sixty percent of the Bank’s total outstanding loan portfolio annually.
Based on this review of relevant loan files, the Loan Review Officer assigned a risk rating to
each relationship in accordance with a predetermined risk rating system that ranged from “1 –
Excellent” to “8 – Loss.” Loans rated “6 – Substandard,” “7 – Doubtful,” and “8 – Loss” were
considered “classified” loans and represented the subset of the loan portfolio where risk of
uncollectability was greatest. As a matter of practice all commercial relationships with a
committed loan balance over $750,000 were risk rated each year.
24.
During the Relevant Period, the loan policy further required that, on a quarterly
basis, the Loan Review Officer review Orrstown’s allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”)
to ensure that the Bank was adequately reserved for projected loan and lease losses. In
connection with this review, the Loan Review Officer evaluated only “Substandard” loans to
determine if they were impaired and whether a provision for loan loss was required to be
recorded in the financial statements.
25.
As discussed in greater detail below, Orrstown did not timely incorporate material
adverse information regarding certain borrowers’ financial difficulties into the risk rating
5

component of its loan review process and instead relied largely on stale data. As a result, loans
were incorrectly risk rated. Moreover, the processes and controls in place to ensure the accuracy
of risk ratings set by the Loan Review Officer were ineffective to prevent or correct the incorrect
risk ratings.
Loans to Several of Orrstown’s Largest Lending Relationships
Were Not Disclosed as Impaired
26.
In 2010, three of the Bank’s largest customers, Lending Relationships A, B and C,
approached Orrstown requesting to modify the terms of their loans, each claiming they had
insufficient cash flow to repay their existing loans with Orrstown. These borrowers’ cash flow
problems were discussed at meetings of Orrstown’s Loan Committee, Executive Committee
and/or Board of Directors. As attendees at these meetings, Quinn, Everly and Embly knew or
should have known that the loans to Lending Relationships A, B and C were impaired or, at a
minimum, that these loans needed to be evaluated for impairment. Quinn, Everly and Embly
received copies of the internal loan presentation materials that set forth the borrowers’ financial
difficulties, but Quinn, Everly and Embly did not raise any concerns about whether the loans
should have been disclosed as impaired in accordance with ASC 310-10-50-12, or identified for
impairment analysis in accordance with ASC 310-10-35-14 and ASC 310-10-35-16. In 2012 and
2013, Orrstown sold the Lending Relationships A, B and C loans at a substantial discount to their
carrying values.
A. Lending Relationship A
27.
As of December 31, 2010, outstanding loans to Lending Relationship A totaled
approximately $28.8 million. By July 13, 2010, Quinn, Everly and Embly knew or should have
known through loan presentation materials distributed at various committee meetings they
attended that the patriarch of Lending Relationship A was “struggling with cash flow” due to the
weakening real estate market. In or about the same time, Quinn, Everly and Embly were told that
the adult children, also borrowers, were “experiencing significant cash flow issues” and had
threatened to surrender their properties to the Bank. Earlier in May 2010, the patriarch’s brother,
himself a borrower, informed the Bank that he was “short” on money to continue construction of
his real estate projects. By December 9, 2010, Quinn, Everly and Embly were told that the
patriarch’s brother was still suffering the effects of the weakening economy, which hindered his
development plans. As a result of these financial difficulties, in 2010 Orrstown modified the
terms of approximately $21.5 million in loans to Lending Relationship A but did not evaluate,
identify, or disclose the loans as impaired, as required by GAAP.
B. Lending Relationship B
28.
As of December 31, 2010, outstanding loans to Lending Relationship B totaled
$12.2 million. As early as June 8, 2010, Lending Relationship B requested loan modifications
because their commercial properties were “producing a negative cash flow after debt service.”
By June 28, 2010, Lending Relationship B had mentioned to the Bank on multiple occasions the
possibility of filing for bankruptcy. And by December 17, 2010, Quinn, Everly and Embly knew
or should have known that Lending Relationship B’s largest financed project was potentially
6

“jeopardized” and that the borrowers were suffering the effects of the weakening economy and
experiencing “significantly strained cash flow[s].” Despite this information, on December 23,
2010, Orrstown approved modifications to the terms of Lending Relationship B loans but did not
evaluate, identify, or disclose them as impaired as required by GAAP.
C. Lending Relationship C
29.
As of December 31, 2010, outstanding loans to Lending Relationship C totaled
$7.7 million. By September 8, 2010, Quinn, Everly and Embly knew or should have known that
the Bank had met with the principal for Lending Relationship C and one of his business partners
to discuss the declining economy’s impact on their commercial real estate portfolio. Quinn,
Everly and Embly knew or should have known that Lending Relationship C and the partner were
having “serious cash flow deficiencies.” As a result, Orrstown agreed to modify many of these
loans in September and October 2010 but did not evaluate, identify, or disclose them as impaired
as required by GAAP.
Orrstown Did Not Disclose Other Commercial Loans as Impaired
at the Time it Recognized Impairment Losses
30.
In addition to Lending Relationships A, B and C, Orrstown incorrectly did not
disclose the value of other impaired loans in its quarterly filings on Form 10-Q for the periods
ended June 30, 2010 and September 30, 2010. During Q2 and Q3 2010, in connection with its
quarterly review and assessment of the adequacy of its ALLL, Orrstown’s Loan Review Officer
performed an analysis to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any, required under ASC
310-10-35, on individual loans rated “Substandard.” Under GAAP, loans with an impairment
loss must be disclosed as impaired.
31.
As part of this Q2 and Q3 2010 review of Orrstown’s ALLL, the Loan Review
Officer followed the Bank’s loan policy by comparing the value at which the Bank carried each
classified loan on its books and records, to the estimated net realizable value of the collateral
securing each loan. Consistent with the Bank’s loan policy, in instances where the loan’s
carrying value exceeded the estimate of the collateral’s net realizable value, an impairment loss
was recorded in the amount of the difference. However, certain loans where impairment losses
were calculated were incorrectly not included in the Loan Review Officer’s ALLL schedule of
impaired loans.
32.
As a result, the Q2 and Q3 2010 Forms 10-Q disclosures incorrectly omitted
impaired loans in the amounts of approximately $5.6 million as of June 30, 2010 and
approximately $18.5 million as of September 30, 2010.
33.
The Loan Review Officer’s calculation of impairment losses was memorialized
and distributed to the Credit Administration Committee, which reviewed it but did not ensure
that loans with impairment losses were designated as impaired in Orrstown’s books and records
(the ALLL schedule). These inaccurate books and records were then used to prepare Orrstown’s
impaired loan disclosures included in its Q2 and Q3 2010 Forms 10-Q. Because Orrstown did
7

not include the value of these impairments in its impaired loan disclosures, the disclosures were
materially misstated.
34.
Everly and Embly were directly notified that the Loan Review Officer did not
appropriately record as impaired in Orrstown’s books and records loans that had been assigned
impairment losses. Specifically, in October 2010, Barton reviewed the Loan Review Officer’s
ALLL schedule, which included the impairment loss analysis discussed above, and informed
Everly and Embly that failing to disclose loans with impairment losses as impaired was
inconsistent with the accounting guidance. No one took corrective action. As a result, Orrstown’s
Q3 2010 Form 10-Q was filed without accurately disclosing Orrstown’s recorded investment in
impaired loans in accordance with GAAP.
Orrstown Did Not Accurately Disclose Impaired Loans Which Caused
it to Make Materially Misstated Filings
35.
Orrstown did not accurately record certain loans as impaired, resulting in
materially misstated periodic filings filed with the Commission. The following Orrstown filings
were materially misstated in the manner described below:
a. Orrstown filed its Q2 2010 Form 10-Q with the Commission on August 5,
2010. In its filing, Orrstown disclosed in its Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”)
impaired loans of approximately $21.7 million. Orrstown did not disclose
approximately $46.6 million of additional impaired loans, an understatement
of approximately 215%.
b. Orrstown filed its Q3 2010 Form 10-Q with the Commission on November 5,
2010. In its filing, Orrstown disclosed in its MD&A impaired loans of
approximately $22.6 million. Orrstown did not disclose approximately $69.5
million of additional impaired loans, an understatement of approximately
308%.
c. Orrstown filed its 2010 Form 10-K with the Commission on March 11, 2011.
In its filing, Orrstown disclosed impaired loans in the footnotes to its financial
statements of approximately $14.7 million. Orrstown did not disclose
approximately $51.0 million of additional impaired loans, an understatement
of approximately 346%.
d. Orrstown filed its Q1 2011 Form 10-Q with the Commission on May 10,
2011. In its filing, Orrstown disclosed impaired loans in the footnotes to its
financial statements of approximately $14.1 million. Orrstown did not
disclose approximately $51.0 million of additional impaired loans, an
understatement of approximately 362%.

8

36.
The misstatement in Orrstown’s 2010 Form 10-K described above was repeated
in the footnotes to the financial statements included in Orrstown’s Q2 2011 Form 10-Q, Q3 2011
Form 10-Q and 2011 Form 10-K.
Orrstown Did Not Make and Keep Adequate Books and Records
by Failing to Comply with GAAP Provisions Relating to TDRs
and Loan Losses
A. Incorrect Application of the Provisions of ASU 2011-02
37.
In connection with the preparation of its Q2 2011 Form 10-Q, Orrstown elected to
early adopt the provisions of ASU 2011-02. This new accounting guidance was to be applied
retroactively to identify and report restructurings that occurred on or after January 1, 2011 that
qualified as TDRs.
38.
As a result of its implementation of ASU 2011-02, Orrstown disclosed in its Q2
2011 Form 10-Q that approximately $34 million of restructured loans qualified as TDRs.
However, at least $22 million of these loans were restructured in 2010 and were thus outside of
ASU 2011-02’s retroactive scope.
39.
Barton was responsible for Orrstown’s implementation of ASU 2011-02 and
knew or should have known that retroactive application of this pronouncement to restructurings
that occurred prior to January 1, 2011 was not in accordance with GAAP.
40.
Additionally, Quinn, Everly and Embly knew or should have known that
Orrstown was not permitted to retroactively apply ASU 2011-02 to restructurings before January
1, 2011. Nonetheless, Quinn, Everly, and Embly participated in and agreed to the decision to
apply ASU 2011-02 to loans that were restructured in 2010, inconsistent with GAAP.
B. Loan Losses Were Not Calculated in Accordance with GAAP
41.
In connection with Orrstown’s recognition of approximately $34 million of TDRs
in Q2 2011, Barton performed an impairment analysis to determine if impairment losses needed
to be recorded for any of these TDRs – which, under GAAP are deemed impaired loans.
42.
For a majority of the $34 million in loans, Barton utilized a discounted cash flow
model (“DCF Model”) to calculate impairment losses. But rather than using the expected future
cash flows and each loan’s effective interest rate in his DCF Model, as required by GAAP,
Barton used each loan’s contractual cash flows which he then discounted at a “market rate” to
arrive at the net realizable value of the loans. This approach did not comply with ASC 310-1035-22.
43.
On or around September 2, 2011, Barton informed Quinn, Everly and Embly that
this methodology was “not technically within the accounting rules” but none of them took any
action to alter the DCF Model to conform to GAAP.

9

C. Orrstown Utilized Stale Real Estate Appraisals in Calculating Fair Value Measurements
for Collateral Securing Certain Commercial Loans
44.
As described above, during Q2 and Q3 2010, when the Bank performed an
impairment analysis on certain classified loans, its analysis did not comply with its loan policy
because it utilized stale real estate appraisals. Moreover, the Bank’s analysis did not comply with
GAAP because it incorporated inappropriate inputs into its collateral valuation models.
45.
During Q2 and Q3 2010, Orrstown relied upon stale appraisals aged in excess of
two years when calculating impairment losses on certain of its commercial loans. Orrstown’s
reliance upon stale real estate appraisals ran counter to its own loan policy, which required that
all real estate loans be supported by current appraisals that were no more than two years old in a
stable real estate environment and no more than “a few months” old in a “rapidly escalating or
deteriorating market.” Despite these requirements, and the declining real estate and broader
economic market throughout 2010, Orrstown did not obtain current real estate appraisals or
reliable real estate appraisal updates on many of its loans, including those issued to Lending
Relationships A, B and C.
46.
For example, during Q2 and Q3 2010, Orrstown evaluated approximately $42.3
million and $49.2 million of “Substandard” rated loans for impairment loss, respectively. For Q2
2010, approximately 40% of those loans were supported by real estate appraisals older than two
years and 14% of those loans were supported by real estate appraisals older than five years. For
Q3 2010, approximately 29% of those loans were supported by real estate appraisals older than
two years and 10% were supported by real estate appraisals older than five years.
47.
Additionally, in Q2 and Q3 2010, Orrstown utilized the fair value of collateral to
measure impairment loss on certain commercial loans individually evaluated for impairment.
GAAP defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and
provides a framework for measuring fair value in ASC 820. According to ASC 820, fair value
measurements are to be based on, among other things, inputs that a market participant would
incorporate into its valuation model as of the applicable measurement date.
48.
During Q2 and Q3 2010, however, contrary to GAAP, Orrstown estimated the
current value of its real estate collateral by relying on stale real estate appraisals and discounted
the appraised values by a universal discount rate regardless of the age of the appraisal. The
discount was based primarily on a regulatory study conducted in 2004 which had no bearing on
the current real estate market as of 2010 and was irrelevant to the collateral valuation model as of
Q2 and Q3 2010.
49.
As members of the Loan Committee, Quinn, Everly and Embly were ultimately
responsible for ensuring that each loan was supported by updated information and Embly, in
particular, was ultimately responsible for regulatory compliance regarding appraisals. Moreover,
Quinn, Everly and Embly knew or should have known that the Bank’s use of stale appraisals in
connection with the measurement of impairment loss, and its use of a universal discount rate, did
not comply with GAAP and Orrstown’s own loan policy.
10

Orrstown Did Not Devise and Maintain a Sufficient System of
Internal Accounting Controls
50.
During the Relevant Period, Orrstown did not maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions were recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Orrstown’s
lack of internal accounting controls resulted in: (1) incorrect loan risk ratings; (2) incorrect
disclosures of impaired loans; (3) incorrect calculations and disclosures of loan losses; (4)
incorrect application of newly issued accounting pronouncements; and (5) the lack of action to
remedy accounting problems after being alerted to them.
51.
Quinn, Everly and Embly were ultimately responsible for the timely
identification, evaluation and reporting of impaired loans.
52.
As President and CEO, Quinn was responsible for the administration of
Orrstown’s loan policy. He was a member of the Loan Committee, Executive Committee and
Board of Directors. As principal executive officer of Orrstown, Quinn was responsible for
certifying in its periodic filings that Orrstown had adequate internal controls to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP.
53.
As CFO, Everly was responsible for ensuring that Orrstown’s financial reporting
was materially accurate, complete and prepared in accordance with GAAP. He was a member of
the Loan Committee and Executive Committee and regularly attended meetings of the Board of
Directors. As principal financial officer of Orrstown, Everly was responsible for certifying in its
periodic filings that Orrstown had adequate internal controls to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP.
54.
As CCO, Embly was responsible for credit underwriting, loan work out and loan
administration, including supervision of the loan review process and ensuring that material
adverse information concerning borrowers was timely incorporated into the loan ratings. He was
a member of the Loan Committee and Executive Committee and regularly attended meetings of
the Board of Directors.
55.
Quinn, Everly and Embly were members of committees that reviewed borrowers’
requests for loan modifications and, in the course of those meetings, received information
regarding the borrowers’ financial difficulties.
56.
Barton was responsible for overseeing the finance department in coordinating
financial reporting and preparing monthly financial reports to senior management and the Board
of Directors. He was also responsible for implementing new accounting pronouncements and
ensuring that Orrstown’s accounting policies were consistent with GAAP. Barton drafted the
disclosure pertaining to the early adoption of ASU 2011-02 in the Q2 2011 Form 10-Q and
performed the calculation of loan loss reserves for the loans that were classified as TDRs in Q2
2011.

Orrstown offered securities in 2010 pursuant to a Form S-8 that it originally filed
on April 11, 2000 and again offered securities in 2011 pursuant to a Form S-8 that it filed on
June 3, 2011. The Form S-8 filed on April 11, 2000 incorporated by reference all subsequent
periodic filings under the Exchange Act for securities sold under this registration statement.
Thus, it incorporated by reference Orrstown’s Q2 and Q3 2010 Forms 10-Q, which materially
under-reported the Bank’s impaired loans. The Form S-8 filed on June 3, 2011 incorporated by
reference Orrstown’s 2010 Form 10-K and its Q1 2011 Form 10-Q and all subsequent periodic
filings under the Exchange Act for securities sold under this registration statement. Thus, it
incorporated by reference Orrstown’s Q2 and Q3 2011 Forms 10-Q and its 2011 Form 10-K,
which also materially under-reported the Bank’s impaired loans.

ORRSTOWN’S REMEDIAL EFFORTS
72.
In determining to accept Orrstown’s Offer, the Commission considered remedial
acts promptly undertaken by Orrstown and cooperation afforded the Commission staff.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest
to impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondents’ Offers. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 8A

2

A willful violation of the securities laws means merely “‘that the person charged with the duty knows what
he is doing.’” Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting Hughes v. SEC, 174 F.2d 969, 977
(D.C. Cir. 1949)). There is no requirement that the actor “‘also be aware that he is violating one of the Rules or
Acts.’” Id. (quoting Gearhart & Otis, Inc. v. SEC, 348 F.2d 798, 803 (D.C. Cir. 1965)).

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103.
I.
Respondent Everly is denied the privilege of appearing and practicing before the
Commission as an accountant.
J.
After three (3) years from the date of this Order, Respondent Everly may request
that the Commission consider his reinstatement by submitting an application (Attention: Office
of the Chief Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as:
i.

A preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or
review, of any public company’s financial statements that are filed with
the Commission.
1. Such an application must satisfy the Commission that
Respondent’s work in his practice before the Commission will be
reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public
company for which he works or in some other acceptable manner,
15

as long as he practices before the Commission in this capacity;
and/or
ii.

An independent accountant. Such an application must satisfy the
Commission that:
1. Respondent, or the public accounting firm with which he is
associated, is registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (“Board”) in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002, and such registration continues to be effective;
2. Respondent, or the registered public accounting firm with which he
is associated, has been inspected by the Board and that inspection
did not identify any criticisms of or potential defects in the
respondent’s or the firm’s quality control system that would
indicate that the respondent will not receive appropriate
supervision;
3. Respondent has resolved all disciplinary issues with the Board, and
has complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions
imposed by the Board (other than reinstatement by the
Commission); and
4. Respondent acknowledges his responsibility, as long as
Respondent appears or practices before the Commission as an
independent accountant, to comply with all requirements of the
Commission and the Board, including, but not limited to, all
requirements relating to registration, inspections, concurring
partner reviews and quality control standards.

K.
The Commission will consider an application by Respondent Everly to resume
appearing or practicing before the Commission provided that his state CPA license is current and
he has resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of accountancy.
However, if state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the Commission, the Commission
will consider an application on its other merits. The Commission’s review may include
consideration of, in addition to the matters referenced above, any other matters relating to the
applying Respondent’s character, integrity, professional conduct, or qualifications to appear or
practice before the Commission.
L.
Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall
be treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondents agree that in any Related Investor
Action, they shall not argue that they are entitled to, nor shall they benefit by, offset or reduction
of any award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondents’ payment of a
civil penalty in this action (“Penalty Offset”). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants
such a Penalty Offset, Respondents agree that they shall, within 30 days after entry of a final
16

order granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the
amount of the Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall
not be deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the
civil penalty imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a “Related Investor
Action” means a private damages action brought against any Respondent by or on behalf of one
or more investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the
Commission in this proceeding.
V.
It is further Ordered that, solely for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in
Section 523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523, the findings in this Order are true and
admitted by Respondents Orrstown, Quinn, Everly, Embly and Barton and further, any debt for
civil penalty or other amounts due by each of the aforementioned Respondents under this Order
or any other judgment, order, consent order, decree or settlement agreement entered in
connection with this proceeding, is a debt for the violation by said Respondents of the federal
securities laws or any regulation or order issued under such laws, as set forth in Section
523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(19).
By the Commission.
