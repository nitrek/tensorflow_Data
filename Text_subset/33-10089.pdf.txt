SUMMARY
1.
This case involves financial accounting and reporting fraud, as well as audit
failures, related to the valuation of certain oil and gas assets in Alaska (“the Alaska Assets”)
acquired by Miller Energy Resources, Inc. (“Miller Energy” or “the Company”). Miller Energy,
an oil and gas company headquartered in Houston, Texas, purchased these assets for $2.25 million
in cash – along with the assumption of certain liabilities it valued at approximately $2 million –
during a competitive bid in a bankruptcy proceeding in December 2009.
2.
The Company subsequently reported those assets at an overstated value of $480
million and recognized a one-time “bargain purchase” gain of $277 million for its fiscal third
quarter ended January 2010 and fiscal year ended April 2010.

professional conduct; or (3) to have willfully violated, or willfully aided and abetted the
violation of, any provision of the securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder.

Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) provides, in pertinent part, that:
The Commission may . . . deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of appearing or
practicing before it . . . to any person who is found…to have willfully violated, or
willfully aided and abetted the violation of any provision of the Federal securities laws or

The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer of Settlement and are not binding
on any other person in this or any other proceeding.

3.
Boyd, who was the Chief Financial Officer of Miller Energy at the time, failed to
account for the acquisition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations, required Miller Energy
to record the value of its acquired Alaska Assets at “fair value.” However, contrary to authoritative
accounting guidance, Boyd was at least reckless in setting fair value based on a reserve report that
was prepared by a petroleum engineer firm using the rules for supplemental oil and gas disclosures.
As set forth in GAAP, the numbers used in these supplemental disclosures do not reflect fair value.
Boyd knew or, at the very least, should have known that the reserve report did not purport to
represent fair value. The reserve report, which he received and reviewed, expressly disclaimed that
the numbers therein represented the engineer firm’s opinion of fair value. The reserve report Boyd
used also contained expense numbers that were understated by the CEO of Miller Energy’s Alaska
operations (“the Alaska CEO”).
4.
In addition, Boyd caused Miller Energy to overstate materially the value of the
Alaska Assets because he knew or should have known that he had double counted $110 million of
certain fixed assets that were already included in the reserve report.

Tennessee since 1993.
THE COMPANY
6.
Miller Energy Resources, Inc. is a Tennessee corporation with its principal place
of business in Houston, Texas. It was founded in 1967 as an oil and gas exploration and
production company, and went public via a reverse merger in 1996. It changed its name from
Miller Petroleum to Miller Energy Resources in April 2011. The Company operated oil and gas
assets in the Appalachian region of east Tennessee until selling them in November 2014 for $3.3
million in cash. Miller Energy’s securities, registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(b),
were listed on the NYSE until September 2015, when the securities were delisted. Between early
2002 and December 2009, Miller Energy’s stock price regularly traded below one dollar per share,
falling to a low of $0.04 per share in December 2007. On October 1, 2015, Miller Energy filed a
voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter 11 of title 11 of the U.S. Code in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Alaska (the “Bankruptcy Case”).
FACTS
Miller Energy Acquires and Overvalues the Alaska Assets
7.
In the fall of 2009, Miller Energy became aware of certain oil and gas properties in
Alaska that were in the process of being “abandoned” as part of the bankruptcy proceedings of a
California-based energy company.
3

8.
Unable to service its heavy debt and pay the significant monthly costs required to
operate the properties, the bankrupt entity unsuccessfully sought for almost a year to sell its Alaska
Assets. Beginning in December 2008, months before it filed for bankruptcy, the former owner of
the assets marketed the same group of assets that Miller Energy ultimately bought to 40 potential
buyers. This process failed to attract any bidders, and the assets were auctioned by the bankruptcy
court in July 2009, with the winning bidder agreeing to a total purchase price of $8 million for the
assets. A second entity, who bid $7 million, was designated as the back-up purchaser. Neither
bidder closed.
9.
As a result, the former owner of the assets sought in August 2009, and was granted
in September, an order from the bankruptcy court allowing it to abandon title to the assets due to a
lack of interest.
10.
Due to renewed interest in the assets from Miller Energy following their
abandonment, the bankruptcy court permitted the debtor to reacquire the Alaska Assets and sell
them to Miller Energy in a competitive auction for $2.25 million in cash and the assumption of
certain limited liabilities. The transaction closed on December 10, 2009.
11.
On March 22, 2010, Miller Energy filed its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for its
fiscal third quarter ended January 31, 2010 and reported a value of $480 million for the Alaska
acquisition. That amount was comprised of $368 million for oil and gas properties and $110
million for fixed assets. Miller Energy also reported an after-tax $277 million “bargain purchase
gain” which boosted net income for the quarter to $272 million – an enormous increase over the
$556,097 loss reported for the same period the year before.
12.
As detailed below, these inflated balance sheet and income statement numbers were
repeated in numerous documents subsequently filed with the Commission.
13.
The newly-booked value of the Alaska acquisition, which resulted in a nearly
5,000% increase in Miller Energy’s total assets, had a significant impact on Miller Energy’s stock
price. On December 10, 2009, the date of the transaction, Miller Energy’s stock closed at $0.61
per share. By March 31, 2010, Miller Energy’s stock closed 982% higher at $6.60 per share.
Weeks later, its stock began trading on NASDAQ and, after moving to the NYSE a year later,
reached an all-time high price on December 9, 2013 of $8.83 per share.
14.
As described in detail below, Miller Energy materially overstated the value of its
Alaska Assets by more than four hundred million dollars.
Under GAAP, Miller Energy Was Required
to Record the Alaska Acquisition at Fair Value
15.
ASC 805, Business Combinations – formerly Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) 141(R) – became effective in December 2008. Among its principal revisions,
ASC 805 requires acquisitions that result in a “bargain purchase,” e.g., entities purchased at fire
4

sales prices in non-orderly transactions, to be measured at fair value, with any resulting gain
recorded on the income statement.
16.
ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements (formerly SFAS 157), provides the framework
for measuring fair value. “Fair value” is defined in ASC 820 as “the price that would be received
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date.” A reporting entity must determine an appropriate fair value using one or
more of the valuation techniques described in accounting literature.
17.
ASC 820 outlines three broad approaches to measure fair value: the market
approach, income approach, and cost approach. Under the market approach, prices and other
relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or
liabilities are used to measure fair value. The income approach utilizes valuation techniques to
convert future amounts to a single discounted present value amount. Finally, the cost approach is
based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the assets in service, i.e., current
replacement cost.
18.
ASC 820 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entityspecific measurement, and should be determined based on the assumptions market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability.
19.
ASC 820 emphasizes that when a price for an identical asset or liability is not
observable entities should use a “valuation technique that maximizes the use of relevant observable
inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs” and entities may not ignore assumptions
market participants would use.4
20.
As described below, Boyd purported to value the Alaska Assets using the income
approach for the oil and gas reserves and the cost approach for certain fixed assets. When
computing their estimate of fair value, Boyd acted at a minimum recklessly when he failed to
consider the existence of numerous, readily apparent data points strongly indicating that the assets
were worth substantially less than the $480 million value Miller Energy recorded. In failing to do
so, Boyd caused Miller Energy to overstate materially the value of the newly acquired Alaska
Assets

ASC 820 defines “unobservable inputs” as “inputs that reflect the reporting entity’s own
assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
developed based on the best information available in the circumstances” and “observable inputs” as
“inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity.”

The Valuation of the Acquired Oil and Gas Properties
Was Based Upon a Reserve Report That Did Not Represent Fair Value
21.
Reserve reports are commonly used in the oil and gas industry to estimate quantities
of oil and gas (the reserves) expected to be recovered from existing properties.5 Generally, these
reports list reserves in categories based on a minimum estimated percentage probability of eventual
recovery and production, i.e., proved, probable, and possible. Information in reserve reports that
are prepared in accordance with Commission regulations is frequently used, among other purposes,
to satisfy supplemental accounting disclosure requirements concerning estimates of future oil and
gas production. However, the numbers used in reserve reports for this purpose are expressly not
considered “an estimate of fair market value.”6
22.
Shortly after acquiring the Alaska Assets, Boyd asked the Alaska CEO – who was a
non-accountant with no formal accounting training -- to obtain a reserve report for the Alaska
properties in order to determine the fair value of the acquired assets to be reported on Miller
Energy’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended January 31, 2010. Boyd instructed the Alaska CEO that
the reserve report should use a pretax present value of net cash flows discounted at 10% (“PV10”).
23.
On January 5, 2010, the Alaska CEO hired a petroleum engineer firm to prepare the
requested reserve report.
24.
The reserve report was finalized in February 2010 and reflected PV-10 of $368
million. The reserve report itself clearly stated that the numbers therein were not an estimate of fair
market value. Specifically, on page 3 of the report, it states that “[t]he discounted values shown
5

Oil and gas reporting companies are subject to two principal authoritative pronouncements
governing financial accounting and reporting for oil and gas activities: Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X (17
C.F.R. 210.4-10), Financial Accounting and Reporting for Oil and Gas Producing Activities Pursuant to
the Federal Securities Laws and the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (“Rule 4-10”); and
ASC 932-235-50-29 through 33 (formerly SFAS 19, Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas
Producing Companies and SFAS 69, Disclosures About Oil and Gas Producing Activities). ASC 932
establishes disclosure requirements for significant oil and gas activities, including disclosure of the
“standardized measure,” which is the future after-tax net cash flows discounted at 10%. A non-GAAP
measure known as “PV-10” is similar to the standardized measure but is typically presented on a pretax
basis. The FASB has noted that the standardized measure supplies investors with useful information,
however, they also noted their concern “that users of financial statements understand that it is neither fair
market value nor the present value of future cash flows. It is a rough surrogate for such measures, a tool to
allow for a reasonable comparison of mineral reserves and changes through the use of a standardized
method that recognizes qualitative, quantitative, geographic, and temporal characteristics.” Paragraph 83
of the Basis for Conclusions of SFAS 69.
See Paragraph 77 of the Basis for Conclusion of SFAS 69 (“Although it cannot be considered an
estimate of fair market value, the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows should be responsive to
some of the key variables that affect fair market value, namely, changes in reserve quantities, selling prices,
production costs, and tax rates.”).

are for your information and should not be construed as our estimate of fair market value.” Boyd
received and reviewed that report and therefore knew that it disclaimed to represent fair value.
Yet, upon receiving the reserve report, Boyd, without undertaking any additional analysis, merely
recorded as the fair value of the acquired oil and gas properties the sum of the PV-10 estimates for
100% of the proved, probable, and possible reserves, which increased the book value of Miller
Energy’s oil and gas properties on its balance sheet by $368 million.
25.
Before recording as fair value in Miller Energy’s accounting records the values
contained in the reserve report, Boyd never reviewed or questioned any of the reserve report’s
assumptions or calculations, nor did he communicate with the engineer firm about the reserve
report.
26.
reasons.

The $368 million reserve report value did not represent fair value for several

27.
First, the $237 million of projected operating and capital expenses that the Alaska
CEO provided the petroleum engineer were unrealistically low, resulting in an overstated
valuation.
28.
In fact, when the Alaska CEO contacted the petroleum engineer firm that the prior
owners of the Alaska Assets had used, that firm advised that the expected level of expenses made a
significant portion of the acquisition unprofitable. Specifically, that firm told the Alaska CEO that
it would not assign any value to one of the largest fields acquired, the Redoubt Shoal field, because
it was uneconomical – i.e., expected future expenses exceeded expected future cash flows – and
explained that it would not put its “name on a report that implies value exists where it likely does
not.”7
29.
Boyd was aware that Miller Energy chose the new firm because the prior firm
would not assign any value to the Redoubt Shoal field. The Redoubt Shoal field – which
represented $291 million of the $368 million in fair value recorded by Miller Energy for the
reserves – showed positive future cash flows in the reserve report that was ultimately generated
primarily because the Alaska CEO of the Alaska operations gave the new engineer firm
understated and unsubstantiated expense numbers.
30.
The Alaska CEO provided expense projections that, in many cases, were
significantly lower than past actual experience. For example, internal documents maintained by
the Alaska CEO indicate that the cost to drill a new well in the Redoubt field was roughly $13
million. However, the Alaska CEO told the petroleum engineer firm to use a cost of $4.6 million
per well in its reserve report. And instead of using recent expense data, the Alaska CEO gave the
7

Unique among the oil and gas properties purchased by Miller Energy, Redoubt Shoal is an
offshore field in Cook Inlet, Alaska, which requires the use of an offshore platform that sits in seventy
feet of water, is accessible only by boat or helicopter, and drills to depths in excess of 12,000 feet.
Offshore drilling presents risks and costs not associated with onshore operations.

7

engineer firm nearly three year old operating expense data, which he revised down on the pretext
that Miller Energy could run a leaner operation than former operators of the properties.
31.
Overall, the reserve report implied operating expenses of $4 per barrel of oil
equivalent (“boe”) for all categories of reserves. That level of operating expenses was
unreasonable in light of its predecessor’s actual operating expenses of $32.50/boe in 2008 and
$55.42/boe in the first half of 2009, before the wells were shut-in. Boyd was at least reckless in
using as fair value in Miller Energy’s financial statements a report that relied on such
unrealistically low expenses.
32.
In late December 2009, the Company’s outside auditors cautioned Boyd that the
lack of any controls over the Alaska CEO’s expense estimates was a “concerning void.”
Notwithstanding his having been made aware of this concern, Boyd knowingly failed to implement
any controls relating to the expense estimates.
33.
By understating the expense numbers, Miller Energy overvalued its oil and gas
properties by tens of millions of dollars.
34.
Second, the reserve report did not include amounts for certain asset retirement
obligations, i.e., the legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets.
35.
Third, despite showing years of net profit that market participants would expect to
be taxable, the reserve report did not make any adjustments for income taxes.
36.
Fourth, at Boyd’s request, the reserve report used a 10% discount rate that was
inappropriate under GAAP for determining fair value. In a discounted cash flow model, a discount
rate is used to account for the uncertainties associated with risk and the time value of money. A
discount rate is the required rate of return that an investor would demand – based on the risks
associated with the benefit stream under consideration – to induce the investor to make an
investment. By failing to consider the discount rate using assumptions market participants would
use for the Alaska Assets, Miller Energy materially overstated the value of the acquired oil and gas
properties.
37.
Finally, the valuation also overstated cash flows from certain categories of reserve
estimates (e.g., “probable” and “possible” reserves) by failing to apply any risk weight to such
reserves and the resulting cash flows. Given the high degree of uncertainty associated with cash
flows from these reserve estimate categories, they are required to be risk weighted in order to
reflect an appropriate valuation.
Miller Energy Misstated the Value of the Fixed Assets
38.
In addition to the $368 million value recorded for the oil and gas properties, Boyd
caused Miller Energy to also erroneously record a separate value of $110 million for acquired fixed
assets, such as facilities and pipelines ancillary to the oil and gas reserves.

8

39.
In a February 8, 2010 email, Boyd informed the Alaska CEO that Boyd needed an
amount to use as fair value for the fixed assets obtained as part of the Alaska acquisition. Boyd
noted that, ideally, the value should be what a willing buyer would pay for the assets, but “[i]n the
absence of that, replacement values or something similar would probably work.” Two days later,
Boyd was sent an “asset replacement cost study” purportedly provided by an independent
insurance broker, which appeared to list the replacement cost for the assets as $110 million. The
“study” was dated September 5, 2008, but “revised” on February 9, 2010.
40.
Boyd caused the $110 million amount reported in the revised insurance study to be
recorded on Miller Energy’s balance sheet.
41.
Boyd’s use of the insurance study’s replacement cost estimates for valuing Miller’s
fixed assets was, at a minimum, reckless. The reserve report Miller Energy had relied on to value
the Alaska Assets used a discounted cash flow model. Valuation specialists use such models to
estimate the value of an enterprise’s “operating assets” – i.e., the assets employed to generate
future cash flows – by converting future benefit streams into a net present value. The fixed assets
in the insurance study were the very same operating assets that were expected to generate the
future cash flows in the reserve report. Accordingly, Boyd knew or was reckless in not knowing
that adding the replacement cost estimates to Miller’s estimated value of “operating assets” would
result in double counting the value of such assets.
42.
Moreover, the “asset replacement cost study” relied upon to support the $110
million fair value was actually a preexisting insurance study created by an insurance broker. It had
been refashioned at the direction of the Alaska CEO and Boyd to appear as if a third party had
derived the $110 million value. In truth, the numbers in the study had been given to the insurance
broker, and its predecessor, by its clients (i.e., Miller Energy and the previous owners of the fixed
assets) as far back as 2007 and had been used as starting points for other types of estimates, such as
estimates for possible losses resulting from fire or natural disasters. The two employees at the
insurance broker who were most familiar with the original “Loss Estimates Study,” including the
engineer who authored it, confirmed that no one at the broker ever tested or in any way doublechecked the values given to them.
43.
At the direction of the Alaska CEO, Miller Energy’s Alaska personnel contacted a
separate consulting firm and sent it the insurance broker’s original 2008 insurance report. Late on
February 8, the consulting firm informed Miller Energy that the insurance study it sent was a
“good reference” but the report did not state “value or replacement cost.” The firm offered to
conduct its own analysis, but advised that the estimate would take “approximately 2-3 weeks to
complete” and “cost around $15,000-$18,000.”
44.
Upon hearing the news that a new report might take two to three weeks, Alaska
personnel called Boyd. According to one participant on this call, Boyd said he could not wait
weeks for a new report. He “needed it quickly and he needed to base it on something . . . a
professional had to sign off on it, not us, some third party. . . .” During the call, Boyd and the
Alaska CEO decided to rely on numbers in the insurance report as replacement costs, despite the
Alaska CEO having been told by the broker that it could not provide Miller Energy with
9

replacement costs and despite Boyd knowing that the numbers in the study were prepared for a
purpose other than fair value.
45.
By using the reserve report and the “asset replacement cost study,” as a proxy for
fair value, Boyd caused Miller Energy to overvalue the Alaska Assets by more than $400 million.
Consequently, Miller Energy filed with the Commission financial reports that materially misstated
the value of its assets, as follows: Forms 10-Q for the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 and all three
quarters of fiscal years 2011 through 2015; Forms 10-K for fiscal years ended 2010 through 2014;
the Form S-1 filed on August 8, 2010; the Forms S-3 filed on September 6, 2012 and October 5,
2012; and prospectuses filed between August 25, 2010 through August 21, 2014 pursuant to Rule
424.
46.
In addition, the following financial reports that Miller Energy filed with the
Commission materially misstated the Company’s net income: Forms 10-Q for the third quarter of
fiscal year 2010, all three quarters of fiscal 2011, and the first two quarter of 2012; Forms 10-K for
fiscal years ended 2010 through 2012; the Form S-1 filed on August 8, 2010; the Forms S-3 filed
on September 6, 2012 and October 5, 2012; and prospectus supplements filed between August 25,
2010 through August 21, 2014 pursuant to Rule 424. In addition, the improper valuation of the
Alaska Assets rendered no fewer than 15 Forms 8-K filed between March 2010 through at least
December 2014 materially false and misleading.
VIOLATIONS
47.
As a result of the conduct described above, Boyd willfully violated Section 17(a) of
the Securities Act, which prohibits fraudulent conduct in the offer or sale of securities.
48.
As a result of the conduct described above, Boyd willfully aided and abetted and
caused Miller Energy to violate Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 13a-1, 13a-11, and
13a-13 thereunder, which require that every issuer of a security registered pursuant to Exchange
Act Section 12 to file with the Commission, among other things, annual, current, and quarterly
reports as the Commission may require.
49.
As a result of the conduct described above, Boyd willfully aided and abetted and
caused Miller Energy to violate Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, which requires reporting
companies to make and keep books, records and accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect their transactions and dispositions of their assets.
50.
As a result of the conduct described above, Boyd willfully aided and abetted and
caused Miller Energy to violate Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, which requires all
reporting companies to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to
provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP.
51.
As a result of the conduct described above Boyd willfully violated Section 13(b)(5)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, which prohibit any person from knowingly

knowingly falsifying any book, record, or account described in Section 13(b)(2) of the Exchange
Act.
52.
As a result of the conduct described above, Boyd willfully aided and abetted and
caused Miller Energy to violate Rule 12b-20 under the Exchange Act, which requires that, in
addition to the information expressly required to be included in a statement or report filed with the
Commission, there shall be added such further material information, if any, as may be necessary to
make the required statements, in light of the circumstances under which they are made not
misleading.
53.
As a result of the conduct described above, Boyd willfully violated Rule 13a-14 of
the Exchange Act which requires that an issuer’s principal executive and principal financial
officers certify each periodic report.

of the Commission and the PCAOB, including, but not limited to, all requirements relating to
registration, inspections, concurring partner reviews and quality control standards.
E.
The Commission will consider an application by Boyd to resume appearing or
practicing before the Commission provided that his state CPA license is current and he has
resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of accountancy. However, if
state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the Commission, the Commission will consider an
application on its other merits. The Commission’s review may include consideration of, in addition
to the matters referenced above, any other matters relating to Boyd’s character, integrity,
professional conduct, or qualifications to appear or practice before the Commission.
F.
Respondent Boyd shall pay a civil money penalty in the amount of $125,000 to the
Securities and Exchange Commission for transfer to the general fund of the United States
Treasury, subject to Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3). Payment shall be made in the following
installments: $10,000 paid within 10 business days following entry of this Order, followed by
$10,000 quarterly payments (i.e. 90 days) for three years, with the final payment being $5,000. If
any payment is not made by the date the payment is required by this Order, the entire outstanding
balance, plus any additional interest accrued pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 3717, shall be due and
payable immediately, without further application. Payment must be made in one of the following
12

ways:
(1)
Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission,
which will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;
(2)
Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via
Pay.gov through the SEC website at
http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or
(3)
Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s check, or
United States postal money order, made payable to the Securities and
Exchange Commission and hand-delivered or mailed to:
Enterprise Services Center
Accounts Receivable Branch
HQ Bldg., Room 181, AMZ-341
6500 South MacArthur Boulevard
Oklahoma City, OK 73169
Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying
Paul W. Boyd as a Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these proceedings; a
copy of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to M. Graham Loomis, Division of
Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission, 950 East Paces Ferry Road, N.E., Atlanta,
GA 30326-1382.
G.
Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be
treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondent agrees that in any Related Investor
Action, he shall not argue that he is entitled to, nor shall he benefit by, offset or reduction of any
award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondent’s payment of a civil
penalty in this action ("Penalty Offset"). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a
Penalty Offset, Respondent agrees that he shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting
the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount of the
Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be deemed
an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil penalty
imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a "Related Investor Action" means a
private damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more investors based
on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the Commission in this
proceeding.
H.
Respondent Boyd shall, within 10 days of the entry of this Order, pay disgorgement
of $158,000 and prejudgment interest of $11,800, but payment of such amount is waived based
upon Respondent’s sworn representations in his Statement of Financial Condition dated April 1,
2016 and other documents submitted to the Commission.

13

I.
The Division of Enforcement ("Division") may, at any time following the entry of
this Order, petition the Commission to: (1) reopen this matter to consider whether Respondent
provided accurate and complete financial information at the time such representations were made;
and (2) seek an order directing payment of disgorgement and pre-judgment interest. No other issue
shall be considered in connection with this petition other than whether the financial information
provided by Respondent was fraudulent, misleading, inaccurate, or incomplete in any material
respect. Respondent may not, by way of defense to any such petition: (1) contest the findings in
this Order; (2) assert that payment of disgorgement and interest should not be ordered; (3) contest
the amount of disgorgement and interest to be ordered; or (4) assert any defense to liability or
remedy, including, but not limited to, any statute of limitations defense.
V.
It is further Ordered that, solely for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in Section
523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523, the findings in this Order are true and admitted by
Respondent, and further, any debt for disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalty or other
amounts due by Respondent under this Order or any other judgment, order, consent order, decree
or settlement agreement entered in connection with this proceeding, is a debt for the violation by
Respondent of the federal securities laws or any regulation or order issued under such laws, as set
forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(19).
By the Commission.
