JOSEPH C. LAWLER,

CATHERINE L. VENABLE
Respondents.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that ceaseand-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act
of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange
Act”) against ModusLink Global Solutions, Inc. (“ModusLink”), Joseph C. Lawler, Steven G.
Crane, and Catherine L. Venable (collectively, “Respondents”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondents have submitted Offers
of Settlement (the “Offers”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V, Respondents consent
to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Pursuant to Section 8A of the

Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings,
and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.
III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offers, the Commission finds1 that:
Summary
1.
ModusLink is a Massachusetts-based company that provides supply chain and
logistics services to other companies. In providing products and services to its clients, ModusLink
routinely purchased products and services from third-party vendors on behalf of its clients.
ModusLink also routinely obtained rebates from vendors. In numerous instances, and without a
sufficient basis to conclude that it was entitled to do so, ModusLink kept rebates that should have
benefited certain ModusLink clients, which were contractually entitled to them under cost-plus and
pass-through contracts. In some other instances, ModusLink marked-up the prices charged by the
vendors and billed the higher price to certain ModusLink clients, also in contravention of their
contracts. ModusLink had no legal entitlement to these rebates and mark-ups and inappropriately
included these sums in computing and reporting its revenue and net income in its financial
statements filed with the Commission.
2.
In June 2012, ModusLink announced its intent to restate certain financial
statements, which it did in January 2013, restating more than five years of inaccurate financial
statements that had appeared in the company’s periodic filings with the Commission. The restated
financial statements reversed the revenue and net income ModusLink had inappropriately reported
from these rebates and mark-ups. As a result of these practices, ModusLink misstated its net
income by up to 1038%, 23%, and 22% in certain years.
3.
ModusLink’s financial misstatements resulted from failures to act reasonably at
every level in the company. ModusLink’s management was made aware on multiple occasions
that certain rebates needed to be passed through to clients. Although ModusLink’s management
directed subordinates to pursue rebates aggressively and set rebate targets for those subordinates to
hit, management failed to take appropriate steps to ensure rebates were passed on to clients when
required. Simultaneously, ModusLink’s operations staff worked with vendors to implement covert
procedures to obtain rebates, and rebate information was kept secret from client-facing sales staff.
And when an internal whistleblower alerted the Internal Audit department and the company’s
Audit Committee, the resulting review was incomplete and ineffective. In addition, staff sitting at
the intersection between operations and corporate staff responsible for financial reporting during
this time, including the CFO of the Supply Chain Business Unit, Catherine L. Venable, failed to
ensure that such rebates and mark-ups were accurately reflected in ModusLink’s books and
records.

1

The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents’ Offers of Settlement and are not binding
on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

4.
ModusLink’s then-Chief Executive Officer, Joseph C. Lawler, and then-Chief
Financial Officer, Steven G. Crane, both received bonuses, incentive compensation, and/or
equity-based compensation during the 12-month periods following certain of the filings
ModusLink restated. Neither Lawler nor Crane, however, has reimbursed any portion of this
compensation to ModusLink pursuant to Section 304(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
Respondents
5.
ModusLink Global Solutions, Inc., is a Delaware corporation with its corporate
headquarters in Waltham, Massachusetts. Its common stock is registered pursuant to Section 12 of
the Exchange Act and traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol “MLNK.” Before 2008,
ModusLink operated under the names CMGI, Inc. and CMG Information Services, Inc. In its
Form 10-K filing for its fiscal year 2015 (filed October 14, 2015), ModusLink reported net revenue
of $561.7 million, an operating loss of $14.3 million, and a net loss of $18.4 million. Nearly all of
ModusLink’s current officers and directors joined the company in the period since ModusLink
announced its intention to restate its financial statements in June 2012.
6.
Joseph C. Lawler, age 65, lives in Skokie, IL. From August 2004 to 2012, he was
ModusLink’s President and Chief Executive Officer. Lawler was also a ModusLink director from
August 2004 to June 2012, and Chairman of the Board from August 2006 to November 2011.
7.
Steven G. Crane, age 58, lives in Charleston, SC. From April 2007 to 2014, he
was ModusLink’s Chief Financial Officer. Crane was also ModusLink’s Treasurer from April
2007 to June 2008.
8.
Catherine L. Venable, age 51, lives in Gold Canyon, AZ. From 2008 to 2010, she
was ModusLink’s CFO of Global Operations and from 2010 to 2012, she was ModusLink’s CFO
of the Supply Chain Business Unit. Venable was also the CFO of the Americas region from 20052007 and CFO of the Asia and Europe regions from 2007-2008. Venable held a CPA license from
1989 to 2003.
ModusLink’s Business and Pricing Models
9.
ModusLink provides “global supply chain business process management” primarily
to computer, electronics, and communications companies. Its supply chain management business
manufactures, stores, and distributes for sale its clients’ products. ModusLink operates in North
America, Europe, and Asia.
10.
Often as part of its supply chain services, ModusLink buys components (such as
power cords or compact discs), raw materials (such as corrugated cardboard), or auxiliary services
(such as printing) on behalf of its clients.
11.
ModusLink enters into contracts with clients that can employ one or more of three
models for pricing those components, materials, and/or auxiliary services:

3

a. “Cost” or “Pass-through” model: Costs incurred by ModusLink to purchase
components, materials, and/or auxiliary services are passed through directly to the
client;
b. “Cost-Plus” model: The client agrees to pay the costs incurred by ModusLink to
purchase components, materials, and/or auxiliary services, plus an agreed-to
percentage mark-up on those costs;
c.

“Fixed-Price” model: ModusLink and its client negotiate a fixed unit price for the
supply chain services to be provided, where the level of costs incurred by
ModusLink does not determine the contractual price.

12.
ModusLink’s biggest clients tended to have cost or cost-plus contracts, as those
clients had more bargaining power with ModusLink; smaller clients tended to have fixed-price
contracts. At the time of its restatement, approximately 17% of ModusLink’s contracts were cost,
33% were cost-plus, and 50% were fixed price.
13.
ModusLink’s business model – which included purchasing commodity materials in
bulk and charging its clients for the materials, as described above – resulted in high revenues
(approximately $1 billion annually), but low profit margins for ModusLink as a whole during the
five and one-half year restatement period (2007-2012). During that period, ModusLink turned an
annual profit only twice ($37.7 million in 2007 and $0.5 million in 2008).
ModusLink’s Retention of Rebates and Cost Mark-Ups
14.
Beginning no later than the mid-2000s and extending through the first half of 2012,
ModusLink negotiated for certain of its vendors to pay rebates to ModusLink on the components,
materials, and auxiliary services ModusLink bought from the vendors to fulfill its contracts with its
clients. ModusLink used its size and purchasing power to arrange rebates with vendors whenever
possible.
15.
Rebate amounts would generally be calculated per-unit (e.g., 10 cents or 10% off
per item) or based on ModusLink hitting certain volume criteria (in which cases the rebates were
sometimes termed “volume discounts”). The rebates effectively lowered the actual price
ModusLink paid the vendors for the components, materials, and auxiliary services purchased, and
were accounted for as a reduction in ModusLink’s material costs (i.e., cost of goods sold).
16.
Notwithstanding the fact that the rebates lowered ModusLink’s vendor costs,
ModusLink generally did not pass the cost savings through to its clients, including those with cost
and cost-plus contracts that required such savings to be passed on to the clients. Instead,
ModusLink generally kept the rebate savings for itself and billed the clients at the original, prerebate (higher) price charged by vendors.
17.
At times, ModusLink negotiated the rebate amount with a vendor at the same time
that it negotiated the original price for the product or service with the same vendor. In these
instances, ModusLink directed the vendor to bill ModusLink at the original price – rather than the
4

“net” price, inclusive of the rebate. The original (higher) price was used to bill ModusLink’s
clients.
18.
For example, if ModusLink needed to provide a power cord for a client with a cost
contract, it might negotiate with a vendor to supply that power cord for $1 with a 10% rebate.
ModusLink would initially pay $1 to the vendor for each power cord and then bill the client for the
$1 paid to the vendor. At a later point (generally at month-end or quarter-end), however,
ModusLink would receive 10 cents back from the vendor. Despite ModusLink’s true cost of 90
cents, ModusLink generally did not pass back to its clients the 10 cents per power cord, but instead
kept the 10 cents for itself.
19.
Rebates were a key element of profitability at ModusLink, often comprising a
substantial portion of the company’s net income for the quarter or year. One executive referred to
rebates as “pure profit,” and they were considered part of ModusLink’s business model.
Notwithstanding their direct impact on ModusLink’s bottom line and their importance to
ModusLink’s business, however, ModusLink’s SEC filings did not identify or describe rebates in
any way before the SEC began an investigation into its rebate practices.
20.
ModusLink also added profit to its bottom line by directly marking up vendor costs.
In some instances, however, mark-ups were added in contravention of certain clients’ cost or costplus contracts, which called for vendor costs to be either passed-through to clients with no markups or with only agreed-upon mark-ups.
21.
As described more fully below, ModusLink’s retention of vendor rebates and markups in contravention of certain clients’ cost and cost-plus contracts resulted in ModusLink
retaining revenue and net income to which it was not entitled. The following chart compares the
net income ModusLink originally reported in its Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the Commission
with the amounts that ModusLink restated in 2013 based on its improper rebate and mark-up
practices. While ModusLink’s revenues were misstated by less than 1% in each period, its net
income was misstated exponentially more.

ModusLink Failed to Ensure the Accurate Treatment of Rebates
22.
ModusLink’s financial misstatements resulted from failures to act reasonably at
every level in the company. Despite being aware that certain rebates could not be kept by
ModusLink, the company nevertheless aggressively – and covertly – pursued rebates from vendors
without regard to its contractual obligations to clients with cost and cost-plus contracts.
5

23.
ModusLink personnel generally knew, at least as to ModusLink’s larger clients,
which had cost and cost-plus contracts and which did not. Client pricing models – which were
critically important to whether ModusLink would turn a profit on a particular client’s business –
were reviewed when ModusLink considered both new business projects and existing business
projects.
24.
ModusLink’s pursuit and retention of vendor rebates was also well known to, and
driven by, ModusLink’s management. Management put pressure on the operations staff to
aggressively pursue rebates as a way to reduce ModusLink’s costs and improve its profits. As part
of the budget process, management set targets for the amount of rebates the business units were
expected to obtain.
25.
Management would thereafter periodically receive reports on the company’s
success obtaining rebates and their effect on the company’s financial performance. Rebates were
also regularly discussed in reports from ModusLink’s business units.
26.
The possibility of obtaining new rebates was also periodically a factor when
ModusLink considered whether a new business project was expected to be sufficiently profitable to
undertake.
27.
Management was informed on multiple occasions that the company could not keep
vendor rebates associated with clients on cost and cost-plus contracts, including in memos and
reports authored by or received by ModusLink’s managers.
28.
Management was also apprised on multiple occasions that ModusLink was marking
up vendor costs on business associated with some of its biggest clients, including clients with
which ModusLink had cost or cost-plus contracts.
29.
Notwithstanding management’s general knowledge of its clients’ contracts and
knowledge of the company’s pursuit of rebates and mark-ups, ModusLink did not have any
meaningful processes in place to ensure rebates and mark-ups were properly treated under its
different contract models. ModusLink failed to direct the relevant parts of the company, including
its legal staff, operations staff, sales staff, and finance staff, to develop any procedures for the
proper treatment of rebates.
30.
Ultimately, in connection with its 2013 restatement of financial statements,
ModusLink admitted to deficiencies in its accounting and financial controls, including a failure to
reconcile its pricing and billing processes to its contractual obligations.
ModusLink’s Secretive Approach to Rebate Negotiation and Retention
31.
ModusLink’s embrace of rebates as a profit strategy created an incentive to retain
rebates to which it was not entitled. Vendor rebates were pursued and implemented on the
operations side of ModusLink’s business (rather than the client-facing sales side). The operations
side, accordingly, turned from a cost center into a mixed cost and profit center, with a profit goal it
was expected to hit each year.
6

32.
By turning the operations side of its business into a profit center, ModusLink
engendered a competitive and contentious dynamic between sales and operations, and the
operations staff developed practices that were aimed at increasing rebates while hiding them from
scrutiny. ModusLink’s internal procedures and information systems were designed to keep rebaterelated information away from sales and other client-facing personnel and to conceal rebate
practices from clients. Management was aware of and directed this deliberate information
withholding, ostensibly so that sales personnel did not negotiate away the profits made from the
rebates. The effect was that those with the most knowledge about the client contracts – the clientfacing personnel – were kept in the dark about the company’s rebate practices. Company-wide
rebate information, likewise, was generally available at the management level only.
33.
Among the ways the operations staff kept rebate information hidden was by
directing vendors to make sure that their invoices did not reflect the anticipated payment of rebates.
Emails dating as far back as 2003, and as late as 2011, reflect that operations staff would arrange
with vendors to invoice ModusLink at the higher, original price and then return the difference
between the “real” or “net” price and the higher price to ModusLink at month- or quarter-end in
the form of a rebate. By keeping the rebate information off of the vendor invoices, the clientfacing sales personnel (and the clients themselves) would be unaware of the rebates.
34.
The ModusLink personnel responsible for the concealed rebate program hid their
activities by providing inflated cost figures (which included the higher, non-rebated price) to those
ModusLink employees who dealt with clients.
35.
In some instances, members of the operations staff pursued rebates in this fashion
specifically because they knew that the client contracts would be structured as cost or cost-plus and
thus they could not directly mark-up the vendor costs. Numerous middle- and upper-level
managers in operations received and sometimes sent emails reflecting these practices.
36.
At times, operations staff members clashed with sales staff members who suspected
(accurately) that operations had included rebate-inflated prices into pricing quotes, making it
tougher to make a sale to a client. Members of senior management would occasionally have to
mediate these disputes between operations and sales.
37.
ModusLink operations staff also made sure that its main accounting and billing
systems did not contain detailed information regarding rebates. These practices were designed to
and did conceal rebates from those select clients that had contractual rights to review and audit
what ModusLink had charged them.
38.
At various times, ModusLink operations staff referred to its rebate efforts internally
as a “masked pricing program” and, more colloquially, as “Scooby Snacks.”2

2

In the cartoon Scooby Doo, Scooby Snacks were a food item (or possibly a dog treat) frequently
used as an incentive for the dog Scooby-Doo and his owner Shaggy.

ModusLink Failed to Adequately Address Internal Whistleblower Complaint
39.
In November 2008, an anonymous whistleblower put ModusLink’s management
and Audit Committee on notice of the problem posed by ModusLink’s rebate practices, but
ModusLink failed to effectively respond.
40.
An allegation was received through ModusLink’s “EthicsPoint” system regarding
the collection of rebates. This system allowed for the reporting of anonymous tips concerning
improper conduct at the company. The allegation stated that ModusLink’s sourcing department –
which was part of the operations function at ModusLink – was conducting a rebate program in
which purchase orders provided to vendors and invoices received from vendors were not reduced
by the rebate amount, and rebates were paid from vendors to ModusLink on separate paperwork.
The allegation further asserted that these rebates were not being disclosed to clients, who were told
they were receiving cost-plus pricing. The allegation squarely identified the problem with this
program: “[V]endor rebate agreements in existence [sic] which are not being passed to customers
per the contract terms and conditions.”
41.
The allegation was referred to ModusLink’s Internal Audit team, which began to
investigate the rebate program. At the outset, the Internal Audit director identified that the
allegation raised concerns “from a legal and accounting perspective.” The investigation, however,
failed to sufficiently evaluate and investigate the allegation from either perspective.
42.
No one at ModusLink appears to have sought either a legal or accounting opinion
about whether ModusLink could properly charge the non-rebate price to clients on cost and costplus contracts. Nor did the Internal Audit investigation involve a review by anyone of the terms of
the cost and cost-plus contracts to determine whether rebate amounts needed to be passed back to
those clients. Instead, the Internal Audit team simply asked the operations staff, including its
finance personnel, about the rebate program, and they uniformly asserted that the collection of
rebates was acceptable because the vendors providing the rebates served multiple ModusLink
clients. When the internal auditors sought historical data concerning rebate practices, they were
told that the available data did not contain the level of detail requested and was unreliable,
notwithstanding that the requested data was in fact being maintained by ModusLink’s operations
staff. Despite later being told that more detailed information was available, Internal Audit did not
obtain or evaluate the information.
43.
Internal Audit, along with ModusLink’s general counsel, thereafter closed the
EthicsPoint investigation, calling the allegation “unfounded” based on its insufficient inquiry. In
March 2009, Internal Audit reported to ModusLink’s Audit Committee that the investigation was
closed and that Internal Audit had concluded that the rebates received were ModusLink’s
“entitlement.”
44.
During the Internal Audit investigation, staff at ModusLink identified a risk “that a
client could come back and ask for the rebates received on their part orders when the client
contract holds a cost or cost-plus option.” That risk does not appear to have been communicated to
ModusLink’s Audit Committee when the complaint was closed.
8

45.
The Audit Committee did not engage in any discussion or ask any questions about
Internal Audit’s review or its conclusions. No legal opinion was sought or obtained and no inquiry
was made regarding the basis for the cursory conclusion reported to the Audit Committee. In other
words, the Audit Committee tacitly accepted Internal Audit’s report that the rebate program was
justified.
46.
Following the closing of the investigation, ModusLink’s supply chain managers
were told to review the company’s rebate practices to eliminate the risk that a client with a cost or
cost-plus contract might seek rebates ModusLink received on that client’s business. While the
managers and staff reviewed the company’s rebate practices, they did nothing to change their
fundamental nature. ModusLink failed to implement any new processes, including any processes
to check client contracts to determine whether they were cost or cost-plus. Instead, the responsible
managers merely documented the rebate practices then in existence.
Role of Catherine Venable
47.
Catherine Venable held the most senior finance role on the operations side of
ModusLink’s business, CFO of Global Operations and its equivalent, from 2008 to 2012. In prior
years, she was CFO of the Americas (2005-2007) and CFO of Asia and Europe (2007-2008).
Venable often served as an intermediary between operations and the corporate accounting staff on
issues related to rebates (including, for example, whether they were sufficiently predictable to
warrant an accrual), and was a strong and consistent advocate for rebates, given their positive
impact on the bottom line.
48.
Venable was responsible for preparing the financial statements for her region and/or
business unit (as she was promoted), which were provided to the corporate accounting staff.
49.
Venable was familiar with ModusLink’s client contracts. She knew the company’s
contracts with certain clients required pass-through pricing of vendor costs, and knew or should
have known that certain cost savings, including rebates, had to be passed back to clients on those
contracts.
50.
Venable also knew that the procurement staff was negotiating rebates from vendors
at the direction of management.
51.
During her tenure, Venable repeatedly prepared financial statements knowing that
ModusLink was retaining rebates for goods and services procured, in part or whole, for use in
performing work for clients with cost and cost-plus contracts. Venable unreasonably relied on the
unfounded rationale that retention of these rebates was acceptable because the vendors providing
the rebates were believed to be serving multiple ModusLink clients. Venable took no independent
steps to determine whether rebates should have been or were passed back to clients with cost and
cost-plus contracts, and thereby, through her negligence, was a cause of ModusLink’s failure to
accurately record rebates and, by extension, its revenue and net income.

ModusLink’s Required Restatement of Financial Statements Filed with the Commission
52.
On March 12, 2012, ModusLink’s Form 10-Q filing for the period ended January
31, 2012, defended the company’s rebate practices:
As part of [ModusLink’s supply chain management] services and in the
normal course of our business we purchase certain commodity types of materials,
including, but not limited to, print, packaging, media and labels, to meet client
requirements, often in quantities well in excess of those required by any one client.
As a result, we receive improved pricing on materials, as well as rebates based on
aggregate volumes of purchases or other criteria established by the vendor. Cost of
revenue for the second quarter of our 2012 fiscal year included the positive impact
of approximately $1 million attributable to such rebates. In response to an inquiry
by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we are currently evaluating this
practice, to determine the extent to which such rebates should be shared with
certain of our clients. Based on our operating practices, including our ongoing
periodic pricing negotiations with our clients, we believe the benefit of these
rebates is effectively shared with our clients and that our accounting for such
practices is correct.
53.
On June 11, 2012, ModusLink filed with the Commission a Form 8-K, along with a
press release from the company. The Press Release revised ModusLink’s position on rebates,
stating,
Concurrent with the [Securities and Exchange Commission’s] inquiry, the
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors initiated an internal investigation and
has determined that certain client contracts have not been aligned consistently with
ModusLink’s practice of retaining volume discounts. In the course of the
investigation, the Audit Committee also identified limited instances where vendor
costs incurred were marked-up to clients in a manner not consistent with client
contacts.
54.
ModusLink then announced that “it [was] no longer able to conclude that amounts
from such volume discounts and mark-ups, where now found to be inconsistent with client
contracts, were correctly accounted for as revenue. As soon as practicable, the Company expects
to restate its audited financial statements from fiscal years 2009 through 2011, as well as the first
two quarters of fiscal 2012 and its unaudited selected financial data for fiscal years 2007 and
2008.” In other words, ModusLink announced that its financial statements from 2007 to the
present could not be relied upon.
55.
On January 11, 2013, ModusLink filed an amended Form 10-K with the
Commission in which it restated its financial results for the period 2007 through 2011 and the first
two quarters of 2012. In that filing, ModusLink admitted, “based on additional accounting
evaluations conducted in connection with the investigation and in consultation with the Audit
Committee’s advisors, the Company concluded, and recommended to the Audit Committee, that
10

revenue should not have been recognized for retained rebates and mark-ups associated with the
cost-based client contracts.”
56.
The restatement resulted in a cumulative downward adjustment of $32.9 million in
revenue, from 2007 through the first two quarters of 2012. ModusLink adjusted net income
downward by $18.0 million and restated its aggregate net loss of $231.1 million. These
adjustments flowed from the approximately $45 million ModusLink determined that it had
improperly billed clients based on rebates and mark-ups ModusLink retained in contravention of
client contracts.
57.
In a “Summary of Investigation Findings” in the Form 10-K filed on January 11,
2013, ModusLink conceded that:
The errors identified in the course of the Audit Committee’s investigation
revealed deficiencies in the Company’s accounting and financial control
environment, some of which were determined to be material weaknesses. These
included a failure of effective controls to track and reconcile the Company’s belief
that it was entitled to retain rebates and pricing mark-ups against the specific terms
of the contractual pricing models and cost disclosure obligations required by client
contracts.
Compensation of CEO Lawler and CFO Crane
58.
During the 12-month periods following ModusLink’s filing with the Commission
of inaccurate financial statements in its Forms 10-K for the full years of 2010 and 2011, Lawler
and Crane received bonuses, incentive compensation, and equity-based compensation. Neither
Lawler nor Crane has reimbursed any portion of this compensation to ModusLink.
ModusLink Offered Securities
59.
On December 20, 2010, ModusLink filed a Form S-8 with the Commission. That
filing detailed ModusLink’s registration of over five million shares of common stock, in
connection with its adoption of a 2010 Incentive Award Plan on December 8, 2010. The
registration statement incorporated ModusLink’s Fiscal Year 2010 10-K, which ModusLink later
restated, as described above. ModusLink made this filing, and subsequently offered certain of the
registered shares to employees, during the period it improperly billed and kept rebates and markups.
Violations
60.
Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act make it unlawful, in the offer or
sale of securities, to (1) obtain money or property by means of any material misrepresentation or
omission or (2) engage in any transaction, practice or course of business that operates or would
operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser. Negligence is sufficient to establish violations of
Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act. As a result of its negligent conduct described
above, ModusLink violated Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act.
11

61.
Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act requires issuers of securities registered
pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file periodic and other reports with the
Commission. With exceptions not applicable here, Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 of the Exchange Act
require each issuer to file annual and quarterly reports respectively on the appropriate forms and
within the period specific on the form. Rule 12b-20 further requires that the required reports
contain such further material information, if any, as may be necessary to make the required
statements, in light of the circumstances under which they are made not misleading. As a result of
the conduct described above, ModusLink violated Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules
12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.
62.
Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires issuers of securities registered
pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to make and keep books, records and accounts,
which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and dispositions of
their assets. As a result of the conduct described above, ModusLink violated Section 13(b)(2)(A)
of the Exchange Act.
63.
Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act requires issuers of securities registered
pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to, among other things, devise and maintain a system
of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. As a result of the conduct described above, ModusLink violated
Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.
64.
As a result of her negligent conduct described above, Venable was a cause of
ModusLink’s violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act.
65.
Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires the chief executive
officer and chief financial officer of any issuer required to prepare an accounting restatement due
to material noncompliance with the securities laws as a result of misconduct to reimburse the
issuer for (i) any bonus or incentive-based or equity-based compensation received by that person
from the issuer during the 12-month periods following the false filings, and (ii) any profits
realized from the sale of securities of the issuer during those 12-month periods. Section 304 does
not require that the chief executive officer or chief financial officer personally engage in
misconduct to trigger the reimbursement requirement, and the Commission does not allege that
Lawler and/or Crane participated in misconduct. As described above, however, ModusLink
engaged in misconduct giving rise to its restatement. During the 12-month period following
ModusLink’s filing of inaccurate financial statements in its Forms 10-K for 2010 and 2011,
Lawler and Crane received bonuses, incentive compensation, and/or equity-based compensation.
Neither Lawler nor Crane has, to date, reimbursed any portion of this compensation or profits
stemming from this compensation to ModusLink. Lawler and Crane have, therefore, violated
Sarbanes-Oxley Section 304.

I.
Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be
treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondents ModusLink and Venable agree that
in any Related Investor Action, they shall not argue that they are entitled to, nor shall they benefit
by, offset or reduction of any award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of
Respondents ModusLink’s and Venable’s payment of a civil penalty in this action (“Penalty
Offset”). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a Penalty Offset, Respondents
ModusLink and Venable agree that they shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting
the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission’s counsel in this action and pay the amount of the
Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be deemed
an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil penalty
imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a “Related Investor Action” means a
private damages action brought against one or more Respondents by or on behalf of one or more
investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the
Commission in this proceeding.
V.
It is further Ordered that, solely for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in Section
523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523, the findings in this Order are true and admitted by
Respondents, and further, any debt for disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalty or other
amounts due by Respondents under this Order or any other judgment, order, consent order, decree
or settlement agreement entered in connection with this proceeding, is a debt for the violation by
Respondents of the federal securities laws or any regulation or order issued under such laws, as set
forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(19).
By the Commission.
