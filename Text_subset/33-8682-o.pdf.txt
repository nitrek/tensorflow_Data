ORDER INSTITUTING ADMINISTRATIVE
AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS
PURSUANT TO SECTION 8A OF THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, SECTIONS
15(b)(6) and 21C OF THE SECURITIES
EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AND SECTIONS
203(e), 203(f) AND 203(k) OF THE
INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940

In the Matter of
David Henry Disraeli and Lifeplan
Associates, Inc.,
Respondents.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in
the public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby
are, instituted pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), Sections
15(b)(6) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), and Sections
203(e), 203(f) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) against
David Henry Disraeli ("Disraeli"), and pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act and Section
21C of the Exchange Act against Lifeplan Associates, Inc. ("Lifeplan") (collectively
"Respondents").

II.
After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement alleges that:
A.

Respondents

1.
David Henry Disraeli, 42, of Austin, Texas, is registered with the
Commission as an investment adviser (File No. 801-62429), under the primary business name
“David Henry Disraeli DBA Lifeplan Associsates (sic).” 1
Disraeli presently provides
discretionary investment advisory services, with approximately $5 million in assets under
management, to 19 clients, 18 of whom reside in Texas. Disraeli has worked in the securities
1

Lifeplan Associates is the sole proprietorship under which Disraeli does business.

industry, as an investment adviser or a registered representative of a broker-dealer, since 1988. He
holds Series 6, 7, 22, 24 and 63 licenses from the NASD. Disraeli was registered with the SEC as
an investment adviser from November 1993 until his voluntary withdrawal in June 1997, after it
became apparent he would no longer qualify for Commission registration as an investment adviser
under the National Securities Market Improvement Act of 1996, which added Section 203A to the
Advisers Act. In or about March 1999, Disraeli registered as an investment adviser with the Texas
State Securities Board (“TSSB”), and in or about December 2000, Disraeli allowed his TSSB
registration to lapse. In late 2003, Disraeli registered with the Commission for a second time as an
investment adviser.
2.
Lifeplan Associates, Inc. is a Texas corporation, based in Austin, Texas,
which Disraeli incorporated on or about September 30, 2003. Disraeli holds 80 percent of its
outstanding stock, and approximately 11 of his advisory clients hold the remaining 20 percent.
Disraeli is Lifeplan’s sole officer, director and employee. Lifeplan was registered briefly with the
Commission as an investment adviser from on or about October 13, 2003 to on or about November
13, 2003.
B.

Disraeli’s Investment Adviser Registration with the Commission

1.
On or about April 2, 2003, Disraeli consented on a neither-admit-nor-deny
basis to the entry of a cease-and-desist order by the TSSB. See In the Matter of David Henry
Disraeli d/b/a Disraeli and Associates, TSSB Order No. CDO-1504 (April 2, 2003). The order
found, among other things, that Disraeli had made misleading statements indicating that he was
registered with the Texas Securities Commissioner as an investment adviser, that Disraeli had
failed to disclose a federal tax lien, and that Disraeli had offered for sale unregistered securities
issued for the development of a retirement community. The order required Disraeli to cease and
desist from offering the unregistered retirement community securities, conducting fraudulent
offerings and rendering services as an investment adviser without registering as such.
2.
During the investigation leading to the April 2003 TSSB order, Disraeli had
resigned from the broker-dealer employing him. On or about August 13, 2003, Disraeli applied to
re-register with the TSSB as a registered representative of a broker-dealer. The TSSB opposed his
application, and on or about September 3, 2003, Disraeli requested a hearing on his application.
3.
In or about October 2003, Disraeli filed a Form ADV with the Commission
by which he registered Lifeplan as an investment adviser. Although Section 203A of the Advisers
Act prohibits investment advisers with less than $25 million under management from registering
with the Commission, Lifeplan’s Form ADV claimed it met the exemption under Advisers Act
Rule 203A-2(d), which allows a newly-formed investment adviser to register if it reasonably
expects to qualify for Commission registration within 120 days.
4.
Since Disraeli was the advisory representative of Lifeplan, which had
advisory clients in Texas, Disraeli was required under Texas law to register with the TSSB as an
advisory representative. Therefore, on or about October 21, 2003, Disraeli submitted his advisory

2

representative application to the TSSB, which notified Disraeli on or about November 12, 2003
that it would oppose the application.
5.
On or about November 13, 2003, Disraeli amended Lifeplan’s Form ADV
to substitute Disraeli, operating as a sole proprietorship, as the registered adviser. In the amended
Form ADV filing, Disraeli claimed that he was a newly-formed adviser expecting to qualify for
Commission registration within 120 days. By registering personally with the Commission,
Disraeli avoided registering with the TSSB as either an adviser or advisory representative.
6.
When Disraeli filed the November Form ADV with the Commission, he
had only 14 clients (all residing in Texas) and approximately $4.5 million in assets under
management. Disraeli had provided advisory services to these clients for several years. Therefore,
at the time he filed the Form ADV Disraeli was not a newly-formed investment adviser. Further,
Disraeli did not meet the general $25 million threshold for Commission registration, and had no
reasonable basis for expecting to meet that threshold within 120 days.
7.
On or about February 11, 2004, Disraeli entered into a written undertaking
with the TSSB. The undertaking, which resolved the proceedings arising from the TSSB’s
opposition to his applications to register as a representative of a broker-dealer and a representative
of an investment adviser, required Disraeli to withdraw all applications pending before the TSSB,
to refrain from re-applying for registration for 18 months, and to refrain from acting as a brokerdealer’s registered representative or providing advisory services, until registered or exempt from
registration.
8.
On or about February 13, 2004, Disraeli filed an amended Form ADV with
the Commission, to claim that he met the Rule 203A-2(e) multi-state adviser exemption, which
permits Commission registration by advisers who are required by the laws of 30 or more states to
register as an adviser in those respective states. Disraeli claimed he qualified for the same
exemption in each of the amendments to his Form ADV filed on or about July 1, 2004, March 31,
2005 and November 9, 2005.
9.
Contrary to Disraeli’s statements in his Commission filings, Disraeli was
not required to register as an adviser in 30 or more states, and thus, was not qualified for the multistate exemption. At the time of his Commission filings referenced in paragraph B.8., Disraeli’s
only office was in Texas and all but one of his clients resided in Texas.

C.

The Lifeplan Offering

1.
From in or about September 2003 to in or about December 2003, and also in
or about December 2004 and in or about March 2005, (“the relevant period”) Disraeli offered and
sold 220,000 shares of Lifeplan common stock to approximately 11 of his investment advisory
clients. The offering, at $0.50 per share, raised a total of $105,000.
2.
During the relevant period, Disraeli solicited his clients by means of
material misrepresentations and omissions. Disraeli initially offered and sold Lifeplan stock with a
summary memorandum (the “Summary Memorandum”) and then, beginning in mid-to-late 2003,
through a full private offering memorandum (the “Final Memorandum”). Both documents
outlined essentially the same business plan—that Lifeplan would apply the offering proceeds to the
operation of various wealth management services and ventures, including the operation of the
advisory business and the creation of a limited partnership that would purchase and collect
distressed consumer debt.
3.
While the two memoranda differed in some respects, they contained the
same essential terms. Both memoranda stated that a maximum of $100,000 would be raised with a
$50,000 minimum and that Lifeplan would apply the offering proceeds to administrative and start
up expenses and working capital. The Final Memorandum further specified that Lifeplan would
hold and segregate the offering proceeds, for return to investors, until reaching a $50,000
minimum. The Final Memorandum also specified that, assuming $100,000 was raised, Lifeplan
would apply $42,000 to various administrative and start up expenses, and approximately $58,000
to working capital.
4.
Both memoranda represented that Disraeli would not receive a salary from
Lifeplan. The memoranda further stated that Disraeli’s compensation would be calculated based
on net profit, split pro-rata, between Disraeli and the other Lifeplan shareholders, according to their
ownership of Lifeplan. The Summary Memorandum further stated that the profits would be
calculated and paid quarterly.
5.
Lifeplan and Disraeli’s bank records reflect that Disraeli misappropriated as
much as $60,000 of investor funds for personal and non-business related expenditures contrary to
the representations in the offering memoranda. For example, on or about October 9, 2003, after
raising only $30,000 of the stated minimum $50,000, Disraeli transferred $12,000 from the
Lifeplan account to his personal bank account to cover the purchase of a $9,300 cashier’s check
payable to the IRS toward the release of a personal tax lien. Thereafter, between on or about
October 9 and December 31, 2003, Disraeli spent at least $50,700 of investor funds for various
personal items, debts and expenses, including rent on his personal residence, groceries, medical
fees, entertainment, charitable donations and dining. No investor funds were used for the purchase
and collection of distressed consumer debt and Lifeplan never launched any of the ventures
contemplated by the offering memoranda.

4

6.
As of December 31, 2003, $90,000 of investor funds had been deposited
and expended from Lifeplan’s bank account, including $83,500 transferred directly to Disraeli’s
personal bank account.
7.
During the relevant period, Disraeli did not disclose the use of investor
funds as described in paragraphs C.5. and C.6., above.
8.
Disraeli had discretionary authority and he received more than $500 in fees
more than six months in advance. During the relevant period, Disraeli never disclosed to his
clients his precarious financial condition as evidenced by, among other things, his federal tax liens,
his inability to pay rent on his personal residence for several months, and his indebtedness to
Lifeplan resulting from his misappropriations, all of which were reasonably likely to impair his
ability to meet his contractual commitments to his clients to implement and manage the Lifeplan
business plan.
9.
During the Commission’s January 2005 examination of Disraeli’s advisory
business, Disraeli produced a personal promissory note to Lifeplan, undated as to execution, for
$84,300, plus 8 percent annual interest to accrue from November 10, 2003, payable in a single
balloon payment of $106,193 on November 9, 2006. The purported loan to Disraeli was not
disclosed in the Lifeplan offering memoranda.
D.

Disraeli’s Lack of Record-Keeping and Form ADV Delivery

1.
Disraeli failed to keep books and records, such as journals, ledgers and
financial statements, for his advisory business.
2.
Disraeli only gave Form ADV Part II disclosures to his advisory clients in
November 2003. At no point thereafter did Disraeli deliver (or offer to deliver) updated ADV
Part II disclosures to his clients, annually or otherwise.
E.

Violations

1.
As a result of the conduct described above, Disraeli willfully violated, and
Lifeplan committed violations of, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, which prohibits fraudulent
conduct in the offer or sale of securities, and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5
thereunder, which prohibit fraudulent conduct in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.
2.
As a result of the conduct described above, Disraeli willfully violated
Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act, which prohibit fraudulent conduct by an
investment adviser, and Rule 206(4)-4(a)(1) thereunder. Rule 206(4)-4(a)(1) makes it a fraudulent,
deceptive, or manipulative act, practice, or course of business, for an adviser registered with the
Commission to fail to disclose to any client all material facts with respect to a financial condition
reasonably likely to impair the ability of the adviser to meet contractual commitments, if the
adviser has discretionary authority or custody over such client’s funds or securities, or requires
prepayment of advisory fees of more than $500 from such client, six months or more in advance.
5

3.
As a result of the conduct described above, Disraeli willfully violated
Section 203A of the Advisers Act, which provides that no investment adviser that is regulated or
required to be regulated as an investment adviser in the state in which it maintains its principal
office and place of business shall register under Section 203, unless the adviser has not less than
$25 million in assets under management or is an adviser to a registered investment company.
4.
As a result of the conduct described above, Disraeli willfully violated
Section 204 of the Advisers Act, which requires registered investment advisers to make, keep,
furnish and disseminate reports as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or
appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, and Rules 204-2(a)(1), 2042(a)(2), 204-2(a)(6), 204-3(a) and 204-3(c)(1) promulgated thereunder. Rule 204-2(a)(1) requires
an investment adviser registered with the Commission to make and keep a true, accurate and
current journal or journals, including cash receipts and disbursements, records, and any other
records of original entry forming the basis of entries in any ledger. Rule 204-(2)(a)(2) requires an
investment adviser registered with the Commission to make and keep true, accurate and current
general and auxiliary ledgers (or other comparable records) reflecting assets, liability, reserve,
capital, income and expense accounts. Rule 204-2(a)(6) requires an investment adviser registered
with the Commission to make and keep true, accurate and current trial balances, financial
statements, and internal audit work papers relating to the business of such investment adviser. Rule
204-3(a) generally requires a Commission-registered investment adviser to furnish each client with
a written disclosure statement that is either Part II of Form ADV or contains at least the information
required therein. Rule 204-3(c)(1) states that an investment adviser annually shall, without charge,
deliver or offer in writing to deliver upon written request to each of its advisory clients the
information required in Part II of Form ADV.
5.
As a result of the conduct described above, Disraeli willfully violated
Section 207 of the Advisers Act, which makes it unlawful for any person willfully to make any
untrue statement of a material fact in any registration application or report filed with the
Commission or willfully to omit to state in any such application or report any material fact that is
required to be stated therein.
III.
In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission deems it
necessary and appropriate in the public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist
proceedings be instituted to determine:
A.
Whether the allegations set forth in Section II are true and, in connection therewith,
to afford Respondents an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations;
B.
What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against
Respondent Disraeli pursuant to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act and Sections 203(e) and
203(f) of the Advisers Act including, but not limited to, civil money penalties;

6

C.
Whether, pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act, Section 21C of the Exchange
Act, and Section 203(k) of the Advisers Act, Respondent Disraeli should be ordered to cease and
desist from committing or causing violations of and any future violations of Section 17(a) of the
Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Sections 203A, 204,
206(1), 206(2) 206(4), and 207 of the Advisers Act, and Rules 204-2(a)(1), 204-2(a)(2), 2042(a)(6), 204-3(a), 204-3(c)(1) and 206(4)-4(a)(1) thereunder, and whether Respondent Disraeli
should be ordered to pay disgorgement pursuant to Section 8A(e) of the Securities Act, Section
21C(e) of the Exchange Act and Section 203(k)(5) of the Advisers Act; and
D.
Whether, pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act and Section 21C of the
Exchange Act, Respondent Lifeplan should be ordered to cease and desist from committing or
causing violations of and any future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section
10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.
IV.
IT IS ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on the questions
set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened not earlier than 30 days and not later than 60 days
from service of this Order at a time and place to be fixed, and before an Administrative Law Judge
to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17
C.F.R. § 201.110.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondents shall file an Answer to the allegations
contained in this Order within twenty (20) days after service of this Order, as provided by Rule 220
of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.220.
If Respondents fail to file the directed answer, or fail to appear at a hearing after being duly
notified, the Respondents may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be determined against
them upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true as
provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f) and 310 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R.
§§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f) and 201.310.
This Order shall be served forthwith upon Respondents personally or by certified mail.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an initial
decision no later than 300 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2) of
the Commission’s Rules of Practice.

7

In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission engaged
in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually related
proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, except as witness
or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice. Since this proceeding is not “rule making” within
the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not deemed subject to the
provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of any final Commission action.
By the Commission.
