In the Matter of
DENNIS J. MALOUF

ORDER GRANTING PARTIAL STAY
On July 27, 2016, the Commission issued an opinion and order (the "Order") finding that
Dennis J. Malouf, the majority owner, CEO, and president of UASNM, Inc. ("UASNM"), a
registered investment adviser, violated antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The
Commission found Malouf liable for failing to correct material misstatements in UASNM's
Forms ADV and on its website, for failing to disclose conflicts of interest, and for failing to seek
best execution for his clients' bond trades.1 The Commission barred Malouf from the securities
industry, imposed a cease-and-desist order, and ordered Malouf to pay disgorgement of
$562,001.26, plus prejudgment interest, and a $75,000 civil money penalty.
Malouf now moves for a stay of the sanctions pending judicial review. The Commission
considers the following four factors in determining whether to grant a stay: (i) whether there is a
strong likelihood that the moving party will succeed on the merits of its appeal; (ii) whether the
moving party will suffer irreparable harm without a stay; (iii) whether any person will suffer

substantial harm as a result of a stay; and (iv) whether a stay is likely to serve the public interest.2
The party seeking a stay has the burden of establishing that relief is warranted.3
Malouf argues that he is likely to prevail on appeal because the Commission applied the
wrong legal standard to hold him liable for violating Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933. According to
Malouf, Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) "should be interpreted the same" as Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) and
liability under Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) requires "the performance of an inherently deceptive act . . .
that is distinct from any alleged misstatement." But the Commission held that such a standard
"contravenes the plain text of the rule."4 The Commission recognized that Rule 10b-5(a)
proscribes deceptive "device[s]," "scheme[s]," and "artifice[s] to defraud," that Rule 10b-5(c)
proscribes (among other things) deceptive "act[s]," and that it "would be arbitrary to read those
terms as excluding the making, drafting, or devising of a misstatement."5 Because Malouf's
deceptive failure to correct material misstatements in UASNM's Forms ADV and on its website
in violation of his fiduciary duties also "operated as a 'device' or 'artifice' to defraud and an 'act,'
'practice,' and 'course of business' that misled his clients," the Commission found him liable for
violating Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) and Sections 17(a)(1) and (3).6
Malouf also argues that he is likely to succeed on appeal because he reasonably believed
that the relevant conflicts "had been disclosed," others at UASNM "removed the disclosures
from the ADVs that Respondent believed were there," and "it was not until January 2011 . . . that
Respondent became actually aware that the ADVs did not contain the disclosures." As the
Commission found, however, Malouf admitted to reviewing the Forms ADV.7 And he
acknowledged that as UASNM's CEO he was at least "partially responsible" for them.8
Malouf argues further that he is likely to succeed in arguing on appeal that he is not liable
for violating Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 or for aiding
and abetting and causing UASNM's violations of Advisers Act Section 206(4) and Rule 206(4)-1
thereunder and Section 207. Because Malouf merely repeats the arguments he makes regarding
liability under Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c), he has not demonstrated a
strong likelihood of success on this argument either.

In addition, Malouf claims that the Commission erred in finding that he failed to seek
best execution for his clients' bond trades. According to Malouf, the Commission should not
have "held Respondent to a best execution practice of 'seeking multiple competing bids' before
executing each trade." As the Commission stated, however, "the Division's expert witness
testified that because of their high liquidity and AAA rating, fulfilling the duty of best execution
for transactions in the Treasury and agency bonds at issue was primarily a matter of finding the
lowest available cost for the trade (i.e., the commission paid)," and that "because the commission
cost is the driving factor in achieving best execution for these bonds, the best general practice
was to seek multiple competing bids."9 Malouf also "agreed that the best approach to an
adviser's best execution responsibilities was to seek multiple competing bids for client
transactions." And Malouf "effectively concede[d] that the[] commissions were excessive."10
Malouf is no more likely to succeed on appeal on his argument that he is not liable
because others at UASNM as well as an outside compliance consultant were responsible for the
firm's best execution practices. The evidence established that Malouf executed between 60-70%
of all of UASNM's bond trades, that Malouf was responsible for the large-dollar-amount bond
trades at issue, and that Malouf's clients were the parties to the bond transactions on which
excessive commissions were paid.11 And the lead consultant testified that Malouf and others at
UASNM told him that UASNM always followed a multiple bid process when executing client
trades.12
Because the "first two factors" under the traditional standard for evaluating stay requests
"are the most critical,"13 and because Malouf fails to establish a strong likelihood of success on
the merits of his appeal, he must show irreparable injury absent a stay. Malouf claims that,
absent a stay, "he will not be able to continue as an investment adviser and will have no source

Id. Although Malouf argues that he satisfied his duty to seek best execution by using
BondDesk, a platform to research market prices, the Commission found that Malouf offered "no
evidence showing how BondDesk's information regarding bid and ask spreads would inform
Malouf as to the appropriate commissions he should pay to a broker-dealer." Id. at *19 n.131.
No more persuasive is Malouf's contention that he "frequently obtained outside bids on the bond
transactions." Malouf "conceded that he routinely failed to seek competing bids." Id. at *19.

Id. at *20-21. In his reply brief, Malouf asserts that FINRA Regulatory Notice 15-46
supports his argument that he did not have to obtain multiple competing bids before placing each
trade. He acknowledges that this notice "is not binding on the Commission." In any case, the
notice states that "when routing . . . larger-size orders in any security, regular and rigorous
review alone (as opposed to an order-by-order review) may not satisfy best execution
requirements." See Regulatory Notice 15-46, Best Execution, available at
http://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/notice_doc_file_ref/Notice_Regulatory_15-46.pdf.

of income with which to pay any civil penalty or disgorgement." But the Commission has held
repeatedly that "financial detriment does not amount to irreparable harm."14
Malouf also fails to show that the irreparable injury he claims he will suffer outweighs
the need to protect the public.15 The Commission found that Malouf's "continued work as an
investment adviser, combined with his apparent lack of understanding of the seriousness of his
misconduct demonstrates that a bar is necessary to protect investors."16 Likewise, the
Commission found the sufficient risk of future violations necessary to impose cease-and-desist
orders.17 Malouf does not explain why these sanctions should be stayed despite these findings.18
Accordingly, none of the four factors militates in favor of a stay.
Nonetheless, the Commission has at times stayed monetary sanctions pending appeal
without reference to the applicant's likelihood of success on the merits or the other components
of the four-factor test.19 Under the circumstances and as a matter of discretion, we elect to stay
the requirements in the Order that Malouf pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and a civil
money penalty pending the filing of a petition for review with a United States Court of Appeals
and, upon the timely filing of such a petition, pending the determination of that appeal.
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that the requirements in the Order that Malouf pay
disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and a civil money penalty are stayed for sixty days from
July 27, 2016 pending the filing of a petition for review with a United States Court of Appeals
and, upon the timely filing of such a petition, pending determination of that appeal and the
issuance of the court's mandate. The Order remains effective in all other respects.
For the Commission, by the Office of the General Counsel, pursuant to delegated
authority.

In his reply brief, Malouf asserts that absent a stay his customers will be harmed because
"they will necessarily have to seek the services of others." The Commission has held repeatedly
that "failures to appreciate one's regulatory obligations outweigh[] claims . . . about the possible
impact to clients." Harry W. Hunt, Exchange Act Release No. 68755, 2013 WL 325333, at *5
