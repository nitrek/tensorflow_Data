File No. 3-17551
REGULATION A EXEMPTION OF MED-X, INC. TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) announced the issuance
on September 16, 2016, of an Order Temporarily Suspending Exemption Pursuant to Section
3(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Regulation A thereunder, Statement of Reasons for Entry
of Order, and Notice of and Opportunity for Hearing (Order). The Order finds that Med-X, Inc.
(Med-X) filed a Regulation A Tier 2 Offering Statement (Offering Statement) which was
qualified by the Commission on November 3, 2015. Pursuant to Rule 257 of Regulation A, an
issuer whose offering statement has been qualified under Tier 2 must file with the Commission
an annual report on Form 1-K for the fiscal year in which the offering statement became
qualified and for any fiscal year thereafter. (17 C.F.R. § 230.257(b)(1)) Annual reports on Form
1-K must be filed within 120 calendar days after the end of the fiscal year covered by the report.
(17 C.F.R. § 239.91; General Instruction A.(2) of Form 1-K)
According to the Order, the Commission has reason to believe the following: Med-X, an issuer
of a Regulation A Tier 2 offering qualified in 2015, was required to file an annual report on
Form 1-K for the fiscal year 2015. Med-X operates on a fiscal year ending December 31. As
such, Med-X was required to file its annual report on Form 1-K by April 30, 2016. Med-X has
not filed the required annual report on Form 1-K.
Based on the above, the Order temporarily suspends Med-X’s exemption under Regulation A
pursuant to Rule 258(a). (17 C.F.R. § 230.258(a))
The Commission cautions brokers, dealers, shareholders, and prospective purchasers that they
should carefully consider the foregoing information along with all other currently available
information and any information subsequently issued by the company.
Any person with an interest in this matter may, within thirty (30) calendar days after entry of the
Commission’s Order against Med-X, file with the Commission a written request for a hearing for
the purpose of determining whether the suspension should be vacated or made permanent.
