SEC Sanctions Penny Stock Investor for Unregistered Trading

October 28, 2016 – The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a New York-based
penny stock investor and his entity with violating the federal securities laws when they sold
millions of shares of a microcap company to the investing public for sizeable profits.
Curt Kramer and his Great Neck, N.Y.-based entity, Hope Capital, Inc., agreed to disgorge those
profits and pay a penalty for a total of more than $679,000, to settle the charges.
An SEC investigation found that from mid-December 2008 through mid-May 2009, Kramer and
Hope Capital sold over 113.5 million shares of Spongetech Delivery Systems, Inc. (Spongetech)
stock to the investing public for profits of $525,603. Kramer and Hope Capital had obtained these
shares from two Spongetech affiliates in 16 private transactions, and at significant discounts from
market prices. Kramer had negotiated the purchase of the shares with Spongetech’s CFO. After
Kramer and Hope Capital received the shares, they sold the shares in U.S. public markets within
days or a few weeks of the purchases. The discount Kramer and Hope Capital received enabled
them to promptly sell the Spongetech shares at a profit. No registration statement was filed as to
any of the shares that Kramer and Hope Capital sold to the investing public, and no exemption
from registration requirements was applicable to these transactions.
The SEC’s order finds that Kramer and Hope Capital violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the
Securities Act of 1933. Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, Kramer and Hope
Capital consented to the entry of a cease and desist order, to a prohibition from acquiring any
security from any affiliate of an issuer of securities, and to pay disgorgement of $525,603, plus
prejudgment interest of $54,144. Kramer also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.
