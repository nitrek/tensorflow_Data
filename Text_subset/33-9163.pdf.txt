B.

SUMMARY

6.
Beginning in 2005, MMR, Martin, Rankin, Hubert, and Fimreite fraudulently
recommended, offered and sold eleven best-efforts, no minimum private placement debenture
offerings for eight small start-up companies, raising a total of more than $12 million. MMR
charged sales commissions and other forms of compensation on the offerings totaling upwards of
10% of the offering proceeds. The debenture offerings for all but one of the eight issuers are now
in default on payments of interest and/or principal. The disclosure documents for the debenture
offerings failed to disclose the manner in which Martin, Rankin, Hubert and Fimreite were
personally profiting from the offerings and operations of the issuers, which was material to an
evaluation of the objectivity of their recommendation of the securities. In addition, the disclosure
documents failed to disclose certain sales commissions received for two of the offerings by the
Respondents. The Respondents made other material misrepresentations and omissions regarding
the business of one of the issuers and the fact that the issuer had defaulted with respect to earlier
investors. MMR, Martin, Hubert, and Fimreite also failed to determine that the debentures were
suitable for their customers before recommending the debentures. The debentures were
unsuitable for numerous MMR customers given the level of risk in light of the customers’
investment objectives, advanced age, annual income, and net worth. In addition, MMR and
Martin failed reasonably to supervise Hubert and Fimreite with a view to preventing their
violations of the securities laws.

C.

BACKGROUND

7.
In 1985, Martin and his father formed MMR as a broker-dealer intended to raise
funds for churches. MMR primarily sold church bonds for 20 years. MMR developed a large
customer base throughout the United States.
8.
In 2004, MMR’s market for church bonds was depleted. As a result of MMR’s
nearly exclusive reliance on church bonds for its business, it was unable to meet at least 50% of its
2004 payroll.
9.
Beginning in early 2005, MMR changed its business model and underwrote eleven
best-efforts debenture offerings. The offerings promised a 10% to 11% annual return and had no
minimum amount to be sold. The offerings were as follows:
a.
$697,000;

Dynamic Distribution, Inc. (“Dynamic”), October 2006 – September 2007, raising

b.
$2,493,000;

El Pegasu Developmental, Inc. (“El Pegasu”), March 2005 – February 2006, raising

c.
$1,924,000;

Equity Capital Source, Inc. (“ECSI”), October 2006 – September 2007, raising

d.
$2,118,000;

Havoc Distribution, Inc. (“Havoc”), March 2006 – February 2007, raising

e.
MLP Associates, LLC (“MLP”), October 2005 – September 2007, raising
$2,036,000 and October 2008 – September 2009, raising $1,391,996 consisting of $245,000 in new
funds and the remainder in rollovers from the first MLP offering;
f.
Partners in Care (“PIC”), June 2007 – December 2007, raising $600,000 and
August 2008 – July 2009, raising $999,999 consisting of $399,999 in new funds and the remainder
in rollovers from the first PIC offering;
g.
Southfield Energy Corp. (“Southfield”), August 2006 – November 2007, raising
$758,000 and December 2007 – present, raising $954,000; and
h.
Vending Ventures, Inc. (“Vending Ventures”), December 2007 – November 2008,
raising $354,000.
10.
The debenture companies were all created by acquaintances of Martin and they
encompassed a multitude of business endeavors. Dynamic and Vending Ventures were created to
distribute Havoc Energy Drink, which was manufactured by Havoc. El Pegasu and MLP were
created to provide interim funding for residential home construction, and MLP was also to provide
interim funding for construction of income-producing properties. ECSI was created to contract
3


with faith-based organizations to develop senior housing projects. PIC was formed to supply
specialty nurses to hospitals with personnel shortages. Southfield was created to invest in and hold
fractional interests in exploration, development, and production of oil and gas.
11.
Hubert and Fimreite were the MMR registered representatives who sold most of the
debentures. Martin was their supervisor and was responsible for performing due diligence on the
offerings. Rankin was the assistant compliance officer; he also was responsible for performing due
diligence on the offerings, and he drafted the disclosure memoranda for all but two of the offerings.
12.
MMR earned a total of $1,377,835 from the sale of $12,200,000 in debentures,
consisting of $915,227 in commissions, $392,858 in non-accountable allowances, and $69,750 in
technical assistance fees.
13.
Many of MMR’s customers were financially conservative, older investors, either
retired or near retirement. Many had limited net worth and/or limited annual income.
14.
Each debenture company, other than Southfield, is in default as to repayment upon
maturity and/or for interest payments due on the debentures.
15.
Martin and Rankin created Sunflower Management Group LLC, (“Sunflower”), a
non-registered entity, near the time of the first debenture offering. Sunflower was created to
manage the proceeds of the debenture sales. It set up accounts to deposit invested funds, disburse
proceeds to the issuer, track the amount raised, pay interest when due, and eventually repay
principal.
16.
Sunflower’s monthly management fees, which were charged to the debenture
companies, were 1/12 of 1% of the total outstanding debentures. Sunflower earned a total of
$233,370 for managing the proceeds of the eleven debenture offerings
17.
Martin and Rankin each own 40% of Sunflower. Fimreite owns 10% and Sherril
Hubert, who is Martin’s sister and Hubert’s wife, owns the remaining 10%. The Respondents
profited from Sunflower’s management fees which were tied to the amount of debentures MMR
placed.
D. 	

MISREPRESENTATIONS AND OMISSIONS TO INVESTORS AND
PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS IN THE DEBENTURE OFFERINGS

18.
The Respondents made material misstatements and omissions in relation to each
debenture offering.
19. 	

In relation to the 2008 MLP offering, the Respondents failed to disclose that:

a. 	

MLP’s business model changed materially from 2005 to 2008.

4


b.
MLP had defaulted on maturing debentures from its 2005 offering. MLP defaulted
on repayment of principal in October 2008, the same month MMR began to sell debentures in the
2008 offering.
20.
With respect to all of the offerings, Respondents failed to disclose the extent to
which they would benefit from investors’ purchases of the debentures, which was a material
omission in light of their recommendation of the debentures. In relation to their compensation and
ownership, Respondents failed to disclose:
a.

Their ownership interest in Sunflower.

b.

The amount of Sunflower’s management fee.

c.
That Havoc, Dynamic, Vending Ventures, Southfield, and PIC all issued shares to
Sunflower and/or its assigns, pursuant to the management agreements between those companies
and Sunflower. Only for the Vending Ventures offering was Sunflower’s ownership interest
disclosed.
d.
That Martin, Rankin, Hubert and Fimreite, through Sunflower, would be receiving
shares of the debenture issuers pursuant to Sunflower’s management agreements with the
debenture companies. In fact, they received the following shares:
1)
Martin received 680,000 Havoc shares, 900,000 Dynamic shares, 360,000
Southfield shares, and 700,000 PIC shares;
2)
Rankin received 320,000 Havoc shares, 670,000 Dynamic shares, 237,000
Southfield shares, and 550,000 PIC shares;
3)
Hubert received 100,000 Havoc shares, 200,000 Dynamic shares, 60,000
Southfield shares, 980,000 Vending Ventures shares, and 100,000 PIC shares; and
4)
Fimreite received 150,000 Havoc shares, 687,280 Dynamic shares, 60,000
Southfield shares, 1,727,500 Vending Ventures shares, and 100,000 PIC shares.
e.
That Martin and Rankin each owned units in ECSI. The original offering
memorandum did not disclose the ownership interest. MMR did not issue an addendum to the
offering memorandum disclosing the ownership interest until after an SEC examination in 2007.
21.
Respondents failed to disclose that Sunflower would be managing the offering
proceeds for the initial Southfield offering.
22.
The Respondents knew or were reckless in not knowing of these material
misrepresentations and omissions.

5


E.

T
	 HE DEBENTURE OFFERINGS WERE UNSUITABLE FOR MMR’S
CUSTOMERS

23.
Apart from one church bond offering for a limited period of time, from 2005 through
2008, MMR had no investments to offer its customers other than the debentures, which were
illiquid and high risk investments in start-up ventures that needed funding.
24.
Martin, Hubert, and Fimreite were aware of their obligation to determine whether a
security that they recommended was suitable for their customers. MMR’s Written Supervisory
Procedures required the registered representatives to have reasonable grounds to believe a
recommendation was not unsuitable for a customer.
25.
MMR’s Written Supervisory Procedures further required each sale to be evidenced
by the “initials of the President, Vice-President, or Compliance Officer on the Purchase Order
Form.” This provision required the officer to make an independent determination of suitability.
Further, as President, Martin was responsible for drafting MMR’s Written Supervisory Procedures
and for implementing a system to ensure compliance with those procedures.
26.
Martin, Hubert, and Fimreite knew or were reckless in not knowing that the
debentures were high risk investments. The offering documents for the debentures expressly stated
that the debentures were “speculative and an investment in debentures involves a high degree of
risk.” The documents further stated that the debentures should not be purchased by investors who
could not withstand a “substantial loss.” Fimreite and Hubert admitted that the debentures would
only be suitable for someone with a high yield investment objective.
27.
The debentures were unsuitable for numerous MMR customers to whom the
investment was recommended by Hubert or Fimreite and the sales in most cases were approved by
Martin. Nearly all of these customers were long-term MMR customers who relied upon Hubert’s
and Fimreite’s recommendations. In 2005, when MMR sold the first debentures, over half of the
customers were over 70 and 11 were in their 80’s. Ten had annual income under $25,000, and
the vast majority had annual income under $50,000. Twenty-four had net worth of less than
$500,000, a minimum Martin later required for the sale of debentures. In 15 instances MMR
placed as much as 20% or more of a customer’s net worth in the debentures. Eight households
or individuals held more than 25% of their net worth in debentures. In looking at the customers’
investment objectives, ten investors had low risk investment objectives (retirement, preretirement, and income) for which the debentures were plainly unsuitable. Twenty-six investors
had an investment objective of growth, but there was almost no prospect for growth in this
investment because it was a debt instrument paying a fixed rate of return. Finally, although
account documents for 15 investors reflected high yield as their stated investment objective, that
designation did not genuinely reflect their investment objectives because MMR and its registered
representatives caused the designation to be made without disclosing to customers the risks
inherent in such designation at the time the firm caused the designation to be made.

6


F. 	

MMR AND MARTIN FAILED REASONABLY TO SUPERVISE HUBERT AND
FIMREITE

28.
MMR had in place supervisory procedures relevant to suitability determinations.
Under these procedures, the firm gathered customer information that could have been used to make
suitability determinations, and registered representatives were affirmatively required to make
suitability determinations. A principal of the firm was responsible for making an independent
suitability assessment for each transaction, which in most instances was Martin. While these
procedures appeared reasonably designed to assess suitability, MMR and Martin, as president,
failed to establish reasonable systems to implement the procedures. As a result, MMR’s
supervisory procedures were not adequately implemented and MMR and Martin failed reasonably
to supervise Hubert and Fimreite.
G.

	VIOLATIONS

29.
As a result of the conduct described above, MMR, Martin, Rankin, Hubert, and
Fimreite willfully violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange
Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, which prohibit fraudulent conduct in the offer and sale of securities
and in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.
30.
Alternatively, as a result of the conduct above, Martin, Rankin, Hubert and Fimreite
willfully aided and abetted and caused MMR’s violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 10b-5 thereunder based on the false and misleading disclosure documents for the
debentures.
31.
As a result of the conduct described above, MMR willfully violated Section 15(c)
of the Exchange Act, which similarly prohibits fraudulent conduct in the offer and sale of securities
and in connection with the purchase or sale of securities by broker-dealers. Martin, Rankin,
Hubert, and Fimreite willfully aided and abetted and caused MMR’s violation of Section 15(c) of
the Exchange Act.
32.
As a result of the conduct described above, MMR willfully violated Section 17(a)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-3(a)(17)(i)(B)(1) thereunder, which requires that customers
receive an explanation of the terms regarding investment objectives. Martin, Rankin, Hubert, and
Fimreite willfully aided and abetted and caused MMR’s violation of Section 17(a) of the Exchange
Act.
33.
As a result of the conduct described above, MMR and Martin failed reasonably to
supervise Hubert and Fimreite with a view to preventing their violations of Section 17(a) of the
Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, within the
meaning of Sections 15(b)(4) and 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act.

III.
In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission deems it
necessary and appropriate in the public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist
proceedings be instituted to determine:
A.
Whether the allegations set forth in Section II hereof are true and, in connection
therewith, to afford Respondents an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations;
B.
What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against MMR,
Martin, Rankin, Hubert, and Fimreite pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act including, but
not limited to, disgorgement and civil penalties pursuant to Section 21B of the Exchange Act, based
upon their willful violations and willful aiding and abetting violations alleged above;
C.
What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against MMR and
Martin pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act including, but not limited to, disgorgement
and civil penalties pursuant to Section 21B of the Exchange Act, based upon their failure reasonably
to supervise Hubert and Fimreite as alleged above;
D.
Whether, pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act and Section 21C of the
Exchange Act, all of the Respondents should be ordered to cease and desist from committing or
causing violations and any future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b)
and 15(c) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and whether all of the Respondents
should be ordered to pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest thereon pursuant to Section 8A of
the Securities Act and Section 21C of the Exchange Act; and
E.
Whether, pursuant to Section 308 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a Fair Fund should
be established for the benefit of defrauded investors to distribute to affected investors any
disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalty payments that may be made.

IV.
IT IS ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on the questions
set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened not earlier than 30 days and not later than 60 days
from service of this Order at a time and place to be fixed, and before an Administrative Law Judge
to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17
C.F.R. § 201.110.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondents shall file an Answer to the allegations
contained in this Order within twenty (20) days after service of this Order, as provided by Rule 220
of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.220.

8


If Respondents fail to file the directed answer, or fail to appear at a hearing after being duly
notified, the Respondents may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be determined against
them upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true as
provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f) and 310 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R.
§§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f) and 201.310.
This Order shall be served forthwith upon Respondents personally or by certified mail.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an initial
decision no later than 300 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2) of
the Commission’s Rules of Practice.
In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission engaged
in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually related
proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, except as witness
or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice. Since this proceeding is not “rule making” within
the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not deemed subject to the
provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of any final Commission action.
By the Commission.
