In the Matter of
JOSEPH P. DOXEY

OPINION OF THE COMMISSION
CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDING
Remand of Proceeding
Evidence did not support summary disposition of allegations of antifraud and registration
violations. Held, matter is remanded for further proceedings.
APPEARANCES:
Joseph P. Doxey, pro se.
Ryan Farney, Nina B. Finston, and James E. Smith, for the Division of Enforcement.
Appeal filed: June 10, 2014
Last brief received: August 13, 2014
This matter concerns a series of press releases and offers and sales of securities by Pure
H20 Bio-Technologies, Inc. (“Pure H20” or the “Company”) and its chief executive officer,
Joseph P. Doxey. The press releases concerned Pure H20’s efforts to bring to market a water
disinfection system, the Integrated Hospital Potable Water Disinfection System (the “System”),
for use by hospitals and other medical facilities. Pure H20 sought certification for the System by
NSF International, which had developed a protocol for certifying water purifiers. Although
certification was not legally required to sell its System, the Company saw NSF certification as
critical to marketing the System to hospitals. Pure H20, through Doxey, also offered and sold
unregistered securities to raise capital for the development of the System.

2
Doxey appeals from an initial decision in which, on summary disposition, the
administrative law judge found that Doxey had violated the antifraud provisions of the Securities
Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 because he made material
misrepresentations and omissions concerning, among other things, the certification process, and
violated the registration provisions of the Securities Act when he orchestrated unregistered offers
and sales of Pure H20 stock. The law judge ordered Doxey to cease and desist from committing
or causing those violations and disgorge $57,654 plus prejudgment interest, and barred him from
acting as an officer or director of a public issuer or participating in an offering of penny stock.
Doxey proceeded pro se before the law judge, and proceeds pro se in this appeal to the
Commission.
After reviewing the record and applying the same summary disposition standard as the
law judge,1 we find that disputed issues of material fact exist with regard to both the alleged
fraud and registration violations. We, therefore, are remanding all the claims to the law judge,
directing that further proceedings and a hearing be held consistent with this opinion.
I.
A.

Fraud Allegations

Background

The Division alleged in the Order Instituting Proceedings (“OIP”) that Doxey violated the
antifraud provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act when Pure H20 issued six press
releases about its efforts to obtain certification by NSF. The Division alleged that the press
releases were false and misleading because they stated that NSF certification was expected in
four months or less or was already “underway” when, in fact, “the NSF certification process
never commenced” and the “time required to complete certification was beyond that referenced
in the press releases.” The Division also alleged that the press releases failed to disclose that the
Company lacked the resources to obtain NSF certification.
Separately, the Division alleged that Doxey made material misrepresentations to William
J. Daniels, Observation Capital’s sole owner, officer, and director, to induce Observation Capital
to purchase Pure H20 stock. The Division claims that, in a meeting in late summer 2008, Doxey

Under our Rule of Practice 250, a motion for summary disposition may be granted “if
there is no genuine issue with regard to any material fact and the party making the motion is
entitled to a summary disposition as a matter of law.” 17 C.F.R. § 201.250(b); Jeffrey L. Gibson,
Exchange Act Release No. 57266, 2008 WL 294717, at *5 (Feb. 4, 2008) (“[C]ourts have upheld
summary disposition where no genuine issue of material fact is in dispute.”). Rule 250 also
provides that “[t]he facts of the pleadings of the party against whom the motion is made shall be
taken as true, except as modified by stipulations or admissions made by that party, by
uncontested affidavits, or by facts officially noted pursuant to § 201.323.” 17 C.F.R.

and factual inferences “in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.” SEC v. Monterosso,

represented to Daniels that the Company's System “was completely built, that an inventory of the
product had been amassed, and that [the System] was then undergoing NSF certification.” Those
statements, according to the Division, were false and misleading.
On the Division’s motion for summary disposition, the law judge held that Doxey “made
numerous misrepresentations and omissions [in the Press Releases] in connection with sale of
securities in interstate commerce.” The law judge held that Doxey’s misrepresentations and
omissions were “material” and that he “acted with a high degree of scienter by knowingly
distributing” the misleading press releases. The law judge made no findings about the
allegations that Doxey fraudulently misled Daniels about Pure H20’s prospects during a 2008
meeting.
B.

Analysis

For Doxey to be liable for fraud under Securities Act Section 17(a), the Division must
prove that he, in the offer or sale of securities, employed a device, scheme, or artifice to defraud;
obtained money or property by means of any untrue statement of material fact; or engaged in any
transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit
upon the purchaser.2 For Doxey to be liable under Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5,
the Division must prove that he, in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, employed
any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud; made any untrue statement of material fact; or
engaged in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or
deceit upon any person.3
Scienter is required to establish violations of Section 17(a)(1) and Section 10(b) and Rule
10b-5. Scienter— a “mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud”5— may
be shown by recklessness, “‘an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care, and which
presents a danger of misleading buyers or sellers that is either known to the [actor] or is so
obvious that the actor must have been aware of it.’”6

Because Doxey appeals from a decision on a motion for summary disposition, we
construe the facts and draw all reasonable inferences regarding the allegations in the light most

favorable to Doxey.7 In so doing, we conclude that, contrary to the law judge's findings, there
are material facts in dispute that preclude finding, on summary disposition, that Doxey engaged
in fraud. Specifically, there are material facts in dispute about whether the statements in the
press releases are false or misrepresentations and, if they are, whether Doxey acted with
scienter.8
With respect to the statements in the press releases, the following is undisputed. Pure
H20 engaged an independent laboratory to conduct testing on the System it had developed. By
early 2008, the laboratory's testing showed that the System met the NSF protocol for most types
of contaminants. However, for cryptosporidium, a type of water-born parasite, test results
showed that the Company's system did not achieve the level of purification required by the NSF
protocol.
Thereafter, Doxey drafted and disseminated the six press releases issued between April
2008 and May 2009. All of these releases contained similar language regarding the prospect of
obtaining NSF certification. The April 1, 2008 and October 22, 2008 press releases, for
example, both stated that NSF certification was “expected to be completed within a few short
months and has a high likelihood for success.” Similarly, the January 29, 2009 and April 1, 2009
press releases stated that “[c]ertification of this system is expected to be completed within this
1st quarter and has a high likelihood for success.” The March 3, 2009 press release stated that
Pure H20 was “anxiously awaiting final certification,” and the May 4, 2009 press release stated
that NSF certification was “underway.”
The Division contended that the statements about the possibility of obtaining NSF
certification were materially false and misleading. The law judge agreed, finding that the
certification work was not yet underway and Pure H20 could not have met certification
requirements without additional funds, which it did not have.
But our review of the evidence, in the light most favorable to Doxey, reveals that there
are facts that suggest that these statements were not false. For example, Doxey testified during
the investigation that all that had to be done to meet the required reduction threshold was to
“increase the contact time”—i.e., increase the amount of time the disinfection agent is in contact
with the water—which Doxey believed “was no big deal.” In other portions of his testimony he
indicated that Pure H20 could have easily modified the System (or modified the test performed)
in order to meet the required level of cryptosporidium reduction for the NSF protocol. Doxey
also testified about the ultimate cost and timeline for NSF certification, including that an
unidentified NSF official told him that certification could be completed within 30 days and that
NSF ultimately agreed to complete the certification process for $25,000, which was less than the

See supra note 1.

Although violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) do not require scienter, see SEC v.
Monterosso, 756 F.3d 1326, 1334 (11th Cir. 2014) (stating that to show a violation of Section
17(a)(2) or (3), the SEC need only demonstrate negligence), the law judge did not make findings
concerning Doxey’s conduct in the offers and sales to Daniels and Observation Capital,
including whether Doxey’s conduct was negligent or violated 17(a)(2) and (3).

5
proceeds from the Company's stock offering.9 All of this testimony, if credited, would be
consistent with the statements in the press releases that certification was underway, had a high
likelihood of success and would be completed in short order.
Although the Division, in essence, argues that Doxey’s testimony should not be credited,
neither it nor the law judge identified any evidence that—at least as required to prevail on a
summary disposition motion—establishes as a matter of law that the statements were false or
misleading. In fact, there was evidence that supports Doxey’s statements about the progress,
timing, and likelihood of certification. Doxey submitted an exhibit that appears to be a signed
contract between Pure H20 and NSF dated April 2008, and both Doxey and a NSF employee
testified during the investigation that NSF agreed to accept the testing that the Company had
already conducted through the independent lab.10 A NSF employee also testified that “[a]verage
certification time . . . would be three to four months,” depending on the amount of testing
involved, and that, if there were not a lot of testing, certification could cost $25,000 or less.11
In light of this evidence, we cannot find that the statements in the press releases were
false or misleading as a matter of law. There is evidence at this point in the proceeding
suggesting that Doxey had a basis for representing that the certification was “underway” and for
predicting that NSF certification would be obtained within the schedule indicated in the press
releases, and that Pure H20 could have obtained certification relatively quickly, without raising a
significant amount of additional funds.
Furthermore, this and other evidence creates a material dispute as to Doxey's scienter. In
his answer to the OIP, Doxey denied that he had made any misrepresentations or acted with
scienter and the evidence discussed above, including his testimony and that of NSF employees,
suggests he could have believed the statements made were true. The law judge nonetheless
concluded that Doxey's investigative testimony contained admissions about his knowledge of the
accuracy of the press releases. Specifically, the law judge found scienter because Doxey (1)
“conceded” that investors would have to “read between the lines” of the press releases to
understand that “NSF certification was contingent on obtaining money,” (2) “he acknowledged
that the April 2009 Press Release did not address the fact that Pure H20 had to conduct further
cryptosporidium testing prior to going to NSF for certification testing,” and (3) “he generally

9

See Farney Decl., Ex. 7 at 14-15 (Doxey Tr. 50-51) (“I negotiated NSF all the way down
to $25 thousand . . . . I asked NSF, I said how long is this going to take, and they told me 30
days . . . . I asked if she would put that in writing, she said I’ll put 120 days in writing.”).

In investigative testimony before the Division, NSF employee Ellen Van Buren testified
that “NSF looked into that other lab and determined we would be able to accept that test data.”
Farney Decl., Ex. 6 at 15 (Tr. 54).
11

See Farney Decl., Ex. 6 at 9-10 (Van Buren Tr. 31-32, 34-36). Van Buren testified that
although “it would be difficult to get a certification done for twenty-five thousand dollars,” it
was “possible” depending “on the specifics of the product,” and that $25,000 for certification
was not “a minimum in any way.” Id. at 9 (Van Buren Tr. 32).

6
admitted that aspects of the Six Press Releases did not reflect Pure H20's and the System's status
at the time.”12
But, again, viewing the evidence and the factual inferences in the light most favorable to
Doxey, we cannot conclude that his investigative testimony establishes as a matter of law that he
acted with scienter. The three “admissions” in Doxey’s investigative testimony must be
considered alongside the other parts of his testimony. Doxey consistently and repeatedly
maintained throughout his testimony that he believed in the fundamental accuracy of the
statements in the press releases. And he repeatedly disclaimed any intent to deceive. For
example, Doxey stated, “I have to say now reviewing all these press releases I did not give my
undivided attention to thoroughly write these things the proper way but there was no intent for
me to misrepresent anything.”13
In any event, it is not clear that the “admissions” are in fact, acknowledgements by
Doxey that he intended to deceive. While he did acknowledge that the April 2009 press release
did not specifically disclose the need for further cryptosporidium testing prior to sending the
System to NSF, he also testified that the further cryptosporidium testing that was needed could
be completed within approximately “a week” and was “no big deal.” Separately, although the
law judge found that Doxey “generally admitted that aspects of the Six Press Releases did not
reflect Pure H20's and the System's status at the time,” the transcript pages cited by the law judge
contain no general admissions about the falsity of the Press Releases that we can discern.
Finally, the statement that investors would have to “read between the lines” of the press releases
to understand that “NSF certification was contingent on obtaining money,” is not an admission
by Doxey that he intended to mislead investors by issuing the press releases. The record
suggests, as we noted, that whatever the money required to be raised, Doxey and others believed
it could be less than $25,000, and therefore not a barrier to obtaining certification.
For these reasons, we hold that it was error to grant summary disposition as to the
Division’s fraud allegations. We therefore are remanding with instructions to the law judge to
conduct an evidentiary hearing on those claims.

Registration Allegation

Background

We also hold that it was error to grant summary disposition as to the claims under Section
5 of the Securities Act. The Division alleged that Doxey violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) by
12
13

Doxey, 2014 WL 1943919, at *10, 16 (internal citations omitted).

Scienter may also be shown if Doxey recklessly disregarded the accuracy of the
statements at issue. See, e.g., SEC v. McNulty, 137 F.3d 732, 741 (2d Cir. 1998) (holding in the
context of misrepresentations that scienter “may be established through a showing of reckless
disregard for the truth” of the statements made). But, as discussed above, because there are
genuine factual disputes about whether the statements in the press releases were materially false
or misleading, we cannot conclude, as a matter of law, that Doxey was reckless with regard to
their accuracy.

7
orchestrating the offer and sale of nearly 360 million Company shares to Observation Capital.
Although undisputed evidence establishes many of the facts necessary for certain elements of
those claims, there are material disputes as to others that preclude a finding of liability on a
motion for summary disposition. We begin by summarizing the relevant evidence and then
apply the pertinent legal principles governing the analysis for a Section 5 claim.
Between October 2008 and May 2009, Pure H20 offered and sold nearly 360 million
shares of its stock to Observation Capital, LLC in 12 transactions, generating total sales proceeds
for the Company of $57,654. Testimony and documentary evidence show that Doxey personally
orchestrated the offers and sales of the stock on behalf of Pure H20 with Doxey negotiating the
terms of the sales with Daniels, including via telephone and e-mail. The subscription agreements
were all signed by Doxey on behalf of Pure H20. And instruction letters in the record show that
Doxey directed the transfer agent to issue the Pure H20 shares—specifically indicating that the
shares could be issued without a restrictive legend. The instruction letters and related
correspondence also show that Doxey communicated with the transfer agent via facsimile and email. Doxey did not submit any evidence to the contrary concerning his involvement in the
offers and sales.
The record also contains legal opinion letters procured by Doxey, which contended that
the sales were exempt from registration under Rule 504 of Regulation D and that the shares “may
be issued without a legend restricting the resale thereof.” The Division submitted an EDGAR
printout of Pure H20’s filings during the relevant period showing that Pure H20 never filed a
registration statement for the 12 transactions. Doxey did not challenge the evidence or dispute
the allegation that the Company had not filed any registration statements.
B.

Analysis

Section 5(a) of the Securities Act prohibits the sale of any security, in interstate
commerce, “unless a registration statement is in effect.”14 Section 5(c) similarly prohibits the
“offer to sell” any security, in interstate commerce, “unless a registration statement has been
filed as to such security.”15 The Division can establish a prima facie case that Doxey violated
Section 5 by demonstrating that (1) Doxey directly or indirectly sold and offered to sell
securities; (2) through the use of interstate facilities or the mails; (3) when no registration
statement was in effect or filed for those securities.16 Section 5 imposes strict liability on sellers
engaged in unregistered transactions,17 and the Division is not required to show scienter. Once

8
the Division has established a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the respondent to show that
the securities are exempt from the registration requirements.18
We find that there are no disputed issues of material fact as to the prima facie violation of
Section 5 by Doxey. And we find as a matter of law that the transactions were not exempt from
registration under Securities Act Section 4(a)(1) or Rule 504(b)(1)(iii) of Regulation D. But we
find that there was insufficient evidence in the record to make a determination, as a matter of
law, concerning Doxey’s claim that the transactions were exempt from registration under Rules
504 and 506 of Regulation D. If the transactions were exempt, as Doxey alleges, then he is not
liable under Section 5 of the Securities Act. Consequently, we are remanding the Section 5
claims to the law judge for the purpose of determining whether the transactions were exempt
under either Rule 504 or 506.19
1. Doxey’s prima facie violation
a. Doxey sold securities.
“To demonstrate that a defendant sold securities, the SEC must prove that the defendant
was a ‘necessary participant’ or ‘substantial factor’ in the illicit sale.”20 The offers and sales
would not have taken place without Doxey’s involvement. He was the sole person responsible
for offering and selling Pure H20 stock to Observation Capital in the 12 different transactions.
Doxey orchestrated every aspect of the offers and sales on behalf of Pure H20: he negotiated the
sales, signed the subscription agreements, procured legal opinion letters, and directed the transfer
agent to issue the shares. In opposing the Division's motion for summary disposition, Doxey
offered no evidence to the contrary. Doxey was therefore certainly a “necessary participant” or
“substantial factor” in the securities transactions.21

18

See SEC v. Platforms Wireless Int’l Corp., 617 F.3d 1072, 1086 (9th Cir. 2010);
Cavanaugh, 445 F.3d at 111 n.13.
19

Because Doxey has made no argument in this regard, we do not specifically address
Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, which states that the provisions of Section 5 shall not apply
to the transactions of an issuer not involving any public offering, 15 U.S.C. § 77d(a)(2), but the
law judge may consider the application of Section 4(a)(2) on remand.

See, e.g., SEC v. Imperiali, Inc., 594 F. App’x 957, 960 (11th Cir. 2014) (holding that the
founder and chief executive of the issuer was a “substantial factor” in the sale of securities when
he “dictated or personally prepared press releases and memoranda to tout” the company stock,
filed a Form D on behalf of the company “that included information about the sale of stock and
bore his signature as the president of the company,” and acted as the “closer” for the company’s
sales to investors).

9
b. Doxey used instrumentalities of interstate commerce.
There is no dispute that Doxey used instrumentalities of interstate commerce to offer and
sell the Pure H20 stock. He communicated via facsimile, e-mail, and telephone with relevant
individuals such as Daniels and the transfer agent, all of which establish the jurisdictional nexus
for Section 5 liability.22
c. There was no registration statement in effect.
It is undisputed that there was no registration statement filed or in effect for any of sales
of the Pure H20 shares offered and sold to Observation Capital.
2. Claimed Exemptions
Because the Division established a prima facie violation of Section 5, the burden shifted
to Doxey to prove the existence of an applicable exemption. “It is well-established that
exemptions from the general policy of the Securities Act requiring registration are strictly
construed against the claimant of such an exemption and the burden of proof is on the
claimant.”23 “Registration exemptions are construed strictly to promote full disclosure of
information for the protection of the investing public. Evidence in support of an exemption must
be explicit, exact, and not built on conclusory statements.”24
To meet this burden, Doxey argued below that sales of Pure H20 stock were “extended
certain exemptions under Rules 504, 506, and 144.” But the law judge found that, beyond
conclusory arguments, Doxey had not provided any evidence that these exemptions were
applicable to his sales and, therefore, Doxey failed to meet his burden.
In his appeal, Doxey makes no specific arguments about the Section 5 claims, and asserts
only that he “disagrees with [the] finding in its entirety.” But in light of Doxey’s pro se status
and the particular posture of this case, we consider the evidence and Doxey’s assertion in his
reply to the Division’s motion for summary disposition that Pure H20 “was extended certain
exemptions under Rule 504, 506 and 144.”

22

See SEC v. Softpoint, Inc., 958 F. Supp. 846, 861 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (noting that the
required interstate nexus of Section 5 is “broadly construed” and is satisfied by even “tangential
mailings or intrastate telephone calls”), aff’d, 159 F.3d 1348 (2d Cir. 1998); cf. United States v.
Forehand, 577 F. App’x 942, 947 (11th Cir. 2014) (affirming a conviction for violation of the
Securities Act and noting that the interstate nexus was satisfied by use of “the mail, telephones,
and the internet”).

a. Rule 504 of Regulation D
Securities Act Rule 504 of Regulation D provides for an exemption from Section 5’s
registration requirements for offers and sales by issuers if certain conditions are satisfied.25
Regulation D was adopted in 1982 and the exemptions provided in the regulation were designed
to simplify existing rules, eliminate unnecessary restrictions on small businesses, and achieve
uniformity between state and federal exemptions in order to facilitate capital formation
consistent with the protection of investors.26 Regulation D was amended in 1999 to restrict
resales of securities issued under a Regulation D exemption.27
First, the issuer must not be subject to the reporting requirements of Sections 13 or 15(d)
of the Exchange Act; an investment company; or a development stage company that does not
have a specific business plan or purpose, as described in Rule 504(a)(3).28 Pure H20 was not
subject to Exchange Act reporting requirements, and was not an investment or development
stage company.
Second, for the exemption under Rule 504 to apply, the aggregate price of the offers and
sales cannot exceed $1,000,000 in any 12-month period.29 Pure H20’s aggregate sales of
$57,654 met this requirement.
Third, the offers and sales must satisfy certain requirements of Rule 502—including Rule
502(c)’s prohibition on the use of general solicitation or general advertising, and Rule 502(d)’s
requirement that the issuer exercise reasonable care to limit resales, except as provided under
Rule 504(b)(1).30
There is insufficient evidence to determine as a matter of law that Doxey or Pure H20
engaged in general solicitation or general advertising. On remand, the law judge should consider

11
the nature of the relationship, if any, between Doxey and Daniels prior to the offers and sales in
2008. In Doxey’s reply to the Division’s motion for summary disposition, Doxey refers to two
contracts between Pure H20 and Observation Capital that pre-date the period of offers and sales
alleged in the OIP—a contract to pay third party debt and a consulting agreement. Those
contracts suggest that there may have been a pre-existing substantive relationship between
Doxey and Daniels. If such a relationship is found to have existed prior to the offers and sales at
issue in this matter, that would be a means of demonstrating compliance with the limitation on
the manner of offering found in Rule 502(c).31
There is likewise an insufficient factual record on which to determine that Pure H20
failed to exercise reasonable care to limit resales which, if true, would make the Rule 504
exemption unavailable. Although Doxey directed the transfer agent to issue the securities
without a restrictive legend, compliance with the three-part method specified in Rule 502(d),
including the requirement that a restrictive legend be placed on a securities certificate, is “not the
exclusive method to demonstrate such care. Other actions by the issuer may satisfy this
provision.” 32
Doxey’s legal counsel cited and relied on Rule 504(b)(1)(iii) when opining that the Pure
H20 transactions were exempt from registration. Rule 504(b)(1)(iii) provides an exception to
Rule 504’s prohibition on general solicitation and requirement that an issuer exercise reasonable
care to limit resales. That exception requires that the offers and sales be made “[e]xclusively
according to state law exemptions from registration that permit general solicitation and general
advertising so long as the sales are made only to “accredited investors” as defined in Rule
501(a).”33 We conclude that, as a matter of law, the state law exemption is unavailable for the 12
Pure H20 transactions.
The opinion letters that Doxey obtained relied on Rule 109.4 of the Texas Administrative
Code. That provision provides an exemption from state-law registration requirements for “the

The question of whether Doxey or Pure H20 engaged in general solicitation also would
inform an analysis under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.

Rule 504 was intended to facilitate capital formation, particularly by small businesses,
while permitting general solicitation and the issuance of “freely tradable” securities only in
certain circumstances to curb potential abuses of the exemption. Revision of Rule 504 of
Regulation D, the “Seed Capital” Exemption, 1999 WL 95490, at *1. We note that Doxey, as a
pro se small business owner, should be afforded the opportunity to present evidence concerning
whether he met the requirements for the exemption.

In 2005, Rule 109.4 superseded the Rule 109.3(4) referenced in the Pure H20 opinion
letters. The opinion letters also generally reference Sections 5.H, 5.T and 7 of the Texas
Securities Act. Section 7 does not provide for an exemption but instead lays out the
requirements for registration, and it is therefore inapplicable. Section 5.H provides for an
exemption for offers or sales to entities such as banks and registered broker-dealers, and as there
is no claim or evidence that Observation Capital was such an entity, it is also inapplicable.

offer and sale of any securities” to (1) an “institutional accredited investor,” with certain
exceptions not relevant here; (2) any “qualified institutional buyer”; or (3) “a corporation,
partnership, trust, estate, or other entity (excluding individuals) having net worth of not less than
$5 million, or a wholly-owned subsidiary of such entity, as long as the entity was not formed for
the purpose of acquiring the specific securities.” Rule 109.4 is not a statutory scheme, as Rule
504(b)(1)(iii) requires, that permits general solicitation. It only exempts those sales and offers
made to institutional accredited investors, qualified institutional buyers, and certain other
entities. It does not permit sales and offers of unregistered securities to the general public. As a
result, Rule 109.4 of the Texas Administrative Code does not, as a matter of law, meet the
standards that would be required to make use of the Rule 504(b)(1)(iii) exemption.
The law judge concluded that the transactions were not entitled to a Rule 504(b)(1)(iii)
exemption for a different reason. The law judge determined that Daniels and Observation
Capital were not accredited investors.35 Although there is evidence in the record showing that
Daniels and Observation Capital did not meet the criteria of accredited investors at the time of
the sales,36 the definition of an “accredited investor” under Rule 501(a) includes persons “who
the issuer reasonably believes comes within” the specified criteria.37 There is evidence in the
record that, when viewed in the light most favorable to Doxey, suggests that Doxey could have
reasonably believed that Observation Capital had accredited investor status. For example, in the
subscription agreements signed by Daniels, Observation Capital “represents” and “warrants” that
“it is an ‘accredited investor’ under Rule 501 of Regulation D.” And among the evidence
submitted by Doxey is an investor questionnaire apparently completed by Daniels attesting that
he satisfies the criteria of an accredited investor.38 This is enough to raise a triable issue of fact
on whether Doxey reasonably believed Observation Capital was an accredited investor.
Although the Rule 504(b)(1)(iii) exemption is unavailable, the law judge should determine
(…continued)

Finally, Section 5.T is the statutory provision which permits the Texas Securities Board to
promulgate exemptions by rule, such as Rule 109.4.
35

The relevant categories of persons considered “accredited investors” under Rule 501(a)
include “[a]ny natural person whose individual net worth, or joint net worth with that person’s
spouse, exceeds $1,000,000,” “[a]ny natural person who had an individual income in excess of
$200,000 in each of the two most recent years or joint income with that person’s spouse in
excess of $300,000 in each of those years and has a reasonable expectation of reaching the same
income level in the current year,” and “[a]ny entity in which all of the equity owners are
accredited investors.” 17 C.F.R. § 230.501(a)(5), (6), and (8) (2009).
36

In his Answer to the OIP and investigative testimony, Daniels said that at the time he
invested he believed he was an accredited investor, but he conceded in his testimony that he did
not actually meet the definition of an “accredited investor.”

whether Doxey’s belief regarding Observation Capital was reasonable, because—as we explain
below—that belief is relevant to determining whether a Rule 506 exemption was applicable.
b. Rule 506 of Regulation D
The version of Rule 506 in effect at the time of the transactions permitted an issuer to
raise funds in an unregistered offering from no more than 35 purchasers of securities (or what the
issuer reasonably believed was no more than 35 purchasers in any offering under Rule 506).39
For the purpose of calculating the number of purchasers, accredited investors, among others, are
excluded, meaning that for an offering under Rule 506 funds could be raised from an unlimited
number of accredited investors.40 Each purchaser in the offering who was not an accredited
investor must, either alone or with his purchaser representatives, have had “such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters that he [was] capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of the prospective investments, or the issuer reasonably believe[d] immediately prior to
making any sale that such purchaser [came] within this description.”41
Further, the Company could not rely on Rule 506 unless the offers and sales satisfied all
the terms and conditions of Rules 501 and 502,42 including Rule 502(c)’s prohibition on general
solicitation or general advertising,43 and Rule 502(d)’s requirement to exercise reasonable care to
limit resales.44 As discussed above, we remand on the issues of whether Doxey or Pure H20
engaged in general solicitation or advertising and exercised reasonable care to limit resales, and
believe there is enough evidence to raise a triable issue of fact on whether Doxey reasonably
believed Observation Capital was an accredited investor or had the requisite knowledge and

See 17 C.F.R. § 230.502(d) (2009). To claim the Rule 506 exemption for sales to nonaccredited investors, those investors must be furnished with certain information within a
reasonable time prior to sale (as described in Rule 502(b)). See 17 C.F.R. § 230.502(b) (2009).
Unlike Rule 504, the version of Rule 506 in effect at the time of Doxey’s alleged
misconduct provided no exception to these requirements. Rule 506 was amended in 2013, with
Rule 506 becoming Rule 506(b) and the addition of Rule 506(c). An issuer may rely on the Rule
506(c) exemption if it has engaged in general solicitation so long as it sold securities only to
accredited investors and took reasonable steps to verify the accredited investor status of the
purchasers in the offering. Eliminating the Prohibition Against General Solicitation and

experience under Rule 506(b)(2)(ii). If the evidence establishes that Doxey did not engage in
general solicitation or advertising and exercised reasonable care to limit resales, and that the
Company reasonably believed that Observation Capital qualified as an “accredited investor” or a
purchaser with the requisite knowledge and experience immediately prior to each sale, the law
judge should determine whether the transactions are exempt from registration under Rule 506.
c. Rule 144
We find that the transactions were not exempt pursuant to Rule 144, the remaining
provision cited by Doxey before the law judge. Rule 144 provides a safe harbor from being
deemed an “underwriter” under Securities Act Section 2(a)(11). Rule 144 is relevant to an
analysis of whether a transaction is by a person that falls within the Section 2(a)(11) definition of
an underwriter in light of Section 4(a)(1), which exempts from registration transactions “by a
person other than an issuer, underwriter or dealer.”45 It is not relevant to whether an issuer is
required to register transactions, or whether an exemption applied to an issuer. Pure H20 was
indisputably an issuer, and therefore its offers and sales to Observation Capital were not exempt
from registration under Section 4(a)(1).
III.
A.

Other Arguments Raised in Doxey’s Petition

Waiver of Hearing

On appeal, Doxey suggests that the law judge acted unfairly in granting the Division’s
motion for summary disposition and denying him a hearing. He contends that the law judge
“promised” at a prehearing conference that Doxey could “go through” the allegations “item by
item in order to show the [law judge] where the Division went wrong.” Based on our review of
the January 9, 2014 prehearing conference transcript, the law judge clearly informed Doxey that
pursuant to the OIP he had a right to a hearing by January 24, told Doxey he could waive that
right and submit his arguments in writing in connection with the Division’s motion for summary
disposition, and made clear to Doxey that, depending on the law judge’s review of the matter on
summary disposition, Doxey may or may not ultimately get a hearing.46 Based on this

45

15 U.S.C. § 77d(a)(1).

46

After explaining the process at the prehearing conference, the law judge summarized
Doxey’s options this way:
[T]here’s two possibilities. One possibility, if you insist, if you demand your right to [have a
hearing] within 30 and 60 days after service of the OIP, then we would have to do it no later than
January 24th. . . . The other possibility is if you’re willing to waive your right to doing it on the
24th, then we can have these motions that I’ve talked about. And if I determine that we ought to
have a hearing, a live, in-person hearing, where you can cross examine the Division’s witnesses
and put on your own witnesses and so forth, then that would be sometime down the road . . . . So
what I’m asking you is, do you want to do it within the next two weeks, or do you want to wait
and see?

15
information, Doxey told the law judge that he wanted to “wait and see” if the law judge
determined a hearing was necessary.
The question is whether Doxey is now, given our determination to remand, entitled to a
hearing. We conclude that he is. Although the Division argues that Doxey “waived his right to
an in-person hearing” and “cannot now complain when the summary disposition process did not
work out to his liking,” Doxey only waived his right to a hearing by January 24, 2014, and
agreed to take part in the summary disposition briefing (which had the potential to make a
hearing unnecessary).
For the reasons we have explained, we find that summary disposition on Doxey’s liability
for violations of the antifraud provisions and the Section 5 claims was in error and conclude that
a remand to the law judge is necessary.
B.

Remedial Relief

Because we are remanding the case for further proceedings regarding the Division’s
allegations, we do not address Doxey’s arguments about the appropriateness of the remedial
relief imposed by the law judge.
An appropriate order will issue.
