ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission
ACTION: Proposed rule.
SUMMARY: We are proposing significant revisions to Regulation AB and other rules
regarding the offering process, disclosure and reporting for asset-backed securities. Our
proposals would revise filing deadlines for ABS offerings to provide investors with more
time to consider transaction-specific information, including information about the pool
assets. Our proposals also would repeal the current credit ratings references in shelf
eligibility criteria for asset-backed issuers and establish new shelf eligibility criteria that
would include, among other things, a requirement that the sponsor retain a portion of
each tranche of the securities that are sold and a requirement that the issuer undertake to
file Exchange Act reports on an ongoing basis so long as its public securities are
outstanding. We also are proposing to require that, with some exceptions, prospectuses
for public offerings of asset-backed securities and ongoing Exchange Act reports contain
specified asset-level information about each of the assets in the pool. The asset-level
information would be provided according to proposed standards and in a tagged data
format using eXtensible Markup Language (XML). In addition, we are proposing to
require, along with the prospectus filing, the filing of a computer program of the
contractual cash flow provisions expressed as downloadable source code in Python, a

1


commonly used open source interpretive programming language. We are proposing new
information requirements for the safe harbors for exempt offerings and resales of asset-

backed securities and are also proposing a number of other revisions to our rules 

applicable to asset-backed securities.

Executive Summary
A.

Background

The recent financial crisis highlighted that investors and other participants in the
securitization market did not have the necessary tools to be able to fully understand the
risk underlying those securities and did not value those securities properly or accurately.
The severity of this lack of understanding and the extent to which it pervaded the market
and impacted the U.S. and worldwide economy calls into question the efficacy of several
aspects of our regulation of asset-backed securities. In light of the problems exposed by
the financial crisis, we are proposing significant revisions to our rules governing offers,
sales and reporting with respect to asset-backed securities. These proposals are designed
to improve investor protection and promote more efficient asset-backed markets.
Securitization generally is a financing technique in which financial assets, in
many cases illiquid, are pooled and converted into instruments that are offered and sold
in the capital markets as securities. This financing technique makes it easier for lenders
to exchange payment streams coming from the loans for cash so that they can make
additional loans or credit available to a wide range of borrowers and companies seeking
financing. Some of the types of assets that are financed today through securitization
include residential and commercial mortgages, agricultural equipment leases, automobile
loans and leases, student loans and credit card receivables. Throughout this release, we
refer to the securities sold through such vehicles as asset-backed securities, ABS, or
structured finance products.
At its inception, securitization primarily served as a vehicle for mortgage
financing. Since then, asset-backed securities have played a significant role in both the

9


U.S. and global economy. At the end of 2007, there were more than $7 trillion of both
agency and non-agency24 mortgage-backed securities and nearly $2.5 trillion of assetbacked securities outstanding.25 Securitization can provide liquidity to nearly all major
sectors of the economy including the residential and commercial real estate industry, the
automobile industry, the consumer credit industry, the leasing industry, and the
commercial lending and credit markets.26
Many of the problems giving rise to the financial crisis involved structured
finance products, including mortgage-backed securities.27 Many of these mortgagebacked securities were used to collateralize other debt obligations such as collateralized
debt obligations and collateralized loan obligations (CDOs or CLOs), types of assetbacked securities that are sold in private placements.28 As the default rate for subprime
and other mortgages soared, such securities, including those with high credit ratings, lost

Agency securities are securities issued by the government-sponsored enterprises, Ginnie Mae,
Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.

Investors, Financial Institutions and the Capital Markets (June 17, 2009), at 16 (citing to statistics on
outstanding residential mortgage-backed securities and outstanding U.S. ABS collected by the Securities
Industry and Financial Markets Association), available at

A report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) notes that 75% of subprime loans
were packaged into securities in 2006. See U.S. Government Accountability Office, Financial Regulation:
A Framework for Crafting and Assessing Proposals to Modernize the Outdated U.S. Financial Regulatory
System (Jan. 2009) at 26.
28

CDOs are typically sold as a private placement to an initial purchaser followed by resales of the
securities to “qualified institutional buyers” pursuant to Rule 144A. Pools comprising the CDOs may
consist of various types of underlying assets including subprime mortgage-backed securities and
derivatives, such as credit default swaps referencing subprime mortgage-backed securities, and even
tranches of other CDOs. CLOs are similar to CDOs except that they hold corporate loans, loan
participations or credit default swaps tied to corporate liabilities.

10 


their value.29 CDOs were noted, in particular, to have contributed to the collapse in
liquidity during the financial crisis.30 As the crisis unfolded, investors increasingly
became unwilling to purchase these securities, and today, this sentiment remains, as new
issuances of asset-backed securities, except for government-sponsored issuances, have
recently dramatically decreased.31 The absence of this financing option has negatively
impacted the availability of credit.32
The financial crisis highlighted a number of concerns with the operation of our
rules in the securitization market. Certain regulations for asset-backed securities rely on
the ratings for those securities provided by the ratings agencies, and much has been
written about the failures of those ratings accurately to measure and describe the risks
associated with certain of those products that were realized during the financial crisis.33
In addition, investors have expressed concern regarding a lack of time to analyze

29

See, e.g., The President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, Policy Statement on Financial
Market Developments, March 2008 (the “PWG March 2008 Report”) at 9 (discussing subprime mortgages
and the write-down of AAA-rated and super-senior tranches of CDOs as contributing factors to the
financial crisis).
30

See, e.g., The Report of the Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group III (“CRMPG III”),
Containing Systemic Risk: The Road to Reform, August 6, 2008 (the “2008 CRMPG III Report”), at 53
(noting that lack of comprehension of CDO and related instruments resulted in the display of price
depreciation and volatility far in excess of levels previously associated with comparably rated securities,
causing both a collapse of confidence in a very broad range of structured product ratings and a collapse in
liquidity for such products). Another type of asset-backed security that is privately offered is asset-backed
commercial paper (ABCP), which was increasingly collateralized by CDOs and RMBS from 2004 through
2007. The ABCP market severely contracted during the crisis. See PWG March 2008 Report at 8.
31

See, e.g., David Adler, “A Flat Dow for 10 Years? Why it Could Happen,” Barrons (Dec. 28,
2009) (noting that new securitization issuances, except those sponsored by the government, have largely
come to a halt). In 2008 through the end of September, annualized issuance volumes for overall global
securitized and structured credit issuance were approximately $2.4 trillion less than in 2006. See Global
Joint Initiative to Restore Confidence in the Securitization Market, Restoring Confidence in the
Securitization Markets (Dec. 3, 2008) at 6.

securitization transactions and make investment decisions.34 While the Commission
historically has not built minimum time periods into its registration process to
deliberately slow down the market,35 and instead has believed investors can insist on
adequate time to analyze securities (and refuse to invest if not provided sufficient time),
we have been told that this is not generally possible in this market, particularly in an
active market.36 In addition, market participants have expressed a desire for expanded
disclosure relating to the assets underlying securitizations.37 Investors have complained
that the mechanisms for enforcing the representations and warranties contained in
securitization transaction documents are weak, and thus are not confident that even strong
representations and warranties provide them with adequate protection. In the private
market, we believe that, in many cases, investors did not have the information necessary
to understand and properly analyze structured products, such as CDOs, that were sold in
transactions in reliance on exemptions from registration.38 As a result of these and other
factors, the financial crisis resulted in an absence of confidence in much of the
securitization market.
We are proposing a number of changes to the offering process, disclosure, and
reporting for asset-backed securities, which are designed to enhance investor protection
34

See discussion in Section II.B.1 below.

35

See, e.g., Section IV.A. of Securities Offering Reform, Release No. 33-8591 (Jul. 19, 2005) [70
FR 44722] (release adopting significant revisions to registration, communications and offering process
under the Securities Act)(the “Offering Reform Release”) (stating that Rule 159 would not result in a speed
bump or otherwise slow down the offering process).
36

See discussion in Section II.B.1 below.

37

See also discussion in Section III.A.1 below.

38

The assumption that sophisticated investors are able to fend for themselves in a private assetbacked securities transaction has also been questioned. Cf. Financial Services Authority, The Turner
Review: A Regulatory Response to the Global Banking Crisis, March 2009 (the “Turner Review”), at 39
(finding that “the crisis also raises important questions about the intellectual assumptions on which
previous regulatory approaches have largely been built”).

12 


in this market.39 The proposals are intended to provide investors with timely and
sufficient information, including information in and about the private market for assetbacked securities, reduce the likelihood of undue reliance on credit ratings, and help
restore investor confidence in the representations and warranties regarding the assets.
Although these revisions are comprehensive and therefore would impose new burdens, if
adopted, we believe they would protect investors and promote efficient capital formation.
The proposals cover the following areas:
•	 revisions to the shelf offering process and criteria and prospectus delivery
requirements;
•	 Securities Act and Exchange Act disclosure requirements, including new
requirements to disclose standardized asset-level information or grouped asset
data and a computer program that gives effect to the cash flow provisions of the
transaction agreement (often referred to as the “waterfall”); and
•	 changes to the Securities Act safe harbors for exempt offerings and exempt
resales for asset-backed securities.
In addition, we are proposing clarifying, technical and other changes to the
current rules. The proposals are designed to address issues that contributed to or arose
from the financial crisis. These proposals are also designed to be forward looking; some
of these proposals are designed to improve areas that have the potential to raise issues
similar to the ones highlighted in the financial crisis.

39

Our proposals, if adopted, would not affect the applicability of the Investment Company Act (15
U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.) to ABS issuers, including the availability of exclusions from such Act. See, e.g.,
Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) (15 U.S.C. 80a-3(c)(1) and 80a-3(c)(7)) (for private transactions); Rule
3a-7 [17 CFR 270.3a-7] (for public and private transactions). Our proposals are not intended to affect the
application of the Investment Company Act, including the availability of these exclusions, to ABS issuers.

13 


Our proposals are generally consistent with global initiatives that seek to improve
practices in the securitization market.40 These initiatives include calls by international
organizations to require greater disclosure by issuers of securitized products, including
initial and ongoing information about underlying asset pool performance.41 Our focus on
both the public and private markets for securitized products is supported by
recommendations from international regulators about the type of disclosure that should
be provided to investors in the private markets.42
B.

Securities Act Registration

Securities Act shelf registration provides important timing and flexibility benefits
to issuers. An issuer with an effective shelf registration statement can conduct delayed
offerings “off the shelf” under Securities Act Rule 415 without further staff clearance.
Under our current rules, asset-backed securities may be registered on a Form S-3
registration statement and later offered “off the shelf” if, in addition to meeting other
specified criteria,43 the securities are rated investment grade by a nationally recognized
statistical rating organization (NRSRO). As described in detail in Section II.B.3. below,
we are proposing to repeal that criterion and establish other criteria for shelf eligibility.
We are also proposing changes to the Securities Act rules and forms for issuances of
asset-backed securities.

40

See Improving Financial Regulation – Report of the Financial Stability Board to G20 Leaders,
(Sept. 25, 2009) (“The official sector must provide the framework that ensures discipline in the
securitisation market as it revives.”).

types of disclosure mandated in the public markets, private investors may want issuers to provide) .
43

See discussion of other criteria in fn. 70 below.

14 


We have undertaken a Commission-wide effort to consider whether references to
NRSRO credit ratings in all the Commission’s regulations are necessary or appropriate
and whether they could cause investors to unduly rely on ratings.44 In this release, we are
proposing to eliminate the current means of establishing shelf eligibility for an ABS
transaction based on the credit ratings of the securities to be issued.45 Instead, we are
proposing to require for shelf eligibility the following:
•

A certification filed at the time of each offering off of a shelf registration
statement, or takedown, by the chief executive officer of the depositor46 that the
assets in the pool have characteristics that provide a reasonable basis to believe
that they will produce, taking into account internal credit enhancements, cash
flows to service any payments due and payable on the securities as described in
the prospectus;

44

See References to Ratings of Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, Exchange
Act Release No. 58070 (July 1, 2008) [73 FR 40088] (proposing amendments to rules and forms under the
Securities Exchange Act); References to Ratings of Nationally Recognized Statistical Ratings
Organizations, Investment Company Act Release No. 28327 (July 1, 2008) [73 FR 40124] (proposing
amendments to rules under the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act); Security
Ratings, Securities Act Release No. 8940 (July 1, 2008) [73 FR 40106] (proposing amendments to rules
and forms under the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act) (“2008 Proposing Release”).
45

As part of the Commission-wide effort to consider whether references to NRSRO credit ratings are
necessary, we proposed to replace the ratings requirement in the shelf eligibility criteria in the 2008
Proposing Release. See also Section II.A. below. We reopened the comment period in October 2009.
References to Ratings of Nationally Statistical Rating Organizations, Release No. 33-9069 (Oct. 5, 2009)
[74 FR 52374]. After considering comments, we are withdrawing this part of the proposals in the 2008
Proposing Release, and we are proposing different ABS shelf eligibility requirements to replace the
investment grade ratings requirement.
46

We use the term “depositor” to mean the depositor who receives or purchases and transfers or sells
the pool assets to the issuing entity. For ABS transactions where there is not an intermediate transfer of the
assets from the sponsor to the issuing entity, the term depositor refers to the sponsor. For ABS transactions
where the person transferring or selling the pool assets is itself a trust, the depositor of the issuing entity is
the depositor of that trust. See Item 1101(e) of Regulation AB.

15 


•

Retention by the sponsor of a specified amount of each tranche of the
securitization,47 net of the sponsor’s hedging (also known as “risk retention” or
“skin-in-the-game”);

•	 A provision in the pooling and servicing agreement that requires the party
obligated to repurchase the assets for breach of representations and warranties to
periodically furnish an opinion of an independent third party regarding whether
the obligated party acted consistently with the terms of the pooling and servicing
agreement with respect to any loans that the trustee put back to the obligated party
for violation of representations and warranties and which were not repurchased;
and
•	 An undertaking by the issuer to file Exchange Act reports so long as non-affiliates
of the depositor hold any securities that were sold in registered transactions
backed by the same pool of assets.
We also are proposing to replace Forms S-1 and S-3 with new forms for
registered ABS offerings -- proposed Forms SF-1 and SF-3 -- and to revise the shelf
offering structure for those securities. Form SF-3 would be the form used for ABS shelf
offerings.
Given many ABS investors’ stated desire for more time to consider the
transaction and for more detailed information regarding the pool assets,48 we are
proposing to revise the filing deadlines in shelf offerings to provide investors with
additional time to analyze transaction-specific information prior to making an investment
47

We use the term “sponsor” to mean the person who organizes and initiates an asset-backed
securities transaction by selling or transferring assets, either directly or indirectly, including through an
affiliate, to the issuing entity. See Item 1101(l) of Regulation AB.

decision. These changes are designed to promote independent analysis of ABS by
investors rather than reliance on credit ratings. Under the proposed ABS shelf
procedures, an ABS issuer would be required to file a preliminary prospectus with the
Commission for each takedown off of the proposed new shelf registration form for ABS
(Form SF-3) at least five business days prior to the first sale in the offering.49 Under the
proposal, issuers would use one prospectus for each transaction and the current practice
of using core or base prospectuses plus supplements would be eliminated for ABS.
C.

Disclosure

In 2004, we adopted a new set of rules prescribing the disclosure requirements for
asset-backed issuers.50 Many disclosure requirements of Regulation AB are principlesbased. Regulation AB currently requires that material, aggregate information about the
composition and characteristics of the asset pool be filed with the Commission and
provided to investors. As described in detail in Sections III, IV and V below, we are
proposing additional, and, in some cases, revised disclosure requirements for ABS
offerings and ongoing reporting.
For each loan or asset in the asset pool, we are proposing to require disclosure of
specified data relating to the terms of the asset, obligor characteristics, and underwriting
of the asset. Such data would be provided in a machine-readable, standardized format so
that it is most useful to investors and the markets. Under our proposal, issuers would be
49

Pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 15c2-8(b) [17 CFR 240.15c2-8(b)], with respect to ABS, a brokerdealer is exempt from the requirement that a preliminary prospectus be delivered to prospective investors at
least 48 hours prior to sending a confirmation of sale if the issuer of the securities has not previously been
required to file reports pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m or15
U.S.C. 28o). We also are proposing to repeal this exception from Rule 15c2-8(b) such that a broker-dealer
would be required to deliver a preliminary prospectus at least 48 hours prior to sending a confirmation of
sale in connection with an issuance of ABS, including those issued by ABS issuers exempted from the
requirement to file reports pursuant to Section 12(h) of the Exchange Act.
50

See the 2004 ABS Adopting Release.

17 


required to provide the asset-level data or grouped account data at the time of
securitization, when new assets are added to the pool underlying the securities, and on an
ongoing basis.
We are proposing to require the filing of a computer program (the “waterfall
computer program,” as defined in the proposed rule) of the contractual cash flow
provisions of the securities in the form of downloadable source code in Python, a
commonly used computer programming language that is open source and interpretive.
The computer program would be tagged in XML and required to be filed with the
Commission as an exhibit. Under our proposal, the filed source code for the computer
program, when downloaded and run (by loading it into an open “Python” session on the
investor’s computer), would be required to allow the user to programmatically input
information from the asset data file that we are proposing to require as described above.
We believe that, with the waterfall computer program and the asset data file, investors
would be better able to conduct their own evaluations of ABS and may be less likely to
be dependent on the opinions of credit rating agencies.
We also are proposing additional requirements to refine current disclosure
requirements for asset-backed securities. Among other things, we are proposing to
require:
•	 aggregated and loan-level data relating to the type and amount of assets
that do not meet the underwriting criteria that is specified in the
prospectus;

18 


•	 for certain identified originators, information relating to the amount of the
originator’s publicly securitized assets that, in the last three years, has
been the subject of a demand to repurchase or replace;
•	 for the sponsor, information relating to the amount of publicly securitized
assets sold by the sponsor that, in the last three years, has been the subject
of a demand to repurchase or replace;
•	 additional information regarding originators and sponsors;
•	 descriptions relating to static pool information, such as a description of the
methodology used in determining or calculating the characteristics of the
pool performance as well as any terms or abbreviations used;
•	 that static pool information for amortizing asset pools comply with the
Item 1100(b) requirements for the presentation of historical delinquency
and loss information; and
•	 the filing of Form 8-K for a one percent or more change in any material
pool characteristic from what is described in the prospectus (rather than
for a five percent or more change, as currently required).
We also are proposing to limit some of the existing exceptions to the discrete pool
requirement in the definition of an asset-backed security. This is intended to not only
address recent concerns arising out of the financial crisis but also serve to protect against
future practices of participants along the chain of securitization that could result in the
addition of assets into a securitization pool without a clear understanding of their quality.

D.

Privately-Issued Structured Finance Products

A significant portion of securities transactions, including the offer and sale of all
CDOs and ABCP, is conducted in the exempt private placement market, which includes
both offerings eligible for Rule 144A resales and other private placements.51 CDOs are
typically sold by the issuer in a private placement to one or more initial purchaser or
purchasers in reliance upon the Section 4(2) private offering exemption in the Securities
Act, which is available only to the issuer, followed by resales of the securities to
“qualified institutional buyers” in reliance upon Rule 144A.52 Subsequent resales may
also be made in reliance upon Rule 144A. Rule 144A provides a safe harbor for resellers
from being deemed an underwriter within the meaning of Sections 2(a)(11) and 4(1) of
the Securities Act53 for the sale of securities to qualified institutional buyers. If the
conditions of the Rule 144A safe harbor are satisfied, sellers may rely on the exemption
from Securities Act registration provided by Section 4(1) for transactions by persons
other than issuers, underwriters or dealers.54
Some have concluded that the events of the financial crisis have demonstrated that
a lack of understanding of CDOs and other privately offered structured finance products

51

CDOs often permit the active management of their pool assets, which could include engaging in
activities the primary purpose of which is to protect or enhance the returns of their equity holders. Such
CDOs typically would not meet the requirements of Rule 3a-7 under the Investment Company Act because
that rule includes conditions that are intended to permit an issuer to engage only in limited activities that do
not in any sense parallel typical ‘management’ of registered investment company portfolios. Accordingly,
these CDOs usually rely on one of the private investment company exclusions, both of which condition the
exclusion in part on the issuer not making a public offering. See fn. 39 above.
52

In general, a qualified institutional buyer is any entity included within one of the categories of
“accredited investor” defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D, acting for its own account or the accounts of
other qualified institutional buyers, that in the aggregate owns and invests on a discretionary basis at least
$100 million in securities of issuers not affiliated with the entity (or $10 million for a broker-dealer).

54

See Section II.A. of the Resale of Restricted Securities, Release No. 33-6862 (Apr. 30, 1990) [55
FR 17933] (the “Rule 144A Adopting Release”).

20 


by investors, rating agencies and other market participants may have significant
consequences to the entire financial system.55 For example, the ratings of these products
proved inaccurate, which significantly contributed to the financial crisis.56 This lack of
understanding by credit rating agencies, investors, and other market participants indicates
that the offering processes and disclosure available in the public and private market were
inadequate to provide appropriate investor protection. Further, these securities are issued
by special purpose vehicles whose only purpose is holding financial assets, with
numerous parties involved in the securitization process.57 As a result, information about
those assets and the structure of the vehicle is critical to an informed investment decision.
The safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation D that provide the ability to rely
on an exemption from registration do not impose specific requirements on the disclosures
provided to investors if those investors meet certain size requirements. However, the
financial crisis has called into question the ability of our rules, as they relate to the private
market for asset-backed securities, to ensure that investors had access to, and had
sufficient time and incentives to adequately consider, appropriate information regarding
these securities.58

55

See, e.g., The PWG March 2008 Report (noting that originators, underwriters, asset managers,
credit rating agencies and investors failed to obtain sufficient information or conduct comprehensive risk
assessments on instruments that were often quite complex and also noting that downgrades were even more
frequent and severe for CDOs of ABS with subprime mortgage loans as the underlying collateral). See also
the Turner Review, at 20 (finding that “the financial innovations of structured credit resulted in the creation
of products –e.g, the lower credit tranches of CDOs or even more so CDO-squareds – which had very high
and imperfectly understood embedded leverage.”).
56

See id.

57

See also discussion in Section VI. below.

58

An assessment of whether the protections of the Act are needed often focuses on whether the
purchasers of securities can “fend for themselves.” SEC v. Ralston Purina Co., 346 U.S. 119, 125 (1953).
Historically, whether this test is met turned on whether information necessary or appropriate to make
informed decisions is realistically available to the purchasers. See id. The Supreme Court also noted that
“We agree that some employee offerings may come within § 4(1), e.g., one made to executive personnel
who because of their position have access to the same kind of information that the Act would make

21 


We are proposing to require enhanced disclosure by asset-backed issuers who
wish to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions for these privately-issued
securities.59 In addition, in order to provide additional transparency with respect to the
private market for these securities, we are proposing amendments to Rule 144A to require
a structured finance product issuer to file a public notice on EDGAR of the initial
placement of structured finance products that are eligible for resale under Rule 144A. As
we believe that the Commission may benefit from the availability of more information
about private placements of structured finance products, we are proposing to require that
in submitting such notice, the issuer undertakes to provide offering materials to the
Commission upon written request.
All of our proposals, if adopted, would apply to new issuances of asset-backed
securities. Therefore, the proposed rules, if adopted, would not impose new requirements
on outstanding asset-backed securities.
II.

Securities Act Registration
We are proposing a number of changes to the Securities Act registration process

for the offer and sale of asset-backed securities. These changes include proposed new
eligibility criteria for shelf offerings and changes to the shelf offering process.
A.

History of ABS Shelf Offerings

In 1984, mortgage related securities, a subset of asset-backed securities, were first
permitted to be offered on a “shelf” basis. Contemporaneous with the enactment of

available in the form of a registration statement.” Id. at 125. See also Lawler v. Gilliam, 569 F.2d 1283
(4th Cir. 1978) (discussing the Supreme Court’s observation in Ralston that an offering to those who are
shown to be able to fend for themselves is a transaction ‘not involving any public offering’ and the ruling
that an essential requirement is access to the kind of information that registration would disclose).
59

We are also proposing to make conforming changes to Regulation D, Form D and Rule 144.

22

Secondary Mortgage Market Enhancement Act of 1984 (SMMEA),60 which added the
definition of “mortgage related security” to the Exchange Act, we amended Securities
Act Rule 415 to permit mortgage related securities to be offered on a delayed basis,
regardless of which form is utilized for registration of the offering.61 SMMEA defined a
mortgage related security to include a security that has a high investment grade credit
rating.62
In 1992, in order to facilitate registered offerings of asset-backed securities and
eliminate differences in treatment under our registration rules between mortgage related
asset-backed securities (which could be registered on a delayed basis) and other assetbacked securities of comparable character and quality (which could not), we expanded
the ability to use “shelf offerings” to other asset-backed securities.63 Under the 1992
amendments, offerings of asset-backed securities rated investment grade by an NRSRO64

60

Pub. L. 98–440, 98 Stat. 1689.

61

See Shelf Registration, Release No. 33–6499 (Nov. 17, 1983) [48 FR 5289]. Mortgage related
securities, including such securities as mortgage-backed debt and mortgage participation or pass through
certificates, may be offered on a delayed basis under Rule 415. See 17 CFR 230.415(a)(1)(vii). SMMEA
was enacted by Congress to increase the flow of funds to the housing market by removing regulatory
impediments to the creation and sale of private mortgage-backed securities. An early version of the
legislation contained a provision that specifically would have required the Commission to create a
permanent procedure for shelf registration of mortgage related securities. The provision was removed from
the final version of the legislation, however, as a result of the Commission’s decision to adopt Rule 415,
implementing a shelf registration procedure for mortgage related securities. See H.R. Rep. No. 994, 98th
Cong., 2d Sess. 14, reprinted in 1984 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 2827; see also Release No. 33­
6499 (Nov. 17, 1983) [48 FR 52889], at n. 30 (noting that mortgage related securities were the subject of
pending legislation).
62

The term, “mortgage related security” is defined to include “a security that is rated in one of the
two highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization.” 15
U.S.C. 78c(a)(41).
63

See Simplification of Registration Procedures for Primary Securities Offerings, Release No. 33­
6964 (Oct. 22, 1992) [57 FR 32461].
64

The security is an “investment grade security” for purposes of form eligibility if, at the time of
sale, at least one NRSRO has rated the security in one of its generic rating categories which signifies
investment grade, typically one of the four highest categories. See General Instructions I.B.2 and I.B.5 of
Form S-3.

23 


could be registered on Form S-3.65 The eligibility requirement’s definition of
“investment grade” was largely based on the definition in the existing eligibility
requirement for non-convertible corporate debt securities.66
The 1992 amendments did not prescribe specific disclosure requirements for ABS
offerings; disclosure in ABS offerings was based largely on market practices and SEC
staff guidance.67 At the end of 2004, the Commission adopted new rules and
amendments under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act addressing the registration,
disclosure and reporting requirements for asset-backed securities.68 In the 2004
amendments (“2004 ABS Adopting Release”), we prescribed specific ABS disclosure
requirements for the first time, which are largely principles-based. In addition, under the
2004 amendments, we retained the investment grade ratings condition to ABS Form S-3
eligibility69 and added additional shelf eligibility conditions.70

65

Under Securities Act Rule 415, securities registered on Form S-3 or Form F-3 may be offered on a
continuous or delayed basis. See 17 CFR 230.415(a)(1)(x).

66

See Release No. 33-6964.

67

See id. The 1992 release explained that the Commission did not intend to change the character or
quality of the disclosure that is customary in these offerings and explained generally the type of disclosure
that was expected for ABS offerings.
68

See 2004 ABS Adopting Release. In 2003, we raised the question whether to eliminate ratings
reliance from our shelf eligibility requirements in a concept release where we requested comment on
alternatives to the investment grade ratings component of Form S-3 eligibility for ABS and debt offerings.
See Rating Agencies and the Use of Credit Ratings under the Federal Securities Laws, Release No. 33­
8236 (Jun. 4, 2003) [68 FR 35258].
69

We noted in 2004, however, that the Commission was engaged in a broad review of the role of
credit ratings agencies in the securities markets and the use of credit ratings for regulatory purposes. See
Section II.A.3.c of the 2004 ABS Adopting Release.
70

In addition to investment grade rated securities, an ABS offering is eligible for Form S-3
registration only if the following conditions are met: (i) delinquent assets must not constitute 20% or more,
as measured by dollar volume, of the asset pool as of the measurement date; and (ii) with respect to
securities that are backed by leases other than motor vehicle leases, the portion of the securitized pool
balance attributable to the residual value of the physical property underlying the leases, as determined in
accordance with the transaction agreements for the securities, does not constitute 20% or more, as
measured by dollar volume, of the securitized pool balance as of the measurement date. See General
Instruction I.B.5 of Form S-3. Moreover, to the extent the depositor or any issuing entity previously
established, directly or indirectly, by the depositor or any affiliate of the depositor are or were at any time

24 


In 2008, we proposed several changes to our rules and form requirements that
reference investment grade ratings (the “2008 Proposing Release”), including a proposal
to revise shelf eligibility criteria for ABS offerings and primary offerings of nonconvertible debt by replacing the investment grade ratings component. 71 Our proposal
would have replaced investment grade ratings with a requirement that sales registered on
Form S-3 be made in minimum denominations and only to qualified institutional buyers,
as defined in Rule 144A. We reopened comment on the 2008 Proposing Release on
October 5, 2009.72
We received comment letters from 35 commenters on the 2008 Proposing
Release. Commenters generally opposed the proposed amendments that would have
replaced investment grade ratings references in certain rules and the shelf eligibility
criteria.73 Some commenters on the proposed amendments to ABS shelf eligibility noted
that the proposed eligibility requirements would result in many ABS issuers registering

during the twelve calendar months and any portion of a month immediately preceding the filing of the
registration statement on Form S-3 subject to the requirements of Section 12 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act
(15 U.S.C. 78l or 78o(d)) with respect to a class of asset-backed securities involving the same asset class,
such depositor and each such issuing entity must have filed all material required to be filed regarding such
asset-backed securities pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m, 78n or
78o(d)) for such period (or such shorter period that each such entity was required to file such materials).
Such material (except for certain enumerated items) must have been filed in a timely manner. See General
Instruction I.A.4 of Form S-3. We are not proposing changes to these other eligibility conditions.
71

See the 2008 Proposing Release.

72

See Release No. 33-9069. We also held a Credit Rating Agency Roundtable on April 15, 2009 to
consider further information on ratings and rating agencies. Materials related to the roundtable, including
an archived webcast and a transcript of the roundtable, are available at http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/cra­

offerings on Form S-174 or selling the securities privately.75 After considering comments,
we are withdrawing this part of the 2008 proposal and are proposing different
replacements to the ratings requirement in the shelf eligibility criteria for ABS issuers
that we believe are better measures of quality, and therefore, are more appropriate
eligibility criteria. We are also proposing several changes to restructure the registered
ABS offering process.
B.

New Registration Procedures and Forms for Asset-Backed Securities

1.

New Shelf Registration Procedures

Under existing rules, as with offerings of other types of securities registered on
Form S-3 and Form F-3, the shelf registration statement for an offering of asset-backed
securities will often be effective before a takedown is contemplated. Pursuant to existing
Securities Act Rules 409 and 430B,76 the prospectus in the registration statement may
omit the specific terms of a takedown if that information is unknown or not reasonably
available to the issuer when the registration statement is made effective.77 For ABS
offerings off the shelf, because assets for a pool backing the securities will not be
identified until the time of an offering, information regarding the actual assets in the pool
and the material terms of the transaction are sometimes only included in a prospectus or
prospectus supplement that is filed with the Commission the second business day after

74

17 CFR 239.11.

75

See, e.g., comment letters from ABA dated September 12, 2009; ASF; Boeing; Cadwalader; Davis
Polk; Debevoise; and Mayer. As the proposal in the 2008 Proposing Release did not add requirements to
the safe harbors for privately-issued asset-backed securities, these commenters did not assess whether
additional requirements would have changed the result.
76

17 CFR 230.409 and 17 CFR 230.430B.

77

The prospectus disclosure in the registration statement is often presented through a ‘‘base’’ or
‘‘core’’ prospectus and a prospectus supplement. We are proposing to eliminate this type of presentation
for asset-backed issuers. See Section II.D.1. below.

26 


first use.78 This information includes information about the pool, underwriting criteria
for the assets and exceptions made to the underwriting criteria, identification of the
originators of the assets and other information that is keyed off the identification of
specific assets for the pool.
We recognize that asset-backed issuers have expressed the need to use shelf
registration to access the capital markets quickly.79 We understand that the creation of an
asset pool to support securitized products is a dynamic and ongoing process in which
changes can take place up until pricing. As a result, our proposals today generally
maintain the fundamental framework of shelf registration for ABS offerings.
However, we also recognize that it is important for investor protection that ABS
investors have not just adequate information to make an investment decision, but also
adequate time to analyze the information and the potential investment. For the most part,
each ABS offering off of a shelf registration statement involves securities backed by
different assets, so that, in essence, from an investor point of view, each offering is like
an initial public offering with respect to the ABS issuer. Information regarding the assets
is an important piece of information for investors to use to conduct an analysis of the
ability of those underlying assets to generate sufficient funds to make payments on the
securities. Furthermore, some have noted the lack of time to review transaction-specific
information as hindering the investors’ ability to conduct adequate analysis of the

78

An instruction to Rule 424(b) requires that a form of prospectus or prospectus supplement relating
to a delayed offering of mortgage-backed securities or an offering of asset-backed securities be filed no
later than the second business day following the date it is first used after effectiveness in connection with a
public offering or sales, or transmitted by a means reasonably calculated to result in filing with the
Commission by that date.
79

Notably, according to EDGAR, in 2006 and 2007, only three ABS issuers filed registration
statements on Form S-1 that went effective.

27 


securities.80 We believe that a more orderly process for asset-backed securities offerings
with improved investor protections, where investors and underwriters have additional
time to assist their review of offerings, may be needed, even if issuers may not always be
able to time their offering in a way that takes advantage of short term price peaks.
Therefore, we are proposing rules designed to increase the amount of time that investors
have to review information regarding a particular shelf takedown and promote analysis of
asset-backed securities in lieu of undue reliance on security ratings for shelf offerings.
a)

Rule 424(h) Filing

We are proposing to require an asset-backed issuer using a shelf registration
statement on proposed Form SF-3 to file a preliminary prospectus containing transactionspecific information at least five business days in advance of the first sale of securities in
the offering. This requirement, if adopted, would allow investors additional time to
analyze the specific structure, assets, and contractual rights regarding each transaction.
Requiring that such information be filed at least five business days before the first sale of
securities in the offering is designed to balance the interest of ABS issuers in quick
access to the capital markets and the need of investors to have more time to consider
transaction-specific information. We considered whether a longer minimum time period

80

See, e.g., Section I.B. of CFA Institute Centre for Financial Market Integrity and Council of
Institutional Investors, U.S. Financial Regulatory Reform: The Investor’s Perspective, July 2009 (noting
that securitized products are sold before investors have access to a comprehensive and accurate prospectus,
noting that each ABS offering involves a new and unique security, and recommending that the Commission
adopt rules to improve the timeliness of disclosures to investors); Dr. William W. Irving’s testimony
concerning “Securitization of Assets: Problems and Solutions” Before the Senate Banking, Housing and
Urban Affairs Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and Investment (Oct. 7, 2009), at 11 (recommending
that there be ample time before a deal is priced for investors to review and analyze a full prospectus and not
just a term sheet). The testimony is available at http://banking.senate.gov/public/.

28 


than five business days would be more appropriate.81 However, we are proposing five
business days, because we preliminarily believe that the proposals discussed below that
require the filing of standardized and tagged loan-level information and a computer
program that gives effect to the cash flow provisions of the transaction agreement could
reduce the amount of time required by investors to consider transaction specific
information. Our requests for comment on the proposed new procedures below include
questions about the appropriate amount of time investors need to consider transaction
specific information.
Under our proposal, with respect to any takedown of securities in a shelf offering
of asset-backed securities where information is omitted from an effective registration
statement in reliance on newly proposed Rule 430D, a form of prospectus meeting certain
requirements must be filed with the Commission by a means reasonably calculated to
result in filing in accordance with proposed Rule 424(h) (the “Rule 424(h) filing” or
“Rule 424(h) prospectus”) at least five business days prior to the first sale of securities in
the offering.82 If the preliminary prospectus is used earlier than such five business days
to offer the securities, then it must be filed by the second business day after first use.
As discussed below, we are proposing new Rule 430D to provide the framework
for shelf registration of ABS offerings. The proposed rule explains what information
may be omitted from the prospectus filed with the effective registration statement and
what information must be contained in the Rule 424(h) filing. Under new Rule 430D, as

81

Some have suggested that investors be provided with up to two weeks to analyze asset
information. See, e.g., Joshua Rosner, Securitization: Taming the Wild West, Roosevelt Institute’s Make
Markets be Markets (Mar. 3, 2010), at 73.
82

Sale includes “contract of sale.” See fn. 31 and accompanying text of the Offering Reform

Release.

29 


proposed, the Rule 424(h) filing must contain substantially all the information for the
specific ABS takedown previously omitted from the prospectus filed as part of an
effective registration statement,83 except for the information with respect to the offering
price, underwriting discounts or commissions, discounts or commissions to dealers,
amount of proceeds or other matters dependent upon the offering price. The information
required to be filed pursuant to proposed Rule 424(h) would include, among other things,
information about the specific asset pool that is backing the securities in the takedown
and the waterfall computer program discussed in Section III below. Proposed Rule 430D
would provide that a material change in the information provided in the Rule 424(h)
filing, other than offering price, would require a new Rule 424(h) filing and therefore, a
new five business-day waiting period.84 The new Rule 424(h) filing would be required
to reflect the change and contain substantially all the information required to be in the
prospectus, except for pricing information. For example, if a credit enhancement (that
was contemplated in the registration statement) is added to the transaction after a Rule
424(h) filing is filed, we would expect the issuer to file a new Rule 424(h) filing that
reflects the credit enhancement and wait an additional five business days before the first
sale in the offering. This is designed to provide investors with information and time
sufficient to conduct a thorough analysis of new information relating to the offering.
So long as a form of prospectus has been filed in accordance with Rule 430D,
ABS issuers could continue to utilize a free writing prospectus or ABS informational and
83

For example, the Rule 424(h) filing would include the waterfall computer program that we are
proposing to require, as discussed in Section III.B.1 of this release. We believe that investors need
adequate time to run the waterfall computer program using the asset data filed with the Rule 424(h) filing.
84

Whether a change is material for purposes of the proposed requirement would depend on the facts
and circumstances. See TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 448-449 (1976). See also
Basic v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 231 (1988).

computational materials in accordance with existing rules.85 However, because we
believe that investors should have access to a comprehensive prospectus that contains
substantially all of the required information, a free writing prospectus or ABS
informational and computational materials could not be used for the purpose of meeting
the requirements of proposed Rule 424(h). For liability purposes, a Rule 424(h) filing
would be deemed part of the registration statement on the date such form of prospectus is
filed with the Commission, or if the preliminary prospectus is used earlier than five
business days in advance of the first sale of securities in the offering, then the date of first
use.86 A final prospectus for ABS offerings would continue to be filed pursuant to Rule
424(b). Consistent with Rule 430B for shelf offerings of corporate issuers, under
proposed Rule 430D the filing of the final prospectus under Rule 424(b) would trigger a
new effective date for the registration statement relating to the securities to which such
form of prospectus relates for purposes of liability under Section 11 of the Securities
Act.87

85

ABS informational and computational materials, as defined in Item 1101 of Regulation AB [17
CFR 229.1101], may be used in accordance with Securities Act Rules 167 and 426 [17 CFR 230.167 and
17 CFR 230.426]. Materials that constitute a free writing prospectus, as defined in Securities Act Rule 405
[17 CFR 230.405] may be used in accordance with Securities Act Rules 164 and 433 [17 CFR 230.164 and
17 CFR 230.433].
86

This is consistent with the existing provisions for other preliminary prospectuses. See Rule
430B(e). We also propose in this release to repeal the exception to the prospectus delivery requirement in
Exchange Act Rule 15c2-8(b) for shelf-eligible asset-backed securities. See Section II.C. below.

15 U.S.C. 77k. The proposed rule does not change the treatment of ABS offerings for purposes of
Rule 159 [17 CFR 230.159]. Rule 159 provides the following:
(a)	 For purposes of section 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act only, and without affecting any other
rights a purchaser may have, for purposes of determining whether a prospectus or oral
statement included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading at the time of sale (including, without limitation, a contract of
sale), any information conveyed to the purchaser only after such time of sale (including such
contract of sale) will not be taken into account.
(b) For purposes of section 17(a)(2) of the Act only, and without affecting any other rights the
Commission may have to enforce that section, for purposes of determining whether a

b)

New Rule 430D

Currently, the framework for ABS shelf offerings, along with shelf offerings for
other securities, is outlined in Rule 430B of the Securities Act. Rule 430B describes the
type of information that primary shelf eligible and automatic shelf issuers may omit from
a base prospectus in a Rule 415 offering88 and include instead in a prospectus
supplement, Exchange Act report incorporated by reference, or a post-effective
amendment.89 We are proposing new Rule 430D to provide the framework for delayed
shelf offerings of asset-backed securities pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(vii), as proposed to
be revised. If we adopt Rule 430D, existing Rule 430B would no longer apply to ABS
offerings.
Proposed Rule 430D would require that with respect to each offering,
substantially all the information previously omitted from the prospectus filed as part of an
effective registration statement, except for the omission of information with respect to the
offering price, underwriting discounts or commissions, discounts or commissions to
dealers, amount of proceeds or other matters dependent upon the offering price, be filed
at least five business days in advance of the first sale of securities in the offering in
accordance with Rule 424(h). Thus, an issuer may not omit such information (other than
offering price, underwriting discounts or commissions, discounts or commissions to

statement includes or represents any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading at the time of sale (including,
without limitation, a contract of sale), any information conveyed to the purchaser only after
such time of sale (including such contract of sale) will not be taken into account.
(c)	 For purposes of section 12(a)(2) of the Act only, knowing of such untruth or omission in
respect of a sale (including, without limitation, a contract of sale), means knowing at the time
of such sale (including such contract of sale).
88

Under Rule 430B, a form of prospectus filed as part of a registration statement for offerings of
asset-backed securities may omit information unknown or not reasonably available pursuant to Rule 409.

32 


dealers, amount of proceeds or other matters dependent upon the offering price) from the
Rule 424(h) filing.
We are proposing conforming revisions to the undertakings that are required by
Item 512 of Regulation S-K90 in connection with a shelf registration statement. For the
most part, ABS issuers would continue to provide the same undertakings that are
currently required of ABS issuers conducting shelf offerings. We are proposing a
conforming revision to the undertakings relating to the determination of liability under
the Securities Act as to any purchaser in the offering. It would require an undertaking
that each prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(h) would be deemed part
of the registration statement as of the date the prospectus was deemed part of, and
included in, the registration statement (i.e., the date it was filed with the Commission, or,
if the prospectus was used and filed earlier, the second business day after first use).91
Also, under our proposed revision to Item 512 of Regulation S-K, an issuer would be
required to undertake to file the information required to be contained in a Rule 424(h)
filing with respect to any offering of securities.
Request for Comment
•	 We request comment on our proposal to establish a minimum period of time
available to investors to review registered ABS offering prospectuses. Are we
correct that investors need additional time? Would the proposed timeline for
filing the proposed preliminary prospectus at least five business days prior to
the date of first sale pose problems for market participants? If so, how could
89

See also Section V.B.1.b of the Offering Reform Release.

90

17 CFR 229.512.

33

we address those concerns while still providing investors with sufficient time
to analyze the securities?
•	 Is the proposed five business days sufficient time for investors? Should the
required minimum number of days that the Rule 424(h) filing must be filed
before the first sale be longer (e.g., six, seven, eight, or ten business days) or
shorter than what we are proposing (e.g., two or four business days)? Given
the increased amount of information that would be made available to investors
under this proposal, would investors need more time to consider transaction
specific information? Is our belief that the filing of standardized and tagged
asset-level information and a computer program that gives effect to the cash
flow provisions of the transaction agreement could reduce the amount of time
investors need to consider transaction-specific information correct?
•	 We are cognizant that having a transaction exposed to the markets for some
period of time causes concerns to some issuers and underwriters in some
instances. However, we also note situations in which transaction-specific
information regarding ABS is provided to other deal participants for a longer
period prior to selling the securities seemingly with no or minimal effect on
the issuer’s ability to sell securities. We note, in particular, that the Federal
Reserve Board requires information to be provided to it regarding the assets
pledged to the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) at least

91

This is consistent with the existing undertaking in Item 512 for prospectuses that are filed pursuant
to Rule 424(b)(3). See Item 512(a)(5)(i)(A) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.512(a)(5)(i)(A)].

34

three weeks prior to the subscription date.92 Similarly, rating agencies receive
information prior to rating transactions.93 If there are issues raised by
exposing the transaction publicly to the markets, please provide us with
specific information about the concerns and ways we can revise the proposal
to address them.
•	 Under our proposal, the Rule 424(h) filing would not be required to include
information dependent on pricing. Is that appropriate? If not, what
information should be required to be included and how would an issuer have
access to the information in the timeframe that we are proposing?
•	 Under our proposal, if a material change to the disclosure other than to pricing
information occurs, the issuer would be required to file a new Rule 424(h)
prospectus with updated information. Is this requirement specific enough?
Should we, instead or in addition, specify particular changes that would
trigger a filing, or conversely, that would not trigger a filing? Should we, for
example, provide that a new Rule 424(h) filing would be required if the asset
pool has changed by a certain amount? If so, what should that amount be
(e.g., 1%, 5%, or 10% of the final asset pool)? How would other changes be
described, such as changes to the waterfall? Would it be appropriate to allow
a material change without requiring a new Rule 424(h) filing and a new fiveday waiting period? Should the new Rule 424(h) filing be required as

92

Each issuer wishing to bring a TALF-eligible ABS transaction to market is required to provide, at
least three weeks prior to the subscription date, information to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
including, but not limited to, all data on the transaction the issuer has provided to any NRSRO.

proposed to reflect the change and contain substantially all the information
required to be in the prospectus, except for pricing information? Should we
only require that the change be reflected in a supplement?
•	 The requirement to file a new Rule 424(h) filing would trigger another fiveday waiting period before the first sale. Is this approach appropriate and
workable? If the issuer is required to re-file the preliminary prospectus, as
proposed, should the issuer be required to wait another five business days
before the first sale, as proposed? If not, how long should the issuer be
required to wait?
•	 Are there any aspects of the Rule 424(h) filing that we should specify must be
substantially set at the time it is required to be filed?
•	 Are there any changes, other than the ones we are proposing, to the Item 512
undertaking that should be made? Is our proposed change to incorporate the
Rule 424(h) filing in the undertakings relating to liability so that the Rule
424(h) filing shall be deemed part of the registration statement as of the date
the filed prospectus was deemed part of and included in the registration
statement appropriate?
•	 We have designed the proposed process for ABS shelf registration to strike a
balance between facilitating registered ABS offerings and providing investors
a meaningful opportunity to analyze the securities. Would our proposal to
require that the Rule 424(h) prospectus be filed at least five business days
before the first sale make shelf registration sufficiently less attractive to
issuers that they would avoid the registered market? If so, are there ways to

36 


address this concern? Below, we are proposing to require more disclosure for
private offerings of asset-backed securities that rely on the Commission’s safe
harbors that allow issuers to rely on an exemption from registration. Should
we impose even more restrictions on private offerings of asset-backed
securities than what is proposed below? For example, should we condition
reliance on Rule 506 of Regulation D on a limitation of the total number of
purchasers in an ABS offering, even for offerings to accredited investors or
qualified institutional buyers? Alternatively, should we impose fewer
restrictions on private offerings of asset-backed securities?
•	 Should we also require, or require instead, that the initial purchaser or investor
hold the securities for a period of time prior to resales in reliance on Rule
144A to better ensure that such resales of asset-backed securities are not a
distribution? Could that better ensure that the public registered ABS market
operates appropriately and that the existing safe harbors do not inappropriately
erode the public markets? If we were to add these additional restrictions on
private offerings, what would be the impact on the broader market for
structured securities? Would requiring a holding period discourage investors
from purchasing ABS in exempt private placements? Would these offerings
all be done as public deals, or would these offerings cease to be conducted at
all? Should we provide for fewer restrictions – for example, should we
require a subset of loan-level disclosures in the context of an exempt private
offering? Should issuers or sponsors have the option of providing only certain

37 


information? Or would these rules reduce the aggregate amount of
transactions? What would be the economic effect?
2.

Proposed Forms SF-1 and SF-3

In order to distinguish the ABS registration system from the registration system
for other securities, we are proposing to add new registration forms that would be used
for any sales of a security that meets the definition of an asset-backed security, as defined
in Item 1101 of Regulation AB.94 These new forms, which would be named Form SF-1
and Form SF-3,95 would require all the items applicable to ABS offerings that are
currently required in Form S-1 and Form S-3 as modified by the proposed amendments
noted below. Offerings that qualify for delayed shelf registration96 would be registered
on proposed Form SF-3, and all other offerings would be registered on Form SF-1.97
Proposed Form SF-1 would not contain all the items that are currently required by
Form S-1. Specifically, the proposed form would not include the instructions as to
summary prospectuses, as we do not believe that the summary prospectus instructions are
relevant for ABS offerings. Also, we are proposing to substitute the item in existing
Form S-1 permitting incorporation by reference by reporting companies of previously
filed Exchange Act reports and documents with an item that is more tailored to assetbacked securities on proposed Form SF-1. As discussed in Section I.D.1 below, we are
proposing that ABS issuers file a single prospectus for each takedown with all of the
information required by Regulation AB because we believe ABS offerings are more
94

17 CFR 229.1101(c).

95

The proposed forms would be referenced in 17 CFR 239.44 and 17 CFR 239.45.

96

In this release, we also refer to such offerings as shelf offerings.

38 


closely akin to initial public offerings. Therefore, we are proposing to limit incorporation
by reference to certain disclosures. In particular, as discussed below,98 we are proposing
to permit an ABS issuer to incorporate by reference into proposed Form SF-1 information
by the time of effectiveness of the registration statement the information that is required
to satisfy certain disclosure requirements (i.e., static pool information filed pursuant to
Item 6.08 of Form 8-K, asset data filed pursuant to Item 6.06 of Form 8-K, and the
waterfall computer program filed pursuant to Item 6.07 of Form 8-K).99 We also are
proposing to permit ABS issuers structured as revolving asset master trusts to incorporate
by reference certain asset-level disclosures that would have been provided in previously
filed Form 10-Ds.100
We are proposing to revise some disclosure requirements that are currently
located in Form S-3 but would be moved to proposed Form SF-3. As discussed in the
sections immediately following this discussion, we are proposing changes to shelf
eligibility for ABS issuers, which will now become the eligibility criteria for proposed
Form SF-3. In addition, we are proposing to change an eligibility requirement in existing
Form S-3 relating to delinquent filings of the depositor or an affiliate of the depositor for
purposes of proposed Form SF-3. For Form S-3, an issuer is not eligible for registration
on the form if the depositor or an affiliate of the depositor, with respect to a class of

We also propose to make conforming changes throughout our rules to refer to the new forms, as
appropriate. See, e.g., proposed revisions to Securities Act Rules 167 and 190(b)(1) and the exhibit table in
Item 601 of Regulation S-K.

asset-backed securities involving the same asset class, has not filed the Exchange Act
reports required to be filed or has not filed such reports in a timely manner for a period of
twelve months prior to the filing of the registration statement.101 However, for certain
specified reports, including reports on Form 8-K pursuant to Item 6.05, untimely filing
does not result in loss of eligibility.102 We are proposing to repeal the existing exception
from the filing timeliness requirement for Item 6.05 Form 8-K reports. Item 6.05 Form
8-K reports, which we discuss in further detail below, are required to be filed if there is a
change in the asset pool characteristics from the description of the asset pool provided in
the final prospectus and thereby provide important information regarding the composition
of the assets. Under proposed Form SF-3, the untimely filing of an Item 6.05 Form 8-K
report by the depositor or affiliate of the depositor, with respect to a class of asset-backed
securities involving the same asset class, during the twelve calendar months and any
portion of a month immediately preceding the filing of the registration statement would
result in the loss of form eligibility for up to twelve months from the time the report was
due.103 As discussed in Section V.C.1 below, we also are proposing to lower the
threshold amount of change that would trigger a filing requirement for Item 6.05 Form 8­
K reports from five percent of any material pool characteristic to one percent.

please specify.
•	 We are proposing to move the items applicable to asset-backed securities from
Forms S-1 and S-3 to proposed Forms SF-1 and SF-3, with some exceptions
noted. Do the proposed forms omit any requirement for asset-backed issuers that
should be included? Do any of the requirements need further revisions?
•	 The proposed Form SF-1 would not include the instructions as to summary
prospectuses that are included in Form S-1. Is there any reason we should
provide these instructions in proposed Form SF-1 for ABS issuers?
•	 Are our proposed instructions for incorporation by reference appropriate?
•	 Should we repeal the existing carve-out for the untimely filing of an Item 6.05
Form 8-K, as we are proposing to do? Why or why not?
3.

Shelf Eligibility for Delayed Offerings

We are proposing to eliminate the ability of ABS issuers to establish shelf
eligibility in part by means of an investment grade credit rating. This is part of our broad
ongoing effort to remove references to NRSRO credit ratings from our rules in order to
reduce the risk of undue ratings reliance and eliminate the appearance of an imprimatur
that such references may create.104 In place of credit ratings, we are proposing to
establish four shelf eligibility criteria that would apply to mortgage related securities and
other asset-backed securities alike. These proposed requirements, along with the other
current requirements,105 would determine an asset-backed issuer’s eligibility to register
for a delayed shelf offering. Similar to the existing requirement that the securities must
104

See Release No. 33-9069.

41 


be investment grade, the proposed requirements are designed to provide for a certain
quality and character for asset-backed securities that are eligible for delayed shelf
registrations..
a)

Risk Retention

Risk retention requirements have been discussed by some market participants as
one potential way to improve the quality of asset-backed securities by better aligning the
incentives of the sponsors and originators of the pool assets with investors’ incentives. A
chain of securitization may involve multiple participants that may serve the function of
originator, sponsor, servicer, or trustee.106 One concern that has been debated is whether
the model of securitization where loan originators do not hold the loans they originate but
instead repackage and sell them as securities may create a misalignment of incentives
between the originator of the assets and the investors in the securities, which
misalignment may have contributed to lower quality assets being included in
securitizations that did not have continuing sponsor exposure to the assets in the pool.107
The theory underlying a risk retention requirement is that if a sponsor retains exposure to
the risks of the assets, the sponsor is more likely to have greater incentives to include

105

See fn. 70 above.

106

Under Regulation AB, “servicer” means any person responsible for the management or collection
of the pool assets or making allocations or distributions to holders of the asset-backed securities. The term
“servicer” does not include a trustee for the issuing entity or the asset-backed securities that makes
allocations or distributions to holders of the asset-backed securities if the trustee receives such allocations
or distributions from a servicer and the trustee does not otherwise perform the functions of a servicer. See
Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB. In some cases, one party may act in two or more different roles, such as
when a bank and/or affiliated party of the bank serves in all three functions of originator, sponsor, and
servicer of an ABS offering. In contrast, in the case of so-called aggregators, the sponsor acquires loans
from many other unaffiliated sellers before securitization.
107

See, e.g., European Central Bank, The Incentive Structure of the ‘Originate to Distribute Model,’
December 2008, at 5 (noting that securitization is fundamentally vulnerable to certain adverse behavior
since agents seek to maximize their benefits while principals cannot fully observe and control the agents’
actions); Amiyatosh Purnanandam, “Originate-to-Distribute Model and the Subprime Crisis” (Apr. 27,
2009), available at http://ssrn.com/abstract=1167786.

42 


higher quality assets in the pool. Because we believe that securitizations with sponsors
that have continuing risk exposure would likely be higher quality than those without, we
are proposing, among other things, to replace the investment grade ratings requirement in
the ABS shelf eligibility conditions with a condition that the sponsor of any securitization
retain risk in each tranche of the securitization on an ongoing basis. Such a requirement
has colloquially been referred to as “risk retention,” or “skin in the game.” We believe
that the proposed risk retention requirement for shelf eligibility would distinguish the
types of securities that are of a sufficient quality and character to be shelf eligible while
avoiding the possibility of undue reliance on ratings.
Risk retention requirements are being considered in the U.S. and internationally.
In the U.S., proposals with such requirements have come in several different forms.108
Risk retention requirements have recently garnered support.109 On the other hand, some

108

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) recently solicited public comments
regarding proposed amendments to a “safe harbor” rule from the FDIC’s statutory authority to disaffirm or
repudiate contracts of an insured depository institution (“IDI”) with respect to transfers of financial assets
by an IDI in connection with a securitization or a participation (the “FDIC Securitization Proposal”). The
FDIC Securitization Proposal also includes risk retention requirements for purposes of providing a safe
harbor for IDIs, although in a different context from our proposal which would require risk retention as a
condition to shelf eligibility. See Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Advance Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking Regarding Treatment by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as Conservator or
Receiver of Financial Assets Transferred by an Insured Depository Institution in Connection With a
Securitization or Participation After March 31, 2010 (Jan. 7, 2010) [75 FR 934]. The comment letters are
available at http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/federal/2010/10comAD55.html. See also H.R. 4173,
111th Cong., (bill that would require a creditor or securitizer to retain five percent of the credit risk on any
loan that is transferred, sold, or conveyed); Senate proposal, 111th Congress, “Restoring American
Financial Stability Act of 2010” (bill that would require five percent risk retention). The Senate bill
contemplates joint rulemaking regarding the risk retention requirement with the SEC, the FDIC and the
Office of Comptroller Currency and the House bill contemplates joint rulemaking with the SEC, the
National Credit Union Administration Board, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve system, the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervisors and the FDIC.
109

See, e.g., CFA Institute Centre for Financial Market Integrity and Council of Institutional
Investors, “U.S. Financial Regulatory Reform: The Investor’s Perspective,” July 2009 (recommending that
ABS sponsors should be required to retain a meaningful residual interest in their securitized products).
See, e.g., U.S. Department of Treasury, A New Foundation: Rebuilding Financial Supervision and
Regulation, June 17, 2009; H.R. 1728, 111th Cong. §213 (2009). In addition, risk retention by originating
lenders has been a component of several guaranteed loan programs administered by the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) since 1972, when amendments to the Consolidated Farm and Rural

43 


are concerned that mandatory risk retention will not necessarily result in improved asset
quality, may not be calibrated to reflect the risk in any given pool and across different
asset classes, and may conflict with various other goals and purposes of securitization.110
In addition, in its January 2009 framework, a working group on financial reform
in the Group of Thirty recommended that regulated financial institutions be required to
retain a meaningful portion of the credit risk of the financial assets they are packaging
into securitized and other structured credit products.111 On May 6, 2009, the European
Union adopted an amendment to the Capital Requirements Directive, which sets out the
rules for Basel II implementation in Europe, that will, upon effectiveness, prohibit a
credit institution from investing in a securitization unless there is disclosure from the
originator, sponsor, or original lender that one of them will retain, on an ongoing basis, a
net economic interest in the securitized credit risk of at least five percent.
We are proposing to make risk retention a part of the shelf eligibility conditions
for asset-backed issuers. Under our proposal, Form SF-3 would require that, as a

Development Act (7 USC 1921 et seq.) expanded the USDA’s lending authority to include guarantees of
farm and rural development loans issued by commercial lenders. For example, under its guaranteed farm
loan program, the Farm Service Agency can guarantee up to 90% of a loan issued by a commercial lender
to an eligible farmer, but that lender must retain the full amount of the unguaranteed portion in its portfolio
for the life of the loan. See 7 CFR 762.160. Similar conditions are required for guaranteed loan programs
administered by the USDA’s Rural Housing Service. See, e.g., 7 CFR 3575.4. See also comment letter
from MetLife on the FDIC Securitization Proposal (“MetLife FDIC Letter”) (generally supporting credit
risk retention because it aligns interests with investors and noting that retention should represent a vertical
pro rata slice of all securitization obligations, as long as retaining the interest does not cause unintended
consolidation issues for the issuer) and comment letter from Consumers Union on the FDIC Securitization
Proposal (supporting retention of ten percent of an economic interest because it would create stronger
incentives for accurate underwriting).

See, e.g., comment letter from American Securitization Forum and comment letter from American
Bar Association on the FDIC Securitization Proposal.

See Group of Thirty, Financial Reform: A Framework for Financial Stability (Jan. 15, 2009), at

condition to shelf eligibility, the sponsor or an affiliate of the sponsor retain a net
economic interest in each securitization in one of the two following manners:
•	 retention of a minimum of five percent of the nominal amount of each of the
tranches sold or transferred to investors, net of hedge positions directly related to
the securities or exposures taken by such sponsor or affiliate;112 or
•	 in the case of revolving asset master trusts, retention of the originator’s interest of
a minimum of five percent of the nominal amount of the securitized exposures,
net of hedge positions directly related to the securities or exposures taken by such
sponsor or affiliate, provided that the originator’s interest and securities held by
investors are collectively backed by the same pool of receivables, and payments
of the originator’s interest are not less than five percent of payments of the
securities held by investors collectively.113
Under the proposed eligibility requirement, the net economic interest required to be
retained to be shelf eligible would be measured at issuance (or at origination in the case
of originator’s interest), and then maintained on an ongoing basis.114 Also, proposed

112

Under the proposed condition, no sponsor may purchase or sell a security, derivative, or other
financial product or enter into an agreement with any third party, in which the terms or payments (or lack
of payment) of any of the loans or other assets that underlie the ABS are a material term of that financial
product or agreement, if the financial product or agreement in any way reduces or limits the financial
exposure of the sponsor to less than five percent of the nominal amount of the ABS. Thus, hedges of
market interest or currency exchange rates, would not be taken into account in the calculation of the
sponsor’s risk retention for purposes of the net five percent risk retention requirement. Hedges tied to
securities similar to the ABS also would not be taken into account in the calculation of the sponsor’s risk
retention. For instance, holding a security tied to the return of a subprime ABX.HE index would not be a
hedge on a particular tranche of a subprime RMBS sold by the sponsor unless that tranche itself was in the
index.
113

Currently, credit card ABS structures typically include an originator’s interest, which is pari passu
with the investors’ interest in the pool of receivables.
114

In 2009, the EU Commission called on Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) to
provide technical advice on the amendment to the Capital Requirements Directive (i.e., Article 122a of the
EU Capital Requirements Directive) which will prohibit a credit institution from investing in a
securitization unless there is disclosure from the originator or sponsor that it has retained risk. Among

45 


Form SF-3 would require disclosure relating to the interest that is retained by the
sponsor.115 Retention of five percent net economic interest is intended to align incentives
of sponsors with investors, such that the quality of the assets in the pool or other aspects
of the offering is likely to be higher than for a securitization without risk retention, and,
thus, should be an appropriate partial substitute for the existing investment grade ratings
requirement in the ABS shelf eligibility conditions. If we adopt a risk retention condition
to shelf eligibility, we preliminarily believe that five percent is an appropriate amount of
risk to require sponsors to retain and balances our goal of requiring some exposure to risk
without overburdening the capital structure of sponsors.116
In constructing the risk retention shelf eligibility condition, we also considered,
but are not proposing, an option of retaining risk through the retention of randomly
selected exposures for purposes of meeting shelf eligibility conditions. If issuers retain
randomly selected exposures, we believe the economic effects, including incentive
alignment, should be approximately the same as retaining a fixed percentage of the
nominal amount of each tranche, if the randomization is properly implemented.
However, we believe that it would be both difficult and potentially costly for investors
and regulators to verify that exposures were indeed selected randomly, rather than in a
manner that favored the sponsor.

other things, the EU Commission requested the CEBS consider the adequacy of the minimum 5% retention
requirement to meet the goal of avoiding misaligned incentives and of mitigating systemic risks from
securitization markets. See publication of the Committee of European Banking Supervisors, “CEBS today

We believe that the proposed two different ways that a sponsor could retain risk to
satisfy the risk retention shelf eligibility condition would likely result in better incentive
alignment, and, consequently higher quality securities, than retention of only the residual
interest in a securitization.117 “Horizontal risk retention” in the form of retention of the
equity or residual interest could lead to skewed incentive structures, because the holder of
only the residual interest of a securitization may have different interests from the holders
of other tranches in the securitization and, thus, not necessarily result in higher quality
securities. The proposed ways that a sponsor could satisfy the risk retention shelf
eligibility condition -- either by retaining a “vertical” slice of the securitization, by which
we mean taking a portion of the economic risk in each class of security that is being
offered, or, in the case of revolving exposures, the originator’s interest, would create a
direct, shared interest with all the investors in the performance of the underlying assets.
We recognize that there are differing views on the effectiveness of risk retention
policies as a means to align the incentives of securitization transaction parties with the
interests of investors, both as an intrinsic matter and as compared with other alternatives,
as well as concerns about the collateral consequences on the securitization markets
associated with conditioning shelf eligibility on risk retention. Some note that originators
and other financial institutions active in the mortgage securitization chain suffered
massive losses in the financial crisis as a result of their direct and indirect exposure to
asset underperformance and, therefore, risk retention exposes financial institutions who
117

A particular issuance of asset-backed securities often involves one or more publicly offered
classes as well as one or more privately placed classes. In most instances, the subordinated classes, or
residual interests, which are typically privately placed, act as structural credit enhancement for the publicly
offered senior classes by receiving payments after, and therefore absorbing losses before, the senior classes.
Cash flows from the pool assets back both the senior classes and the subordinate classes, and thus
allocation of the cash flows to the subordinated classes could affect directly or indirectly the publicly
offered classes.

are sponsors to too much risk.118 Another criticism of risk retention posits that different
forms of risk retention, such as retention of the equity piece, may lead issuers to screen
assets that go into the pool differently.119 One industry group has asserted that other
forms of requiring potential loss exposure, such as more stringent representations and
warranties regarding the assets in the pool, may be preferable to outright retention of an
economic interest in the securities.120 Nevertheless, we believe it appropriate at this time
to propose the risk retention requirement detailed herein, balancing various
considerations that will need to be accounted for before reaching any final determination
as to the best way to proceed.
Although sponsors in the past may have initially held a portion of the
securitization, such retention often had different motivations and different effects than
retention as we propose it. In many cases, sponsors held small portions. These portions
were often a small horizontal slice of the securitization and, therefore, would have been
unlikely to have driven the sponsor to focus on the quality of the loans or other
underlying assets in order to protect that interest. Also, retention of that small portion of
those securities may have been due to an inability or lack of incentive to sell those
securities. This was often because the securities had a lower return or carried lower

of the scale and nature of risk retention).

For example, the ASF has proposed model representations and warranties designed to enhance the
alignment of incentives of mortgage originators with those of investors in mortgage loans. See American

spread, and thus were of little interest to investors seeking yield, while the higher
returning securities were sold. Many of the retained securities were securities backed by
similarly ranked tranches of ABS, which magnified rather than diversified risk. It may be
the case that originators and/or underwriters underestimated the risk of both higher
(senior) and lower (subordinated) tranches, but their retention practices did not result in
the sort of overall risk assessment that our proposal would entail.121 Thus, retaining risk
in that manner would have been unlikely to have the same impact on loan originations,
risk analysis, or underwriting –and the resultant asset quality -- as the risk retention
requirement that we are proposing for ABS shelf eligibility.
In keeping with our belief that incentives are best aligned and quality of assets
most significantly impacted if the sponsor retains an equal proportion of all tranches or
the economic equivalent, we are proposing to require that, if sponsors select the second
risk retention option, they retain a claim whose cash flows are at least five percent of
those paid to investors, at all times and in all scenarios. This requirement means that the
originator’s interest must ultimately be a claim to the same pool of assets as the securities
held by investors and must be equivalent in seniority to these securities. The originator’s
interest would, therefore, be the economic equivalent of retaining a fixed proportion of
the nominal amount of all tranches held by investors. We understand that it is a typical
practice for credit card ABS to retain an originator’s interest in the pool.
For both options, we are proposing to require risk retention net of hedge positions
directly related to the securities or exposures taken by the sponsor or its affiliate. This

121

See Gillian Tett, Fool’s Gold (2009); International Monetary Fund, Global Financial Stability
Report: Navigating the Financial Challenges Ahead (Oct. 2009) at 25 (noting that retention of the senior
tranche was motivated mainly by difficulties placing them), available at
http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/gfsr/2009/02/pdf/text.pdf.

would mean that sponsors would not be able to simply “resell” the specific risks related
to the retained securities or asset pool underlying them and remain shelf eligible. The
purpose of risk retention is to align the sponsor’s incentives with the investors’ incentives
by exposing each of them to the same risks which thereby promotes higher quality
securities in ABS shelf offerings than without risk retention by the sponsor. However,
we are primarily concerned with the risks that are under the direct or indirect control of
the sponsor (such as the quality of the originator’s underwriting standards and the extent
of the review undertaken to verify the information regarding the assets). Therefore,
hedge positions that are not directly related to the securities or exposures taken by the
sponsor or affiliate would not be required to be netted under our proposal. Such positions
would include hedges related to overall market movements, such as movements of
market interest rates, currency exchange rates, or of the overall value of a particular broad
category of asset-backed securities.
As noted above, the proposed risk retention shelf eligibility condition would apply
to the sponsor or affiliate of the sponsor. Our proposal is intended to provide an
incentive for the sponsor to take additional steps to consider the quality of the assets that
are securitized by exposing sponsors to the same credit risk that investors will be exposed
to. We believe that there may be reasons to impose these risk retention requirements on
the sponsor rather than the originator. Where a non-affiliated aggregator acts as the
sponsor of a transaction,122 the costs of monitoring risk retention born by an originator
rather than the sponsor may be disproportionately high because the securitization may
include many originators where each originator may have contributed a very small part of

122

See discussion in fn. 106 regarding aggregators.

50 


the assets in the entire pool. In addition, if risk retention were imposed on each originator
rather than the sponsor, the amount of risk held by each originator may be small. As
such, the incentives afforded through risk retention may be diminished or rendered less
effective. With risk retention imposed on sponsors, we believe that sponsors would have
the appropriate incentives and mechanisms to ensure that originators’ lending standards
are consistent with the quality and character of the ABS to be offered off of the shelf.
Therefore, we believe it is more appropriate to impose risk retention requirements on the
sponsor than the non-affiliated originator.123
Under our proposal, a sponsor may still conduct a public offering without risk
retention. However, such offering would be required to be registered on proposed Form
SF-1 rather than proposed Form SF-3. Those offerings would not be eligible for delayed
shelf registration, which would subject them to a longer period before they could be
completed since a new registration statement would need to be filed and become effective
before an offering could be completed. This would allow additional time for the
investors to analyze the offering.124
We have also considered other ancillary impacts of our proposed risk retention
shelf eligibility condition. For example, we considered the impact of the shelf eligibility
condition on financial reporting. We note that the Financial Accounting Standards
Board’s newly-issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 166 and 167,
contained in FASB’s Accounting Standards Codification, Topic 860, Transfers and
123

As discussed in Section III.C.3 below, we also propose to add requirements for disclosure of any
interest in the securities that is retained by the sponsor or originator.
124

As we are proposing to require in Section III.C.3 below, if the offering does not include risk
retention by the sponsor, an issuer should provide clear disclosure that the sponsor of the offering is not
required by law to retain any risk in the securities and may sell any interest initially retained at any time, as
applicable.

51 


Servicing, and Topic 810, Consolidation, respectively, change the accounting for
transfers of financial assets and the criteria for consolidation of variable interest entities.
Substantially all types of special-purpose entities used in asset-backed securitization
transactions are, for accounting purposes, variable interest entities.
The accounting guidance for consolidation requires a party to consolidate a
variable interest entity if it has a variable interest in the securitization that is a controlling
financial interest in the variable interest entity. The accounting guidance specifies that a
party has a controlling financial interest if it has variable interests with both of the
following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity
that most significantly impact the variable interest entity’s economic performance, and
(b) the obligation to absorb losses of the variable interest entity (or the right to receive
benefits from the variable interest entity) that could potentially be significant to the
variable interest entity. Only one party, if any, is expected to have a controlling financial
interest in a variable interest entity.
A sponsor that retains an economic interest in each tranche of securities, as we are
proposing to require as a condition for shelf eligibility, generally will have a variable
interest in the asset-backed securitization entity. However, satisfaction of the proposed
risk retention condition would not, by itself, be determinative as to whether a sponsor’s
variable interests would be a controlling financial interest resulting in consolidation. This
is the case because each sponsor will need to evaluate the facts and circumstances related
to each particular transaction in light of the FASB’s newly-issued guidance, including
whether the sponsor has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact
the variable interest entity’s economic performance. In some cases, the economic

52 


performance of the variable interest entity is most significantly impacted by the
performance of the assets that back the securities. In those cases, the activity that most
significantly impacts the performance of the assets could be, for example, management of
asset delinquencies and defaults or, as another example, selecting, monitoring, and
disposing of collateral securities.
We expect the effect of the FASB’s newly-issued guidance, together with the
effect of satisfaction of our proposed risk retention condition for shelf eligibility (or
retention of risk for other reasons), to generally increase the instances in which financial
assets (and corresponding financial obligations) continue to be reported in the financial
statements of the reporting entity that transfers the financial assets. However, the
accounting and consolidation determinations for any particular transaction will depend on
judgments about the related facts and circumstances.
We understand that the isolation of the assets comprising the pool from claims of
other creditors is important to ABS investors. 125 Currently, credit card issuers typically
retain an originator's interest in the pool, so our proposed risk retention shelf eligibility
condition should not impact those issuers. Our proposed shelf eligibility requirement of
retaining a vertical slice of the securities offered is not intended to have an impact on the
isolation of the underlying assets, and we are not aware of any reason to believe it
would. The proposed shelf eligibility condition would be to hold an interest in all the
securities sold to investors and not the underlying assets directly nor the residual interest.
True sale opinions are typically required on the transfer of assets from the originator to

Industry Association , “Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) and the Securitization Markets,” (Feb. 1, 2002)

the depositor. This proposed shelf eligibility condition would apply to the sponsor,
which may not necessarily be the originator. Thus, we believe the shelf eligibility
condition should not impact whether there has been a true sale at law of the assets and
therefore not change the analysis in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or
conservatorship of the originator or the sponsor.
Request for Comment
•	 Should we continue to condition shelf eligibility on requirements that are related
to the quality of an ABS offering? Should we, as proposed, replace references to
investment grade credit ratings with a risk retention requirement and/or the other
criteria discussed below, which are intended to increase the likelihood of higher
quality securities than securities that are not required to meet such criteria? Is
there a possibility that, by establishing a risk retention requirement or any other
criteria based on quality, investors may unduly rely on an appearance that
incentives are aligned or that the security has greater quality and consequently be
less inclined to expend effort to perform their own analyses creating a similar
situation that over-reliance on ratings created? Do the policy bases for shelf
eligibility suggest eligibility criteria based on quality of securities are appropriate?
Conversely, are expedited offerings inconsistent with an attempt to promote
independent analysis of asset-backed securities and reduce the likelihood of undue
reliance by investors on credit ratings and therefore, should we not allow ABS
offerings to be shelf registered? Should we continue to allow short-form
registration for asset-backed securities? Given that each asset-backed security

securitizations would not take place without the ability to establish SPEs, as investors do not want to take
on any risk associated with the seller).

54

offering off the shelf is akin to an initial public offering with respect to the
particular issuer, is the premise of most other short form registration (i.e., that an
eligible issuer enjoys a widespread market following) applicable to issuers of
asset-backed securities?
•	 We request comment on risk retention as a condition to eligibility for a delayed
ABS shelf offering. Would the proposed risk retention condition address
concerns relating to the misalignment of incentives and lead to higher quality
securities in registered ABS shelf offerings? Is this an appropriate condition for
shelf eligibility? Would the requirement incentivize sponsors to consider the
quality of the assets being underwritten and sold into the securitization vehicle?
•	 Is five percent an appropriate amount of risk for the sponsor to retain in order for
the offering to be shelf eligible? Should it be higher (e.g., ten or 15%)? Should it
be lower (e.g., one or three percent)? Should the amount of required risk
retention be tied to another measure?
•	 Should the risk retention condition require retention of risk by sponsors (as
proposed) or by originators?
•	 Are there other better ways to address alignment of incentives, and thus quality of
the securities, in the aggregator situation? Should we require in that situation that
all originators and the sponsor retain some risk?
•	 Should sponsors be permitted to satisfy the risk retention condition through a
different form of risk retention than what is proposed (e.g., retention of first loss
position or retention of first loss position in conjunction with retention of some
form of vertical slice of the securitization)? Should the risk retention condition

55 


relate to retention of the mezzanine tranche? Should the risk retention condition
depend on the type and quality of the assets, the structure of the securities and
expected economic condition? How could we structure a shelf eligibility
condition to take those variables into account?
•	 We considered but are not proposing an alternative way to satisfy the risk
retention shelf eligibility condition based on retention of randomly-selected
exposures. We are concerned about the ability to subsequently demonstrate the
randomness of the random selection process, including for purposes of monitoring
or auditing. Should we include this alternative? Are there any mechanisms that
we could adopt that would ensure adequate monitoring of the randomization
process if such an alternative were permitted? For example, would our concerns
be addressed if the sponsor was required to provide a third party opinion that the
selection process has been random and that retained exposures are equivalent (i.e.,
share a similar risk profile) to the securitized exposures? Would this be
sufficient? Would this opinion resemble a credit rating, raising the same issues
that rule reliance on credit ratings has had? If this approach were taken, should
we impose any requirements on the characteristics of such a third party? Should
that third party be considered an expert for purposes of the registration statement?
•	 If we adopted a random selection alternative, should we require the same
disclosure regarding the securitized exposures that are subject to risk retention
that is required for the assets in the pool at the time of securitization and on an
ongoing basis? Should the shelf eligibility condition require that the retained
exposures be subject to the same servicing as the securitized exposures?

56 


•	 Instead of requiring risk retention as a condition for shelf eligibility, should risk
retention be made voluntary for shelf-eligible offerings and issuers only be
required to add specified disclosure on the interest that the sponsor or other
transaction participants retain? In other words, instead of mandating a certain
amount of risk retention, should the requirement be that issuers disclose the
percentage of risk retained and in what form? As discussed in greater detail in
section III.C.3 of the release, we are also proposing to revise Items 1104, 1108
and 1110 of Regulation AB to require disclosure regarding the sponsor’s, a
servicer’s or a 20% originator’s interest retained in the transaction, including
amount and nature of that interest. This information would be required for both
shelf and non-shelf offerings. If those proposed risk retention disclosure
requirements were adopted, would there be a need for or a significant incremental
benefit from mandating specific minimum risk retention as a condition of shelf
eligibility? Could this incremental benefit be achieved strictly through a marketbased mechanism – for example, through fully-disclosed ABS covenants in which
the sponsor pre-commits to retain a minimum percentage of the risk of the deal, as
opposed to a regulatory requirement? Is the disclosure proposed to be required
below sufficient to achieve such a benefit, and if not, what additional disclosures
should we require? Would disclosure of the risk retention be a sufficient indicator
of shelf-eligible offerings? Should we condition shelf eligibility on requiring the
sponsor to covenant that it would maintain a minimum percentage of risk
retention? If so, should we provide any limitations on the covenant (e.g., what
percentage of tranche or assets must be retained, manner of sponsor’s retention,

57 


no hedging)? What are the limitations to a market-based mechanism for risk
retention? Would such a transaction covenant be credible and enforceable?
Would requiring this transaction covenant, along with disclosure of risk retention
pursuant to the covenant, sufficiently distinguish those offerings that should be
made shelf eligible from those that should not?
•	 Should net economic interest be measured at the time of origination/issuance as
proposed? Would a different measurement date be more appropriate (e.g., the
securitization cut-off date)? If the interest were measured at the time of
securitization cut-off date, could this cause issuers to change various terms? Is
the amount of retention that is required to be retained on an ongoing basis
appropriate? Why or why not?
•	 Should revolving asset master trusts be permitted to satisfy the shelf eligibility
requirement by retaining the originator’s interest, as proposed? In those cases,
should we require as proposed that the originator’s interest and securities held by
investors are collectively backed by the same pool of receivables, and payments
of the originator’s interest are not less than five percent of payments of the
securities held by investors collectively? Is that typical in credit card issuances?
•	 Are the proposed netting provisions appropriate? Do we need to provide more
guidance on what kind of hedges would be netted against the retained risk? Is the
proposed “directly related” standard appropriate? Is it sufficiently clear what type
of hedges would be allowed? Are there certain forms of hedges that we should
indicate would not be netted against the retained risk? Is there any concern that
sponsors may inadvertently hedge the economic risk required to be retained? If

58 


so, do we need to address that and what is the best way for us to address it?
Should we expand the proposed netting provisions to other types of hedging?
Should we narrow the proposed netting provisions in any way?
•

Should the sponsor be allowed to sell off the retained interest after a certain point
in time while non-affiliates of the depositor still hold securities and still remain
shelf eligible? If so, when? Would that undermine the purpose of the condition?
If not, why not?

•

Should there be an alternate condition to the risk retention shelf eligibility
condition? For instance, should risk retention apply to RMBS that are backed by
mortgages that are not qualified mortgages, as defined H.R. 1728, 126 a recent
legislative proposal?127 Would it be appropriate to require risk retention unless

126

See, e.g., Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act, H.R. 1728, 111th Congress.

127

At §203 in H.R. 1728, a qualified mortgage is defined as a mortgage:
(i)

that does not allow a consumer to defer repayment of principal or interest, or is not
otherwise deemed a `non-traditional mortgage' under guidance, advisories, or regulations
prescribed by the Federal Banking Agencies;

(ii)

that does not provide for a repayment schedule that results in negative amortization at any
time;

(iii)

for which the terms are fully amortizing and which does not result in a balloon payment,
where a `balloon payment' is a scheduled payment that is more than twice as large as the
average of earlier scheduled payments;

(iv)

which has an annual percentage rate that does not exceed the average prime offer rate for
a comparable transaction, as of the date the interest rate is set-(I)
by 1.5 or more percentage points, in the case of a first lien residential mortgage
loan having a original principal obligation amount that is equal to or less than the amount
of the maximum limitation on the original principal obligation of mortgage in effect for a
residence of the applicable size, as of the date of such interest rate set, pursuant to the
sixth sentence of section 305(a)(2) the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act
(12 U.S.C. 1454(a)(2));
(II)
by 2.5 or more percentage points, in the case of a first lien residential mortgage
loan having a original principal obligation amount that is more than the amount of the
maximum limitation on the original principal obligation of mortgage in effect for a
residence of the applicable size, as of the date of such interest rate set, pursuant to the
sixth sentence of section 305(a)(2) the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act
(12 U.S.C. 1454(a)(2)); and

59 


full documentation has been provided for the assets, the borrower meets a certain
minimum credit score, or the terms of the loan do not involve balloon payments?
Would such requirements for the mortgages in the pool be a better condition to
shelf eligibility than the proposed risk retention shelf eligibility condition?
Would such a shelf eligibility condition be difficult to implement? Should we
instead condition shelf eligibility on risk retention for loans with an annual
percentage rate that exceeds the average prime offer rate for a comparable
transaction as of the date the interest rate is set by 1.5 or more percentage points
for loans secured by a first lien on a dwelling, or by 3.5 or more percentage points
for loans secured by a subordinate lien on a dwelling?128 How would we structure
a condition that relates to specified characteristics of the assets for other asset

(III)
by 3.5 or more percentage points, in the case of a subordinate lien residential
mortgage loan;
(v)	

for which the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the obligors on the
loan are verified and documented;

(vi)	

in the case of a fixed rate loan, for which the underwriting process is based on a payment
schedule that fully amortizes the loan over the loan term and takes into account all
applicable taxes, insurance, and assessments;

(vii)	

(vii) in the case of an adjustable rate loan, for which the underwriting is based on the
maximum rate permitted under the loan during the first seven years, and a payment
schedule that fully amortizes the loan over the loan term and takes into account all
applicable taxes, insurance, and assessments;

(viii)	

that does not cause the consumer’s total monthly debts, including amounts under the
loan, to exceed a percentage established by regulation of the consumer’s monthly gross
income or such other maximum percentage of such income as may be prescribed by
regulation under paragraph (4), and such rules shall also take into consideration the
consumer's income available to pay regular expenses after payment of all installment and
revolving debt;

(ix)	

for which the total points and fees payable in connection with the loan do not exceed 2
percent of the total loan amount, where `points and fees' means points and fees as defined
by Section 103(aa)(4) of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1602(aa)(4)); and

(x)	

for which the term of the loan does not exceed 30 years, except as such term may be
extended under paragraph (4).

classes that may not have those variables or those industry standards or have
different underwriting standards? What would be the appropriate categories and
thresholds? Do those appropriate categories and thresholds differ for different
classes? If so, how? Are there securitized asset classes that have no clear or
established standards that could demarcate assets meriting shelf eligibility and
those that do not?
•	 The residual interest of a commercial mortgage securitization is typically sold to a
third party purchaser, also known as the “B-piece buyer,” before the issuance of
the securities. In light of this practice, should we permit third party retention of a
portion of the securitization to fulfill the shelf eligibility condition? How can we
ensure that incentives between the sponsor and investors are aligned in a manner
that results in higher quality if the sponsor is permitted to sell off its risk to a third
party? For example, should such a shelf eligibility condition require that if a third
party will retain the credit risk, the third party purchaser must retain a higher
percentage (e.g., ten or 15%) of the risk, rather than five percent? If we allow this
approach, should we condition shelf eligibility on a requirement that the third
party separately examine the assets in the pool and/or not sell or hedge its
holdings? Are there reasons we should, or should not, permit a third party to
retain risk in order satisfy the proposed risk retention condition?129
•	 Should any asset classes or types of securities be exempt from the proposed risk
retention shelf eligibility condition or have different risk retention requirements
apply? Because of the unique nature of residential mortgages in the financial

In recent years, it was not uncommon for the securitization residual or equity interests to be
repackaged into CDOs and sold in the private markets.

61 


markets, should risk retention apply to shelf offerings of residential mortgagebacked securities (RMBS) but not offerings of other ABS? If so, what would be
an appropriate partial substitute for investment grade rating for shelf eligibility for
those other asset classes?
•	 How would the proposed risk retention shelf eligibility condition impact how
sellers account for the transfer of assets in a securitization transaction? Is it
desirable to revise the proposal to lessen that impact and if so, how?
•	 Would the proposal have an impact on the true sale at law of the assets or on the
rights of ABS investors as a result of conservatorship, receivership or bankruptcy
of the originator or sponsor? If so, how can we revise the proposed risk retention
condition to require risk retention without jeopardizing the transfer of assets as a
true sale at law or the remoteness of those assets in the event of any bankruptcy,
conservatorship, or receivership of the sponsor or originator?
•	 We note that FINRA Rule 5130 (Restrictions on the Purchase and Sale of IPOs of
Equity Securities) generally prohibits FINRA members from selling initial public
offerings to broker dealers and their affiliates. The rule is designed to protect the
integrity of the public offering process by ensuring that: 1) members make bona
fide public offerings of securities at the offering price; 2) members do not
withhold securities in a public offering for their own benefit or use securities to
reward persons who can give them future business; and 3) industry insiders do not
take advantage of their insider position to purchase IPOs for their own benefit at
the expense of the public.130 Under FINRA’s rules, if an ABS is an equity

security, it is excluded from the application of the rule if the security is sold
pursuant to an exemption under the Securities Act or if it is an offering of
investment grade rated ABS. Will this rule have any significant impact on the
ability to retain risk as a requirement for shelf eligibility? While our rule changes
would eliminate references to credit ratings, sponsors may still obtain ratings,
which would potentially qualify the offering for this exemption. Alternatively,
FINRA could change its rule to provide the exemption to shelf-eligible ABS
rather than investment grade rated ABS. Are there any other regulations or rules
that may impact the retention of risk?
b)

Third Party Review of Repurchase Obligations

In the underlying transaction agreements for an asset securitization, sponsors or
originators typically make representations and warranties relating to the pool assets and
their origination, including about the quality of the pool assets. For instance, in the case
of residential mortgage-backed securities, one such representation and warranty is that
each of the loans has complied with applicable federal, state and local laws, including
truth-in-lending, consumer credit protection, predatory and abusive laws and disclosure
laws. Another representation that may be included is that no fraud has taken place in
connection with the origination of the assets on the part of the originator or any party
involved in the origination of the assets. Upon discovery that a pool asset does not
comply with the representation or warranty, under transaction covenants, an obligated
party, typically the sponsor, must repurchase the asset or substitute the non-compliant
asset with a different asset that complies with the representations and warranties.

63 


The effectiveness of these contractual provisions has been questioned and lack of
responsiveness by sponsors to potential breaches of the representations and warranties
relating to the pool assets has been the subject of investor complaint.131 Transaction
agreements typically have not included specific mechanisms to identify breaches of
representations and warranties or to resolve a question as to whether a breach of the
representations and warranties has occurred. 132 Thus, these contractual agreements have
frequently been ineffective because without access to documents relating to each pool
asset, it can be difficult for the trustee, which typically notifies the sponsor of an alleged
breach, to determine whether or not a representation or warranty relating to a pool asset
has been breached. Investors and trustees must rely on the sponsor to provide the
necessary documentation about the assets in question. Without further safeguards, the
protective quality of the representations and warranties can be compromised.
We are proposing to require as a condition to shelf eligibility, that the pooling and
servicing agreement or other transaction agreement for the securitization, which is
required to be filed with the Commission,133 contain a specified provision to enhance the

or abusive lending practices) and American Securitization Forum, ASF Releases Model Representations
and Warranties to Bolster Risk Retention and Transparency in Mortgage Securitizations, (Dec. 15, 2009),

Freddie Mac have been able to exercise repurchase demands. See Aparajita Saha-Bubna, “Repurchased
Loans Putting Banks in Hole,” Wall Street Journal (Mar. 8, 2010)(noting that most mortgages bouncing
back to lenders are coming from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac).

breaches of representations and warranties and recommending that post-securitization forensic reviews be
conducted by an independent third party for delinquent loans).

protective nature of the representations and warranties. The specified provision would
require the obligated party (i.e. the representing and warranting party) to furnish a third
party’s opinion relating to any asset for which the trustee has asserted a breach of any
representation or warranty and for which the asset was not repurchased or replaced by the
obligated party on the basis of an assertion that the asset met the representations and
warranties contained in the pooling and servicing or other agreement.134 The third party
opinion would confirm that the asset did not violate a representation or warranty
contained in the pooling and servicing agreement or other transaction agreement.
Because we believe that annual review of the assets is not sufficient to address investors’
concerns regarding the enforceability of these provisions in the underlying transaction
documents, the opinion would be required to be furnished to the trustee at least quarterly.
To better ensure that the opinion is impartial, we are proposing to require that the
third party providing the opinion not be an affiliate of the obligated party. This proposed
third party loan review condition to shelf eligibility is designed to help ensure that
representations and warranties about the assets provide meaningful protection to
investors, which should encourage sponsors to include higher quality assets in the asset
pool.135 As a result, we believe that this proposed condition is an appropriate partial
substitute for the investment grade ratings requirement.

See proposed General Instruction I.B.1(b) of proposed Form SF-3. Under existing rules, the
transaction agreement is required to be filed as an exhibit to the registration statement. See Item 601 of
Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.601].
135

As described below, we also propose to add a disclosure requirement to Exchange Act Form 10-D
that would require disclosure of the number of loans that have been presented for repurchase to the party
obligated to repurchase the assets under the transaction agreements and the number of those assets that
have not been repurchased or replaced.

•

Is this proposed condition an appropriate shelf eligibility condition for ABS
offerings?

•	 Would this proposed condition, which would only require an undertaking from
the issuer, have a measurable benefit to investors? Should we require more
assurance that third party opinions have been provided to investors as a condition
to shelf eligibility? For example, should we instead condition eligibility on
receipt of a certification from the trustee in offerings of the same asset class by
the depositor or its affiliates to the effect that all required opinions have been
obtained? Should we condition eligibility on a requirement that the trustee
provide notice if required third party opinions are not obtained, along with an
absence of a notice from the trustee to the effect that there was a failure to provide
required opinions?
•	 Should we provide more guidelines in this shelf eligibility condition regarding the
specifics of the provision that would be required to be included in the pooling and
servicing or other agreement? If so, what should be detailed?
•	 Should the proposed condition provide any further specification of the terms of
the third party opinion provision?
•	 Is it appropriate to require, as proposed, the third party to be non-affiliated with
the obligated party? Should we specify further any requirements relating to
providers of the third party opinion? Should we specify that the third party
opinion provider must be an independent expert, similar to what is required in
Section 314(d)(1)136 of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939?137

136

15 U.S.C. 77nnn(d)(1).

66 


•	 Should we specify who should provide the third party opinion or who should not
be permitted to provide the opinion? Should diligence firms that provide third
party pre-securitization review of a random sample of assets be allowed to
provide this opinion? Should we specify that it must be a legal opinion? Would
attorneys or law firms be willing to provide this opinion? Why or why not?
Would it be appropriate to allow a sponsor’s in-house counsel to provide the
opinion? If a law firm provides the opinion, should we prohibit the law firm that
assisted in the offering from providing such an opinion?
•	 Based on existing attestation standards of either the PCAOB or AICPA, we do not
believe that the proposed opinion could be provided by a public accountant.
Would a public accountant be able to provide the proposed opinion under existing
attestation standards? If so, which standard or standards should be applied, what
level of assurance should be provided and how should the third party opinion be
reported?
•	 Should we provide that the third party opinion must cover all of the
representations and warranties in the agreement related to the assets, as proposed?
Instead, are there certain representations and warranties that are the most
significant that the opinion should cover? Are there types of representations and
warranties that the third party opinion should not be required to opine on? For
example, are there certain representations and warranties that an attorney or a law
firm would not be able to opine on? If so, why?

137

15 USC 77aaa et. seq.

•	 Are there any other types of limitations that a third party opinion provider would
or should place on the required opinion? In general, what type of exam,
assessment or evaluation would a third party opinion provider need to make in
order to provide the required opinion?
•	 How costly or burdensome would it be for an issuer to be required to have a third
party provide an opinion to satisfy the proposed shelf eligibility condition?
Would this impose too much burden on ABS issuers? Are there ways to lessen
the cost?
•	 Should the third party opinion be required to be furnished annually rather than
quarterly, as proposed?
•	 Should we require that the third party opinion also be filed as an exhibit to an
Exchange Act report?
•	 We are aware of some insurance providers that have offered to insure in the
context of mergers and acquisitions any breach of the representations and
warranties in the transaction agreement. As an alternative to conditioning ABS
shelf eligibility on an undertaking in the transaction agreement that the issuer
furnish a third party opinion on assets not repurchased (or instead of the proposed
condition), should we allow the issuer to purchase insurance to insure a minimum
amount or percentage of the sponsor or originator’s obligations under the
transaction agreement? If so, what kind of disclosure should we require about the
insurance provider? How can we ensure that this alternative method of meeting
shelf eligibility adequately improves the incentive structure and therefore the
quality of the securities?

c)

Certification of the Depositor’s Chief Executive Officer

We also are proposing to establish a requirement that, as a condition to ABS shelf
eligibility to replace investment grade ratings criteria, the issuer provide a certification
signed by the chief executive officer of the depositor of the securitization regarding the
assets underlying the securities for each offering.138 The certification would require the
depositor’s chief executive officer to certify that to his or her knowledge, the assets have
characteristics that provide a reasonable basis to believe they will produce, taking into
account internal credit enhancements, cash flows at times and in amounts necessary to
service payments on the securities as described in the prospectus. This officer would also
certify that he or she has reviewed the prospectus and the necessary documents for this
certification.139
Because we would frame this ABS shelf eligibility condition as a certification
requirement instead of a disclosure requirement, we are using slightly different language
than a similar EU disclosure requirement in order to more precisely outline what the
officer is certifying to. We are proposing a certification rather than a disclosure
requirement because we preliminarily believe the potential focus on the transaction and
the disclosure that may result from an individual providing a certification should lead to

138

See proposed General Instruction I.B.1(c) to proposed Form SF-3.

139

This condition is similar to the current disclosure requirements for asset-backed issuers in the
European Union. Annex VIII, Disclosure Requirements for the Asset-Backed Securities Additional
Building Block, Section 2.1 (European Commission Regulation (EC) No. 809/2004 (April 29, 2004). The
EU requires asset-backed issuers to disclose in each prospectus that the securitized assets backing the issue
have characteristics that demonstrate capacity to produce funds to service any payments due and payable on
the securities. Similarly, under the North American Securities Administrator’s Association (NASAA)’s
guidelines for registration of asset-backed securities, sponsors are required to demonstrate that for
securities without an investment grade rating, based on eligibility criteria or specifically identified assets,
the eligible assets being pooled will generate sufficient cash flow to make all scheduled payments on the
asset-backed securities after taking certain allowed expenses into consideration. The guidelines are
available at www.nasaa.org.

enhanced quality of the securitization.140 We believe, as we did when we proposed the
certification for Exchange Act periodic reports, that a certification may cause these
officials to review more carefully the disclosure, and in this case, the transaction, and to
participate more extensively in the oversight of the transaction.141
We are proposing that the statements required in the certification would be made
based on the knowledge of the certifying officer. As signatories to the registration
statement, we would expect that chief executive officers of depositors would have
reviewed the necessary documents regarding the assets, transactions and disclosures.
Under current requirements, the registration statement for an ABS offering is required to
include a description of the material characteristics of the asset pool,142 as well as
information about the flow of funds for the transaction, including the payment
allocations, rights and distribution priorities among all classes of the issuing entity’s
securities, and within each class, with respect to cash flows, credit enhancement and any
other structural features in the transaction.143 The proposed certification would be an
explicit representation by the chief executive officer of the depositor of what is already

140

For instance, a depositor’s chief executive officer may conclude that in order to provide the
certification, he or she must analyze a structural review of the securitization. Rating agencies would also
conduct a structural review of the securitization when issuing a rating on the securities.

Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs (September 9, 2003) (noting that a consequence of “the
combination of the certification requirements and the requirement to establish and maintain disclosure
controls and procedures has been to focus appropriate increased senior executive attention on disclosure
responsibilities and has had a very significant impact to date in improving financial reporting and other
disclosure”).

implicit in this disclosure contained in the registration statement.144 This is similar to the
certifications of Exchange Act periodic reports required by Exchange Act Rules 13a-14
and 15d-14,145 which also refer to the disclosure. As with the certifications required by
these rules, the language of the proposed certification could not be altered. Instead, any
issues in providing the certification would need to be addressed through disclosure in the
prospectus.146 For instance, if the prospectus describes the risk of non-payment, or
probability of non-payment, or other risks that such cash flows will not be produced or
such payments will not be made, then those disclosures would be taken into consideration
in signing the certification.
The chief executive officer of the depositor is already responsible as signatory of
the registration statement for the issuer’s disclosure in the prospectus and can be liable
for material misstatements or omissions under the federal securities laws.147 An officer
providing a false certification potentially could be subject to Commission action for
violating Securities Act Section 17.148 The certification would be a statement of what is
known by the signatory at the time of the offering and would not serve as a guarantee of
payment of the securities.
Under our proposal, this certification would be an additional exhibit requirement
for the shelf registration statement that would not be applicable to the non-shelf
144

This approach is somewhat similar to the approach we took with Regulation AC, which requires
certifications from analysts. We noted there that Regulation AC makes explicit the representations that are
already implicit when an analyst publishes his or her views – that the analysis of a security published by the
analyst reflects the analyst’s honestly held views. Section II of Regulation Analyst Certification, Release
No. 33-8193 (Feb. 23, 2003) [68 FR 9482].

registration statement, Form SF-1, and that would be required to be filed by the time the
final prospectus is required to be filed under Rule 424.149 We believe that requiring the
chief executive officer of the depositor to sign the certification is consistent with other
signature requirements for asset-backed securities.150
Request for Comment
•	 Is our proposal to require certification appropriate as a condition to shelf 

eligibility? Would investors find the certification valuable? 

•	 Is the proposed language for the certification requirement appropriate? Should
we revise it in any way? Should we require that the officer certify that he has a
reasonable basis to believe that the assets will produce cash flows at times and in
amounts necessary to service payments on the securities as described in the
prospectus (rather than certify that the assets have characteristics that provide a
reasonable basis to believe that the assets will produce cash flows at times and
amounts necessary to service payments as described)?
•	 Should we identify the level of inquiry required by the executive officer? Should
we specify which documents (other than the prospectus) would need to be
reviewed for purposes of the certification, and, if so, which ones should we
specify?
•	 Under the proposal, the certifying officer could take into account internal credit
enhancements for purposes of evaluating whether the assets have characteristics
that provide a reasonable basis to believe they will produce cash flows at times
148

15 U.S.C. 77q(a). 


149

See proposed revision to Item 601(b) of Regulation S-K.


72

and in amounts necessary to service payments on the securities as described in the
prospectus. Should we also permit the certifying officer to also take into account
external credit enhancements that may be utilized in the securitization?151
•	 Are there concerns that it is not possible for any individual to be in a position to
certify that the assets in the pool have characteristics that provide a reasonable
basis to believe they will produce, taking into account internal credit
enhancements, cash flows at times and in amounts necessary to service payments
on the securities as described in the prospectus? If so, how can we address those
concerns or are there steps we should take to ensure that the level of uncertainty
in the structure and assets is clear to investors?
•	 Instead of, or in addition to, requiring a certification, should we require the
sponsor to disclose its estimates of default probability for all tranches in the
transaction, default probability of loans in the pool, and/or the expected recovery
rate on the loans conditional on default? Such estimates would be expected to be
consistent with assumptions used in sponsors’ internal modeling. Would this
disclosure potentially provide investors useful insights into the sponsor’s view of
the creditworthiness of pool assets and the securitization overall? Would it
convey information similar to that contained in credit ratings, which also have,
historically, reflected beliefs about default probabilities and expected recovery
rates? Do sponsors currently have internal models, or make internal assumptions

150

See, e.g., Item 601(b)(31)(ii) of Regulation S-K (exhibit requirement for ABS regarding
certification required by Exchange Act Rules 13a-14(d) and 15d-14(d)).
151

Examples of external credit enhancement may include third party insurance to reimburse losses on
the pool assets or the securities or an interest rate swap or similar swap transaction to provide incidental
changes to cash-flow and return.

73

for valuation purposes, that could be used to readily produce these numbers? If
so, should we require that disclosed estimates be consistent with those used in
sponsors’ internal models? Should we indicate whether or not such disclosures
constitute forward-looking statements?
•	 Should the chief executive officer of the depositor, as proposed, be required to
sign the certification, or should an individual in a different position be required to
certify? Which individual should be required to sign the certification? Should we
instead require that the certification be signed by the senior officer of the
depositor in charge of securitization, consistent with other signature requirements
for ABS? Given that the depositor is often a special purpose subsidiary of the
sponsor, would it be more appropriate to have an officer of the sponsor sign the
certification? If so, should it be the senior officer in charge of securitization or
some other officer of the sponsor?
•	 Is it appropriate to require the certification be filed as an exhibit to the registration
statement at the time of the final prospectus by means of a Form 8-K?
d)

Undertaking to File Ongoing Reports

Our last proposed new shelf eligibility criterion replacing the investment grade
ratings requirement is a requirement that the issuer provide an undertaking to file
Exchange Act reports with the Commission on an ongoing basis. Exchange Act Section
15(d) requires an issuer with an effective Securities Act registration statement to file
ongoing reports with the Commission. However, the statute also provides that for issuers
that do not also have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act the duty to
file ongoing reports is automatically suspended after the first year if the securities of each

74 


class to which the registration statement relates are held of record by less than three
hundred persons. As a result, typically the reporting obligations of all asset-backed
issuers,152 other than those with master trust structures,153 are suspended after they have
filed one annual report on Form 10-K because the number of record holders falls below,
often significantly below, the 300 record holder threshold.154
In the proposing release for Regulation AB, we requested comment on whether
the ability to suspend reporting under Section 15(d) should be revisited.155 One investor
group recommended conditioning ABS shelf registration upon an issuer agreeing either
to continue filing reports under Section 15(d) or to make publicly available on their Web
sites copies of reports that contain the information required by Form 10–D.156 While in
2004 we did not adopt rules that would create ongoing reporting obligations for assetbacked issuers, we did note that the concerns raised by investors confirm the importance

152

Under Rule 3b-19 under the Exchange Act [17 CFR 240.3b-19], an issuer is defined in relation to
asset-backed securities in the following way:
(a)
The depositor for the asset-backed securities acting solely in its capacity as
depositor to the issuing entity is the ‘‘issuer’’ for purposes of the asset backed securities
of that issuing entity.
(b)
The person acting in the capacity as the depositor specified in paragraph (a) is a
different ‘‘issuer’’ from that same person acting as a depositor for another issuing entity
or for purposes of that person’s own securities.
153

In a securitization using a master trust structure, the ABS transaction contemplates future
issuances of asset-backed securities backed by the same, but expanded, asset pool that consists of revolving
assets. Pre-existing securities also would therefore be backed by the same expanded asset pool.
154

One source noted that in a survey of 100 randomly selected asset-backed transactions, the number
of record holders provided in reports on Form 15 ranged from two to more than 70. The survey did not
consider beneficial owner numbers. See Committee on Capital Markets Regulation Financial Crisis
Report, at fn. 349.

to investors of post-issuance reporting of information regarding an ABS transaction in
understanding transaction performance and in making ongoing investment decisions.157
We are proposing to require as a condition to ABS shelf eligibility that the issuer
undertake to file with the Commission reports to provide disclosure as would be required
pursuant to Exchange Act Section 15(d) and the rules thereunder, if the issuer were
required to report under that section.158 The issuer’s reporting obligation under the
undertaking would extend as long as non-affiliates of the depositor hold any of the
issuer’s securities that were sold in registered transactions.159 We believe that ongoing
reporting of an asset-backed issuer would provide investors and the markets with
transparency regarding many aspects about the ongoing performance of the securities and
servicer in its compliance with servicing criteria, among other things. We believe this
transparency is important for investors and the market and that it is appropriate to
encourage ABS issuers to provide ongoing reports by conditioning shelf eligibility on an
undertaking to do so. Thus, we believe this requirement is a reasonable additional
condition to shelf eligibility. In conjunction with our proposal to require asset-level
information, it may prove even more useful to investors.160
157

See Section III.A.3.d of the 2004 ABS Adopting Release. We noted that modifying the reporting
obligation would raise broad issues about the treatment of other non-ABS issuers that do not have public
common equity. We believe our ABS shelf eligibility proposal is sufficiently distinguishable from the
treatment of non-ABS issuers.

158

See proposed Item 512(a)(7)(ii) of Regulation S-K.

159

We also are proposing to add a checkbox to the cover page of Forms 10-K, 10-D, and 8-K where
the issuer would be required to indicate whether the report is being filed pursuant to the proposed
undertaking.
160

See the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation Financial Crisis Report, at 151-152 (noting that
loan-level data is not useful if issuers can opt out of periodic reporting and recommending that the
Commission consider whether Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act should apply to the typical RMBS
issuance); Statement of Paul Schott Stevens President and CEO, ICI, for SEC Roundtable on Oversight of
Credit Rating Agencies, April 15, 2009, available at http://www.sec.gov/comments/4-579/4579-15.pdf
(recommending that the Commission require disclosure under Regulation AB be required to be made on an
ongoing basis in spite of Section 15(d)).

76 


In connection with this shelf eligibility condition, we are proposing to require
disclosure in the prospectus that is filed as part of the registration statement that the issuer
has undertaken and will file with the Commission the reports as would be required
pursuant to Exchange Act Section 15(d) and the rules thereunder if the issuer were
required to report under that section. Such disclosure would be subject to the same
liability as other disclosure in the prospectus.
Also, we are proposing to add a disclosure requirement to Item 1106 of
Regulation AB161 that would require disclosure in a prospectus of any failure in the last
year of an issuing entity established by the depositor or any affiliate of the depositor to
file, or file in a timely manner, an Exchange Act report that was required either by rule or
by virtue of an undertaking. We are proposing further changes to ABS shelf eligibility
requirements in connection with the proposed condition, as discussed in the following
section.
Request for Comment
•	 We request comment on our proposal to require ABS issuers who wish to conduct
delayed shelf offerings to undertake to file reports that would be required under
Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act for as long as non-affiliates of the depositor
hold any securities that were sold in registered transactions. Should we impose
such a requirement? Should ABS issuers who use shelf registration be permitted
to terminate their reporting obligations at an earlier period in time under shelf
eligibility conditions? If so, when?

161

17 CFR 229.1106.

77 


•	 Should we require, as proposed, the disclosure of any failure in the last year of an
issuing entity established by the depositor or any affiliate of the depositor to file,
or file in a timely manner, an Exchange Act report that was required either by rule
or by virtue of the proposed undertaking?
•	 We request comment on all of the four new proposed shelf eligibility conditions
in general. Are the proposed shelf eligibility conditions appropriate alternatives
to the existing investment grade ratings requirement? If one or more of these
proposed criteria are not adopted, should an investment grade rating continue to
determine whether or not an ABS issuer is eligible for shelf registration? Or
should we prohibit ABS issuers from using shelf registration altogether? What
would the impact be if ABS issuers were prohibited from utilizing shelf
registration? Do the proposed changes to the shelf registration procedures
described above, coupled with the proposed shelf eligibility conditions, mitigate
concerns about ABS issuers using shelf registration?
•	 Should our proposed shelf eligibility conditions (or some subset of them) be used
in addition to the existing investment grade ratings requirement rather than
replace it?
•	 What is the aggregate effect of the proposed revisions to shelf eligibility criteria
and the shelf registration process for ABS offerings? If these revisions are
adopted, would this make using non-shelf registration (Form SF-1) more
attractive to an ABS issuer? How would this change the costs and benefits
analysis for using shelf registration for ABS issuers? Would this change cause
shelf registration to be less attractive or become uneconomic?

78 


•	 If we continue to condition shelf eligibility, in part, on characteristics of the
securities that relate to quality, should we establish shelf eligibility based on
different criteria than the four proposed criteria? Should shelf eligibility be
conditioned on a limitation of the capital structure of ABS offerings? For
instance, should shelf offerings not be allowed to include leveraged tranches or
should we limit the number of tranches? If so, how many (e.g., five, six, or
seven)? Should we put restrictions on the size of each tranche? If so, how should
we do that? Should we limit ABS shelf eligibility to offerings backed by assets
that are seasoned for some period of time? If so, how much time for each asset
class (e.g., six months, one year, or two years)? Are there certain standardized
structures that we should use as a requirement for shelf offering?
e)

Other Proposed Form SF-3 Requirements

We are proposing other amendments to Rule 401 and the instructions in proposed
Form SF-3 relating to form eligibility. Currently, to be eligible to use Form S-3, the
existing form for ABS shelf registration, an issuer must meet the form’s registrant
requirements, which generally pertain for ABS issuers to reporting history under the
Exchange Act of the depositor and affiliates of the depositor with respect to the same
asset class, and at least one of the form’s transaction requirements. One of the current
ABS transaction requirements for use of Form S-3 is that the securities are investment
grade securities, and above we have described our proposals for four new transaction
requirements for use of Form SF-3 that would replace the investment grade ratings
requirement (i.e., risk retention, third party opinion review of repurchase demands,
certification, and the undertaking to file Exchange Act reports). We are proposing to add

79 


new registrant requirements that pertain to compliance with the four proposed transaction
requirements. These registrant requirements would be new shelf eligibility conditions to
registration on proposed Form SF-3, and would also serve as the new eligibility
conditions to be evaluated prior to conducting an offering off an effective Form SF-3
shelf registration statement.
i)

Registrant Requirements to be Met for Filing a Form SF-3

In order to be eligible to file a registration statement on proposed Form SF-3, we
are proposing that the registrant meet the following new requirements. First, we are
proposing to require that to the extent the sponsor or an affiliate of the sponsor of the
ABS transaction being registered was required to retain risk with respect to a previous
ABS offering involving the same asset class, then, at the time of filing the registration
statement, such sponsor or affiliate must be holding the required risk.
Second, we are proposing that to the extent the depositor or an issuing entity
previously established, directly or indirectly, by the depositor or any affiliate of the
depositor were at any time during the twelve calendar months and any portion of a month
immediately preceding the filing of the registration statement required to comply with the
other transaction requirements of Form SF-3 (“twelve-month look-back period”), with
respect to a previous offering of securities involving the same asset class, the following
requirements would apply:
•	 Such depositor and each such issuing entity must have timely filed all the
transaction agreements that contained the required provision relating to the
third party opinion review of repurchase demands;162
162

Under our proposal discussed in Section III.F below, we are proposing to revise Item 1100(f) to
require that exhibits be filed no later than the date of filing the final prospectus.

80 


•	 Such depositor and each such issuing entity must have timely filed all the
required certifications of the depositor’s chief executive officer; and
•	 Such depositor and each such issuing entity must have filed all the reports
that they had undertaken to file during the previous twelve months (or
such shorter period during which the depositor or issuing entity had
undertaken to file reports) as would be required under the Section 15(d) of
Exchange Act if they were subject to the reporting requirements of that
section.
Third, as proposed, there must be disclosure in the registration statement on Form
SF-3 stating that these proposed registrant requirements have been complied with.
These proposed new registrant requirements are, in many respects, consistent with
the existing Form S-3 registrant requirement relating to Exchange Act reporting.163 As
with the existing Form S-3 Exchange Act reporting registrant requirement, which we are
retaining for proposed Form SF-3, the proposed new registrant requirements would
require specified compliance with respect to previous offerings of the depositor or its
affiliates. The proposed twelve-month look-back period (except for the requirement
relating to risk retention) is also consistent with the existing Form S-3 Exchange Act
reporting registrant requirement. The proposed new registrant requirement relating to
risk retention requires an issuer to measure its risk retention as of the date of filing the

163

Under existing Form S-3, prior to filing a registration statement, to the extent the depositor or any
issuing entity previously established by the depositor or an affiliate of the depositor are or were at any time
during the twelve calendar months and any portion of a month immediately preceding the filing of the
Form S-3 required to file Exchange Act reports, with respect to a class of asset-backed securities involving
the same asset class, such depositor and each such issuing entity must have filed all material required to be
filed during the twelve months (or shorter period that the entity was required to have filed such materials).
Also, such material, other than certain specified reports on Form 8-K, must have been filed in a timely
manner. See General Instruction I.A.4 to Form S-3.

81 


registration statement, which we believe is a reasonable requirement. As described in
more detail below, we are not proposing to require the sponsor or an affiliate of the
sponsor to ensure that all risk was retained at all times during the previous twelve
calendar months, for purposes of shelf eligibility, out of a concern that it may be overly
burdensome.
ii)	

Evaluation of Form SF-3 Eligibility in Lieu of Section 10(a)(3)
Update

Form S-3 eligibility under the current rules is determined at the time of filing the
registration statement and at the time of updating that registration statement under
Securities Act Section 10(a)(3) 164 by filing audited financial statements. Because ABS
registration statements do not contain financial statements of the issuer, a periodic
determination of whether the issuer can continue to use the shelf would be specified by
rule.165 Such an evaluation would also provide a means for the Commission and its staff
to better oversee compliance with the proposed new Form SF-3 eligibility conditions that
would replace the existing investment grade ratings requirement. Therefore, in lieu of
Section 10(a)(3) updating, we are proposing to revise Rule 401 to require, as a condition
to conducting an offering off an effective shelf registration statement, an annual
evaluation of whether the Exchange Act reporting registrant requirements have been
satisfied. Under the proposal, an ABS issuer wishing to conduct a takedown off an
effective shelf registration statement must evaluate whether affiliated issuers that were
required to report under Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act during the previous

164

15 U.S.C. 77j(a)(3). 


165

See Securities Act Rule 401(b) [17 CFR 230.401(b)]. 


82 


twelve months, have filed such reports on a timely basis, as of ninety days after the end
of the depositor’s fiscal year end.166
iii)	

Quarterly Evaluation of Eligibility to Use Effective Form SF-3
for Takedowns

We also are proposing to require a quarterly evaluation of whether the ABS issuer
has satisfied the proposed new registrant requirements relating to risk retention, third
party opinions, the depositor’s chief executive officer certification, and the undertaking to
file ongoing reports. Under our proposal, an ABS issuer wishing to conduct a takedown
off an effective shelf registration statement must evaluate its compliance with the
proposed new registrant requirements as of the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter.
(A)

Risk
	 Retention

Accordingly, if the interest that a sponsor was required under the proposed risk
retention shelf eligibility condition to retain during the previous twelve months (or
shorter period as applicable), with respect to a previous offering of securities off a Form
SF-3 registration statement involving the same asset class, was sold off or hedged as of
the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter, the related shelf registration statement could
not be utilized for subsequent offerings until the fiscal quarter after the sponsor has re­
acquired the risk that was required to be retained (e.g., by removing the disqualifying
hedge or open market purchases of the securities) and such risk was on the sponsor’s
books as of the end of the fiscal quarter. We have provided for quarterly testing because
we are concerned that more frequent testing could be unnecessarily costly. By requiring
an evaluation of risk retention at the end of the quarter, we are not suggesting that a
166

Under this proposal, the related registration statement could not be utilized for subsequent
offerings for at least one year from the date the issuer that had failed to file Exchange Act reports then
became current in its Exchange Act reports (and the other requirements had been met).

83 


sponsor could permissibly sell or hedge the required risk. Such activities would be
inconsistent with the risk retention shelf eligibility condition, with the disclosure relating
to a sponsor’s interest in the transaction that we are proposing to require in the
registration statement, and would be subject to our proposed periodic reporting disclosure
requirements related to the sponsor’s interest described in Section III.C.3. below. At the
same time, we are concerned that there may be circumstances where a sponsor or its
affiliates undertake transactions that inadvertently hedge a required risk retention interest,
and discover this after a take-down off the shelf by an affiliated ABS issuer. We are not
proposing that this would necessarily cause the new offering to be deemed not to have
been registered on the appropriate form. However, we believe that it is important that our
requirements take into consideration a practicable testing schedule that promotes
compliance with the proposed shelf eligibility criteria without creating undue burdens or
uncertainty for issuers, and we are proposing requirements that would require at least
quarterly testing to achieve that goal. Similarly, with respect to our proposed registrant
requirement relating to risk retention, we are proposing that an issuer evaluate whether
the sponsor has retained required risk at the time of filing the registration statement.
(B)

Transaction Agreements and Officer Certification

An ABS issuer must also evaluate whether, during the previous twelve months,
the depositor or it affiliates had filed the transaction agreements required to contain the
third party opinion provision and the depositor’s chief executive officer certifications on
a timely basis as of the end of the quarter. If they had not, then the depositor could not
utilize the registration statement or file new registration statement on Form SF-3 until one
year after the required filings were filed.

84 


(C)

Undertaking to File Exchange Act Reports

Finally, under this proposal, an issuer must evaluate whether Exchange Act
reports, with respect to previous takedowns off an effective registration statement of the
depositor or affiliate of the depositor, where the issuer had undertaken to file such reports
during the prior twelve months had, in fact, been filed as of the last day of the most recent
fiscal quarter. In this way, the reports required under Section 13(a) or 15(d) must
continue to be timely for shelf eligibility but reports required pursuant to the undertaking
must be current as of the end of the quarter. As such, the ABS issuer would need to
confirm once a quarter that it continued to be eligible to use the effective registration
statement for takedowns.
Request for Comment
•	 Should we add, as proposed, registrant requirements that would require, as a
condition to form eligibility, affiliated issuers of the depositor that had offered
securities of the same asset class that were registered on Form SF-3 to have
complied with the risk retention, third party opinion, certification and ongoing
reporting shelf eligibility conditions that replace the investment grade ratings
requirement? Will these requirements lead to better compliance by ABS issuers
with the new shelf eligibility conditions that we are proposing?
•	 Should we require disclosure, as proposed, in the registration statement that the
registrant requirements have been complied with? Should we specify a location
in the registration statement for such disclosure?
•	 In our proposed registrant requirements for Form SF-3, we are proposing to
require that sponsors of affiliated issuers have retained the required risk at the

85 


time of filing the registration statement. Is that appropriate? Should we require
continued monitoring of risk retention compliance instead? Should we provide
the loss of shelf eligibility if the sponsor of a previously established affiliated
issuer has not retained at any time during the previous twelve months all of the
risk that it was required to retain during that time? Or would such a requirement
be overly burdensome?
•

Is it appropriate to require, as proposed, that the certifications and the transaction
agreement containing the required third party opinion provision that are required
to be filed pursuant to our proposed shelf eligibility conditions be filed on a
timely basis? Why or why not?

•

We are proposing to require an affiliated issuer that has undertaken to file
Exchange Act reports in the last twelve months to have filed such reports as
required pursuant to the Exchange Act rules. Is this an appropriate additional
registrant requirement for proposed Form SF-3? Should we also specify that such
reports must have been filed on a timely basis?

•

Should we revise Rule 401, as proposed, to require that as a condition to
continued use of an existing shelf registration statement for takedowns, an issuer
conduct a periodic evaluation of form eligibility? Why or why not? If not, how
should we address the concern that ABS issuers do not file amendments for
purposes of Section 10(a)(3)?

•

Should we require, as proposed, that an issuer test for sponsor’s compliance with
risk retention requirements as of the end of the fiscal quarter? Could there be
situations where a sponsor or its affiliates undertake transactions

86 


that inadvertently hedge a required risk retention interest? Alternatively, because
the testing for compliance would occur at predictable intervals, are there concerns
that the quarterly test for risk retention compliance could allow a sponsor to hold
less than the required risk in between testing intervals? Should our requirements
provide for testing that is made at different intervals (e.g., once a month, once a
distribution period, twice a quarter, at minimum number of random intervals)?
•	 Should we require that the evaluation of whether Exchange Act reports of
affiliated issuers have been filed on a timely basis be made as of the 90 days after
the depositor’s fiscal year, as proposed? Should the evaluation be made on a
different timeframe, such as the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter,
consistent with our other proposals here?
•	 Should we require, as proposed, that the evaluation of whether the registrant
requirements relating to risk retention, third party opinions, certification, and the
issuer’s undertaking to file ongoing reports be made as the last day of the most
recent fiscal quarter? Should that evaluation be made at different periods, such as
monthly or annually?
4.

Continuous Offerings

We also are proposing to amend Rule 415 to limit the registration of continuous
offerings for ABS offerings to “all or none” offerings. While we have not encountered
particular problems with respect to continuous ABS offerings to date (and we believe that
ABS offerings are not typically continuous), we believe that our proposal would help
ensure that ABS investors receive sufficient information relating to the pool assets, if an

87 


issuer registered an ABS offering to be conducted as a continuous offering. We believe
that this would close a potential gap in our regulations for ABS offerings.
In an all or none offering, the transaction is only completed if all of the securities
are sold. However, in a best-efforts or “mini-max” offering, a variable amount of
securities may be sold. In those latter cases, because the size of the offering would be
unknown, investors would not have the transaction-specific information and, in
particular, would not know the specific assets to be included in the transaction. Thus,
Item 1111, either in its existing form or as proposed to be amended, could not be
complied with.167 Under our proposal, the continuous offering must be commenced
promptly and must be made on the condition that all of the consideration paid for such
security will be promptly refunded to the purchaser unless (A) all of the securities being
offered are sold at a specified price within a specified time, and (B) the total amount due
to the seller is received by the seller by a specified date.168
Request for Comment
•	 Is our proposed amendment to Rule 415 relating to continuous offerings of ABS
appropriate?
•	 Should we restrict the duration of a continuous offering of ABS? If so, how long
should the offering be permitted to continue?
5.

Mortgage Related Securities

As noted above, mortgage related securities, as that term is defined in Section
3(a)(41) of the Exchange Act, currently are eligible for shelf registration regardless of
167

The staff has advised us that they believe that neither best efforts offerings nor any continuous
offerings have been utilized in the past for public offerings of asset-backed securities.
168

All or none offerings are described in Exchange Act Rule 10b-9 [17 CFR 240.10b-9] in the same

manner.

88 


form eligibility. This was a provision that was added to Rule 415 contemporaneous with
the enactment of SMMEA.169 As a result, an offering of mortgage related securities that
does not meet the requirements of Form S-3 can be registered on a delayed basis on Form
S-1.170
We believe that mortgage related securities should meet all the requirements we
are proposing for shelf eligibility in order to be eligible for registration on a delayed basis
since these securities present the same complexities and concerns as other asset-backed
securities. To achieve this goal and to better coordinate shelf registration for all types of
asset-backed securities, we are proposing to amend Rule 415 to eliminate the provision
for shelf eligibility for mortgage related securities regardless of the form that can be used
for registration of the securities.171 Under the proposal, offerings of mortgage related
securities will only be eligible for shelf registration on a delayed basis if, like other assetbacked securities, they meet the criteria for eligibility for shelf registration that we are
proposing today. Thus, as proposed, delayed shelf offerings of mortgage related
securities must be registered on new proposed Form SF-3, and accordingly, must meet
the eligibility requirements of Form SF-3.
Request for Comment
•	 We request comment on the proposed amendment for mortgage related securities.
Should we instead treat mortgage related securities differently from other asset­

169

See Section II.A. and fn. 61 above.

170

See fn. 61 of 2004 ABS Adopting Release.

171

As proposed, Rule 415(a)(1)(vii) would enumerate the provision that permits delayed offerings for
all asset-backed securities that are eligible to register on the proposed new Form SF-3. This provision
would include offerings of eligible mortgage related securities.

89 


backed securities by continuing to condition the ability to conduct a delayed
offering of mortgage related securities on their credit ratings by an NRSRO?
•	 We are proposing to require that delayed offerings of mortgage related securities
be registered on proposed Form SF-3, the same registration form for delayed
offerings of other asset-backed securities. Is there any reason to permit delayed
offerings of mortgage related securities on either proposed Form SF-1 or
proposed Form SF-3?
C.

Exchange Act Rule 15c2-8(b)

Except for securities issued under master trust structures, shelf-eligible ABS
issuers generally are not reporting issuers at the time of issuance. Under Exchange Act
Rule 15c2-8(b),172 with respect to an issue of securities where the issuer has not been
previously required to file reports pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange
Act, unless the issuer has been exempted from the requirement to file reports thereunder
pursuant to Section 12(h) of the Exchange Act, a broker or dealer is required to deliver a
copy of the preliminary prospectus to any person who is expected to receive a
confirmation of sale at least 48 hours prior to the sending of such confirmation (“48-hour
preliminary prospectus delivery requirement”). The rule contains an exception to the 48­
hour preliminary prospectus delivery requirement for offerings of asset-backed securities
eligible for registration on Form S-3. An exception to the 48-hour preliminary prospectus

172

17 CFR 240.15c2-8(b).

90 


delivery requirement was first provided in 1995 by staff no-action position.173 This staff
position was later codified in 2004.174
In light of recent economic events and to make this rule consistent with our other
proposed revisions, we are proposing to eliminate this exception so that a broker or dealer
would be required to deliver a preliminary prospectus at least 48 hours before sending a
confirmation of sale for all offerings of asset-backed securities, including those involving
master trusts. Because each pool of assets in an ABS offering is unique, we believe that
an ABS offering is akin to an initial public offering, and therefore we believe the 48-hour
preliminary prospectus delivery requirement in Rule 15c2-8(b) should apply. Even with
subsequent offerings of a master trust, the offerings are more similar to an initial public
offering given that the mix of assets changes and is different for each offering.
Moreover, requiring that a broker or dealer provide an investor with a preliminary
prospectus at least 48 hours before sending a confirmation of sale should be feasible and
made easier to implement as a result of our proposal that a form of preliminary
prospectus be filed with the Commission at least five business days in advance of the first
sale in a shelf offering. We, therefore, are proposing to amend Rule 15c2-8(b) by
repealing the exception for shelf-eligible asset-backed securities from the 48-hour
preliminary prospectus delivery requirement.175

173

See fn. 163 of the 2004 ABS Adopting Release and accompanying text (discussing staff no-action
letters providing relief to ABS issuers from Rule 15c2-8(b)).
174

In the 2004 ABS Adopting Release, we noted some concerns that investors did not have sufficient
time to consider ABS offering information. However, we determined to codify the staff position in light of
other proposals that we were considering at the time that sought to address information disparity in the
offering process.
175

Because of the other changes we are proposing, we are also proposing to repeal Rule 190(b)(7).
Rule 190(b)(7) provides that if securities in the underlying asset pool of asset-backed securities are being
registered, and the offering of the asset-backed securities and the underlying securities is not made on a
firm commitment basis, the issuing entity must distribute a preliminary prospectus for both the underlying

91 


Under the proposed amendment, a broker or dealer would be required to comply
with the 48-hour preliminary prospectus delivery requirement with respect to the sale of
securities by each ABS issuer, regardless of whether the issuer has previously been
required to file reports pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.176 In
addition, the 48-hour preliminary prospectus delivery requirement would also apply to
ABS issuers utilizing master trust structures that are exempt from the reporting
requirements pursuant to Section 12(h) of the Exchange Act. In a master trust
securitization, assets may be added to the pool in connection with future issuances of the
securities backed by the pool.177 Although ABS issuers utilizing master trust structures
may be reporting under the Exchange Act at the time of a “follow-on” or subsequent
offering of securities, additional assets are added to the entire pool backing the trust in
connection with a subsequent offering of securities. Additional assets are added to the
pool also in connection with a subsequent offering by an issuer utilizing a master trust
structure that is exempt from reporting under Section 12(h) or the rules thereunder.
Requiring a broker-dealer to deliver a preliminary prospectus at least 48 hours before
sending a confirmation of sale of ABS involving master trust structures issued by a

securities and the expected amount of the issuer’s securities that is to be included in the asset pool to any
person who is expected to receive a confirmation of sale of the asset-backed securities at least 48 hours
prior to sending such confirmation. Rule 190(b)(7) effectively overrules the exclusion in Rule 15c2-8 for
ABS issuers from the 48-hour preliminary prospectus delivery requirement for particular types of ABS
offerings. Because we are proposing to repeal the Rule 15c2-8 exclusion for ABS issuers, and because our
proposed disclosure requirements regarding the underlying securities for resecuritizations would require
significantly more information than what is required in Rule 190(b)(7) to be provided in the preliminary
prospectus, we are proposing to delete Rule 190(b)(7).
176

See definition of issuer in relation to asset-backed securities in Exchange Act Rule 3b-19.

177

The typical master trust securitization is backed by assets arising out of revolving accounts such as
credit card receivables or dealer floorplan financings.

92 


reporting ABS issuer could afford investors more time to consider information about the
assets that is not provided in Exchange Act reports.178
We are also proposing a correcting amendment to Rule 15c2-8(j). Paragraph (j)
states that the terms “preliminary prospectus” and “final prospectus” include terms that
are defined in a Rule 434. In 1995, at the same time we adopted Rule 434, we added
paragraph (j) to expand the use of the terms “preliminary prospectus” and “final
prospectus” to reflect the terminology used in Rule 434.179 Rule 434, however, was later
repealed in 2005.180 Accordingly, we are proposing to delete paragraph (j), which is no
longer applicable.
Request for Comment
•	 Should we adopt a 48-hour preliminary prospectus delivery requirement for all
ABS issuers, as proposed? Should we instead provide a different application of
the 48-hour preliminary prospectus delivery requirement for ABS issuers?
Should a broker or dealer be required to deliver a preliminary prospectus for an
ABS offering at a different time from initial public offerings, such as 48 hours
before the first sale in the offering (instead of 48 hours before confirmation)?
•	 Does our proposal to require filing of a preliminary prospectus pursuant to
proposed Rule 424(h) at least five business days before the first sale in the
offering make the proposed changes to Rule 15c2-8(b) unnecessary? Or is
delivery of the preliminary prospectus, as contemplated by Rule 15c2-8(b),

178

We note that many such issuers currently often provide preliminary prospectuses to investors for
each offering. Therefore, we do not believe our proposal would be overly burdensome on such issuers.

important? Would the proposed amendment to 15c2-8(b) provide a meaningful
change in the information and time that investors are given to consider offering
materials?181
•	 How should the prospectus delivery requirement apply to master trust structures?
Is our proposal appropriate with respect to master trusts? Should we instead
amend the rule to apply the 48-hour preliminary prospectus delivery requirement
to master trusts only if the pool assets have changed by a specified level? If so,
what should that level be (e.g., a change in five, ten, or 20% of pool assets, a
change in a specified percentage such as five, ten, or 20% of the dollar value of
the pool assets as measured by the principal balance, a significant change in the
pool assets)? Are there other ways of measuring change in pool assets? Should
this be determined by asset class, and if so, which asset classes should be subject
to what standards? For example, should a change in pool assets for purposes of
Rule 15c2-8 be measured differently for credit card ABS than for dealer floorplan
ABS?
•	 As proposed, there are no specific disclosure requirements applicable to the 48­
hour preliminary prospectus. Do we need to specify further how much asset or
other information should be contained in the 48-hour preliminary prospectus? Or

181

The 48-hour preliminary prospectus delivery requirement is triggered by when a broker-dealer
sends a confirmation of sale. Under Exchange Act Rule 10b-10 [17 CFR 240.10b-10], the Commission’s
confirmation rule, broker-dealers must send confirmations to their customers at or before completion of a
securities transaction. Given the industry practice of a lengthy time to complete an ABS transaction, a
customer may not receive a preliminary prospectus until well after he or she has made an investment
decision. See also Exchange Act Rule 15c1-1 [17 CFR 240.15c1-1] (defining “completion of the
transaction”).

94 


is that unnecessary in light of proposed Rule 430D and the proposed Rule 424(h)
filing requirements?
D. 	

Including Information in the Form of Prospectus in the Registration
Statement

1. 	

Presentation of Disclosure in Prospectuses

As currently permitted, asset-backed offerings registered on a shelf basis typically
present disclosure through the use of two primary documents: the “base” or “core”
prospectus and the prospectus supplement.182 The base prospectus filed prior to
effectiveness of the registration statement outlines the parameters of the various types of
ABS offerings that may be conducted in the future, including asset types that may be
securitized, the types of security structures that may be used and possible credit
enhancements or other forms of support. The registration statement at the time of
effectiveness also contains one or more forms of prospectus supplement, which outline
the format of transaction-specific information that will be disclosed at the time of each
takedown.183 At the time of a takedown, a final prospectus supplement is used which
describes the specific terms of the securities being offered.184 The base prospectus and
the final prospectus supplement together form the final prospectus which is filed with the

182

The Form S-3 requirements adopted in 2004 incorporated the existing practice of using a base and
supplement format. In Section III.A.3.b. of the 2004 ABS Adopting Release, we noted that we did not
intend to change existing practices of asset-backed issuers.
183

Rule 430B describes the type of information that primary shelf eligible issuers and automatic shelf
issuers may omit from a base prospectus in a Rule 415 offering and include instead in a prospectus
supplement, Exchange Act report incorporated by reference, or a post-effective amendment. Under Rule
430B a base prospectus in a shelf registration statement must comply with the applicable form
requirements, but can omit information that is unknown or not reasonably available to the registrant
pursuant to Rule 409. See Section V.B.1.b.i.(A) of the Offering Reform Release.
184

We note that currently stand alone trust issuers do not usually provide preliminary prospectuses to
investors.

95 


Commission pursuant to Securities Act Rule 424(b).185
This practice has also been utilized by non-ABS issuers. However, for typical
corporate issuers, their base prospectus is substantially shorter than in an ABS offering as
the bulk of the information is incorporated by reference into the prospectus from the
issuer’s Exchange Act reports.
In the 2004 ABS Adopting Release, we explained that when presenting disclosure
in base prospectuses and prospectus supplements, the base prospectus must describe the
types of offerings contemplated by the registration statement.186 We also noted that a
takedown off of a shelf that involves assets, structural features, credit enhancement or
other features that were not described as contemplated in the base prospectus will usually
require either a new registration statement (e.g., to include additional assets) or a posteffective amendment (e.g., to include new structural features or credit enhancement)
rather than simply describing them in the final prospectus filed with the Commission
pursuant to Securities Act Rule 424. However, we admonished registrants to exercise
discretion and describe only those material asset types and features reasonably
contemplated to be included in an actual takedown in order to make the information
easily accessible to investors.187
Today, we also remind issuers of the importance of providing disclosure in
compliance with our plain English rules. Under Securities Act Rule 421,188 information

185

See Section III.A.3.b of the 2004 ABS Adopting Release and Section V.B.1.b.i.(A) of the Offering
Reform Release.

in a prospectus must be presented in a clear, concise and understandable manner. The
note to Rule 421(b) states that issuers should avoid copying complex information directly
from legal documents without any clear and concise explanation of the provisions. The
rule also cautions against using boilerplate disclosure and repeating disclosure in
different sections of the document because it increases the size of the document and it
does not enhance the quality of information.189
Notwithstanding the discussion in the 2004 ABS Adopting Release and the
provisions of Rule 421, we are concerned that the base and supplement format has
resulted in unwieldy documents with excessive and inapplicable disclosure that is not
useful to investors. Many ABS prospectuses in this format often include boilerplate
disclosure and complex information that appears to be imported directly from forms of
transaction agreements. Some issuers file a base prospectus that contemplates multiple
asset types, security structures and possible types of enhancement and support that are
never actually utilized in a takedown. Moreover, the length of a disclosure document for
an ABS offering, as a result of the base and prospectus supplement format, is often
overwhelming and is burdensome for investors to navigate.
Another problem that has arisen under current practices is that in some instances,
issuers have filed with the Commission at the time of takedown only the prospectus
supplement and not the base prospectus that was included in the registration statement.
Since the base and the prospectus supplement together form the final prospectus, when an
ABS issuer excludes the base prospectus from the EDGAR filing at the time of
takedown, an investor needs to locate the base prospectus filed with the initial effective

189

See 17 CFR 230.421(b).

97 


registration statement on Form S-3 on EDGAR. Given that a shelf registration statement
is available for three years,190 it can be unclear what information from the base
prospectus is applicable to the current offering or is superseded by the supplement.
The current format has the unintended effect of encouraging a drafting approach
that builds in the largest possible flexibility for as many differing transactions as possible,
although with the negative effect that an investor bears the burden of determining which
disclosures are relevant to a particular transaction. The current rule benefits issuers but
may not be as useful for investors, when the registration statement is primarily for the
benefit of investors. We believe we should facilitate investor understanding and access to
prospectuses for ABS and eliminate unnecessary disclosures given to investors. Investors
must be able to readily access and understand the information for a specific offering.
Consequently, we are proposing to eliminate the practice of providing a base prospectus
and a prospectus supplement for ABS issuers. To accomplish this, we are proposing to
add a provision in new Rule 430D and an instruction to proposed Form SF-3 that would
require ABS issuers to file a form of prospectus at the time of effectiveness of the
proposed Form SF-3 and to file a single prospectus for each takedown, which would
require that all of the information required by Regulation AB be included in the
prospectus.191 We believe our proposal will help issuers comply with our plain English
requirements, help reduce the size of the offering documents, and eliminate the need to
190

See Securities Act Rule 415 (a)(5).

191

Disclosure may still be incorporated by reference as allowed by proposed Rule 430D and the
applicable Form requirements. Proposed Rule 430D(c) would provide that information omitted from a
form of prospectus that is part of an effective registration statement in reliance on Rule 430D(a) that is
subsequently included in the prospectus that is part of a registration statement must contain all of the
information that is required to be included in the prospectus pursuant to the requirements of the registration
statement with respect to the offering. Under this proposed requirement, an ABS issuer would not be
permitted to include information on the offering in a prospectus base and supplement format. We discuss
this proposal in more depth in Section II.B.1.b.

98 


review inapplicable disclosure.
Other than the proposed limitation of one depositor and asset class per registration
statement discussed below, we believe requiring only one form of prospectus with the
registration statement would not limit the flexibility of the issuer to vary its structural
features from takedown to takedown. As is the case today, assets, structuring and other
features may be presented in brackets in the form of prospectus filed with the registration
statement. Under the proposal, issuers could include the same bracketed information in
the form of prospectus filed with the registration statement. At the time of the offering,
only the disclosure applicable to the transaction at hand would be included in the
prospectus provided to investors and filed with the Commission.
Currently, some sponsors create a separate depositor for each of its various loan
programs, and each depositor files its own shelf registration statement. Other issuers
have included multiple depositors,192 multiple base prospectuses and multiple prospectus
supplements all in one registration statement.193 Under our proposal, each depositor
would be required to file a separate registration statement for each form of prospectus.
Each registration statement would cover offerings by one depositor securitizing only one
asset class.194

Although this would change current practice for asset-backed issuers, we

192

With respect to registration statements with multiple depositors, each depositor is an issuer of each
takedown of securities off of a shelf. See Securities Act Rule 191 [17 CFR 230.191].
193

Also, the current instructions to Form S-3 state that a registration statement may not merely
identify several alternative types of assets that may be securitized. Under current requirements, a separate
base prospectus and form of prospectus supplement must be presented for each asset class that may be
securitized in a discrete pool in a takedown under that registration statement. See General Instruction
V.A.2 of Form S-3 and Section III.A.3.b. of the 2004 ABS Adopting Release.
194

For instance, resecuritization transactions of mortgage-backed securities would be considered a
separate asset class from mortgage-backed securities and, thus, require a separate registration statement,
even if the depositor would be the same. As we currently require for offerings registered on Form S-3, a
separate registration statement would be required for takedowns involving pools of foreign assets where the
assets originate in separate countries or the property securing the pool assets is located in separate
countries. In cases where an underlying security such as a special unit of beneficial interest (SUBI) or

believe such a change would make disclosure for investors much more accessible and
useful. 

Request for Comment

•	 Is the proposed change to presentation of disclosure in the prospectus
appropriate? Would investors benefit from the proposed change? Would it be
unduly burdensome for issuers to prepare the disclosure in a single document? If
so, how can we better mandate clear and concise documents so that investors are
able and encouraged to analyze the investment?
•	 Is our proposal to require a depositor to file a separate registration statement for
each form of prospectus appropriate?
•	 Are there any particular asset classes that should retain the base and form of
prospectus supplement format? If so, why?
•	 Should issuers be able to file more than one form of prospectus with a registration
statement? If so, why? If issuers were permitted to do so, what other steps could
be taken to help market participants understand the transaction?
•	 Are there other changes we should make to the format and form of the prospectus
to assist investors in analyzing the potential investment?
2.

Adding New Structural Features or Credit Enhancements

We are also proposing to restrict the ability of ABS issuers to file a prospectus
under Rule 424(b) for the purpose of adding certain types of information to the form of
prospectus. Under the existing Rule 430B, ABS issuers and other issuers are permitted to

collateral certificate is also registered, the depositor of the underlying SUBI or collateral certificate would
also be included in the same registration statement. Collateral certificates and SUBIs are discussed further
in Section VII.A. below.

provide the information omitted from the prospectus that is part of a registration
statement at the time of the offering as a prospectus supplement, a post-effective
amendment, or where permitted as described below, through its Exchange Act filings that
are incorporated by reference into the registration statement and prospectus that is part of
the registration statement and identified in a prospectus supplement.195 In the 2004 ABS
Adopting Release, we stated our longstanding position that the type or category of asset
to be securitized must be fully described in the registration statement at the time of
effectiveness.196 We further explained the structural features contemplated also should be
disclosed, as well as identification of the types or categories of securities that may be
offered, such as interest-weighted or principal-weighted classes (including IO or PO
securities), planned amortization or companion classes or residual or subordinated
interests.197 We stated that a takedown off of a shelf that involves assets, structural
features, credit enhancements or other features that were not described as contemplated in
the base prospectus will usually require either a new registration statement (e.g., to
include additional assets) or a post-effective amendment (e.g., to include new structural
features or credit enhancement) rather than simply describing them in the final prospectus
filed with the Commission pursuant to Securities Act Rule 424.198 Although, with
Offering Reform, we adopted Rule 430B,199 which provides all issuers on Form S-3 with
the alternative to include information previously omitted in a prospectus filed pursuant to
424(b) or by incorporating periodic and current Exchange Act reports and the staff has

continued to apply our position articulated in the 2004 ABS Adopting Release. We
confirm that position by proposing to codify our statement regarding when a posteffective amendment would be required in Rule 430D.200
We are proposing to require that when the issuer desires to add information that
relates to new structural features or credit enhancement, the issuer must file that
information by post-effective amendment. As a result of this proposal, the staff would
have the opportunity to review new structural features or credit enhancements that would
be contemplated for future offerings. With respect to new assets, we believe that if the
issuer intends to offer securities that are backed by assets that are not contemplated in the
form of prospectus that is filed as part of the registration statement, a new registration
statement should be filed.201
Request for Comment
•	 Is our proposal to require issuers to file a post-effective amendment to reflect new
structural features or credit enhancements and provide a related undertaking
appropriate?
E.

Pay-as-You-Go Registration Fees

In 2005, we first adopted pay-as-you-go rules202 to allow well-known seasoned
issuers using automatic shelf registration statements to pay filing fees at the time of a
securities offering.203 To alleviate some of the burden of managing multiple registration

200

See proposed Securities Act Rule 430D(d)(2).

201

If the asset pool includes securities, registration would be required under Securities Act Rule 190.

202

See Securities Act Rules 456(b) [17 CFR 230.456(b)] and 457(r) [17 CFR 230.457(r)].

203

See Section V.B.2.b.(D) of the Offering Reform Release. Under the current pay-as-you-go
procedure for WKSIs, an issuer can pay any filing fee, in whole or in part, in advance of takedown or at the
time of takedown providing flexibility in the timing of the fee payment. Issuers using pay-as-you-go can
still deposit monies in an account for payment of filing fees when due. The fee rules applicable to the use

102 


statements among ABS issuers, we are proposing to allow, but not require, asset-backed
issuers eligible to use Form SF-3 to pay filing fees as securities are offered off of a shelf
registration statement. If this approach, commonly known as “pay-as-you-go,” is adopted
for ABS issuers, no filing fees would need to be paid at the time of filing a registration
statement on Form SF-3. A dollar amount or a specific number of securities would not
be required to be included in the calculation of the registration fee table in the registration
statement, unless a fee based on an amount of securities is paid at the time of filing.204
However, under our proposal the fee table on the cover of the registration statement must
list the securities or class of securities registered and must indicate if the filing fee will be
paid on a pay-as-you-go basis.205
Under our proposal, the triggering event for a fee payment would be the filing of a
preliminary prospectus under proposed Rule 424(h).206 At the time of filing a Rule

of such account, also referred to as the “lockbox account,” apply. The amount of the fee is calculated based
on the fee schedule in effect when the money is withdrawn from the lockbox account. This flexibility had
been provided so issuers may determine the fee payment approach most appropriate for them. See fn. 529
of the Offering Reform Release.
204

See proposed Securities Act Rule 457(s).

205

In the case of ABS, the fee table on the registration statement would typically list the offering of
certificates and notes as separate classes of securities. Each class (or tranche) of those certificates and
notes offered would not need to be separately listed on the fee table. However, if the ABS is a
resecuritization, where registration of the underlying securities would be required under Rule 190 and the
underlying security was not listed on the fee table of the Form SF-3 registration statement, the offering
would require a new registration statement. Likewise, if a servicer or trustee invests cash collections in
other instruments which may be securities under the Securities Act, such as guarantees or debt instruments
of an affiliate, under Rule 190 those underlying securities would also need to be registered concurrently
with the asset-backed offering. If those underlying securities were not listed on the fee table of the
registration statement, a new registration statement would be required.
206

See proposed Securities Act Rule 456(c). Unlike the pay-as-you-go rules for WKSIs, we do not
believe that a cure period is necessary for ABS issuers because we are proposing to require ABS issuers to
pay the required fee at the time the preliminary prospectus is filed under Rule 424(h). The timing of the fee
payment for ABS would not give rise to the same effective date and registration concerns that arise with
WKSIs. Section V.B.2.b.(D) of the Offering Reform Release.

fee table on the cover page of the prospectus and would be required to pay the
appropriate fee calculated in accordance with Securities Act Rule 457.208
Request for Comment
•	 Is our proposal for a pay-as-you go fee alternative for ABS issuers appropriate?
Should ABS issuers be able to register offerings of an unspecified amount of
securities on Form SF-3?
•	 Would this help with the management of multiple shelves for asset-backed
issuers? Are there other steps we could take to help sponsors and depositors
manage shelves for ABS?
•	 Should we revise Rule 457(p), as proposed, to clarify that if an ABS offering is
not completed after the fee is paid, the fee could be applied to future registration
statements by the same depositor or affiliates of the depositor across asset classes?
F.

Signature Pages

We also are proposing to revise the signature pages for registration statements of
asset-backed issuers. Securities Act Section 6209 requires that the registration statement
be signed by the issuer, its principal executive officer or officers, its principal financial
officer, its comptroller or principal accounting officer, and the majority of its board of
207

If an issuer is filing a Rule 424(h) filing solely in order to update the fee table and pay additional
fees, the 424(h) filing would not trigger a new five business day waiting period.
208

The amount of the filing fee is calculated based on the fee schedule in effect at the time of
payment (upon filing in advance, or at the time of an offering) in accordance with the provisions of Rule
457. Thus the fee amount may be different depending on the time of payment. Also, as provided in Rule
457(p), if all or a portion of the securities offered under a registration statement remain unsold after the
offering's completion or termination, or withdrawal of the registration statement, the aggregate total dollar
amount of the filing fee associated with those unsold securities may be offset against the total filing fee due
for a subsequent registration statement. Currently, if an ABS offering is not completed after the fee is paid,
the fee could be applied to future registration statements by the same depositor or affiliates of the depositor.

104 


directors or persons performing similar functions. In 2004, we clarified that the depositor
is the issuer for purposes of ABS.210 We codified in the general instructions to Forms S-1
and S-3 that the registration statement must be signed by the depositor, the depositor’s
principal executive officer or officers, principal financial officer and controller or
principal accounting officer, and by at least a majority of the depositor’s board of
directors or persons performing similar functions.211
Asset-backed issuers are not required to file financial statements of the issuer
under our rules or pursuant to their governing documents, and these issuers do not
employ a principal accounting officer or controller. Thus, because such signatures appear
to serve no purpose, we are proposing to exempt asset-backed issuers from the
requirement that the depositor’s principal accounting officer or controller sign the
registration statement.
The Form 10-K report for ABS issuers must be signed either on behalf of the
depositor by the senior officer in charge of securitization of the depositor, or on behalf of
the issuing entity by the senior officer in charge of the servicing. In addition, the
certifications for ABS issuers that are required under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act212 must be signed either on behalf of the depositor by the senior officer in charge of
securitization of the depositor if the depositor is signing the Form 10–K report, or on
behalf of the issuing entity by the senior officer in charge of the servicing function of the
209

15 U.S.C. 77f(a).

210

Securities Act Rule 191 and Exchange Act Rule 3b-19 state that the depositor for the asset-backed
securities acting solely in its capacity as depositor to the issuing entity is the ‘‘issuer’’ for purposes of the
asset-backed securities of that issuing entity. These rules also provide that the person acting in the capacity
as such depositor is a different ‘‘issuer’’ from that same person acting as a depositor for another issuing
entity or for purposes of that person’s own securities.
211

See General Instruction VI.C of Form S-1 and General Instruction V.B. of Form S-3.

servicer if the servicer is signing the Form 10-K report. We are now proposing to require
that the senior officer in charge of securitization of the depositor sign the registration
statement (either on Form SF-1 or Form SF-3) for ABS issuers. We believe that
requiring such individual to sign the registration statement is more meaningful in the
context of ABS offerings because it is more consistent with our other signature
requirements for ABS issuers.
Request for Comment
•	 Is our proposed amendment to the registration statement signature
requirements appropriate? Is there any reason we should not exempt, as we
are proposing to do, ABS issuers from the requirement that the depositor’s
principal accounting officer or comptroller sign the registration statement?
•	 Is our proposal to require the senior officer in charge of securitization of the
depositor to sign the registration statement for ABS issuers appropriate?
III.

Disclosure Requirements
In addition to reformatting how prospectuses are presented in ABS offerings, we

are proposing several changes to the disclosure requirements in Regulation AB for assetbacked securities. Three of our proposals involve significant changes from our current
requirements. First, subject to certain exceptions, we are proposing to require asset-level
information regarding each asset in the pool backing the securities. Second, we are
proposing that issuers of ABS backed by credit card pools provide standardized grouped
account data regarding the underlying asset pool. Third, we are proposing to require that
most issuers provide the flow of funds, or waterfall, in a waterfall computer program. In

212

15 U.S.C. 7241.

106

addition, we are proposing changes that refine other disclosure requirements, including
those relating to pool-level disclosure, the prospectus summary, transaction parties, and
static pool information.
A.

Pool Assets

We are proposing to increase the required disclosure regarding the assets
underlying the ABS. We are proposing that in most ABS offerings asset-level data be
required in the prospectus at the time of offering and in Exchange Act reports. For credit
card ABS issuers, we are proposing that issuers provide grouped account data. In order
to facilitate investors’ use of asset data files, we are proposing that the data be filed on
EDGAR in Extensible Mark-Up Language (XML). We also are proposing revisions to
our pool-level disclosure requirements designed to enhance the information available to
analyze the pool.
While Regulation AB does not restrict the type or quality of assets that may be
included in the asset pool, our rules under the Securities Act are designed to assure that a
prospectus contains disclosure regarding the assets that facilitates informed investment
decisions.213 We believe access to robust information concerning the pool assets is
important to investors’ ability to make informed investment decisions about asset-backed
securities.214 We also believe disclosure about the pool should be as multi-faceted as
necessary to provide a full picture of the composition and characteristics of the pool

213

Item 1111 of Regulation AB contains our disclosure requirements regarding the pool assets. Item
1111 requires disclosure of the material aspects of the composition of the asset pool, sources of pool cash
flow, changes to the asset pool, and rights and claims regarding the pool assets. See Section III.B.5. of the
2004 ABS Adopting Release.
214

assets. In addition, it is critical that the pool asset information be presented in a
comprehensible and clear fashion.215
1.

Asset-Level Information in Prospectus

To augment our current principles-based pool-level disclosure requirements, we
are proposing a new requirement to disclose asset-level information. Investors, market
participants, policy makers and others have increasingly noted that asset-level
information is essential to evaluating an asset-backed security.216 Some have said that
there is a need and investor appetite for increased asset-level disclosures.217 We have
heard that understanding a borrower’s ability to repay may be more important than the
features of the underlying loan, or even the collateral, on an asset-level basis.218 Others
have stated that having access only to pool data (and not asset-level data) has made it
difficult to discern whether the riskiest loans were to the most creditworthy borrowers or
to the least creditworthy borrowers in the asset pool.219
The public availability of asset-level information has been limited. In the past,
some transaction agreements for securitizations required issuers to provide investors with

standard, granular, loan-level data be provided sufficient to allow investors to complete their own credit

to compare performance of various deals, issuers, and underlying collateral).

asset-level information, or information on each asset in the pool backing the securities.220
Such loan schedules provided to an investor are sometimes filed as part of the pooling
and servicing agreement or as a free writing prospectus. We believe that all investors and
market participants should have access to the information necessary to assess the credit
quality of the assets underlying a securitization transaction at inception and over the life
of the transaction.221
For most investors, the usefulness of asset-level data is generally limited unless
the individual data points are standardized. Standardizing the information facilitates the
ability to compare and analyze the underlying asset-level data of a particular asset pool as
well as compare them with other pools. 222 Standardized and easily accessible data points
also may facilitate stronger independent evaluations of ABS by market participants.
Prior to today, the Commission had not proposed to require asset-level data or
proposed standards for such information. We are aware that some standards have already
been developed for registered and unregistered offerings of commercial mortgage-backed

220

This usually includes information such as the principal balance at the time of origination, the date
of origination, the original interest rate, the type of loan (e.g., fixed, ARM, hybrid), the borrower’s debt to
income ratio, the documentation level for origination of the loan, and the loan-to-value ratio.
221

Others have noted the importance of loan-level data to investors. See U.S. Department of
Treasury, A New Foundation: Rebuilding Financial Supervision and Regulation, June 17, 2009; (noting in
particular, that issuers of ABS should be required to disclose loan-level data); Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, Supervisory Insights: Enhancing Transparency in the Structured Finance Market, available at
http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/examinations/supervisory/insights/sisum08/article01_transparency.html
(stating that a lack of complete and public dissemination of a securitization’s loan-level data reduces
transparency and hampers the investor’s ability to fully assess risk and assign value).
222

See Statement of Former Federal Reserve Governor Randall S. Kroszner at the Federal Reserve
System Conference on Housing and Mortgage Markets, Washington, D.C., Dec. 4, 2008 (stating that a
necessary condition for the potential of private-label MBS to be realized going forward is for
comprehensive and standardized loan-level data covering the entire pool of loans backing MBS be made
available and easily accessible so that the underlying credit quality can be rigorously analyzed by market
participants).

securities and residential mortgage-backed securities.223 The CRE Finance Council
(formerly Commercial Mortgage Securities Association)’s224 Investor Reporting Package
includes data fields on loan, property and bond-level information for commercial
mortgage-backed securities at issuance and while the securities are outstanding.225 The
American Securitization Forum (ASF)226 recently published disclosure and reporting
packages for residential mortgage-backed securities that included standardized definitions
for loan or asset-level information.227 The package is part of the group’s Project on
Residential Securitization Transparency and Reporting (“Project RESTART”). The ASF
has proposed implementation dates involving new issuance loans under the Disclosure
Package of February 1, 2010.228 Other organizations, such as Mortgage Electronic
Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS),229 have developed reporting packages to capture and
report data at different times during the life of the underlying residential or commercial
loan. Sellers of mortgage loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac230 are required to deliver

223

The collection of standardized disclosure given to investors is generally called a reporting

package.

organization for the commercial real estate finance industry.

230

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are government sponsored enterprises (GSE’s) that purchase
mortgage loans and issue or guarantee mortgage-backed securities (MBS). MBS issued or guaranteed by
these GSEs have been and continue to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act and reporting
under the Securities Exchange Act. As a result, only non-GSE ABS, or so called “private label” ABS, will
be required to comply with the new rules. For more information regarding the GSEs, see Task Force on

110 


loan-level data in a standardized electronic form.231 Other federal agencies, such as the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Office of Thrift Supervision
(OTS) also collect certain loan-level data on mortgages. The OCC and the OTS gather
mortgage performance data from national banks and thrifts.232 We are unaware of any
publicly available data standards for other asset classes and currently there is no
mandatory requirement that issuers follow any of these standards for reporting to
investors in asset-backed securities.
Because we believe that issuers should provide transparent and comparable data,
we are proposing to require asset-level information in a standardized format to be
included in the prospectus and periodic reports and filed on EDGAR. Our proposal
specifies and defines each item that must be disclosed for each asset in the pool. In our
discussion below, we refer to each individual item requirement as an asset-level data
point. Some of the asset-level data points that we are proposing are indicator fields.
Indicator fields will require an answer of “yes” or “no,” and are designed to facilitate
investor review of the data.233 We are also proposing an instruction to Schedule L that

9.htm. (attaching Web site link to the data dictionary).
233

For example, we are proposing an asset-level data point to disclose whether the asset has been
modified. The response would be either yes or no. If the answer is no, a preparer or user of the data would
then know that asset-level data points related to modifications would not be applicable to that particular
asset.

111 


will contain definitions for some of the terms that we use throughout the schedule.
Because we believe that asset-level data should be provided to investors and all market
participants in a form that facilitates data analysis, we are also proposing to require that
asset-level data be filed on EDGAR in XML format. These proposals would be in
addition to the disclosure currently required about the composition and characteristics of
the pool of assets taken as a whole. We believe the pool-level disclosure currently
required by Regulation AB is still important to investment decisions and can facilitate an
investor’s understanding of the overall investment opportunity.
Request for Comment
•	 Is our proposal to require asset-level disclosure with data points identified in
our rules appropriate?
•	 Is a different approach to asset-level disclosure preferable, such as requiring it
generally, but relying on industry to set standards or requirements? If so, how
would data be disclosed for all the asset classes for which no industry standard
exists or for which multiple standards may exist? To the extent multiple
standards exist, how would investors be able to compare pools? Please be
detailed in your response.
•	 We note that there are several different standards under which asset-level data
is already required. Would our requirements impose undue burdens on ABS
issuers?
•	 Should we instead amend our current requirements regarding pool-level
disclosure by requiring issuers to present certain pool-level tables in a
standardized manner? For instance, should we specify how statistical data

112 


should be presented by defining the groups or incremental ranges that must be
presented? What would those appropriate groups or incremental ranges be for
an individual table? For instance, what would be the appropriate range for
obligor income and why? Please be specific in your response.
•	 Are the definitions of terms in the proposed instruction to Schedule L
appropriate? Are there any other terms that should be included in the
instruction?
a)

When Asset-Level Data Would be Required in the Prospectus

Today we are proposing new Item 1111(h) and Schedule L of Regulation AB
which enumerate all of the data points that must be provided for each asset in the asset
pool at the time of the offering. Schedule L data would be an integral part of the
prospectus, and in order to facilitate investor analysis prior to the time of sale, we are
proposing to require issuers to provide Schedule L data as of a recent practicable date that
we define as the “measurement date” at the time of a Rule 424(h) prospectus. So that
investors receive a data file with final pool information at the time of the offering, we
also are proposing that an updated Schedule L, as of the cut-off date for the
securitization, be provided with the final prospectus under Rule 424(b).234 Likewise, if
issuers are required to report changes to the pool under Item 6.05 of Form 8-K, updated
Schedule L data would be required.235 As we discuss in Section III.A.3, we are
proposing a new Item 6.06 to Form 8-K for issuers to file the XML data file.
234

The cut-off date would be the date specified in the instruments governing the transaction (i.e., the
date on and after which collections on the pool assets accrue for the benefit of the asset-backed security
holders).
235

If a new asset is added to the pool during the reporting period, an issuer would be required to
provide the asset-level information for each additional asset as required by our proposed revisions to Item
1111 and Item 6.05 on Form 8-K.

Request for Comment
•	 Is the proposed requirement to provide Schedule L data with the proposed
Rule 424(h) prospectus, the final prospectus under 424(b) and for changes
under Item 6.05 of Form 8-K appropriate? Should Schedule L data be
required at any other time? If so, please tell us when and why.
•	 Are the proposed measurement dates appropriate? Are there any data fields
that would be inappropriate or too burdensome to supply as of two different
measurement dates (i.e., the measurement date and the cut-off date)? If so,
please specify the data field and provide a detailed explanation.
•	 Should we provide further guidance about what would be a recent practicable
date for purposes of determining the measurement date?
b)

Proposed Disclosure Requirements and Exemptions

We are proposing that issuers of ABS of most asset classes must provide the
standardized data points enumerated in Schedule L. The proposed standardized data
points would serve to indicate the payment stream related to a particular asset, such as the
terms, expected payment amounts, indices and whether and how payment terms change
over time. Such data points would be important in order to analyze the future payments
on the asset-backed securities. To perform better prepayment analysis or credit analysis,
we are proposing data points that indicate the quality of the obligor or the asset
origination process. For instance, in the case of residential mortgages, data points we are
proposing to require, among others, are credit score of the obligors, employment status,
income, and how that information was verified. To perform analysis of the collateral
related to the asset in the pool, we are proposing data points related to each property. For

114 


instance, in the case of loans or leases secured by automobiles, issuers would need to
provide data points related to the type and model of car and the value of the car.
Except with respect to certain asset classes (as described below), we are
proposing that every issuer must provide the data points listed under Item 1. General
described below. We are proposing to subdivide Schedule L based on the asset class.
We believe the general data points are consistent with the principles-based definition of
an asset-backed security and apply to almost every asset class underlying a transaction
that has been registered in the past, and should also apply to any new asset classes that
may be included in a registered offering in the future. We also propose asset class
specific data point requirements for eleven specific asset classes: residential mortgages,
commercial mortgages, auto loans, auto leases, equipment loans, equipment leases,
student loans, floorplan financings, corporate debt and resecuritizations. We are
proposing item requirements for these asset classes because, based on our experience
with registered offerings for these types of asset classes, we believe these data points are
among those that represent the more useful information for investors.
i)

Proposed Coded Responses

Consistent with our efforts to standardize asset-level disclosure, we are proposing
that issuers provide responses to the asset-level disclosure requirements as a date, a
number, text or a coded response. The required coded responses will be contained in the
EDGAR Technical Specifications. Attached at the end of this release we provide an
appendix which contains a table for the proposed general item requirements as well as
asset class specific item requirements. Each table lists the proposed item number, the
title of the proposed data field, the proposed definition, the proposed response type and

115 


codes, if applicable, and proposed category of information. The proposed category of
information designates the type of information we are proposing so that users will know
when the data point is applicable.
We are sensitive to the possibility that certain asset-level disclosure may raise
concerns about the personal privacy of the underlying obligors. In particular, we are
aware that data points requiring disclosure about the geographic location of the obligor or
the collateralized property, credit scores, income and debt may raise privacy concerns.
As we stated in the 2004 ABS Adopting Release, issuers and underwriters should be
mindful of any privacy, consumer protection or other regulatory requirements when
providing loan-level information, especially given that in most cases, the information
would be publicly filed on EDGAR.236 However, as we noted above, information about
credit scores, employment status and income would permit investors to perform better
credit analysis of the underlying assets. In light of privacy concerns, instead of requiring
issuers to disclose a specific location, credit score, or exact income and debt amounts, we
are proposing ranges, or categories of coded responses.
For instance, to designate geographic location of an obligor who is a person,
instead of requiring, city, state or zip code of the property, we are proposing that issuers
provide the broader geographic delineations of Metropolitan or Micropolitan Statistical
Areas. 237 Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas are geographic areas,
designated by a five-digit number, defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) for use by Federal statistical agencies in collecting, tabulating, and publishing

236

See Section III.C.1.c. of the 2004 ABS Adopting Release.

237

Current lists and definitions of Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas are available at
http://www.census.gov/population/www/metroareas/metrodef.html.

116 


Federal statistics.238 A Metropolitan Statistical Area may also contain a subdivision,
called a Metropolitan Division.239 As an example, if the underlying property that serves
as collateral to a mortgage is located in Alexandria, Virginia, the issuer would need to
designate the geographic location as 47894 - Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA­
MD-WV, the appropriate Metropolitan Division.
For asset-level disclosure data points that require disclosure of obligor credit
scores, we are proposing coded responses that represent ranges of credit scores. The
ranges are based on the ranges that some issuers already provide in pool-level disclosure.
For monthly income and debt ranges, we developed the ranges based on a review of
statistical reporting by other governmental agencies.
We also realize that a situation may arise where an appropriate code for disclosure
may not be currently available in the technical specifications. To accommodate those
situations, our proposals provide a coded response for “not applicable,” “unknown” or
“other.” However, “not applicable,” “unknown” or “other” would not be appropriate
responses to a significant number of data points and registrants should be mindful of their

238

A Metropolitan Statistical Area contains a core urban area of 50,000 or more population, and a
Micropolitan Area contains an urban core of at least 10,000 (but less than 50,000) population. Each Metro
or Micro area consists of one or more counties and includes the counties containing the core urban area, as
well as any adjacent counties that have a high degree of social and economic integration (as measured by
commuting to work) with the urban core. The OMB also further subdivides and designates New England
City and Town Areas. The OMB may also combine two or more of the above designations and identify it
as a Combined Statistical Area.
239

For example, 47900 designates the Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV
Metropolitan Statistical Area. 47900 contains two subdivisions. One is 13644 Bethesda-FrederickRockville, MD Metropolitan Division which includes Frederick County and Montgomery County. The
other is 47894 Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV Metropolitan Division which contains
the District of Columbia, DC; Calvert County, MD; Charles County, MD; Prince George’s County, MD;
Arlington County, VA; Clarke County, VA; Fairfax County, VA; Fauquier County, VA; Loudoun County,
VA; Prince William County, VA; Spotsylvania County, VA; Stafford County, VA; Warren County, VA;
Alexandria City, VA; Fairfax City, VA; Falls Church City, VA; Fredericksburg City, VA; Manassas City,
VA; Manassas Park City, VA; and Jefferson County, WV. See OMB Bulletin No. 09-01, “Update of
Statistical Area Definitions and Guidance on Their Uses,” List 3, November 2008.

responsibilities to provide all of the disclosures required in the prospectus and other
reports.240 Additionally, a situation may arise where an issuer would like to disclose
other data not already defined in our proposed disclosure requirements.241 In these cases,
registrants should provide appropriate explanatory disclosure. As we discuss in more
detail below, we are proposing that issuers file explanatory disclosure and or definitions
of additional data points as another exhibit to Form 8-K at the same time the asset-level
data file is required to be filed on Form 8-K. The Form 8-K and each of these exhibits
would be incorporated by reference into the prospectus.242
Request for Comment
•	 Are the proposed coded responses contained in the attached tables
appropriate? Please be specific in your responses by commenting on specific
proposed line items and codes.
•	 The combination of certain asset-level data disclosures may raise privacy
concerns. Are there particular asset-level data points that give rise to privacy
concerns, in addition to the ones noted above and why? Are there other ways
we could provide investors with similar information and lessen privacy
concerns? Which information raises the most significant privacy concerns?
•	 Which data points, or combination of data points would be the most important
to an investor’s analysis? For instance, if we do not adopt any requirement to
disclose geographic location, would the coded range of FICO score, coded

range of income, and sales price still be useful to investors? If we do not
adopt a requirement to disclose geographic location, a coded range of FICO
score and coded range of income, would the sales price alone still be useful to
investors? Please be specific in your response.
•	 Is our approach to geographic location appropriate? Does the use of the
Metropolitan or Micropolitan Statistical Area, or Metropolitan Division
provide investors with meaningful disclosure? Should we require only
Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Area which would be a broader
description? For example, for a property in Alexandria, Virginia, 47900­
Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical
Area would be the appropriate designation that would be a larger geographic
area than Metropolitan Division. Would disclosure by state or zip code be
appropriate? If a particular geographic area is experiencing a low volume of
real estate transactions, would the low volume of transactions make it easier to
identify the underlying obligor using other publicly available resources? Are
there other ways to designate geographic location that would provide investors
meaningful disclosure while also addressing privacy concerns? For instance,
instead of requiring geographic location at the asset-level, should we proscribe
requirements for a pool-level table that presents the geographic concentration
of the pool subdivided by state, size of loan and number of loans? In using
such a pool-level disclosure approach would it also be necessary to subdivide
by income, credit score and sales price?

119 


•	 Is our approach to credit scores, income and debt appropriate? Does our
approach appropriately balance investor need for the information while
addressing privacy concerns? Do the categories provide meaningful ranges
for investor analysis? If not, please be specific in your response. Should we
instead require asset-level disclosure of the specific credit score, amount of
income and amount of debt of an obligor?
•	 Are there other privacy issues that arise for issuers of ABS backed by foreign
assets? How do the privacy laws of foreign jurisdictions differ from U.S.
privacy laws? If the privacy laws of foreign jurisdictions are more restrictive
regarding the disclosure of information, how should we accommodate issuers
of ABS backed by foreign assets? Is there substitute information that could be
provided to investors? Please be specific in your response.
ii)

Proposed General Disclosure Requirements

With respect to each asset in the pool, the issuer would be required to provide the
disclosure described below. A description of the 28 proposed data points is provided in
Table 1 of the Appendix. We believe the proposed general item requirements are basic
characteristics of assets that would be useful to investors in ABS across asset classes.
1.	 A unique asset number applicable only to that asset and the source of the
number. We are aware that identifiers for each asset may be generated in
many ways. These identification numbers may have been generated at
origination or at different times through the securitization process. An asset
number is necessary so that investors and other market participants may
follow the performance of a loan through ongoing periodic reporting. We do

120 


not propose a specific naming or numbering convention; however, we are
proposing an instruction to clarify what type of asset numbers would satisfy
this requirement and an instruction to clarify that the same asset number
should be used to identify the asset for all reports required of an issuer under
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. For instance, asset number types
that would satisfy the requirements could be generated by CUSIP Global
Services (CUSIP);243 the American Securitization Forum (ASF Universal
Link); MERS (Mortgage Identification Number); by the registrant;244 or by
using the convention “[CIK-number]-[Sequential asset number]”;245
2.	 Whether the asset is designated to a particular collateral group. Some asset
pools designate assets to particular groups in order to determine how cash
flows will be passed on to investors;
3.	 Information regarding origination, such as origination date, original amount of
the loan or contract, original term of the asset in number of months;
4.	 The asset maturity date, which is the month the final payment on the asset is
scheduled to be made;
5.	 The original amortization term, which is the number of months in which the
asset would be retired if the amortizing principal and interest were to be paid
each month;

243

A CUSIP number would be appropriate if the asset being securitized itself is a security.

244

For instance, if a registrant uses its own unique numbering to track the asset throughout its life,
disclosure of that number would satisfy this proposed item requirement.
245

For instance, if a registrant used the “[CIK-number]-[Sequential asset number]” format, the
number would first list the 10-digit CIK of the issuing entity and the second half would be a number for the
pool, e.g, “ 0000350001-000001.”

121 


6. Information regarding interest rate, such as the original interest rate,
amortization type which means whether the interest rate is fixed or adjustable;
7.	 If the asset has an interest only term, the number of months in which the
obligor is permitted to pay only interest on the asset;
8.	 Whether the interest calculation is simple or actuarial. A simple interest
calculation is always based on the original principal, thus interest on interest is
not included. An actuarial calculation is based on principal plus accrued
interest;
9.	 The identity of the primary servicer that has the right to service the asset,
either by name or by the MERS organization number (in the case of RMBS);
10. The servicing fees, either expressed as a percentage of the asset amount or as
a flat-dollar amount, as applicable;
11. The servicing advance methodology by indicating the code that best describes
the manner in which principal and/or interest are to be advanced by the
servicer;
12. Whether the loan or asset was an exception to defined or standardized
underwriting criteria; and
13. The measurement date, which would be the date the asset-level data is
provided in accordance with proposed Item 1111(h)(1).246
As discussed above, proposed Item 1111(h)(2) would also require issuers to
provide Schedule L data as part of a final prospectus filed in accordance with Rule

246

As discussed above, proposed Item 1111(h)(1) would require issuers provide Schedule L data at
the time of a Rule 424(h) prospectus as of a recent practicable date.

122 


424(b), as of the cut-off date for the securitization.247 The cut-off date would be the date
specified in the instruments governing the transaction (i.e., the date on and after which
collections on the pool assets accrue for the benefit of the asset-backed security holders).
In addition, we are proposing the following data points to update for activity that could
occur during the period between the time the asset-level data would have been previously
provided in the proposed Rule 424(h) prospectus and the cut-off date.
1.	 The current asset balance, current interest rate, and current payment amount
due.
2.	 The number of days the obligor is delinquent and the number of payments the
obligor is past due as of the cut-off date.
3.	 If the obligor has not made the full scheduled payment, the number of days
between the scheduled payment date and the cut-off date.248 We are
proposing this item requirement so that investors will receive comparable data
about the payment performance of an asset.249 We note that the disclosure
provided in response to this proposed requirement may differ from other

247

We note that the proposed requirement to file Schedule L data with the final prospectus does not
address the timing and adequacy of information available to the investor at the time the investment decision
is made. Under Securities Act Rule 159, information conveyed after the time of the contract of sale (e.g., a
final prospectus) is not taken into account in evaluating the adequacy of information available to the
investor at the time the investment decision was made.
248

For example, if the scheduled payment date is December 25, and the full payment due is not
received by the cut-off date for the report, December 31, the appropriate response to this item would be 6
days. We note that some delinquency recognition policies may not consider the payment delinquent at the
same point in time.

249

We are also proposing that issuers be required to report the number of days a full scheduled
payment is past due in each Form 10-D. See discussion in Section III.A.2.a.

123 


asset-level or pool-level delinquency disclosure due to the various
delinquency recognition policies across issuers and asset classes.250
4. Remaining term to maturity, which would be the number of months between
the cut-off date and asset maturity date.
Request for Comment
•	 Are the general data points that would apply to all securitizations (other than
credit cards, charge cards and stranded costs) appropriate? Should any be
deleted or made applicable only to certain asset classes? If so, what data
points? Are there any other data points that should apply to all asset classes?
Please provide a detailed explanation of the reasons why or why not.
•	 Is the approach to asset number identifier workable? Should we only require
or permit one type of asset number for all asset classes? If so, which one
would be most useful? It appears that our proposed naming convention of
“[CIK-number]-[Sequential asset number]” would be applicable to all asset
classes. Does the use of an asset number alleviate potential privacy issues for
the underlying obligor? Why or why not? What issues arise if the asset
250

We are proposing this item instead of proposing to define delinquency for all issuers. In the 2004
ABS Adopting Release we stated that delinquency should be determined in accordance with any of the
following: the transaction agreements for the asset-backed securities; the delinquency recognition policies
of the sponsor, any affiliate of the sponsor that originated the pool asset or the servicer of the pool asset; or
the delinquency recognition policies applicable to such pool asset established by the primary safety and
soundness regulator of any entity listed above or the program or regulatory entity that oversees the program
under which the pool asset was originated. We adopted that definition because commenters requested
flexibility since policies relating to delinquency vary somewhat across asset types and sponsors. The
approach we adopted gave consideration to a party’s delinquency recognition policies and we emphasized
robust disclosure about those policies. For instance, some sponsors do not consider an obligor delinquent
when any portion of a contractually required payment is late, but instead only when less than some
percentage or amount of a payment is received. See Section III.A.d.iii. of the 2004 ABS Adopting Release.
In the context of standardized asset-level data, we believe the disclosure of the number of days from the
scheduled payment due date and the cut-off date allows flexibility for the definition of delinquent while
allowing for analysis and comparability of asset-level data.

124 


number is determined by the registrant? Would there be any issues with
investors being able to specifically identify each asset and follow its
performance through periodic reporting?
•	 Should we require a data point to disclose the CIK number of the sponsor?
Would all sponsors have a CIK number? If not, in what other ways could we
require standardized disclosure of the identity of sponsors?
•	 Should we define delinquency in order to provide comparable delinquency
disclosure across issuers and asset classes? If so, how should it be defined
and why? Would market participants be able to make changes to their current
systems to capture information to satisfy a standardized delinquency
disclosure requirement? Would such a requirement be burdensome? Is there
another way to provide comparable delinquency disclosure across issuers and
asset classes? Please be detailed in your response.
•	 The response to some data points requires the identification of a party (e.g.,
originator or servicer) or the MERS generated number of the organization. Is
this approach to identification workable? Do any issues arise with allowing a
text response to these types of data points? What alternatives would alleviate
such issues? What if the organization does not have a MERS number?
iii)

Asset Specific Data Points

As discussed in detail below, we are proposing to further subdivide the Schedule
L data points so that issuers can determine whether or not the data field applies to their
transaction. For instance, if the asset pool contains only residential mortgages, then
issuers would only need to provide those data points designated under proposed Items 1

125 


and 2 of Schedule L. Similarly, if the asset pool contains only student loans, the issuer
would only need to provide those data points designated under proposed Items 1 and 8.
If the asset pool contains assets for which we have not proposed asset class specific data
points, the issuer would only need to provide those general data points designated under
proposed Item 1. Further, if the asset pool of residential mortgages consists only of fixedrate mortgages, all of the data points related to adjustable rate mortgages251 need not be
included in the data file. Likewise, in a pool of student loans, if the asset pool comprised
only loans issued under a federal student loan program, such as the Federal Family
Education Loan Program (FFELP),252 information related to private label student loan
programs need not be included in the data file.253 The issuer, however, may need to
provide data in the appropriate indicator field, which is a “yes” or “no” answer to whether
the characteristic is present. This approach is designed to facilitate investor review of the
asset-level data.
Request for Comment
•	 Is the proposed subdivision of Schedule L appropriate? Would this approach
facilitate investor review of the asset-level data?
iv)

Proposed Exemptions

We are proposing to exclude ABS backed by credit cards, charge cards, and
stranded costs from the requirement to provide asset-level data. Based on staff reviews
of credit card and charge card asset pools, it appears that some may contain as many as

251

Item 2(a)(16) of proposed Schedule L.

252

FFELP loans are generally based on need, instead of credit quality of the underlying obligor. For
more information, see the U.S. Department of Education Web site at
http://www2.ed.gov/programs/ffel/index.html.
253

Item 8(c) of proposed Schedule L.

126 


20 to 45 million accounts. Based on the overwhelming volume of data in these types of
asset classes, we do not believe that granular asset-level information would be as useful
for investors and the provision of asset-level data may be cost-prohibitive for issuers. We
have also heard anecdotally that investors in credit card or charge card ABS do not have a
desire for asset-level data. For these asset classes, we are proposing that credit card ABS
issuers provide grouped account data that we discuss below.254
For ABS backed by stranded costs, the underlying asset is transition property or
system restoration property. Stranded costs are the costs associated with a decline in the
value of electricity-generating assets due to restructuring of the industry, and the
underlying property is called transition property. 255 System restoration property is a
similar underlying asset, but provides for recovery of system restoration costs incurred by
electric utilities as a result of hurricanes, tropical storms, ice or snow storms, floods and
other weather-related events and natural disasters. These types of property are usually
created by the action of a state legislature or other designated authority. 256 The property
generally includes a right and interest to impose, collect and receive charges payable by
electric customers in a particular territory. Also, this right usually provides that the
designated state authority may periodically adjust the charges billed to customers in order
to recover the stranded costs in the event all collections are not made. Because transition
property is not originated on a customer-by-customer basis, and is instead the right to

254

See Section III.A.3.

255

When the electricity industry deregulated, prices for electricity were expected to decline as
competition was introduced into the market. With prices projected to fall more than production costs,
utilities would earn less and the value of their assets would shrink. Thus, with falling prices eroding the
value of the utilities’ assets, some of their costs would be unrecoverable, or stranded. See Electric Utilities:
Deregulation and Stranded Costs, Congressional Budget Office, October 1998.

See, e.g., Public Utility Regulatory Act, TEX. UTIL. CODE ANN. §§ 39.001-.463

127 


impose charges on customers based on electrical usage, we preliminarily do not believe it
is appropriate to require asset-level data be provided for stranded cost ABS.
Request for Comment
•	 Should asset-level data be provided by credit card, charge card or stranded
cost issuers? If so, please explain why and what asset-level data should be
provided.
•	 Would requiring asset-level data for these asset classes, rather than grouped
asset data, as proposed below, be useful for investors? Is the volume of data
in these types of asset classes a concern to investors? If so, are there ways to
address this, for example, by facilitating the presentation of the data, to make
it more useful to investors?
•	 Are there any other asset classes that should be exempt from the requirement
to provide asset-level data and why?
•	 In light of the proposal not to set forth asset-level data for these assets, is there
any pool-level data that should be provided by credit card, charge card, or
stranded cost issuers? If so, please identify the pool-level data that we should
require and explain why.
•	 Should we specify standardized definitions for pool-level data? For instance,
for credit cards or charge cards, should we define terms such as modification,
excess spread and charge-off? How are issuers currently defining these
various terms?
•	 Should pool-level data for credit cards and charge cards be provided at the
same time that we propose for other issuers to provide Schedule L data (i.e.,

128 


with the proposed Rule 424(h) prospectus, the final prospectus under 424(b)
and for changes under Item 6.05 of Form 8-K)? Should it also be provided at
any other time, such as in periodic reports? If so, please tell us when and
why.
•	 Should we revise Item 1111 to require pool-level disclosure in a standardized
format for ABS backed by credit cards or charge cards? Current Item 1111
requires issuers to present pool-level statistical information in appropriate
distributional groups or incremental ranges in addition to presenting
appropriate overall pool totals, averages and weighted averages, if such
presentation will aid in the understanding of the data. In the case of credit
cards and charge cards, should we proscribe the distributional groups or
incremental ranges for material pool characteristics such as credit scores,
credit limit, account balance, account age, geographic location or annual
percentage rate (APR)?257 For instance, in the case of FICO credit scores,
should the distributional groups be similar to the coded response ranges for
asset-level data in proposed Item 2(c)(3) of Schedule L?258 What other types
of credit scores are used by credit card issuers, if any? Are any proprietary?
What distributional groups would be useful for disclosure of other types of
credit scores?

257

In the FDIC Securitization Proposal, the FDIC also solicited comments on specific questions of
disclosure related to securitizations. We note the suggestions of one commenter regarding the disclosure
that should be provided by issuers of ABS backed by credit cards. See comment letter from MetLife on the
FDIC Securitization Proposal (“MetLife FDIC Letter”), available at
http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/federal/2010/10comAD55.html.
258

See Table 2 of the Appendix to this release.

129 


o In the case of credit limit and account balance, should we proscribe the
following distributional groups for disclosure with respect to credit
card and charge card pools: (1) <$1,000; (2) $1,000-$5,000; (3)
$5,000-$10,000; (4) $10,000-$20,000; (5) $20,000-$30,000; (6)
$30,000-$40,000; (7) $40,000-$50,000; and (8) greater than $50,000?
Would using these distribution groups lead to useful disclosure?
o	 In the case of account age, should we proscribe the following
distributional groups for disclosure with respect to credit card and
charge card pools: (1) 12 months or less; (2) 12-24 months; (3) 24-36
months; (4) 36-48 months; (5) 48-60 months; (6) 60-84 months; (7)
84-120 months; and (8) over 120 months? Would using these
distribution groups lead to useful disclosure?
o	 In the case of geographic location, should we require disclosure by
state or by Metropolitan Statistical Area for credit card and charge
card pools?259 Which would be more useful? Should issuers be
required to disclose all states or Metropolitan Statistical Areas for the
entire pool, or only the top 10, 20 or some other number?
o	 In the case of interest rate or APR, what would be the appropriate
distributional groups? For example, would the following distributional
groups be appropriate: (1) 0 to 1.99%; (2) 2.00% to 4.99%; (3) 5.00%
to 9.99%; (4) 10.00% to 14.99%; (5) 15.00% to 19.99%; (6) 20.00% to
24.99%; (7) 25.00% to 29.99%; (8) 30.00% to 34.99%; (9) 35.00% to

259

See discussion in Section III. A.1.b.i. above.

130 


39.99%; and (10) over 40.00%? Are there other characteristics that
should be included in the same statistical table of information, such as
how many accounts are currently deferring interest, deferring
interest/principal, or other types of promotions?
o	 Should we require issuers of ABS backed by credit cards and charge
cards to provide statistical tables to disclose the amount of credit that
is available for purchases? If so, should we proscribe the following
distributional groups: (1) <$1,000; (2) $1,000-$5,000; (3) $5,000­
$10,000; (4) $10,000-$20,000; (5) $20,000-$30,000; (6) $30,000­
$40,000; (7) $40,000-$50,000; and (8) greater than $50,000? Would
using these distribution groups lead to useful disclosure? Would this
information be useful to investors and why?
o	 Should we require issuers of ABS backed by credit cards and charge
cards to provide statistical tables to disclose the type of products in the
pool? For instance, credit card products could include affinity,260 co­
branded cards,261 merchant cards, partner cards, and reward cards.
Would this information be useful to investors and why?
o	 Should we require issuers of ABS backed by credit cards and charge
cards to provide statistical tables to disclose whether there any
accounts in the pool are under a debt management program, have

Affinity card programs are offered by organizations such as universities, alumni associations,
sports teams, professional associations and others.

redefaulted, are diluted or whether the account has been closed?
Would this information be useful to investors and why?
o	 Should we require issuers of ABS backed by credit cards and charge
cards to provide statistical tables to disclose payment habits of the
obligors, such as the number of accounts, or percentage of the pool
that make minimum payments, pays balances in full, or other payment
types? Are there any other categories of payment behavior that would
be useful to investors?
o	 Should we require issuers of ABS backed by credit cards and charge
cards to provide statistical tables to disclose whether the obligors are
homeowners, mortgage holders or renters? Would this information be
useful to investors and why? Do issuers have this information?
Because credit card securitizations are usually structured as master
trusts, how would issuers be able to provide updated information at the
time of each takedown?
o	 Should we require issuers of ABS backed by credit cards and charge
cards to provide statistical tables to disclose whether the obligors are
employed and if so, the type of employment? Should we specify the
categories for this type of information, such as: (1) professional; (2)
technical; (3) managerial; (4) clerical; (5) sales; (6) service; (7)
agricultural; (8) laborers; (9) military; (10) student; (11) retired; (12)
unemployed; and (13) unknown? Would this information be useful to
investors and why?

132 


o Should we require issuers of ABS backed by credit cards and charge
cards provide statistical tables to disclose the level of education of the
obligors? Should we specify the categories for this type of
information such as: (1) graduate; (2) college-4 year; (3) college-2
year; (4) high school or (5) unknown? Would this information be
useful to investors and why?
o	 Should we require issuers of ABS backed by credit cards and charge
cards to provide statistical tables to disclose the debt-to-income ratio
of the obligors? Would this information be useful to investors and
why? Should the debt-to-income ratio be defined and calculated in the
same manner as required in Schedule L?262 What would the
appropriate distributional categories? For example, would the
following distributional groups be appropriate: (1) 0 to 4.99%; (2)
5.00% to 9.99%; (3) 10.00% to 14.99%; (4) 15.00% to 19.99%; (5)
20.00% to 24.99%; (6) 25.00% to 29.99%; (7) 30.00% to 34.99%; (8)
35.00% to 39.99%; (9) 40.00% to 44.99%; (10) 45.00% to 49.99%;
(11) 50.00% to 54.99%; (12) 55.00% to 59.99%; (13) 60.00% to
64.99%; (14) 65.00 to 69.99%; (15) 70.00% to 74.99%; (16) over
75.00%?
o	 Because credit card securitizations are usually structured as master
trusts, how would issuers be able to provide updated information

262

See proposed Items 2(a)(21)(iv) and 2(a)(20)(v) of Schedule L.

133 


described in the previous four bullet points at the time of each
takedown?
o	 Should we specify the data that should be presented for each
distributional group in the above requests for comment? For instance,
for each distributional group of credit scores, issuers typically provide
a table detailing the number of accounts, dollar amount and percentage
of the pool. Should we also require that issuers provide the following
information for each credit score distributional group in the same
table: (1) weighted average credit limit; (2) weighted average
utilization rate; (3) weighted average account age; (4) percentage of
obligors that pay in full; (5) percentage of obligors that make
minimum payments; (6) weighted average credit score; (7) weighted
average APR; (8) portfolio yield; (9) amount of interchange; (10)
amount of fees; (11) amount of gross charge-offs; (12) amount of
recoveries; (13) amount of prepayments; (14) dollar amount of
accounts that are over 30 days delinquent; (15) number of accounts
that are over 30 days delinquent; and (16) weighted average excess
spread?263 Is there any other information that would be useful for
investors in this format?
•	 Should we require aggregated asset-level data in a machine-readable form for
issuers of ABS backed by stranded costs so that investors may download the
data and input it into a waterfall computer program? If so, please specify the

and formulas, if applicable.
c)

Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities

We are proposing 137 data points for ABS backed by residential mortgages. The
staff has surveyed the data and definitions provided by the organizations mentioned
above, as well as other industry sources. We are proposing to require additional data
fields that relate to residential mortgages that are based mainly on information already
typically provided by sellers to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or likely to be collected by
participants in Project RESTART.
Some of the Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Project RESTART data points appear
in the general section (Item 1), because we believe those data points would apply to all
types of asset-backed securities. We did not, however, include every data point included
in those loan-level packages. We believe that there are numerous ways to capture the
same data, and after reviewing other loan-level data dictionaries, our definitions may
have minor differences from those in Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Project RESTART
because we wanted to make sure that we captured disclosure that may be provided to
other organizations. For instance, we believe that many of the points are also consistent
with the data dictionary developed by MISMO.264 We also reviewed other data
definitions currently used by banks for reporting to the OCC and OTS.265 As noted
above, we also are proposing several indicator fields that usually require a “yes” or “no”
answer in order to facilitate investor review of the data.
264

As noted above, MISMO is an affiliate of MERS. The MISMO data dictionary is available at
http://www.mismo.org/pages/Residential%20Specifications.aspx.

2009, available at http://www.occ.treas.gov/ftp/release/2009-9a.pdf.

135 


With respect to each mortgage in the pool, the issuer would be required to
disclose the information described below. A complete description of each proposed data
point is provided in Table 2 of the Appendix to this release.
1. A code that describes the loan purpose.
2. The lien position of the loan.
3. Whether the obligor is subject to any prepayment penalties, a code that
describes the type of penalty, the term of penalty and a code that describes
how the penalty is calculated.
4. The origination channel and whether a broker took the application.
5. The Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System (NMLS) loan originator number
and loan origination company number.266
6. Whether the loan allows for negative amortization and information regarding
the negative amortization terms which would include:

266

In 2008, Congress passed The Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008
(the SAFE Act) which required the creation of a Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry.
The SAFE Act is designed to enhance consumer protection and reduce fraud by encouraging states to
establish minimum standards for the licensing and registration of state-licensed mortgage loan originators
and for the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) and the American Association of Residential
Mortgage Regulators (AARMR) to establish and maintain a nationwide mortgage licensing system and
registry for the residential mortgage industry. The SAFE Act was enacted as part of the Housing and
Economic Recovery Act of 2008, Public Law 110–289, Division A, Title V, sections 1501–1517, 122 Stat.
2654, 2810–2824 (July 30, 2008), codified at 12 U.S.C. 5101–5116. The Federal Housing Finance
Agency will require that mortgages purchased by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae include loan-level
identifiers of the loan originator and loan origination company for mortgage applications taken on or after
July 1, 2010. The original date of compliance was January 1, 2010; however, this has been extended to
July 1, 2010. See Federal Housing Finance Agency News Release, “FHFA Announces New Mortgage
Data Requirements,” January 15, 2009, available at
http://www.fhfa.gov/webfiles/400/LoanOrigIDS11509.pdf. See also Freddie Mac Bulletin 2009-27,

Request for Comment
•	 Are all of the RMBS data points appropriate? Are there other data points that
should be required for all RMBS issuers? Are any data points not necessary
or overly burdensome to obtain? Please specify the proposed data points and
provide a detailed explanation of the reasons why or why not.
•	 Some data points request the results of calculations, such as debt-to-income
ratios. Can these ratios otherwise be calculated from data provided by the
other asset-level data points? If so, can users of the information
independently calculate these data points? And should we not require these
data points to be included in the asset-level data file?
•	 Should we include a data point to require what effort an originator or sponsor
made to see if there are other loans secured by the same property? If we were
to code the response, what code descriptions should we provide?

142 


•	 Are the proposed type of responses and coded responses appropriate? Are
there additional codes that should be included? Please provide a detailed
explanation of the reasons why or why not.
•	 What privacy concerns arise if we require issuers to disclose the sales price of
the property, if any? Would rounding the sales price to the nearest thousandth
alleviate privacy concerns? If not, what would be the appropriate rounding
method? If we instead required the disclosure of sales price be provided by a
coded range of dollar amounts, would that alleviate privacy concerns? What
would be the appropriate ranges of dollar amounts? Would the above
mentioned options have an effect on an investor’s ability to analyze the assetlevel data or use the waterfall computer program? If so, please be specific in
your response. In what other ways could we require the disclosure of sales
price so that investors receive useful information and also address any privacy
concerns?

Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities

We are proposing 61 data points for ABS backed by commercial mortgages. The
data points we are proposing to require are primarily based on the definitions included in
the CRE Finance Council Investor Reporting Package, current Regulation AB
requirements and staff review of current disclosure. The CRE Finance Council
disclosure package standardizes bond, loan and property level information for
commercial mortgage-backed securities.267 We are not proposing, however, to include
every data point included in the CRE Finance Council reporting package. Some of the
267

According to the CRE Finance Council, transaction disclosure should be updated and provided
monthly. See http://www.crefc.org/.

143 


data points already appear in the general section (Item 1), because we believe those data
points would apply to all types of asset-backed securities. We did not include others
because we did not believe the level of detail was necessary for investor analysis as we
believe that the most important data points for CMBS are those that relate to the loan
term and the property. With respect to each commercial mortgage loan in the pool, the
issuer would be required to disclose the information described below. A description of
each proposed data point and related response is provided in Table 3 to the Appendix to
this release.
1.	 A code that describes the loan structure, including the seniority of participated
mortgage loan components.
2.	 The current remaining term of the loan.
3.	 A code that describes the payment method, the amount of the periodic
principal and interest payment, and frequency of payment for the loan,
frequency that the payment will be adjusted, and grace days allowed.
4.	 The number of properties that serve as mortgage collateral for the loan;
5.	 The hyper-amortizing date, which is the current anticipated repayment date
after which principal and interest may amortize at an accelerated rate, and/or
interest to the mortgagor increases substantially.
6.	 Whether the loan is interest only or requires a balloon payment.
7.	 Whether the obligor is subject to prepayment penalties, the effective date after
which the lender allows prepayment of a loan, the date after which yield
maintenance prepayment penalties are no longer effective and the date after
which prepayment premiums are no longer effective.

144 


8.	 If the loan permits negative amortization, the maximum percentage and
amount of the original loan balance that can be added to the original loan
balance as a result of negative amortization.
9.	 If the loan is an adjustable rate mortgage:
a.	 the index on which the adjustable rate is based;
b.	 the first rate adjustment date;
c.	 the first payment adjustment date;
d.	 the number of percentage points that are added to the current index
rate to establish the new note rate each interest adjustment date,
e.	 the maximum percentage by which a mortgage rate may increase or
decrease, initially, at subsequent points in time, and over the lifetime
of the loan;
f.	 a code describing the frequency with which the periodic mortgage rate
is reset and a code describing the frequency with which the periodic
mortgage payment will be adjusted; and
g.	 the number of days prior to an interest rate effective date which is used
to determine the appropriate index rate or lookback.
10. Whether the loan had been modified from its terms at the time of origination.
The issuer also would be required to provide information on each of the properties
collateralizing the loan. This would include:
1.	 The property name, geographic location, designated by zip code, as
applicable, and the year that the property was built;

145 


2. A code describing the current use of the property, including net rentable
square feet of a property, number of units/beds/rooms, and percentage of
rentable space occupied by tenants;
3.	 The valuation amount of the property as of a valuation date and source of
valuation;
4.	 The total underwritten revenues from all sources for a property and total
underwritten operating expenses (including real estate taxes, insurance,
management fees, utilities, and repairs and maintenance);268
5.	 The date when the defeasance option becomes available. A defeasance option
is when an obligor may substitute other income-producing property for the
real property without pre-paying the existing loan;269
6.	 Net operating income and net cash flow, including a code describing how
operating income and net cash flow were calculated (i.e., using the CMSA
standard, using a definition in the pooling and servicing agreement, or using
the underwriting method);
7.	 The ratio of underwritten net operating income to debt service, the ratio of
underwritten net cash flow to debt service, and an indicator showing how the
debt service coverage ratio was calculated;270 and

268

For this purpose “underwritten” means the amount of revenues or expenses adjusted based on a
number of assumptions made by the mortgage originator or seller. We believe issuers should include
narrative disclosure about the assumptions used in the prospectus.
269

See Mary Stuart Freydberg and Mary MacNeill,, “Defeasance by Design: Frequently Asked
Questions,” CMBS World, March 1999, available at
http://www.cmsaglobal.org/cmbsworld/cmbsworld_toc.aspx?folderid=31374.
270

For this purpose, “underwritten” means that the amount disclosed is adjusted based on a number
of assumptions made by the mortgage originator or seller. We believe issuers should include narrative
disclosure about the assumptions used in the prospectus. Such an indicator would consider whether the
servicer allocates debt service only to properties where financial statements are received, whether all

8. The three largest tenants (based on square feet), including square feet leased
by the tenant and lease expiration dates of the tenant.
We note that some of the data points that we are proposing to include in Schedule L are
currently required on a loan-level basis under existing Item 1111(b)(9)(i) of Regulation
AB.271 Such items are described in the list above and relate to: the location and use of
each property; net operating income and net cash flow information, as well as the
components of net operating income and net cash flow, for each mortgaged property;
current occupancy rates for each mortgaged property and the identity, square feet
occupied by and lease expiration dates for the three largest tenants at each mortgaged
property. Issuers of ABS backed by CMBS would be required to continue to provide the
information required by Item 1111(b)(9)(i) in the prospectus in a narrative form.
Request for Comment
•	 Are all of the CMBS data points appropriate? Is there any reason not to
incorporate any of the requirements for commercial mortgage-backed
securities into Schedule L? Are there any additional fields we should include?
Are there any changes we should make for specific types of commercial
properties?
•	 Should we include the current Item 1111(b)(9)(i) asset-level disclosure
requirement for CMBS in Schedule L, as proposed? Should we eliminate the

properties are reported on one rolled up financial statement from the borrower, whether all financial
statements were collected for all properties, whether no financial statements were received, whether not all
properties received financial statements and the servicer leaves empty, or whether or not all properties
received financial statements and the servicer allocates 100% of debt service to all properties where
financial statements are received.
271

Specifically, we are proposing to include the requirements of Item 1111(b)(9)(i)(A), (B), (C), and
(D) in Schedule L.

147 


requirement to provide the asset-level information in narrative form? If so,
would any material information relating to a commercial mortgage be lost?
•	 We are proposing to require an indicator that shows how net operating income
and net cash flow were calculated for commercial mortgages. The code
options for this indicator would show whether these items were calculated
using a CMSA standard, using a definition in the pooling and servicing
agreement, or using an underwriting method. Are these appropriate codes?
Are there any additional codes that should be included?
•	 We are proposing to require an indicator that shows how the debt service
coverage ratio was calculated for commercial mortgages. The code options
for this indicator would be: (1) Average- not all properties received financial
statements, and the servicer allocates debt service only to properties where
financial statements are received; (2) Consolidated – all properties reported on
one “rolled up” financial statement from the borrower, (3) Full- all financial
statements collected for all properties, (4) None Collected – no financial
statements were received; (5) Partial – not all properties received financial
statements and servicer to leave empty; and (6) “Worst Case” – not all
properties received financial statements, and servicer allocates 100% of debt
service to all properties where financial statements are received. Are these
codes appropriate? Are there additional codes that should be included?
•	 We currently require disclosure of the three largest tenants that occupy the
underlying property in the prospectus. Should we also require issuers to
disclose whether the named tenants are affiliated with the obligor as a data

148 


point in Schedule L and in narrative form in the prospectus? Should we
require a description of the relation in narrative form?
•	 Should we continue to require Item 1111(b)(9)(i) data in the prospectus, as
proposed, or is the proposed asset-level data sufficient?
e)

Other Asset Classes

We are unaware of any other organization that has standardized data points for
asset classes other than mortgages for investor reporting.272 As we explain above,
standardized data points provide disclosure to investors about the payment stream and
amount of payments related to individual assets; make it possible for users to perform
prepayment and credit analysis on an individual asset, and evaluate the collateral, if any,
that secures the individual asset.273 Consequently, in order to make the asset-level
information useful to investors, we are proposing data points derived from the aggregate
pool-level disclosure that is commonly provided in prospectuses for the following asset
classes: automobile loans and leases; equipment loans and leases; student loans;
floorplan financing; repackagings of corporate debt and resecuritizations. We are also
proposing to add several data points related to obligor and co-obligor income, assets,
employment, and credit scoring. These data points mirror the definitions proposed for
RMBS in an effort to provide more robust disclosure about obligor credit quality. We
solicit comment on all of our proposed asset specific data points and have specific
questions on certain asset classes.

272

We note that the ASF contemplates expanding Project RESTART to other major asset classes,
such as student loans, credit cards and automobile securitizations. See American Securitization Forum
RMBS Disclosure and Reporting Package Final Release (July 15, 2009) at 29, available at
http://www.americansecuritization.com/.

Request for Comment
•	 Are there any organizations that have produced standardized data definitions
for other asset classes? If so, would these definitions be appropriate for the
proposed asset specific data points?
•	 Are the asset specific data points appropriate? What other data points should
be required by all issuers of that asset class? Please provide a detailed
explanation of the reasons why or why not.
i)

Automobiles

Asset-backed securities may be backed by a pool of automobile loans or
automobile leases. We are proposing to require 31 additional data fields that relate to
ABS backed by loans for the purchase of automobiles and 33 data fields that relate to
ABS backed by automobile leases. With respect to each loan or lease in the pool, the
issuer would be required to disclose the information described below. A description of
each proposed data point is provided in the Appendix to the release in Table 4 for
automobile loans and Table 5 for automobile leases.
1.	 Whether payments are required monthly or a balloon payment is due;
2.	 Whether a form of subsidy was received by the borrower, such as an incentive
or rebate;
3.	 Geographic location of the dealer by zip code;
4.	 The vehicle manufacturer, model, model year, vehicle type and whether it is
new or used;
5.	 The vehicle value and source of vehicle value at the time of origination;
6.	 For leases, base residual value and source of residual value;

iv)

Floorplan Financings

155 


Asset-backed securities may be backed by a pool of floorplan receivables.
Floorplan receivables are used by wholesalers and retailers to finance purchases of
inventory, for instance, an automobile dealership will finance purchases of the vehicles
available for sale in its inventory. Floorplan receivables are usually revolving in nature
and are commonly structured as revolving asset master trusts. Payment terms may vary,
but usually payment is due when the underlying collateral is sold. Generally, when new
inventory is purchased, a new receivable is created; therefore, we are proposing that the
asset-level data be provided for each receivable, instead of each account.
We are proposing to require six additional data fields that relate to ABS backed
by floorplan financings. With respect to each receivable in the pool, the issuer would be
required to disclose the information described below. A description of each proposed
data point is provided in the Appendix to the release in Table 9.
1.	 The account origination date.
2.	 The type of inventory product line.
3.	 Whether the property financed is new or used.
4.	 Information related to the obligor such as geographic location by zip code,
and credit score and type.
5.	 If the issuing entity is structured as a master trust that has previously issued
securities, the information required by Items 1 and 9 of Schedule L-D for
assets that were part of the asset pool prior to the current offering.275
Request for Comment

275

We believe prior performance information of pre-existing assets would be useful for investor
analysis of the asset pool. If the information was previously reported, issuers would be able to incorporate
by reference the previously filed Form 10-D.

156 


•	 Since floorplan financings are usually structured as master trusts, we are
proposing to require asset-level data based on each receivable in the pool.
Should the data be provided by account? Which is more appropriate and
why?
•	 Are all of the proposed floorplan financing data points appropriate? What
other data points should be required by all issuers of ABS backed by floorplan
financings? Please provide a detailed explanation of the reasons why or why
not.
•	 We are proposing to require an indicator for product line type. The code
options for this indicator would be: (1) Accounts Receivable;276 (2) Consumer
Electronics and Appliances; (3) Industrial; (4) Lawn and Garden; (5)
Manufactured Housing; (6) Marine; (7) Motorcycles; (8) Musical Instruments;
(9) Power Sports; (10) Recreational Vehicles; (11) Technology; (12)
Transportation and (98) Other. Are these codes appropriate? Are there
additional codes that should be included?
•	 Is our proposal to require the information in Item 1 and Item 9 of Schedule L­
D for pre-existing assets in master trusts appropriate?

276

With respect to accounts receivable, an originator generally makes loans that are secured by
accounts receivable owed to the dealer, manufacturer, distributor or other commercial customer against
which an extension of credit was made and, in limited cases, by other personal property, mortgages on real
estate, assignments of certificates of deposit or letters of credit. The accounts receivable which are pledged
to an originator as collateral may or may not be secured by collateral. In the case of a loan facility secured
by accounts receivable, the lender usually has discretion as to whether to make advances to the borrower
under that facility.

157 


v)

Corporate Debt

Asset-backed securities may be backed by corporate debt securities. Assetbacked securities backed by corporate debt securities are typically issued in smaller
denominations than the underlying security and the ABS are registered under Section
12(b) of the Exchange Act for trading on an exchange. Additionally, a pooling and
servicing agreement may also permit a servicer or trustee to invest cash collections in
corporate debt instruments which may be securities under the Securities Act.277 We are
proposing nine additional data fields for ABS backed by corporate debt. We believe the
data points in Item 1. General are appropriate because items such as origination date,
maturity date, amortization term, etc. would also apply to corporate debt. A description
of each proposed data point is provided in the Appendix to this release in Table 10.
1.	 Title of the underlying security or agreement, denomination, and currency.
2.	 The payment frequency of the security or agreement.
3.	 Whether the security or agreement is callable.
4.	 Name of trustee.
5.	 Underlying SEC file number and CIK number.
6.	 Whether the security is a zero-coupon, that is whether it bears interest by
means of periodic payments or by means of purchase at a discount and full
price repayment at maturity.

An asset pool of an issuing entity includes all other instruments provided as credit enhancement or
which support the underlying assets of the pool. If those instruments are securities under the Securities
Act, they must be registered or exempt from registration if included in the asset pool as provided in
Securities Act Rule 190, regardless of their concentration in the pool. See Securities Act Rule 190(a) and
(b). See also Section III.A.6.a. of the 2004 ABS Adopting Release.

underlying security? If so, how would we define the data point(s) and the

vi)

Resecuritizations

In a resecuritization ABS, the asset pool is comprised of one or more asset-backed
securities. We are proposing that issuers provide the same Schedule L data as required
for corporate debt-backed securities, for each asset-backed security in the asset pool
because the same information about the underlying asset-backed security, such as the title
of the security, payment frequency, whether it is callable, the name of trustee and the
underlying SEC file number and CIK number would be useful to an investor. In addition,
we are proposing that issuers provide Schedule L data for assets underlying those
securities. 278 For instance, in an offering where the asset pool is comprised of several
RMBS, then the data points in Item 1 and Item 10 of Schedule L would be required for
every RMBS security in the asset pool, as well as the data points in Item 1 and Item 2 for
each loan underlying each RMBS security. Also, under current rules, if the assets that
will be securitized are themselves securities under the Securities Act, the offering of

278

The waterfall computer program would also be required for each underlying security. See our
proposed changes to Item 1113 (h) of Regulation AB discussed in Section III.B.1 below.

159 


those securities must be registered or exempt from registration under the Securities Act,
and all disclosures for a registered offering is required.279
Request for Comment
•	 Is our proposal for resecuritizations appropriate? What other data points
should be required by all issuers of that asset class? Please provide a detailed
explanation of the reasons why or why not.
•	 Should we require disclosure of the ratings of the resecuritized securities in
Schedule L?
•	 Should we require Schedule L data for the asset pool only, i.e. only the data
points in Item 1 and Item 9 of Schedule L?
•	 Would issuers of the resecuritization ABS be able to obtain the asset-level
data for the pool of assets underlying the resecuritized ABS? Should we
phase in the requirement? We note that Project RESTART recommends that
issuers provide the loan-level reporting package for outstanding RMBS,280
although we note that the ASF recommendation may only serve to provide
information similar to our proposed requirements for periodic reports, and
may not include all the information required at the time of an offering.

279

Due to the exposure created in the underlying instrument through the asset-backed offering, under
current rules, information related to any underlying instrument is required to be disclosed in accordance
with offering disclosure requirements of current Forms S-1and S-3. For example, updated and current
information includes updated pool data, static pool, risk factors, performance information, how the
underlying securities were acquired, and whether and when the underlying securities experienced any
trigger events or rating downgrades. As we stated in the 2004 ABS Adopting Release, not all items of
disclosure required at the time of offering the resecuritization ABS are available through incorporation by
reference of Exchange Act reports. See Section III.A.7. and footnote 193 of the 2004 ABS Adopting
Release. Furthermore, under our proposal requiring one prospectus for each ABS offering, all of the
information must be contained in the prospectus.

2.

Asset-Level Ongoing Reporting Requirements

In addition to asset-level information at the time of the offering, we are proposing
to require asset-level performance information in a standardized format filed on EDGAR
in periodic reports required under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act, including
those required pursuant to the new undertaking to continue reporting described above.
The proposed asset-level performance data in periodic reports would differ from
information that would be required at the time of the offering. We believe that in
periodic reports, some of the most important information focuses on whether an obligor is
making payments as scheduled, the efforts by the servicer to collect amounts past due,
and the losses that may pass on to the investors.
Currently, issuers report performance information in periodic reports on an
aggregate basis; however, we believe that it would be most useful for investors to receive
information regarding whether an individual obligor is making payments as scheduled,
the efforts by the servicer to collect amounts past due, and the loss that may pass on to
the investors on an asset-level basis. That way, an investor may use the asset-level
information to conduct his or her own valuation of the credit quality of a particular asset
and its effect on the pool throughout the life of the investment. We also believe that
regulators could find this information useful. Like asset-level data at the time of the
offering, we are proposing to require asset-level performance data to be filed on EDGAR
in XML in order to facilitate data analysis. The proposed disclosure requirements are
contained in proposed Item 1121(d) and Schedule L-D.
As we discussed earlier, in to order facilitate comparison of information across
securities, we believe that asset-level data should be standardized, and some

161 


organizations have already developed data points for ongoing reporting of information
for registered and unregistered commercial mortgage-backed securities and residential
mortgage-backed securities.281 In our proposed periodic reporting requirements, we have
utilized such standardization where feasible. Like our proposal for asset-level data at the
time of the offering, our proposed periodic reporting requirements specify and define
each item that must be disclosed for each asset in the pool. We are also proposing an
instruction to Schedule L-D that will contain definitions for some of the terms that we use
throughout the schedule. Attached at the end of this release we provide an appendix
which contains a table of the proposed general item requirements as well as asset class
specific item requirements. Each table lists the proposed item number, the title of the
proposed data field, the proposed definition, the proposed response type and codes, if
applicable, and proposed category of information. The proposed category of information
designates the type of information we are proposing so that users will know when the
data point is applicable.
Proposed Item 1121(d) and Schedule L-D disclosure would be required at the
time of each Form 10-D. Periodic reports on Form 10-D are required to be filed within
15 days after each required distribution date on the asset-backed securities, as specified in
the governing documents for such securities.282 If assets are added to the pool during the
reporting period, either through prefunding periods, revolving periods or substitution,
disclosure would be required under our proposed revisions to Item 6.05 on Form 8-K

discussed in Section V.C.1. Similarly, the Schedule L data contained in proposed Item
1111A would need to be provided.
Request for Comment
•	 Are the definitions of terms in the proposed instruction to Schedule L
appropriate? Are there any other terms that should be included in the
instruction?
•	 Are the proposed coded responses contained in the attached tables
appropriate? Does our approach to responses provide investors with
meaningful disclosure while also addressing any privacy concerns? Please be
specific in your response by commenting on specific proposed line items and
codes.
•	 Is the proposed requirement to provide Schedule L-D data with Form 10-D
appropriate? Should Schedule L-D data be required at any other time, such as
daily or monthly for all asset classes? Please tell us why.
a)

Proposed Disclosure Requirements

We are proposing that the same asset classes, subject to the requirement to
provide asset-level data at the time of the offering, would also be required to provide the
standardized data points enumerated in Schedule L-D. Like the proposed asset-level
information at the time of the offering, we are proposing that most issuers must provide
the 46 data points listed under Item 1. General of Schedule L-D. We believe these data
points are generic and consistent across asset classes, and should also apply to any new

282

See General Instruction A.2 to Form 10-D.

163

asset classes that may be included in a registered offering. In addition, we also propose
asset class specific data points that will be discussed further below.
With respect to each asset in the pool, we are proposing to require the following
disclosure with each Form 10-D. A description of the 46 data points is provided in Table
11 of the Appendix.
1.	 The unique asset number and a description of the type of number. The asset
number and type of asset number should be the same values assigned at the
time of the offering that would appear in Schedule L.
2.	 Whether the asset is designated to a particular collateral group.
3.	 The beginning and ending dates of the reporting period.
4.	 The actual total amount paid during the reporting period, the amount of
interest collected, the amount of principal collected and other amounts
collected.
5.	 Any other principal and interest adjustments.
6.	 The current asset balance and scheduled asset balance.
7.	 Amounts that were scheduled to be collected during the reporting period,
which would be the scheduled payment amount, scheduled interest payment
amount, and scheduled principal amount.
8.	 A code that describes the current delinquency status and current payment
status.
9.	 A code that describes the payment history over the most recent 12 months.
10. The next due date, next interest rate and remaining term to maturity.
11. Information related to servicing which would be:

164 


a.	 The current servicer and the dollar amount of the fee earned by the
current servicer for administering the loan for the reporting period;
b.	 If the loan’s servicing has been transferred, the effective date of the
servicing transfer;
c.	 Any amounts advanced by the servicer during the reporting period,
and the cumulative outstanding amount;
d.	 A code that describes the manner in which principal and/or interest are
advanced by the servicer;
e.	 The date a servicer stopped advancing payment; and
f.	 Other fees earned by the servicer and other fees assessed by the
servicer related to the asset.
12. Whether the asset terms have been modified.
13. Whether a notice to repurchase the asset has been received, whether the asset
has been repurchased, the repurchase date, name of the repurchaser, and the
reason for repurchase.
14. Whether the asset has been liquidated.
15. Whether the asset has been charged-off and the charged-off principal and
interest amounts.
16. Whether the asset has been paid-off, and if so, whether any prepayment
penalties were paid or waived. If waived, a code indicating the reason why.

•

Are the general data points appropriate for Form 10-D? What other data
points would apply to all asset classes? Please provide a detailed explanation
of the reasons why or why not.

b)

Proposed Exemptions

We are proposing to exclude ABS backed by credit cards, charge cards and
stranded costs from the requirement to provide ongoing asset-level data in periodic
reports. Like the proposed asset-level data at the time of the offering, because of the
volume of accounts in a credit card or charge card securitization we believe that granular
asset-level information would not be as useful to investors and would be very costly for
issuers, depending on the level of automation of the issuer’s information processing and
delivery system. For these asset classes, we are proposing that issuers provide grouped
account data that we discuss in Section III.A.3. below. As explained earlier, because
transition property is not a receivable, nor a pool of receivables, we do not propose assetlevel data be provided for stranded cost ABS for periodic reports.
Request for Comment
•	 Is there any asset-level data that should be provided in periodic reports by
credit card, charge card or stranded cost issuers? If so, please explain why.
•	 Is there any pool-level data that should be provided in periodic reports by
credit card, charge card, or stranded cost issuers? Should any pool-level data
be standardized for these asset classes? If so, please explain why. For
instance, we request comment above about whether we should require issuers
of ABS backed by credit cards and charge cards to provide specific types of

166 


pool-level disclosure in a standardized manner at the time of an offering.283
Should any of that pool-level information be required with each periodic
report on Form 10-D? For instance, should we use the same distributional
groups for account balance, account age, APR, credit available for purchase,
types of products, and accounts under a debt management program?
•	 Are there any other asset classes that should be exempt from the asset-level
disclosure requirement in periodic reports and why?
c)

Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities

We are proposing 151 data points for periodic reports for ABS backed by
residential mortgages. Similar to the RMBS data points we are proposing for Schedule L,
much of the proposed data and definitions are based on fields developed by organizations
doing work in the area of RMBS, as well as government agencies.284 Many of the data
points we are proposing relate to loan modifications and loss mitigation activities by the
servicer. We describe the additional proposed data points below. A description of each
proposed data point and related response is provided in Table 12 of the Appendix to this
release.
1.	 Information related to delinquent loans, such as a code describing the
reason for non-payment and codes describing the status of the non­
payment;
2.	 If the loan is an adjustable rate mortgage, the rate at the next reset date, the
next interest reset date, the payment at the next reset date, the next

283

See Section III. A.1.b.iv. above.

284

See Section III.A.1.c. above.

payment reset date, whether the loan is an option ARM, and whether the
borrower exercised an option to convert an ARM loan to a fixed loan;
3.	 If the obligor has filed for bankruptcy:
a.	 The date of filing and case number;
b.	 The date on which the next payment is due under the terms of the
bankruptcy plan;
c.	 If the bankruptcy has been released, the code that describes the reason
for the release and the date of the release;
d.	 The actual due date of the loan had the bankruptcy not been filed; and
e.	 Whether the debt was reaffirmed and whether the trustee handles postpetition payments.
4.	 With respect to delinquent loans, whether the servicer is pursuing loss
mitigation and the type of loss mitigation with the loan, borrower or
property;
5.	 Information related to loan modifications:
a.	 The date of first payment due post modification;
b.	 The loan balance as of the modification effective payment date;
c.	 The amount added to the principal balance of the loan;
d.	 Pre- and post-modification interest rates;
e.	 Post-modification margin, which is the number of percentage points
added to the index to establish the new rate;
f.	 Pre- and post-modification principal and interest scheduled payment
amount;

168 


g. Post-modification interest rate ceilings and floors;
h.	 Pre- and post-modification initial and subsequent limitations on
interest rate increases and decreases;
i.	 Pre- and post-modification limitations on payment amount increases
and decreases;
j.	 Pre- and post-modification maturity dates;
k.	 The number of months of the interest reset period, pre- and postmodification;
l.	 Updated debt-to-income ratios used to qualify the modification;
m. Pre- and post-modification interest only period;
n.	 Cumulative and current forgiven interest and principal amounts;
o.	 The due date on which the next payment adjustment is scheduled to
occur for an ARM loan;
p.	 Whether the loan remains an ARM loan post-modification;
q.	 Whether the terms of the modification agreement call for the interest
rate to step up over time, the maximum interest rate to which the loan
may step up and the date the maximum interest rate will be reached;
r.	 Cumulative and current principal amount deferred by the modification
that are not subject to interest accrual as well as any amounts collected
from the obligor during the current period;
s.	 Cumulative and current interest and fees deferred by the modification
that are not subject to interest accrual as well as any amounts collected
from the obligor during the current period;

169 


t. The total amount of expenses that have been waived or forgiven and
reimbursable to the servicer;
u.	 The total amount of escrow and corporate advances made by the
servicer at the time of the modification. Corporate advances are
amounts paid by the servicer which may include foreclosure expenses,
attorney fees, bankruptcy fees, and insurance, among others;
v.	 The total amount of servicing fees for delinquent payments that has
been advanced by the servicer at the time of the modification;
w.	 Whether the loan has been modified under the terms of the HomeAffordable Modification Plan (HAMP).285 If so, information
regarding participation end dates, amounts paid and payable under the
program, whether the mortgage holder has or will receive the incentive
amount under the program, and actual and scheduled balance of the
loan plus any deferred amounts.
6.	 If a forbearance plan is in effect, the start date and end date of the plan. A
forbearance plan is a period during which no payment or a payment
amount less than the contractual obligation is required by the obligor;
7.	 If a repayment plan is in effect, the start and end date of the plan, and the
date the obligor ceased complying with the terms of the plan. A

arrangement. Deed-In-Lieu refers to the transfer of title from an obligor to
the lender to satisfy the mortgage debt and avoid foreclosure;
9.	 If the type of loss mitigation is a short sale, the amount accepted for a
short sale. Short sale refers to the process in which a servicer works with
a delinquent obligor to sell the property prior to the foreclosure sale;
10. If the loan has exited loss mitigation efforts, whether the plan was
completed or satisfied, cancelled or failed, or denied and the date of exit;
11. If the loan is in the foreclosure process:
a.	 The date the loan was referred to a foreclosure attorney and the date on
which foreclosure action was taken;
b.	 The expected date of the foreclosure sale, the date set for the
foreclosure sale by the court or the trustee, and the actual date it
occurs;
c. A code that describes the reason for delay in the foreclosure process;
d. If state law provides for a period for confirmation, ratification,
redemption or upset period, the date of the end of the period;
e. The amount bid by the servicer at the foreclosure sale;286
f. If the loan exited foreclosure, the date and the code that describes the
reason the proceedings ended;
286

The servicer will usually place an opening bid, on behalf of the issuing entity, at the foreclosure
auction that is usually equal to the outstanding loan balance, interest accrued, and any additional fees and
attorney fees associated with the trustee sale. If there are no bids higher than the opening bid, the property

g. If the property was sold to a third-party, the sale amount of the
property;
h. In a judicial foreclosure state, if a judgment on the foreclosure has
occurred, the date on which a court granted the judgment in favor of
the creditor;
i. The date on which the publication of the trustee’s sale information is
published in the appropriate venue; and
j. The date on which the servicer sent a notice of intent to the obligor
informing the obligor of the acceleration of the loan and pending
initiation of foreclosure action.
12. If the property is now owned by the issuing entity due to an unsuccessful
sale at the foreclosure auction, the asset is considered real estate owned
(REO).287 Information should be provided on the following:
a.	 The most recent listing date and price;
b.	 If an offer has been accepted, the amount and the date of acceptance;
c.	 The original list date and list price for the property;
d.	 If an REO sale has closed, the closing date, the gross proceeds, and the
net proceeds;
e.	 The cumulative monthly and total loss amount passed on to the issuing
entity;
f.	 Any amount recovered during the current period;

will be owned by the issuing entity and be considered real estate owned (REO). This typically would occur
because the market value of the property is less than the total amount owed on the loan.
287

Servicing agreements will usually require the servicer to promptly sell the property.

172

g. The start and end date of an eviction process, if applicable; and
h.	 If the loan exited REO during the current period, provide the date and
a code describing the reason.

d.	 If the property was conveyed to the insurance company, the date of
conveyance.
Request for Comment
•	 Are all of the RMBS data points appropriate for periodic reports? What other
data points should be required by all RMBS issuers? Are any data points not
necessary or overly burdensome to obtain? Please provide a detailed
explanation of the reasons why or why not. Some data points request the
results of calculations, such as debt-to income ratios. Can those data points be
calculated from information already provided by the other asset-level data
points? If so, can users of the information independently calculate these data
points? Should we not require these data points to be included in the assetlevel data file for periodic reports?
•	 Should we add a data point to require the amount of any loss as a result of
intentional misstatement, misrepresentation, or omission by an applicant or
other interested parties, relied on by a lender or underwriter to provide
funding for, to purchase, or to insure a mortgage loan? If so, how would the

174 


issuer be able to verify the information? Is this information currently
disclosed?
•	 Should we require updated information about the obligor, such as updated
credit scoring information? If so, why? Would issuers be able to obtain
updated credit scores?
•	 We are proposing several data points to capture activity specifically related to
the HAMP program. Are more generic data points appropriate that would
capture activity if other types of government programs are or become
available? If so, please provide us with the data points that would be more
appropriate and the related definition.
•	 We are proposing, in the case of a foreclosure, that registrants provide the
expected date of the foreclosure sale, the date on which the foreclosure sale
has been set by the court or the trustee, and the date on which the foreclosure
sale occurs. Are all three data points necessary?
•	 We are proposing, in the case of a delayed foreclosure, that registrants provide
a code describing the reason for the delay. Should we specify the number of
days that would constitute a delay for this item requirement? If so, what
would be the appropriate number of days and why?
d)

Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities

We are proposing to require 47 additional data points for periodic reports that
relate to commercial mortgages. Similar to the proposed Schedule L data points for
commercial mortgage-backed securities, the data points we are proposing to require
below are primarily based on the definitions provided by the CMSA. With respect to

175 


each commercial mortgage loan in the pool, the issuer would be required to disclose the
information described below. A description of each proposed data point is provided in
Table 13 to the Appendix to this release.
1.	 The remaining term, number of properties that collateralize the loan and the
current hyper-amortizing date. The hyper-amortizing date is the current
anticipated repayment date, after which principal and interest may amortize at
an accelerated rate, and/or interest to the mortgagor increases substantially.
2.	 If the loan is an adjustable rate mortgage, the rate at the next reset date, the
next date the rate is scheduled to change, the amount of the payment at next
reset, and next payment change date.
3.	 If the loan permits negative amortization, the cumulative deferred interest, and
deferred interest collected.
4.	 A code describing any workout strategy.
5.	 Information related to modifications, such as the date of the last modification,
a code that describes the type of loan modification, the new modified note
rate, payment amount, maturity date and amortization period.
6.	 Information related to each property such as property name, geographic
location, as represented by zip code, property type, net rentable square
footage, number of units, year built, valuation amounts, physical occupancy,
property status and a code that describes the defeasance status. A defeasance
option is when an obligor may substitute other income-producing property for
the real property without pre-paying the existing loan.
7.	 Financial information related to the properties including:

176 


a. Financial reporting beginning and end dates;
b.	 Revenues, operating expenses, net operating income, and net cash
flow;
c.	 A code describing how net operating income and net cash flow were
calculated; and
d.	 The ratio of underwritten net operating income to debt service, the
ratio of underwritten net cash flow to debt service and a code
describing how the ratio was calculated.288

•	 Are all of the CMBS data points for periodic reports appropriate? What other
data points should be required by all CMBS issuers? Please provide a detailed
explanation of the reasons why or why not.
•	 Should we require more data points relating to foreclosure in CMBS, like we
propose for RMBS? If so, please be specific as to which data points should be

collateralizing each asset in Item 3(d) of Schedule L-D because we note that
issuers that currently provide the disclosure in accordance with the CMSA
Investor Reporting Package provide property information on a periodic basis.
Some of this information is the same disclosure that would have been
provided at the time of the offering by proposed Schedule L. Is it appropriate

288

For this purpose, “underwritten” means the adjusted amount based on a number of assumptions
made by the mortgage originator or seller. We believe issuers will have had to include narrative disclosure
about the assumptions used in the prospectus for the transaction.

177 


to include all of the data points in proposed Item 3(d) with each Form 10-D
filing? In particular, is it useful for investors to receive the Item 3(d)(1)
Property name, Item 3(d)(2) Property geographic location, Item 3(d)(3)
Property type and Item 3(d)(6) Year built with each Form 10-D filing? Please
tell us why or why not.
e)

Other Asset Classes

As discussed above, because we are unaware of any other organizations
attempting to standardize data points for asset classes other than mortgages, we are
proposing data points for periodic reports derived from the aggregate pool-level
disclosure that is already provided in periodic reports for the following asset classes:
automobile loans and leases; equipment loans and leases; student loans; and
resecuritizations. We do not propose any asset specific data points related to
repackagings of corporate debt for periodic reports. We believe the data points required
under proposed Item 1. General of Schedule L-D will provide the appropriate asset-level
performance disclosure for those assets to investors.
Request for Comment
•	 Should we propose asset specific data points related to repackaging of
corporate debt for periodic reports? If so, what would those be and what
would be the appropriate form of disclosure?
i)

Automobiles

We are proposing to require five additional data fields for periodic reports that
relate to ABS backed by automobiles loans and nine for ABS backed by automobile
leases. With respect to each loan or lease in the pool, the issuer would be required to

178 


disclose the information described below. A description of each proposed data point is
provided in the Appendix to the release in Table 14 for automobile loans and Table 15 for
automobile leases.
1.	 Whether a form of subsidy is received on the loan, such as an incentive or
rebate.
2.	 Any recovery of amounts previously charged-off.
3.	 Whether the vehicle was repossessed and related proceeds and fees.
4.	 For automobile leases, the updated residual value, source of residual value,
whether the lease has been terminated and the reason why, any excess wear
and tear or mileage charges, sales proceeds of the vehicle, or extension of
lease term.

•	 Are all of the automobile data points appropriate for periodic reports? What
other data points should be required by all issuers of ABS backed by
automobile loans or leases? Please provide a detailed explanation of the
reasons why or why not.
•	 We are proposing to require an indicator for the reason for automobile lease
termination. The code options for this indicator would be: (1) Scheduled
termination; (2) Early termination due to bankruptcy; (3) Involuntary
repossession; (4) Voluntary repossession; (5) Insurance payoff; (6) Customer
payoff; (7) Dealer purchase; and (98) Other. Are these codes appropriate?
Are there additional codes that should be included?

179 


ii)

Equipment

We are proposing to require two additional data fields for periodic reports that
relate to ABS backed by equipment loans and five that relate to equipment leases. With
respect to each loan or lease in the pool, the issuer would be required to disclose the
information described below. A description of each proposed data point is provided in
the Appendix to the release in Table 16 for equipment loans and Table 17 for equipment
leases.
1.	 Liquidation proceeds and any recovery of amounts previously charged-off;
and
2.	 For equipment leases, the updated residual value, source of residual value, and
whether the lease has been terminated and the reason why.

included?

180 


iii)

Student Loans

We are proposing to require six additional data fields for periodic reports that
relate to ABS backed by student loans. With respect to each loan in the pool, the issuer
would be required to disclose the information described below. A description of each
proposed data point is provided in the Appendix to the release in Table 18.
1.	 A code that describes the current obligor payment status.
2.	 The amount of capitalized interest during the reporting period.
3.	 If there is activity related to any guarantor during the reporting period,
principal and interest received from the guarantor, whether a claim is in
process and the outcome of the claim.

Floorplan Financings

We are proposing to require five additional data fields for periodic reports that
relate to ABS backed by floorplan financings. With respect to each loan in the pool, the
issuer would be required to disclose the information described below. A description of
each proposed data point is provided in the Appendix to the release in Table 19.
1.	 The liquidation proceeds and any recovery of amounts previously
charged-off.
2.	 Updated credit score and type.

181 


Request for Comment
•	 Are all of the proposed floorplan financing data points appropriate for
periodic reports? What other data points should be required by all issuers of
ABS backed by floorplan financings? Please provide a detailed explanation
of the reasons why or why not.
v)

Resecuritizations

As discussed earlier, at the time of the offering, we are proposing to require
underlying asset-level data disclosure for resecuritization ABS.289 Therefore, for periodic
reporting, in addition to the asset-level data that would be required of the underlying
securities as outlined in Item 1. General of Schedule L-D, we also propose that issuers of
resecuritization ABS provide Schedule L-D data for the asset pool of the underlying
securities. For example, if the ABS is comprised of several RMBS, then the data points
in Item 1 of Schedule L-D would be required with respect to each RMBS security in the
asset pool. In addition, the data points in Items 1 and 2 of Schedule L-D would be
required for each loan underlying each RMBS security.290 If the issuer of the underlying
security suspends its reporting obligation and stops reporting, the issuer of the
resecuritization ABS would still have to provide the required Schedule L-D data for each
loan underlying each RMBS security because we believe that investors in the
resecuritization ABS would need the underlying asset-level information to evaluate the
performance of the resecuritization ABS.
289

Where the underlying securities were required to be registered pursuant to Rule 190 [17 CFR
230.190], the issuer of those underlying securities is subject to the requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act, as applicable.
290

However, asset-level data would not be required if the asset class is exempt from the requirements
of Item 1121(d) of Regulation AB. For instance, if the asset pool is comprised of stranded cost ABS, then

182 


Request for Comment
•	 Is our proposal for asset-level reporting for resecuritizations appropriate?
•	 Would issuers of the resecuritization ABS be able to obtain the asset-level
data for the pool of assets underlying the resecuritized ABS? Should we
phase in the requirement? We note that Project RESTART recommends that
issuers provide the loan-level reporting package for outstanding RMBS.291
3.

Grouped Account Data for Credit Card Pools

As we discussed above, we are proposing to exclude ABS backed by credit
cards292 from the requirement to provide asset-level data because we believe that level of
information would result in an overwhelming volume of data that may not be useful to
investors and providing the data may be cost-prohibitive for issuers. However, as we also
noted above, we believe that investors and market participants should have access to the
information necessary to assess the credit quality of the assets underlying a securitization
transaction at inception and over the life of the transaction. Instead of providing assetlevel data, we are proposing that issuers of ABS backed by credit cards provide
disclosure more granular than pool-level disclosure by creating “grouped account data.”
As we explain in more detail below, grouped account data would be created by
compressing the underlying asset-level data into combinations of standardized
distributional groups using asset-level characteristics and providing specified data about
these groups. Like our proposals for other asset classes discussed above, we are

Schedule L-D for the underlying pool would not be required because they are exempt from the
requirements of Item 1121(d).

See American Securitization Forum RMBS Disclosure and Reporting Package Final Release (July
15, 2009) at 21, available at http://www.americansecuritization.com/.

For purposes of this discussion, we refer to both credit card and charge cards as “credit cards.”

183

proposing to require the grouped account data be provided in XML and filed as an Asset
Data File in order to facilitate data analysis.293 Our proposal for grouped account data
would be in addition to the disclosure currently required about the composition and
characteristics of the pool of assets taken as a whole.
Request for Comment
•	 Is our proposal to require grouped account data disclosure with
standardized groupings appropriate?
•	 Do investors in ABS backed by credit cards need enhanced information
about assets, or are our current disclosure requirements sufficient?
•	 Is our proposal to require grouped account data in XML appropriate?
Why or why not?
a)

When Credit Card Pool Information Would be Required

Today we are proposing new Item 1111(i) and Schedule CC of Regulation AB
that describe the standardized distributional groups and the information that would be
provided for each group. Consistent with the proposed asset-level disclosure
requirements for other asset classes, Schedule CC data would be an integral part of the
prospectus, and in order to facilitate investor analysis prior to the time of sale, we are
proposing to require issuers to provide Schedule CC data as of a recent practicable date
that we define as the “measurement date” at the time of a Rule 424(h) prospectus and at
the time of the final prospectus under Rule 424(b). Likewise, if issuers are required to
report changes to the pool under Item 6.05 of Form 8-K, updated Schedule CC data

293

See Section III.A.4.

184 


would be required.294 Updated Schedule CC would also be required if an issuer is
required to report changes to the waterfall under proposed Item 6.07 to Form 8-K.295 As
we discuss in Section III.A.4, we are proposing a new Item 6.06 to Form 8-K for issuers
to file the XML data file.
In addition, because credit card ABS are typically structured as master trusts,
accounts may be added or withdrawn.296 Unlike amortizing asset pools, the composition
of the underlying asset pool varies over time and we believe investors and market
participants would benefit from receiving information about the underlying asset pool as
the pool evolves. Therefore, we are proposing that an updated Schedule CC be filed with
each periodic report on Form 10-D.
Request for Comment
•	 Is the proposed requirement to provide Schedule CC data with the proposed
Rule 424(h) prospectus, the final prospectus under 424(b) and for changes
under Item 6.05 of Form 8-K appropriate?
•	 Is the proposed measurement date appropriate? Should we provide further
guidance about what would be a recent practicable date for purposes of
determining the measurement date? For example, should we specify that it be
prepared as of a date that is five business days prior to filing?
•	 Would the proposed Schedule CC contained in the most recent Form 10-D
provide investors with sufficiently current information at the time of making

294

Under our proposed revisions to Item 6.05 of Form 8-K, a narrative description of the changes that
were made to the asset pool, including the number of assets substituted or added to the asset pool, would be
included in the body of the report.
295

See Section III.B. below.

296

See fn. 177 above and accompanying text.

185 


an investment decision? In this regard, we note the result could be that the
most recent Schedule CC data could be as old as 45 days.
•	 Is our proposal to require that updated Schedule CC data be provided with
Form 10-D appropriate? Should Schedule CC data be required at any other
time, such as daily, weekly or monthly? If so, please tell us when and why.
•	 Is our proposal to require that updated Schedule CC data be provided when
changes to the waterfall are reported under proposed Item 6.07 appropriate?
Please tell us why or why not.
b)

Proposed Disclosure Requirements

We are proposing that issuers group the underlying pool into grouped account
data lines. Proposed Schedule CC sets forth the standardized groups and the information
requirements that would be required for credit card pools. Grouped account data lines are
created by grouping the underlying accounts by several characteristics. We further
designate the groupings for each characteristic. This way, investors may receive more
granular information about the underlying asset pool in order to perform better analysis
of future payments on the asset-backed securities.297
We are proposing that data be grouped by a combination of the following
characteristics:
1.	 Credit score. If the credit score used is FICO, the proposed groupings
would be: (1) less than 500; (2) 500-549; (3) 550-599; (4) 600-649; (5)
650-699; (6) 700-749; (7) 750-799; (8) 800 and over; and (9) unknown.
We are proposing that issuers provide the most recent credit score
297

We base our groupings on a comment letter received from an investor in response to the FDIC
Securitization Proposal. See fn. 257 above.

186 


available and accompanying disclosure would be required to explain the
age of the credit score or the policy for updating the credit score from the
time of account origination.298 If the credit score used is not FICO, an
issuer would designate similar groupings and provide explanatory
disclosure. We are proposing a group of “unknown;” however, as we
discuss above, registrants should be mindful of their responsibilities to
provide all of the disclosures required in the prospectus and other
reports.299
2.	 Number of Days Past Due. The proposed groupings would be accounts
that are: (1) current; (2) less than 30 days; (3) 30-59 days; (4) 60-89 days;
(5) 90-119 days; (6) 120-149 days; (7) 150-179 days; and (8) 180 days and
over.300
3.	 Account age. The proposed groupings would be accounts that are: (1)
less than 12 months; (2) 12 to 24 months; (3) 24 to 36 months; (4) 36 to 48
months; (5) 48 to 60 months; and (6) over 60 months.
4.	 State. The proposed groupings would be the top 10 states for aggregate
account balance. The remaining accounts would be grouped into the
category “other.”

298

See further discussion regarding explanatory disclosure for asset data files in Section III.A.4. and
proposed Item 6.06(b) to Form 8-K.
299

See Securities Act Rule 409 [17 CFR 230.409] and Exchange Act Rule 12b-21 [17 CFR 240.12b­

21].
300

See fn. 260 above. As we discuss above, our rules do not currently provide a definition of
delinquent because of various delinquency policies across issuers. Instead of proposing to define
delinquency, we believe disclosure of the number of days past due allows for analysis and comparability of
the data.

187 


5. Adjustable rate index. The proposed groupings for the adjustable rate
indexes would be: (1) fixed; (2) prime; and (3) other.
In order to create a grouped account data line, each group based on each of these
characteristics should be combined with all groups for all other characteristics. All
possible combinations would result in 14,256 grouped account data lines. The table
below illustrates how the distributional groups and the information requirements relate to
each other. For example, grouped account data line 2 in the table below presents the
information required by columns (b)(1) through (b)(5) by combining all the credit card
accounts in the underlying pool that fall within the 500-549 credit score group (column
(a)(1)), payments are less than 30 days past due (column (a)(2)), account age of 12 to 24
months (column (a)(3)), with obligors located in the state of Alabama (column (a)(4)),
where the adjustable rate index is based on a floating percentage (column (a)(5)). For
each grouped account data line, we are proposing that issuers provide the following
information: the aggregate credit limit; aggregate account balance; number of accounts;
weighted average annual percentage rate; and weighted average net annual percentage
rate.301

Request for Comment
•	 Are the proposed standardized distributional groups appropriate? Are there
any other distributional groups that we should specify? Are there any that
should not be required?
•	 Would credit card ABS issuers be able to provide this information in this
format on a cost-effective basis? Would it raise competitive concerns?
•	 We understand that most credit card ABS issuers currently provide disclosure
about the FICO credit score distribution of the underlying pool. Rather than
allowing the issuer to use a credit score that is not FICO, should we require
that all issuers provide disclosure of FICO credit scores by distributional
groups? Are there other types of credit scores with respect to which we
should require disclosure by distributional group? If so, what would be the
appropriate distributional groups?

189 


•	 Should we provide a definition for delinquency? If so, how should it be
defined?
•	 Are the distributional groups for adjustable rate index appropriate? Are there
any other commonly used indexes that we should specify?
•	 Would issuers already have information about all of the states in order to
prepare the groupings for the top 10 states by aggregate account balance and

Please tell us why or why not.
•	 Are the proposed informational requirements appropriate for the grouped
account data (i.e., aggregate credit limit, aggregate account balance, number
of accounts, weighted average APR and weighted average net APR)? What
other types of information should issuers provide about their accounts in the
grouped account data format?
•	 Are credit cards ever securitized using structures that are not master trusts? If
so, should we require asset-level disclosure for non-master trust credit card
ABS issuers because the pool would be fixed and contain a smaller number of
accounts?

Asset Data File and XML

We are proposing to require asset-level information302 and grouped account data
(with respect to credit cards) related to an offering and ongoing periodic reporting be
filed on EDGAR in XML (eXtensible Markup Language) as an asset data file. By
proposing to require the asset-level data file in XML, a machine-readable language, we

302

As defined in proposed Schedule L [17 CFR 229.1111A] and Schedule L-D [17 CFR 229.1121A].

190 


anticipate that users of the data will be able to download the disclosure directly into
spreadsheets and databases, analyze it using commercial off-the-shelf software, or use it
within their own models in other software formats.
Asset-backed filers currently are required to file their registration statements,
current and periodic reports in ASCII (American Standard Code for Information
Interchange) or HTML (HyperText Markup Language).303 Our electronic filing system
also uses other formats for reporting related to corporate issuers, such as XML, to process
reports of beneficial ownership of equity securities on Forms 3, 4, and 5 under Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act, 304 and a form of XML known as XBRL to provide financial
statement data.305 As we explained in the XBRL Adopting Release, electronic formats

such as HTML and XML are open standards306 that define or “tag” data using standard
definitions. The tags establish a consistent structure of identity and context. This
consistent structure can be recognized and processed by a variety of different software
applications. In the case of HTML, the standardized tags enable Web browsers to present
Web sites’ embedded text and information in a predictable format so that they are human
readable. In the case of XML and XBRL, software applications, such as databases,
financial reporting systems, and spreadsheets recognize and process tagged information.
For asset-backed issuers, we believe that XML is the appropriate format to provide

Rule 301 under Regulation S-T [17 CFR 232.301] requires electronic filings to comply with the
EDGAR Filer Manual, and Section 5.1 of the Filer Manual requires that electronic filings be in ASCII or

adjunct to their official filings in ASCII or HTML unofficial PDF copies of filed documents.

standardized asset data disclosure. As we discuss earlier, some issuers already file loan
schedules on EDGAR as part of the pooling and servicing exhibit or a free writing
prospectus. However, the data is currently filed on EDGAR in ASCII or HTML, both of
which do not facilitate data analysis. XBRL allows issuers to capture the rich complexity
of financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.307 In contrast, the
proposed asset data file will present relatively simpler characteristics of the underlying
loan, obligor, underwriting criteria and collateral among other items that are well suited
for XML. We are proposing XML, rather than XBRL, because there are many
commercial products that can be used with XML including parsers that would allow
investors to insert data into a relational database for analysis, data extensions available in
XBRL are not applicable to this data set, the nature of the repetitive data lends itself to an
XML format and the schema could be easily updated.
We understand that most of this information is data collected at the time of
origination and ongoing performance information is maintained on servicing systems.
The CRE Finance Council (formerly CMSA) is already moving towards requiring issuers
to provide its Investor Reporting Package in XML.308 The use of XML will enable
investors to use standard commercial off-the-shelf software for analysis of underlying

loan-level data.309 This software may also permit investors to insert the data into a
database to identify individual data points. Then the data can be aggregated, compared
and analyzed. Data can also be subjected to further waterfall analysis. Since XML data
can be visualized in internet browsers, investors can develop a style sheet if viewing data
is important in their analysis.310
Prior to requiring the asset data file in XML, technical specifications that describe
the schema, which would include each data point described in Schedules L, L-D, and CC
are necessary.311 Also, extension data would not be permitted in the asset-level data file
because we believe it would defeat the purpose of standardizing the data elements.312
Instead, we are proposing to include a limited number of “blank” data tags in our XML
schema. In order to reduce complexity for users we are proposing to limit the number to
ten blank data tags. These blank data tags would give issuers the ability to present
additional asset-level data not required by proposed Schedule L or L-D. For example, if
servicers were required to comply with a new modification program, and related tagged
information would be material to investors, it may be appropriate to use a blank data tag.
Additionally, if an issuer registers ABS backed by an asset class that has not been
previously registered, so that no asset class specific schema exists at the time, that issuer
could use the available blank data tags. Issuers, however, would need to provide a
narrative explanation of the definitions or formulas for the additional tagged data and file

it as another exhibit on Form 8-K or Form 10-D.313 Issuers could also file other
explanatory disclosure regarding the asset-level data in an exhibit, if necessary.314
a)

Filing the Asset Data File and EDGAR

We are proposing that the new asset data file in XML be filed as an exhibit to the
filings. Therefore, we are proposing changes to Item 601 of Regulation S-K, Rules 11,
201, and 202 of Regulation S-T and Form 8-K to accommodate the filing of asset data
files. We are proposing to define the XML file required by proposed Schedules L, L-D,
and CC as an “Asset Data File” in Regulation S-T and make corresponding changes to
Rule 101 of Regulation S-T mandating electronic submission.315 As we discuss above,
we are proposing that the asset data be filed as an exhibit to the appropriate Form 8-K (in
the case of an offering) or to the appropriate Form 10-D (in the case of a periodic
distribution report).316 As we note above, we realize that registrants may want to provide
investors with additional asset information not defined in Schedule L or L-D, or that
issuers of new asset classes may want to provide investors with other data points. As
such, we also propose an additional exhibit, an asset related document, for registrants to
disclose the definitions or formulas for the additional data points or to provide further
explanatory disclosure regarding the asset data file.317
We also propose to add Item 6.06 to Form 8-K. Regardless of whether the issuer
is registering the offering on Form SF-1 or SF-3, we are proposing to require all asset
data files to be filed on Form 8-K so that investors may easily locate asset-level data

disclosure on EDGAR. The proposed item explains that the asset data file must be filed
with the Form 8-K on the same date of the filing of a prospectus filed in accordance with
proposed Rule 424(h), a final prospectus meeting the requirements of section 10(a) of the
Securities Act filed in accordance with Rule 424(b), and a report filed in accordance with
Item 6.05 of Form 8-K (Securities Act Updating Disclosure). The proposed item also
requires that any asset data related document318 be filed at the same time the asset data
file is filed on EDGAR. We have also included proposed instructions to Item 6.06 to
refer to the proposed exhibit requirements in Item 601 of Regulation S-K and to the
incorporation by reference item requirements on proposed Forms SF-1 and SF-3.
b)

Hardship Exemptions

We are proposing a self-executing temporary hardship exemption for filing the
asset data file; however, we are proposing to exclude the asset data file from the
continuing hardship exemption. Rule 201 under Regulation S-T generally provides for a
temporary hardship exemption from electronic submission of information, without staff
or Commission action, when a filer experiences unanticipated technical difficulties that
prevent timely preparation and submission of an electronic filing. The temporary
hardship exemption permits the filer to initially submit the information in paper, but
requires the filer to submit a confirming electronic copy of the information within six
business days of filing the information in paper. 319 Failure to file the confirming
electronic copy by the end of that period results in short form ineligibility. Because the
disclosure requirement for an asset data file is inherently electronic, and the information
would not be useful if provided in paper, we are proposing an alternative approach to the
318

Id.

195 


temporary hardship exemption. Under our proposal, if the registrant experiences
unanticipated technical difficulties preventing the timely preparation and submission of
an asset data file, a registrant will still be considered timely if the asset data is posted on a
Web site on the same day it was due to be filed on EDGAR, the Web site address is
specified in the required exhibit, a legend is provided in the appropriate exhibit claiming
the hardship exemption, and the asset data file is filed on EDGAR within six business
days. We believe that posting the asset data on a Web site is preferable to a paper filing
in this circumstance. By requiring the asset data file posting on a Web site, investors
would have access to the disclosures and would not experience any delay in accessing the
asset data in XML format. Consistent with our current temporary accommodation rules,
under our proposed accommodation, the asset data file must be filed on EDGAR within
six business days and failure to file the asset data file within that period will result in the
loss of Form SF-3 eligibility. We believe it is important that the disclosure be filed with
the Commission on EDGAR to preserve continuous access to the information. As we
discuss below, our experience with the temporary accommodation for static pool
disclosure raises concern that access to the information on Web sites may be lost due to
the distress in the market or the fact that certain sponsors may cease operations.320
We are proposing to exclude asset data files from the continuing hardship
exemption under Rule 202 of Regulation S-T. Rule 202 generally allows a registrant to
apply for a continuing hardship if it cannot file all or part of a filing without undue
burden or expense. In contrast to the self-executing temporary hardship exemption

319

See Rule 201 of Regulation S-T [17 CFR 232.201].

320

See Section III.E.4.

196

process, a filer may obtain a continuing hardship exemption only by submitting a written
application, upon which the Commission staff must then act under delegated authority.
We do not believe a continuing hardship exemption is appropriate with respect to
an asset data file because we believe the proposed asset data file would be an integral part
of the prospectus and periodic performance reporting. We believe that, for ABS issuers,
the information in machine readable format is generally already collected and stored on a
servicer’s systems. Therefore, we do not believe it would be appropriate for issuers to
receive a continuing hardship exemption for the asset data file. We believe investors
should receive all of the disclosures specified in Schedules L and L-D and in a format
that will allow them to effectively utilize the information.321
c)

Technical Specifications

We are proposing to add detailed information on submitting an asset data file to
the EDGAR Technical Specification. As discussed above and as specified in the
Appendix to this release, there are several data points contained in Schedule L and
Schedule L-D that require issuers to provide a coded response. These codes would be
enumerated in the EDGAR Technical Specification. We expect that the technical
specifications would be available as early as possible prior to any required compliance
date. The manual would be published on the SEC’s Web site on the “Information for
EDGAR Filers” webpage.322

321

We recognize that our rules provide for a continuing hardship for registrants required to file
Interactive Data Files in XBRL. Interactive Data Files in XBRL contain data that is already disclosed in
the prospectus. In contrast, asset data files will contain disclosure that is not otherwise provided in the
related prospectus or report. See the XBRL Adopting Release.

Request for Comment
•	 Is it appropriate to require the asset data file in XML format? Does XML
format most easily facilitate the analysis of the securities and their underlying
assets for all market participants?
•	 In what format do issuers currently provide asset data information to investors
(as may be required, for example, under transaction agreements)? Do any
market participants currently provide asset data in accordance with a technical
specification or schema commonly used across a particular asset class? If so,
would our data points cause divergence from current practice? Please tell us
which specific proposed data points would be of concern and why. How can
we address those concerns? Is another format preferable, such as XBRL?
•	 Should we adopt the proposed changes to Item 601 of Regulation S-K,
Regulation S-T and Form 8-K?
•	 We are not proposing changes to Rule 305 of Regulation S-T to exempt the
asset data file from the restrictions on the number of characters per line that
may be filed on EDGAR in order to prevent issuers from filing the tagged data
in one continuous string. We believe the restriction on the number of
characters per line will help preparers and validators with their review of the
asset data file. Should we exempt the asset data file from Rule 305 of
Regulation S-T? If so, why?
•	 Are the proposed blank data tags appropriate? Is ten blank data tags the
appropriate number? Should the number be more or less? Would more blank
data tags create undue complexity for investors? Are there other ways we

198 


could provide for additional disclosure and have that disclosure be
standardized?
•	 Is the proposed temporary hardship exemption, including the required Web
site posting, appropriate? Should we allow a continuing hardship exemption
for filing the asset data file on EDGAR?
•	 We propose to use existing submission types in order to enable filers to attach
the asset data file as an exhibit. Tagging specifications that explain the
requirements of the XML schema would be included in the proposed technical
specifications. Are there other specifications that would be helpful that should
be provided in the EDGAR Filer Manual for asset data files that are not
currently included in other Technical Specifications? Please be specific in
your response.
•	 Should we provide a transition period prior to the required compliance date
that would allow filers to submit only test filings? Please be specific in your
response.
•	 The technical specification will outline in detail the required format of each
data point. Are there other validation checks that need to be in place to check
compliance? Please be specific in your response.

Pool-Level Information

By at least 2006, an increasing number of residential mortgages were generated in
the United States through loosened underwriting standards.323 In addition, originators
engaged in practices such as the bundling of non-traditional features into a single loan
323

The PWG March 2008 Report states that there was a dramatic weakening of underwriting
standards for U.S. subprime mortgages, beginning in late 2004 and extending into early 2007.

199 


product, known as “risk-layering.”324 The loosening of underwriting standards for
subprime mortgages has been cited as one of the principal causes of the recent turmoil in
the financial markets.325 In addition, compliance with the disclosure guidelines set forth
in our rules by some ABS issuers was not consistent.
Item 1111 of Regulation AB326 outlines several aspects of the pool that the
prospectus disclosure should cover.327 Item 1111 explicitly provides that exceptions to
origination criteria must be disclosed.328 We are proposing revisions to the pool-level
disclosure requirements in Item 1111 to further detail and clarify the type of disclosure
that is required to be provided for ABS offerings with respect to deviations from
disclosed underwriting standards. We also are proposing revisions related to the
originator’s diligence with respect to the information used to underwrite the assets, and
the remedies related to the pool assets that are available to investors that are provided in
underlying transaction agreements.

324

For a discussion of the increase in looser underwriting standards and risk layering practices, see,
e.g., Speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke At the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago’s
43rd Annual Conference on Bank Structure and Competition, Chicago, Illinois, available at
http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20070517a.htm; Report by the Global Joint
Initiative of Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, the American Securitization Forum, the

325

See The PWG March 2008 Report and The President’s Working Group, Progress Update on
March Policy Statement on Financial Market Developments, October 2008 (both reports noting that the
breakdown in underwriting standards for subprime mortgages as one of a list of principal causes of the
turmoil in the financial markets).
326

17 CFR 229.1111.

327

Item 1111 requires this disclosure on the assets, as material, whether or not the sponsor is also the
originator of the assets or the sponsor acts as an aggregator or consolidator of loans.
328

Item 1111(a)(3) requires a description of the solicitation, credit-granting or underwriting criteria
used to originate or purchase the pool assets, including, to the extent known, any changes in such criteria
and the extent to which policies and criteria are or could be overridden.

200 


First, we are proposing to amend Item 1111 to specify that disclosure regarding
the underwriting of assets that deviate from the disclosed origination standards must be
accompanied by specific data about the amount and characteristics of those assets that did
not meet the disclosed standards. To the extent that disclosure is provided regarding
compensating or other factors, if any, that were used to determine that the assets should
be included in the pool, despite not having met the disclosed underwriting standards, the
issuer would be required to specify the factors that were used and provide data on the
amount of assets in the pool that are represented as meeting those factors. Thus, data
would be required on the number of assets not meeting the underwriting criteria, the
number of such assets meeting particular compensating factors (if those factors are
disclosed), and the number of such assets not meeting such factors.
Second, we are proposing to require disclosure of what steps were undertaken by
the originator or originators to verify the information used in the solicitation, creditgranting or underwriting of the pool assets.329 Such information could include how the
originator documented various criteria such as, for example, debt-to-income ratios, loan­
to-value ratios or documentation type.330 We believe that this information should provide
helpful insight to investors regarding the underwriting of the pool assets.
Third, we are proposing amendments that would elicit more disclosure regarding
certain remedies available to investors in the transaction agreements. As discussed
above, most transaction agreements for ABS offerings contain representations and
329

See proposed revision to Item 1111(a).

330

The requirement under this proposal to disclose these steps should not be confused with the due
diligence defense against liability under Securities Act Section 11 (15 U.S.C. 77k) or the reasonable care
defense against liability under Securities Act Section 12(a)(2) (15 U.S.C. 77l(a)(2)). Instead, our proposed
amendment is designed to provide disclosure of information relating to the originator’s diligence to verify
the information used to underwrite the assets.

201 


warranties by the sponsor or originator about the quality, legal compliance and other
aspects of the pool assets. Typically, investors are entitled to recover through provisions
that require the repurchase of assets from the securitized pool by an obligated party. The
obligated party, typically the sponsor, would be obligated to repurchase the assets if the
representations and warranties have been breached. Item 1111(e) currently requires
summary disclosure regarding any representations and warranties made concerning the
pool assets by the sponsor, transferor, originator or other party to the transaction. The
item also requires disclosure of the remedies available if those representations and
warranties are breached, such as repurchase obligations. In addition, many transaction
agreements may provide for the repurchase of assets if the servicer has modified the
terms of an asset in the pool in a manner or to a degree that is prohibited under the
transaction agreements.
To help ensure that issuers provide meaningful disclosure in an area that has
become increasingly important for investors, we are proposing to replace Item 1108(c)(6)
with a more detailed and specific disclosure requirement in Item 1111.331 Item
1108(c)(6) currently requires disclosure to the extent material of any ability of the
servicer to waive or modify any terms, fees, penalties or payments on the assets and the
effect of any such ability, if material, on the potential cash flows from the assets. Our
proposal would replace Item 1108(c)(6) with a more detailed and specific disclosure
requirement in Item 1111. As proposed to be revised, Item 1111 would require a
description of the provisions in the transaction agreements governing modification of the

331

17 CFR 229.1108(c)(6).

202 


assets. We also are proposing to require disclosure regarding how modification may
affect cash flows from the assets or to the securities.
We also are proposing to require disclosure of whether or not a fraud
representation is included among the representations and warranties. Under the proposal,
the issuer would provide disclosure regarding whether a representation was made that no
fraud has taken place in connection with the origination of the assets on the part of the
originator or any party involved in the origination of the assets. We believe that it is
important to highlight this representation to investors, although we do not intend to
diminish the importance of other representations and warranties regarding the pool assets
that are provided.
Existing Item 1111 requires the disclosure of statistical information about the
pool in appropriate distributional groups or incremental ranges, among other things. The
rule also requires that statistical information for each group or range also should be
presented by material variables, such as average balance, weighted average coupon,
average age and remaining term, average loan-to-value or similar ratio, and weighted
average standardized credit score or other applicable measure of obligor credit quality.332
Because we believe that existing Item 1111 calls for statistical information in the
prospectus regarding an originator’s “risk-layering practices” that demonstrates the
manner and extent to which multiple non-traditional features of a loan are bundled into
one instrument, issuers should already be providing this disclosure.333 However, to the
extent there is ambiguity or lack of clarity in Item 1111 regarding what disclosure with
respect to risk-layering practices is required to be provided, we request comment on how
332

See also Section III.B.5.a. of the 2004 ABS Adopting Release.

203 


to make changes to Regulation AB to require the appropriate disclosure on risk-layering
practices.
Request for Comment
•	 Above we noted that disclosure regarding risk layering practices is required
under existing Item 1111. Is the application of Item 1111 to risk-layering
practices clear? Is there some way we can make Item 1111 clearer in that
regard? Should we revise any other rule in that regard?
•	 Should we require, as proposed, disclosure on assets that deviate from the
disclosed origination underwriting standards that must be accompanied by
disclosure of specific data about the amount and characteristics of those assets
that did not meet the standards? Should we require, as proposed, that if
disclosure is provided regarding compensating or other factors, if any, that
were used to determine that the assets should be included in the pool, despite
not having met the disclosed underwriting standards, disclosure is required
that would describe those factors and provide data on the amount of assets in
the pool that are represented as meeting those factors and the amount of assets
that do not meet those factors? Should we require any other disclosure with
respect to exceptions to or deviations from disclosed origination underwriting
standards? Should issuers be required to identify each exception loan by a
loan identifier that will be disclosed in the proposed Schedule L discussed
above?

333

We believe that this would include risks relating to the geographic location of the property.

204

•	 Are the proposed amendments relating to disclosure concerning
representations and warranties and modification provisions in the transaction
agreements appropriate?
•	 Are there other kinds of disclosure relating to representations and warranties
and enforcement mechanisms of those representations and warranties that
should be required to be provided? If so, please describe in detail.
•	 A repurchase obligation also may be imposed under other circumstances.334 .
Should the rules require prospectus disclosure of other types of repurchase
obligations?
•	 We are proposing to require disclosure of whether the transaction agreements
include a fraud representation. Is this appropriate? Are there other types of
representations and warranties that the prospectus should highlight?
•	 Should we delete Item 1108(c)(6), as proposed? Is there any type of
disclosure that will be omitted if we delete Item 1108(c)(6) in lieu of our
proposed revision to Item 1111?
B.

Flow of Funds

1.

Waterfall Computer Program

We are proposing to require that most ABS issuers file a computer program that
gives effect to the flow of funds, or “waterfall,” provisions of the transaction. We are
proposing that the computer program be filed on EDGAR in the form of downloadable
source code in Python. Python, as we will discuss further below, is an open source

334

For example, there may be obligation to repurchase a loan that goes into payment default within a
short period of time after closing.

205 


interpreted programming language.335 Under our proposal, an investor would be able to
download the source code for the waterfall computer program and run the program on the
investor’s own computer (properly configured with a Python interpreter).336 The
waterfall computer program would be required to allow use of the asset data files that we
are also proposing today.337 This proposed requirement is designed to make it easier for
an investor to conduct a thorough investment analysis of the ABS offering at the time of
its initial investment decision. In addition, an investor may monitor ongoing performance
of purchased ABS by updating its investment analysis from time to time to reflect
updated asset performance.338 In this way, market participants would be able to conduct
their own evaluations of ABS and may be less dependent on the analysis of third parties
such as credit rating agencies.
The waterfall is a critical component of an ABS. Currently investors receive only
a textual description of this information in the prospectus, which may make it difficult for
them to perform a rigorous quantitative analysis of the ABS.339 In a typical ABS, the

335

Open source means that the source code is available to all users (as opposed to proprietary source
code that can be viewed only by the owner/developers of the program). An interpreted programming
language is one that requires an interpreter in the target computer for program execution. See Section
III.B.1.d. below.
336

An interpreter is a programming language translator that translates and runs the program at the
same time. It converts one program statement into machine language, executes it, and then proceeds to the
next statement. This differs from regular executable programs that are presented to the computer as binarycoded instructions. Interpreted programs remain in the source language the programmer wrote it in, which
is human readable text.
337

See Sections III.A.1., III.A.2. and III.A.3 above.

338

Updated asset performance data would be required under proposed Item 1121(d) and (e) for
Regulation AB. See Sections III.A.2. and III.A.3.
339

See Item 1113 of Regulation AB [17 CFR 229.1113]. The waterfall computer program is a
necessary but not a sufficient tool for carrying out quantitative analysis of an ABS. We recognize that
investors will still have to build or acquire from a vendor other elements of a complete cash flow and
valuation model. However, requiring the issuer to supply the waterfall computer program should make the
investor’s task easier, and is an appropriate subject of a filing requirement as it consists of information that
is specific to the particular ABS being offered.

206 


waterfall governs the application of cash collected on pool assets. Using the waterfall,
cash collections are applied to distributions to the holders of various classes of ABS
backed by the pool assets. Depending on the level of prepayments, defaults and losses­
given-default340 that occur on the pool assets, the waterfall may redirect the application of
cash to or away from a particular class of securities; may allocate cash to a reserve
account or require the release of reserve account cash; 341 may change the allocation of
cash to the classes in an ABS transaction from sequential pay to pro rata pay, 342 and vice
versa; or may accelerate or defer the application of principal prepayments to a particular
tranche. As a result, the calculation of the probable amount and timing of cash
distributions to an investor on a particular ABS, an essential element of valuing or pricing
the security, can be complex.
Institutional sellers and buyers of ABS typically rely on computer simulation of
the results of applying the cash flows on the pool assets to the waterfall under different
interest rate, prepayment, default and loss-given-default assumptions to determine the
likely amount and timing of cash distributions on, and therefore the value of, the ABS. A
common approach to this task is to: (a) run many separate simulations, or projections, of
the cash flows for the pool assets (using randomly generated assumed interest rates,
prepayment speeds, default rates and loss-given-default rates – a simulation process
referred to as the Monte Carlo method); (b) pass these simulated cash flows through the
340

By losses-given-default we mean the amount of unrecovered principal on a defaulted asset after
realization of all amounts available.
341

A reserve account is a form of internal credit enhancement created to cover losses on the pool

assets.
342

Sequential pay means that from the inception of the transaction, a single designated class receives
all available principal payments until it is retired; only then does a second designated class begin to receive
principal; and so on. Pro rata pay means that all classes receive their proportionate shares of principal
payments during the life of the securities.

207 


waterfall structure of the ABS; and (c) observe the resulting cash flows for each separate
ABS tranche. To conduct this analysis, a market participant requires:
•	 loan-level information, or grouped account data, about the assets, including
such fields as their coupon rates, balances, loan-to-value ratios, maturity dates,
and the borrowers’ credit scores, among others;
•	 a computer program that calculates the contractual cash flows for each tranche
of the ABS based on the presumed cash flows of the underlying pool assets;
•	 additional computer models that generate inputs for the computer simulation
(such as interest rate, prepayment, loss and loss-given-default models); and
•	 a computer system that combines the three elements above into a model that
allows investors to calculate the values of ABS tranches based on their own
assumptions about the behavior of the underlying pool assets combined with
the waterfall of the ABS, and the current state and performance of the
underlying pool assets.
Without these tools, market participants must rely on third party vendors to provide
quantitative analysis of the asset-backed security343 or must rely on computational
materials provided by the issuer, without the opportunity to test the model or vary the
assumptions used by the issuer.344

343

Our proposed requirement to file the waterfall computer program is intended to have same
functionality as a “deal” in a “deal library” that has been coded or programmed from an authoritative
statement of the waterfall, such as a pooling and servicing agreement. Deal and deal library are terms used
by commercial vendors of quantitative valuation analysis services and their customers. The process of
coding or programming the waterfall for an ABS is referred to by vendors as “scripting” a deal.
344

Computational materials contain statistical data displaying for a particular class of asset-backed
securities the yield, average life, expected maturity, interest rate sensitivity, cash flow characteristics or
other such information under specified prepayment interest rate, loss or related scenarios. See Item 1101(a)
of Regulation AB [17 CFR 229.1101(a)] and Section III.C. of the 2004 ABS Adopting Release.

208 


The ABS issuer or the underwriter generally will have a computer model of the
waterfall. However, the issuer or underwriter currently has no obligation to share the
computer model with actual or potential ABS investors. Because prospective investors in
ABS typically do not have access to the ABS issuer’s computer models, under current
conditions, an investor must create its own computer program. It does this by taking the
priority of payment rules stated in the trust agreement, pooling and servicing agreement,
indenture, or other operative document for the ABS and described in the prospectus,
converting the English language statement of those provisions into one or more
algorithms, and then expressing the algorithms as computer code in a programming
language. As a practical matter, it is often not possible to complete these steps before
making an investment decision. This is particularly onerous for smaller institutional
investors, for whom it may not be feasible to acquire the financial and technological
expertise necessary to develop a computer program of the waterfall. Thus, investment
decisions with respect to ABS may be made without the benefit of the investor
performing its own quantitative valuation analysis. This may encourage undue reliance
on the determinations of credit rating agencies. Further, there is the possibility that some
investors will program the waterfall erroneously, leading to inaccurate ABS valuations.
We believe that the proposed requirement to file the waterfall computer program
would convey information to investors in a form that is both more accurate and more
useful to them for data analysis than a textual description of the waterfall. By running the
waterfall computer program in combination with other internally-developed or
commercially available vendor interest rate, prepayment, default and loss-given-default
models, cash flow engines, or computational services, investors should be able to

209 


promptly run cash flow simulations and generate present value estimates for ABS
tranches. An investor should also be able to more effectively monitor the ongoing
performance of the ABS by using the proposed updated asset-level performance
information to be filed with each periodic distribution report on Form 10-D.
a)

Proposed Disclosure Requirements

We are proposing to require, for offerings of asset-backed securities backed by
most asset classes, that issuers file the waterfall computer program in the form of
downloadable source code in the Python programming language.345 We define the
disclosure requirements of the waterfall computer program in proposed Item 1113(h)(1).
We are proposing that the waterfall computer program give effect to the priority of
payment provisions in the transaction agreements that determine the funds available for
payments or distributions to the holders of each class of securities,346 and each other
person or account entitled to payments or distributions, from the pool assets, pool cash
flows, credit enhancement or other support, and the timing and amount of such payments
or distributions.347
Under the proposed requirement, the filed source code, when downloaded and run
by an investor, must provide the user with the ability to programmatically input the user’s
own assumptions regarding the future performance and cash flows from the pool assets,
including but not limited to assumptions about future interest rates, default rates,
prepayment speeds, loss-given-default rates, and any other necessary assumptions

345

When we refer to a waterfall computer program for an asset-backed security, we refer to the whole
offering of asset-backed securities backed by a particular pool of assets; in other words, the deal, not to a
single class or tranche of the deal.
346

For this purpose, a subclass or tranche would be a separate class.

347

See proposed Item 1113(h)(1)(i) of Regulation AB.

210 


required to be described under Item 1113 of Regulation AB. The waterfall computer
program must also allow the use of the proposed asset-level data file that will be filed at
the time of the offering and on a periodic basis thereafter.348
We also propose to require that the waterfall computer program produce a
programmatic output, in machine-readable form, of all resulting cash flows associated
with the ABS, including the amount and timing of principal and interest payments
payable or distributable to a holder of each class of securities, and each other person or
account entitled to payments or distributions in connection with the securities, until the
final legal maturity date, as a function of the inputs into the waterfall computer program.
We are also proposing an instruction to the item requirement to make clear that
the provisions captured in the waterfall computer program should include, but not be
limited to, provisions that set forth the priorities of payments or distributions (and any
contingencies affecting such priorities) to the holders of each class of securities and any
other persons or accounts entitled to payments or distributions, and any related provisions
necessary to determine the quantitative results of such provisions (including certain
provisions required to be described in Item 1113 of Regulation AB). Item 1113 of
Regulation AB currently requires disclosure of a plain English description of the structure
of the waterfall and we believe that the provisions given effect in the proposed waterfall
computer program should largely be the same as those provisions required to be
described under current Item 1113. But in the event that there are any provisions that are
not required to be described under Item 1113 because they are not material to the
description of the waterfall in the prospectus, but those provisions are used to determine

348

See proposed Items 1111A and 1121A of Regulation AB.

211 


the value of the inputs to the waterfall computer program, the waterfall computer
program would be required to give effect to the provisions by which those inputs are
determined.
In addition, we are proposing to require that the issuer file as part of the waterfall
computer program a sample expected output for each ABS tranche based on sample
inputs provided by the issuer. By using the sample inputs to run the program, the
investor will be able to confirm that the program is working correctly by matching the
actual outputs produced against the sample expected output provided by the issuer.349
Lastly, so that investors may easily locate the waterfall computer program, we are
proposing that the prospectus include a statement that the information provided in
response to proposed Item 1113(h) is provided as a downloadable source code in the
Python programming language filed on the SEC Web site. Issuers would also need to
disclose the CIK and file number of the related filing.
b)

Proposed Exemptions

We are proposing to exclude issuers of ABS backed by stranded costs from the
requirement to provide the waterfall computer program. As we discuss above, we are not
proposing to require such issuers to file an asset data file at the time of the offering or on
a periodic basis,350 and therefore, we do not believe investors would have the necessary
inputs to run the waterfall computer program.

349

We note that the sample inputs and outputs we propose to require are intended to confirm that the
program is functioning, and would not serve to make any representations about the actual expected
performance of the deal.
350

See Sections III.A.1.b.iii. and III.A.2.b.

212 


c)

When the Waterfall Computer Program Would be Required

Like the asset data file, the waterfall computer program would be an integral part
of the prospectus so that issuers would be required to provide the waterfall computer
program at the time of filing the Rule 424(h) prospectus as of the date of the filing.
Similarly, as a prospectus requirement, the waterfall computer program would be filed
with the final prospectus under Rule 424(b) as of the date of the filing.
In addition, we are proposing to require credit card master trusts to report changes
to the waterfall computer program on Form 8-K and file the updated waterfall computer
program as an exhibit to the report. Furthermore, we are also proposing to require that
registrants provide updated Schedule CC grouped account data at the same time the
updated waterfall computer program is filed so that investors may evaluate the effect of
the change in the flow of funds using updated underlying pool information.
d)

Filing the Waterfall Computer Program and Python

We are proposing that the waterfall computer program be filed as an exhibit in
accordance with Item 6.07 of Form 8-K. The Form 8-K would then also be incorporated
by reference into the registration statement. Therefore, we are proposing changes to Item
601 of Regulation S-K, Rules 101, 201, 202 and 305 of Regulation S-T, new Rule 314 of
Regulation S-T and changes to Form 8-K to accommodate the filing of the waterfall
computer program. We realize that registrants may want to provide more program
functionality in the waterfall computer program than would be required by proposed Item
1113(h). For example, additional program functionality could include features designed
to allow interoperability with other ABS quantitative analysis software. As such, we also

213 


propose to permit the filing of an additional exhibit, a waterfall computer program related
document, for registrants to disclose the additional program functionality.
We are proposing new Rule 314 of Regulation S-T to require that the waterfall
computer program be written in the Python programming language and be filed as source
code that is able to be downloaded and run on a local computer properly configured with
a Python interpreter. As we note above, Python is an open source interpreted
programming language. Open source means that the source code is available to all users
(as opposed to proprietary source code that can be viewed only by the owner or developer
of the program). An interpreted language is a programming language that requires an
interpreter in the target computer for program execution.351 We prohibit the inclusion of
executable code in electronic submissions on EDGAR because of the computer security
risks posed by accepting executable code for filing.352 Executable code results from
separately compiling a computer program prior to running it.353 Since Python is an
interpreted language that does not need to be compiled prior to running it, executable
code would not need to be published on EDGAR, and we would not require EDGAR to
establish facilities to host, run, or operate any computer program. The waterfall computer
program source code would be required to be submitted as tagged XML data. The

351

An interpreter is a programming language translator that translates and runs the program at the
same time. It converts one program statement into machine language, executes it, and then proceeds to the
next statement. This differs from regular executable programs that are presented to the computer as binarycoded instructions. Interpreted programs remain in the source language the programmer wrote it in, which
is human readable text.
352

See Securities Act Rule 106 to Regulation S-T [17 CFR 239.106].

353

We define executable code in Rule 11 of Regulation S-T [17 CFR 239.11] as instructions to a
computer to carry out operations that use features beyond the viewer's, reader's, or Internet browser's native
ability to interpret and display HTML, PDF, and static graphic files. Such code may be in binary (machine
language) or in script form. Executable code includes disruptive code.

214 


EDGAR Technical Specification would contain detailed information on how to file the
waterfall computer program.
Additionally, we are proposing a change to Rule 305 of Regulation S-T to exempt
the waterfall computer program from number and character per line requirements on
EDGAR.
e)

Hardship Exemptions

We are proposing a self-executing temporary hardship exemption for filing the
waterfall computer program; however, we are proposing to exclude the waterfall
computer program from the continuing hardship exemption under Rule 202 of Regulation
S-T.354 We are proposing the same approach to the temporary hardship exemption for the
waterfall computer program as we propose for the asset-level data file. Because the
disclosure requirement for the waterfall computer program is inherently electronic, the
information would not be useful if provided on paper. Under our proposal, if the
registrant experiences unanticipated technical difficulties preventing the timely
preparation and submission of the waterfall computer program, a registrant would be
considered to have made a timely filing if the waterfall computer program is posted on a
Web site on the same day it was due to be filed on EDGAR, the Web site address is
specified in the required exhibit, a legend is provided in the appropriate exhibit claiming
the hardship exemption, and the waterfall computer program is filed on EDGAR within
six business days.
We are also proposing to exclude the waterfall computer program from the
continuing hardship exemption under Rule 202 of Regulation S-T. This is the same

354

We explain the hardship exemptions in further detail above in Section III.A.4.b.

215 


approach for the waterfall computer program that we are proposing for asset-level data
files. We do not believe a continuing hardship exemption is appropriate with respect to
the waterfall computer program because, as we discuss above, the waterfall computer
program will be an integral part of the prospectus. Therefore, we do not believe it would
be appropriate for issuers to receive a continuing hardship exemption for the waterfall
computer program.
Request for Comment
•	 Is it appropriate for us to require most ABS issuers to file the waterfall
computer program? Is there an alternative form of required information filing
that would be more useful to investors, subject to the limitation that
executable code may not be filed on EDGAR?
•	 Should we require, as proposed, that the Rule 424(h) filing include the
waterfall computer program?
•	 Does access to the waterfall computer program decrease the amount of time
needed to analyze the information in a prospectus? If we adopt the waterfall
computer program filing requirement, would less time be needed for investors
to review transaction-specific information? If so, how much time would be
needed after the waterfall computer program is filed? Four days? Two days?
Does analysis of the waterfall computer program require more time than what
we allow as proposed so that we should increase the time period for the Rule
424(h) filing?
•	 Is it appropriate to require issuers to submit the waterfall computer program in
a single programming language, such as Python, to give investors the benefit

216 


of a standardized process? If so, is Python the best choice or are there other
open source programming language alternatives (such as PERL) that would be
better suited for these purposes?
•	 Should more than one programming language be allowed? If so, which ones
and why?
•	 Should we restrict ourselves to only open source programming languages or
allow fully commercial or partly-commercial languages (such as C-Sharp or
Java) to be used? If so, what factors should be considered?
•	 Are there other requirements we should impose on the possible computer
programming languages that are used to satisfy this requirement, other than
that such languages be open source and interpreted?
•	 Under our proposal, issuers would be required to file the waterfall computer
program in the form of downloadable source code on EDGAR. Prior to filing,
the code would not be tested by the Commission. Would downloading the
code onto a local computer give rise to any significant risks for investors? If
so, please identify those risks and what steps or measures we should take to
address the risks, if any.
•	 Are the proposed input and output requirements for the waterfall computer
program appropriate? If not, what type of output and tests should be required
for the waterfall computer program? Should the outputs of the waterfall
computer program be specified in detail by rule, or broadly defined to afford
flexibility to ABS issuers?

217 


•	 Should we require comments in the code that explain what each line does? Is
this necessary given the narrative disclosure of the waterfall in the prospectus?
If it is appropriate, are there any specific explanations we should require?
•	 Is it appropriate to exempt issuers of ABS backed by stranded costs from the
requirement to provide a waterfall computer program? If not, what types of
inputs would be necessary to run the waterfall computer program? How
would issuers obtain these inputs?
•	 Is our proposal to require credit card master trusts to report changes to the
waterfall computer program on Form 8-K and file the updated waterfall
computer program as an exhibit appropriate? Would the flow of funds, and
thus the waterfall computer program, change over time? If so, how and why
would it change? Should we require the waterfall computer program be filed
at any other time? Should we require it be filed with each Form 10-D?
•	 Is the proposed requirement to provide the waterfall computer program with
the proposed Rule 424(h) prospectus as of the date of filing and a final
prospectus under Rule 424(b) as of the date of filing appropriate? Should the
waterfall computer program be required to be filed at any other time? If so,
please tell us why. As we discuss above in Section II.B.1.a., under our
proposal, for material changes in information, other than offering price, which
would include material changes to the waterfall computer program, a new
Rule 424(h) filing would be required as well as a new five business-day
waiting period.

218 


•	 Should we adopt the proposed changes to Item 601 of Regulation S-K and to
Regulation S-T?
•	 Is the proposed temporary hardship exemption appropriate? Should we allow
a continuing hardship exemption?
•	 We propose to use existing submission types in order to enable filers to attach
the proposed waterfall computer program as an exhibit. Specifications that
explain the requirements would be included in the EDGAR technical
specifications. Are there other specifications that would be helpful that should
be provided in the EDGAR Filer Manual for the waterfall computer program
that are not currently included in other technical specifications? Please be
specific in your response.
•	 Should we provide a transition period prior to the required compliance date
that would allow filers to submit only test filings? Please be specific in your
response.
•	 Is our proposal to permit the filing of an exhibit to disclose additional program
functionality appropriate?
•	 Are there any impediments that issuers would face if they are required to file
the waterfall computer program on EDGAR?
2.

Presentation of the Narrative Description of the Waterfall

The information relating to the structure of the transaction pursuant to Item 1113
of Regulation AB may be used by investors to model the cash flows for the securities. In
order to facilitate this modeling, we believe that such information should be easily
accessible and in a useable format. We are proposing to revise Item 1100 of Regulation

219 


AB355 to require that the information detailing the flow of funds for the transaction (and
related definitions of terms) be included in one location in the prospectus. We note that
the waterfall computer program and the narrative description of the waterfall would need
to be accurate and the accuracy of one would not compensate for inaccuracies in the
other.
Request for Comment
•	 Is our proposal to require that the narrative description of the waterfall be
presented in one location appropriate? Are there any reasons not to require this?
C.

Transaction Parties

1.

Identification of Originator

Existing Item 1110(a) of Regulation AB requires identification of originators
apart from the sponsor or its affiliates only if the originator has originated, or expects to
originate, 10% of more of the pool assets. The existing rule does not require
identification of a non-affiliate that has originated less than 10% of the pool assets. In
situations where much of the pool assets have been purchased from originators other than
the sponsor, identification of originators is not required if each originator has originated
less than 10% of the pool assets. This can result in very little, if any information about
originators if there are multiple originators with less than 10% that make up a major part
of the securitization. We believe that where the sponsor securitizes assets of a group of
originators that are not affiliated with the sponsor, more disclosure regarding the
originator of the assets is needed than is required under the current rules. Therefore, we
are proposing that an originator would be required to be identified even if such originator

355

17 CFR 229.1100.

220 


has originated less than 10% of the pool assets if the cumulative amount of originated
assets by parties other than the sponsor (or its affiliates) comprises more than 10% of the
total pool assets.
Request for Comment
•	 Should we amend Item 1110 to require identification of originators even if no
single originator comprises 10% or more of the pool? Is it appropriate to
require identification of originators, as proposed, if the cumulative amount of
originated assets by parties other than the sponsor (or its affiliates) comprises
10% or more of the total pool asset?
•	 Are the proposed revised thresholds for originator identification appropriate?
Should they be different (e.g., 5%)?
2.

Obligation to Repurchase Assets

We are proposing expanded disclosure regarding the obligations to repurchase
assets. As discussed above, many transaction agreements underlying a securitization
provide for the repurchase of pool assets by an obligated party upon breach of a
representation and warranty related to the pool assets.356 This obligated party could be
the originator of the assets or, most typically, the sponsor of the securities – who could
also function as the originator, depending on the transaction. Depending on the
application of Section 15(d) to the issuer, ongoing reports filed by the issuer may provide

356

As discussed in Section II.B.3.b. above, with respect to shelf eligibility, we are proposing that the
pooling and servicing agreement contain a provision requiring the obligated party (i.e.,
representing/warranting party) to furnish an opinion or certificate from a qualified independent third party
to the trustee that any loans that the trustee has asserted breached a representation or warranty and were not
repurchased or replaced by the obligated party did not violate the representations and warranties contained
in the pooling and servicing or other agreement. Neither this provision nor the proposed requirement
regarding the disclosure of the obligation to repurchase assets would impose requirements on the substance
of transaction agreements to include such repurchase obligations.

221 


some information regarding assets that have been repurchased from the pool by the
obligated party pursuant to transaction agreements.
a)

History of Asset Repurchases

We are proposing to amend Item 1104 and Item 1110 to require disclosure of the
amount, if material, of publicly securitized assets originated or sold by the sponsor or an
identified originator (as identified under the specifications detailed below) that were the
subject of a demand to repurchase or replace any of the assets for breach of the
representation and warranties concerning the pool assets in the last three years pursuant
to the transaction agreements.357 We are proposing to require that such disclosure be
provided on a pool by pool basis. The percentage of that amount that was not then
repurchased or replaced by the obligated party (i.e., the sponsor and/or originator) also
would be disclosed. Of those assets that were not then repurchased or replaced, we
propose to require disclosure whether an opinion of a third party not affiliated with the
obligated party had been furnished to the trustee that confirms that the assets did not
violate a representation or warranty. This enhanced information about the originator or
sponsor’s history with assets they have originated or sold into public securitization
vehicles should allow investors to better assess practices of the originator or the sponsor.
Under existing Item 1110(b), additional disclosure relating to an originator, such
as the originator’s experience in originating assets, is only required to be provided if the
originator has originated or is expected to originate 20% or more of the assets (“20%
originator”). This threshold for disclosure was adopted in 2004. Consistent with the

357

Although we are not proposing to require it, additional disclosure regarding the repurchase of
assets could be provided.

222 


existing threshold, the proposed disclosure requirement relating to the repurchase of
assets would only be required if the originator is a 20% originator.
b)	

Financial Information Regarding Party Obligated to Repurchase
Assets

In the events arising out of the financial crisis, the financial condition of the party
obligated to repurchase assets pursuant to the transaction agreements underlying an assetsecuritization became increasingly important to whether payments on asset-backed
securities would be made.358 Currently, there is no requirement for asset-backed issuers
to disclose the financial condition of an originator unless some other financial disclosure
threshold is also triggered such as the trigger for servicers.359 We believe that there are
situations where it is appropriate for financial information about certain obligated parties
to be provided to ABS investors.
We are proposing to amend Item 1104 and Item 1110(b) to require financial
information of the party obligated to repurchase a pool asset for breach of a
representation and warranty pursuant to the transaction agreements. These requirements
would be similar to the requirement regarding financial information of certain servicers.
Under the proposal, information regarding the financial condition of a 20% originator
would be required if there is a material risk that the financial condition could have a
material impact on the origination of the originator’s assets in the pool or on its ability to
358

See testimony of Joseph Mason, “Transparency in Accounting: Proposed Changes to Accounting
for Off-Balance Sheet Entities,” Before the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and
Urban Affairs Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and Investment (Sept. 18, 2008) (noting that
representations and warranties have become a mechanism for subsidizing pool performance, so that no
asset- or mortgage-backed security investor experiences losses – until the seller fails and is no longer able
to support the pool).
359

For example, information regarding the servicer's financial condition is required under Item 1112
of Regulation AB to the extent that there is a material risk that the effect on one or more aspects of
servicing resulting from such financial condition could have a material impact on pool performance or
performance of the asset-backed securities.

223 


comply with provisions relating to the repurchase obligations for those assets.
Information regarding the sponsor’s financial condition similarly would be required to
the extent that there is a material risk that the financial condition could have a material
impact on its ability to comply with the provisions relating to the repurchase obligations
for those assets or otherwise materially impact the pool.
Request for Comment
•	 Is the proposed amendment requiring disclosure regarding amount of assets
that were not repurchased appropriate? Should we also require, as proposed,
disclosure of the percentage of that amount that was not then repurchased or
replaced by the sponsor or 20% originator? Should we also, as proposed,
require disclosure whether an opinion of a third party not affiliated with the
obligated party had been furnished to the trustee that confirms that the assets
that were not repurchased or replaced did not violate a representation or
warranty?
•	 Would requiring this disclosure, as proposed, have the unintended
consequence of incentivizing sponsors (who may want to put an asset back to
an originator) or trustees to demand that originators repurchase assets in
situations where that might not be required under the transaction agreements?
If so, how should we address this?
•	 Should we also require disclosure of the percentage of assets that have been
repurchased by a 20% originator or the sponsor?

224 


•	 Should disclosure be required regarding demands to repurchase in the last
three years, as proposed? Should the timeframe be different (e.g., one year,
two years, four years, or five years)?
•	 Are there parties other than 20% originators or sponsors that may have a
repurchase obligation under the transaction agreements for breach of the
representations and warranties? If so, should similar disclosure about these
parties be required?
•	 With regard to the requirement to disclose the financial condition of
originators and sponsors, rather than add disclosure requirements to Item 1104
and Item 1110, should we expand the definition of significant obligor to
incorporate the obligated party that is required to repurchase assets for breach
of a representation or warranty? How should we revise Item 1112 for this
purpose?
•	 Are the proposed amendments relating to disclosure of the financial condition
of the obligated party appropriate? Should we specify further when disclosure
of the financial condition would be required such as a certain level of financial
concentration? If so, what should that level be? Should we require financial
information about 20% originators and sponsors for other circumstances?
Should we require financial information for 20% originators and sponsors for
all securitizations?
•	 Should our disclosure requirements be consistent with existing thresholds (i.e.,
when the originator has originated 20% or more of the assets) for when
disclosure relating to an originator is required? Should we instead require

225 


disclosure of the proposed items for any originator required to be identified?
Should we require disclosure of the proposed items for originators of more
than ten percent of the assets?
•	 Are there other situations where we should require financial information? For
instance, should we always require disclosure of financial information of all
servicers and all sponsors? If so, should we require audited financial
statements?
3.

Economic Interest in the Transaction

As described in Section III.B.3.a. above, as a condition to shelf eligibility, we are
proposing that the sponsor retain an economic interest in the transaction. Item
1103(a)(3)(i) of Regulation AB360 currently requires disclosure of the classes of securities
offered by the prospectus and any class of securities issued in the same transaction or
residual or equity interests in the transaction that are not being offered by the prospectus.
We believe that information regarding the sponsor’s, a servicer’s361 or a 20%
originator’s continuing interest in the pool assets is important to ABS investors, and we
are proposing to expand our requirements in that regard. Specifically, we are proposing to
revise Items 1104, 1108 and 1110 to require disclosure regarding the sponsor’s, a
servicer’s or a 20% originator’s interest retained in the transaction, including amount and
nature of that interest.362 Unlike current Item 1104, which requires a description of the

360

17 CFR 229.1103(a)(3)(i).

361

Servicers will sometimes hold an interest in tranches or second liens, and investors have expressed
concern relating to those interests. See, e.g., comment letter from the California Public Employees’
Retirement System on the FDIC Securitization Proposal, available at
http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/federal/2010/10comAD55.html.
362

For example, if the originator has retained a portion of each tranche of the securitization, then
disclosure regarding each amount retained for each tranche would be required.

226 


sponsor’s material roles and responsibilities in the securitization, the new disclosure
requirements would further specify that disclosure relating to the interest retained in the
transaction would be required. The information would be required for both shelf and
other offerings. If any sponsor is retaining an interest pursuant to the shelf eligibility
requirements, as proposed above,363 the interest and its amount and scope would need to
be clearly delineated in the prospectus that is contained in the registration statement.364 If
the offering is being registered on Form SF-1, we are proposing to require that the issuer
provide clear disclosure that the sponsor is not required by law to retain any interest in
the securities and may sell any interest initially retained at any time.
Request for Comment
•	 Is our proposed disclosure requirement relating to retained economic interest
appropriate? Is there any additional information that would aid investors’
analysis?
•	 Should we instead require disclosure of whether the sponsor has retained any
interest in the securitization?
•	 Should we require, as proposed, disclosure that the sponsor is not required by
law to retain any risk in the securities and may sell any interest initially
retained at any time for any offering registered on Form SF-1?
4.

Servicer

The definition of servicer in Item 1108 is a principles-based definition. An entity
falls within the definition of servicer if it is responsible for the management or collection
of the pool assets or making allocations or distributions to holders, regardless of the

entity’s title. Item 1108(b)(2) of Regulation AB365 requires a detailed discussion in the
prospectus of the servicer’s experience in, and procedures for, the servicing function it
will perform in the current transaction for assets of the type included in the current
transaction.366 This item also requires disclosure of information or factors related to the
servicer that may be material to an analysis of the servicing of the assets.
While we are not proposing any changes to Item 1108(b)(2) at this time, the staff
believes that application of this requirement has not been consistent among issuers, and
therefore we believe it is appropriate to emphasize how this requirement applies. Item
1122 requires that the servicer assess its compliance with specified criteria and that a
registered public accounting firm issue an attestation report on the party’s assessment of
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. The reports and the compliance
statement are required to be filed as an exhibit to Form 10-K. We believe that Item
1108(b)(2) requires disclosure of any material instances of noncompliance noted in the
assessment or attestation reports that are required by Item 1122 or the servicer
compliance statement that is required by Item 1123. In addition, the prospectus should
also provide disclosure of any steps taken to remedy the noncompliance disclosed and the
current status of those steps.
Request for Comment
•	 Are there any changes we should make to Item 1108(b)(2) to clarify what
disclosure should be included?

This information is also required by proposed General Instruction I.B.1(a) of Form SF-3. 


365

17 CFR 229.1108(b)(2). 


366

Item 1108 also requires a general discussion of the servicer’s experience in servicing assets of any


type.

228

•	 Item 1108(b)(4)367 requires information regarding the servicers’ financial
condition to the extent there is a material risk that the effect on one or more
aspects of servicing resulting from such financial condition could have a
material impact on pool performance or performance of the securities. Should
we revise this requirement?
•	 For example, should we require financial statements or other financial
information be provided with respect to the servicer in all asset-backed
transactions, regardless of whether there is a material risk that servicing
resulting from the financial condition could have a material impact on pool
performance or performance of the securities? If the servicing function is
divided among different unaffiliated parties, should disclosure of a servicer’s
financial statements depend on how much of the pool a servicer is servicing?
What about a special servicer? Should we take into account any other
considerations?
•	 If we revise our rules to specifically require servicer financial statements in all
cases, how should the rules apply if the registration statement or offering
prospectus contemplates a change in servicer soon after the offering is
complete? In that situation, which servicer’s financial statements should be
required – the original servicer, the new servicer, or both?368

367

17 CFR 229.1108(b)(4).

368

If there has been a change in servicer, Item 6.02 of Form 8-K requires that when a new servicer
contemplated by Item 1108(a)(2) of Regulation AB has been appointed, the date the event occurred and
circumstances surrounding the change of servicer must be provided. We remind issuers that a Form 8-K
containing such disclosure is required to be filed even where the offering prospectus has indicated that the
sponsor is only temporarily acting as the servicer and that a new servicer will replace the sponsor.

D.

Prospectus Summary

Under our current rules, a prospectus summary should briefly highlight the
material terms of the transaction, including an overview of the material characteristics of
the asset pool.369 However, we believe that summary disclosures in ABS prospectuses
currently may not adequately highlight the material characteristics, including material
risks, particular to the ABS being offered. Instead, the prospectuses often summarize
metrics that are common to all securitizations of a particular asset class. For instance,
under current practice, a prospectus summary related to an offering of securities backed
by residential mortgages typically only includes common metrics such as the number,
averages and ranges of common pool characteristics such as principal balances, interest
rates, credit scores and loan to value. Other material characteristics of pool assets,
however, typically are not highlighted, such as statistics regarding whether the loans in
the asset pool were originated under various underwriting or origination programs,
whether loans were underwritten as exceptions to the underwriting or origination
programs, or whether the loans in the pool have been modified. We believe these types
of statistics could be summarized by broad category on the basis of the underwriting
program, type of exception or modification, but historically, this type of information has
not been included.
We believe that the summary disclosures should be improved to include this
information, which is among the most significant for investors. Accordingly, we are
proposing a new instruction to Item 1103(a)(2) of Regulation AB370 to clarify the
summary disclosure requirements. Specifically, the proposed new provision would
369

See Item 1103 of Regulation AB.

230 


instruct issuers to provide statistical information regarding the types of underwriting or 

origination programs, exceptions to underwriting or origination criteria and, if applicable, 

modifications made to the pool assets after origination. 

Request for Comment

•	 Is our proposed instruction to require summary statistical information
regarding the types of underwriting or origination programs, exceptions to
underwriting and origination criteria and, if applicable, modifications made to
the pool assets after origination appropriate?
•	 Should we specify line item disclosure requirements for the summary section?
If so, are the pool characteristics identified in the proposed new instruction
appropriate? Would those characteristics be common across all asset classes,
or only apply to a specific asset class?
•	 Are there other features of the transaction that we should specify must be
disclosed in the summary?
E.

Static Pool Information

When we adopted Regulation AB, we included the requirement to disclose static
pool information with respect to prior securitized pools of the sponsor for the same asset
class in the prospectus that is part of the registration statement if the information is
material to the transaction. Static pool information indicates how the performance of
groups, or “static pools” of assets, such as those originated at different intervals, are
performing over time. By presenting comparisons between originations at similar points
in the assets’ lives, static pool data allows detection of patterns that may not be evident

370

17 CFR 229.1103(a)(2).

231

from overall portfolio numbers and thus may reveal a more informative picture of
material elements of portfolio performance and risk. In the 2004 ABS Adopting Release,
we noted that the development of static pool information was an increasingly valuable
tool in analyzing performance.371
Under Rule 312 of Regulation S-T, asset-backed issuers are permitted, but not
required, to post the static pool information required by Item 1105 on an Internet Web
site, rather than file the information with the prospectus on EDGAR. As long as certain
conditions are met, the information provided on the Web site pursuant to Rule 312 is
deemed to be part of the prospectus included in the registration statement. Rule 312 was
adopted in 2004 as a temporary accommodation in response to comments received
concerning the significant amount of statistical information that would be difficult to file
electronically on EDGAR as it existed at the time and the difficulty for investors to use
the information in that format. At the time, we were persuaded by commenters that a
web-based approach might allow for the provision of the required information in a more
efficient, dynamic and useful format than was currently feasible on the EDGAR
system.372 At the same time, we explained that we continued to believe that, at some
point, for future transactions, the information should also be submitted to the
Commission in some fashion, provided this would not result in investors not receiving the
information in the form they have requested. We also explained that we were directing
our staff to consult with the EDGAR contractor, EDGAR filing agents, issuers, investors
and other market participants to consider how static pool information could be filed with

the Commission in a cost-effective manner without undue burden or expense while still
allowing issuers to provide the information in a desirable format.373
On October 19, 2009, we proposed to extend the temporary filing accommodation
until December 31, 2010 so that the staff could continue to explore whether a filing
mechanism for static pool information on EDGAR would be feasible.374 In that release
we solicited comments about current practice and potential alternatives for providing
static pool disclosure that we will discuss below. On December 15, 2009, we adopted the
proposed one-year extension.375
We now are proposing changes to Item 1105 seeking to provide greater
transparency and comparability with respect to static pool disclosure. We also are
proposing to repeal our temporary Web site accommodation for static pool disclosure.
These proposed changes to Rule 312 would allow issuers to make filings on EDGAR in

Disclosure Required

We are proposing revisions to the static pool disclosure requirement designed to
increase clarity, transparency and comparability. Some of our proposals apply to all
issuers, and some apply only to amortizing asset pools and not revolving asset master

trusts. Since adoption of Regulation AB, we have observed that static pool information
provided by asset-backed issuers may vary greatly within the same asset class.
Variations exist not only with regard to the type or categories of information disclosed,
but also with the manner in which it is disclosed. As a result, static pool information
between different sponsors has not necessarily been comparable, which reduces its value
to investors. For example, some issuers of residential mortgage-backed securities
provide a one-page graphical static pool presentation, while others present several
hundred pages of distribution data for prior securitized pools on their Web site, making it
difficult to determine which prior securitizations were most similar to the securities being
offered.
Static pool information is required to the extent the information is material. In the
2004 ABS Adopting Release, we emphasized that in all instances information is required
only if material for the particular asset class, sponsor or asset pool involved; disclosure
for groups or factors that would not be material is not required. We continue to believe
that it is appropriate not to exclude particular asset classes or transactions from the
requirements in their entirety. While keeping this general approach, we believe there are
ways, nevertheless, to make the static pool information more comparable and facilitate
analysis of the information. By requiring issuers to file this information on EDGAR, we
do not want to discourage issuers from providing granular data on their Web sites for
investors to analyze. We believe that clear summaries and explanation complement the
statistical data and allow investors to more easily evaluate material information. To
address these concerns, we are proposing to amend our static pool disclosure requirement
in several ways to enhance clarity, transparency and comparability. Our proposals cover

234 


static pool information for all classes of assets and specific requirements for amortizing
trusts.
First, we are proposing to amend Item 1105 to require narrative disclosure
describing the static pool information presented. For example, for a pool of RMBS, the
disclosure would note the number of assets, types of mortgages (e.g., conventional, home
equity, Alt-A, etc.) and the number of loans that were exceptions to standardized
underwriting criteria. We believe appropriate explanatory information should introduce
the characteristics of the static pool. A brief snapshot of the static pool presented would
provide investors with context in which to evaluate the information without sophisticated
data analysis tools. We do not intend for this requirement to cause issuers to repeat the
underlying static pool disclosure; rather the requirement would serve as a clear and brief
introduction of the disclosure.
Second, we are proposing to require that issuers describe the methodology used in
determining or calculating the characteristics and describe any terms or abbreviations
used. Such a requirement would help investors ascertain whether calculations of terms
are comparable across issuers. For example, a description of the method used to calculate
the loan-to-value ratio could assist investors compare this information across different
issuers.
Third, we are proposing to require a description of how the assets in the static
pool differ from the pool assets underlying the securities being offered. Again, we
believe that a clear and concise description of these differences would provide investors
with context in which to evaluate the information without sophisticated data analysis
tools.

235 


Finally, if an issuer does not include static pool information or includes disclosure
that is intended to serve as alternative static pool information, we are proposing to amend
Item 1105(c) to require additional disclosure. As we explained in the 2004 ABS
Adopting Release, we did not adopt line-item disclosure requirements for static pool
information; however, we noted there may be instances where failure to provide static
pool information would make the data that is presented misleading.377 It is not always
obvious why one issuer does not provide static pool information or provides alternative
disclosure in lieu of such information, while another issuer within the same asset classes
does provide the information. Under our proposal, issuers would be required to explain
why they have not included static pool disclosure or why they have provided alternative
information. We do not intend for issuers to explain why each of their static pool
disclosure points differ from their competitors. However, we believe basic information
about the issuer’s approach to static pool disclosure would promote transparency and help
investors place the disclosure in context.
2.

Amortizing Asset Pools

We are proposing additional changes to the static pool disclosure requirements for
amortizing asset pools. While the staff has previously noted that the static pool
presentation should be governed by the general principles of materiality rather than a
specific requirement in Regulation AB,378 we are concerned that the inconsistency of
377

For example, for a pool with a material concentration of seasoned assets, disclosure of static pool
data about the pool itself may be necessary depending on whether such data would reveal a trend or pattern
concerning one or more elements of pool performance and risk that is material and not evident from data
relating to asset performance otherwise presented and such omission makes the information presented
misleading. See, e.g., Securities Act Rule 408; Securities Act Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 17(a); Exchange
Act Section 10(b); Exchange Act Rule 10b-5; and Exchange Act Rule 12b-20.
378

Item 1105 states that static pool information, including static pool information regarding
delinquencies, is required unless it is not material. As a result, the presentation of static pool information is
governed by general principles of materiality and the requirements of Item 1105 and not the requirements

236 


presentation for delinquencies across issuers within the same asset class has resulted in a
lack of clarity and comparability. Accordingly, we are proposing to add an instruction to
Item 1105(a)(3)(ii) to require the static pool information related to delinquencies and
losses be presented in accordance with the guidelines outlined in Item 1100(b) for
amortizing asset pools. Item 1100(b) requires that information be presented in a certain
manner – for example, it requires that information regarding delinquency be presented in
30-day increments through the point that assets are written off or charged off as
uncollectable. Because information regarding delinquencies and losses, such as number
of accounts, dollar amount and percentage of pool, should already be collected in order to
report under other Regulation AB item requirements,379 we believe it should not be
overly burdensome for issuers to provide this information, and we believe that static pool
disclosure would be improved with this consistent approach.
We also are proposing to amend Item 1105(a)(3)(iv) to require graphical
presentation of delinquency, losses and prepayments for amortizing asset pools. We
believe many asset-backed issuers already provide graphical illustrations of their static
pool data. Depending on the volume and the type of data provided, the static pool data
can be difficult to analyze without the use of sophisticated data analysis tools. Static pool
information is important for analyzing trends within a sponsor’s program by comparing
originations at similar points in the asset’s lives. In the 2004 ABS Adopting Release, we
encouraged issuers to present information in tables or graphs if doing so would aid in the
understanding of the data, such as in the sections describing the transfer of the assets,

of Item 1100(b). Regulation AB Interpretation No. 5.03 in SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual

379

Item 1111(c) of Regulation AB would require presentation of delinquency in accordance with
Item 1100(b).

237

flow of funds, servicing responsibilities, pool asset composition, and periodic
performance information including delinquencies.380 Static pool disclosure has emerged
as another disclosure area where graphical presentation appears to be important for an
investor’s understanding of the overall disclosure. Presentation of the data in this fashion
better allows the detection of patterns that may not be evident from overall portfolio
numbers and may reveal a more informative picture of material elements of portfolio
performance and risk. Given the wide range of information provided by sponsors of the
same asset class, we believe that graphical presentation will provide a more useful
snapshot of the underlying granular information. We are proposing to require
delinquency, loss and prepayments as specific line item requirements because we believe
those are material characteristics applicable across all asset classes and structures and
would promote transparency and comparability across issuances by the same sponsor and
across sponsors. Although not required by our proposal, we also encourage graphical
presentation of any other material terms.
3.

Revolving Asset Master Trusts

Other than our proposals discussed above intended to apply to all issuers of asset
classes and structures, we are not proposing specific changes to the static pool disclosure
framework for revolving asset master trusts. However, we would like to highlight two
areas concerning static pool data and these issuers. First, a practice has developed among
revolving asset master trust issuers to aggregate the static pool data in tables or a

380

See Items 1100(b), 1107(h), 1108(a)(1), 1111, 1113(a)(2) and 1121(a) of Regulation AB. [17 CFR
229.1100(b), 1107(h), 1108(a)(1), 1111, 1113(a)(2) and 1121(a)]

238 


graphical illustration. We believe this approach facilitates investor understanding and we
encourage issuers to continue this practice.
Second, as we discuss above, we propose changes to the way static pool
delinquency information would be reported for amortizing asset pools. For revolving
master asset trusts, however, our rules provide a different approach for presenting static
pool delinquency disclosure.381 Commenters on the 2004 ABS Proposing Release argued
there could be even more concerns about the “static” nature of the pool for these
transaction structures due to changes in the master trust revolving asset pool over time
and the relationship between the sponsor’s retained portfolio or other securitized pools
previously established by the sponsor and the master trust asset pool.382 In response to
these comments, additional incremental performance information based on asset age, or
origination year, for the revolving asset pool in the master trust was adopted as an
appropriate starting point. As we discussed in the 2004 ABS Adopting Release, this
starting point allows an investor to distinguish performance of newer accounts
comprising the master trust pool from those of more seasoned accounts.383 Because the
static pool disclosure requirement for master trusts is different from amortizing pools, we
are not proposing changes to require that static pool information for revolving asset
master trusts be provided in accordance with Item 1100(b) of Regulation AB.
Furthermore, if our proposed amendments to Item 1121(b)(9) are adopted, all issuers,
including revolving master trusts, would have to present delinquency and loss
information in accordance with Item 1100(b) to satisfy the proposed periodic reporting

381

17 CFR 229.1105(b).


382

See, e.g., comment letter from ASF. 


383

See Section III.B.4.a.ii. of the 2004 ABS Adopting Release. 


239 


requirement.384 Therefore, we believe that investors would receive continuing
performance data on the master trust pool, similar to the static pool data provided to
investors in amortizing asset pools, because revolving asset master trust registrants would
continuously report delinquency, prepayment and loss information on the pool assets
through periodic reporting on Form 10-D.
Request for Comment
•	 Should we adopt the changes to Item 1105 for all types of issuers (instead of only
amortizing asset pools, as proposed) to require narrative disclosure of the static
pool information presented, require the methodology used in determining or
calculating the characteristics, and terms, and a description of how the assets in
the static pool differ from the pool assets underlying the securities being offered?
Would these changes help investors evaluate static pool data?
•	 Should we require all issuers to provide static pool data, whether or not material?
•	 Should static pool delinquency and loss information for amortizing asset pools be
required to be presented in accordance with the standards in Item 1100(b)? If not,
why not? Consistent with 1100(b), should delinquencies be presented through
charge-off or some other shorter period of time?
•	 We are proposing to require graphical presentation of delinquency, losses and
prepayments for amortizing asset pools. Is this appropriate? Should we also
require graphical presentation for other specific characteristics? Should we
require graphical presentation of static pool information for revolving asset master
trusts?

384

See our proposal to revise Item 1121(b)(9) discussed in Section V.A.

240 


•	 Should we require that static pool delinquency and loss information for revolving
asset master trusts be presented in accordance with the standards in Item 1100(b)?
If so, please also explain why the same information would not be reported by the
registrant on a periodic basis on Form 10-D.
•	 Should static pool data be required in an offering if there is an ongoing reporting
requirement of asset-level data applicable to other pools of the sponsor of the
same asset class? Would static pool data be informative even if there is an
ongoing duty to report? How would we address issuers registered on Form SF-1
that are not required to provide ongoing information?
•	 Should revolving asset master trusts continue to use a different starting point for
their static pool disclosure? Should we consider any other changes to the static
pool requirement for revolving asset master trusts? If so, why? Are there other
starting points more appropriate for other asset classes or structures? Should we
require asset specific static pool data?
•	 Should we specify that issuers of ABS backed by credit cards and charge cards
need to provide static pool disclosure of delinquencies, monthly payment rates
and losses by both vintage origination year and by credit score?385 Would it be
useful for investors? Why or why not?
•	 Typically, ABS backed by dealer floorplan receivables are structured as revolving
asset master trusts. Some do not appear to present static pool disclosure for
revolving asset master trusts in the manner specified in Item 1105(b). Should we

385

See e.g., Appendix A, Attachment IV of the MetLife FDIC Letter.

241 


provide an alternative starting point for revolving asset master trusts backed by
dealer floorplans? If so, why?
•	 Are there other changes we should make to the static pool disclosure requirement
to make the information more useful and comparable across issuers?
4.

Filing Static Pool Data

We are proposing to require all static pool information be filed on EDGAR by
amending Rule 312 of Regulation S-T. We are also proposing to permit static pool
disclosure to be filed on EDGAR in PDF format as an official filing.386 As noted above,
currently Rule 312 permits but does not require an asset-backed issuer to post the static
pool information required by Item 1105 on an Internet Web site, rather than file the
information with the prospectus on EDGAR, if certain conditions are met. Since the
adoption of Rule 312 in December 2004, technological advances and expanded use of the
internet have enabled the Commission to adopt additional rules incorporating electronic
communications. The Commission continues to recognize that, in certain circumstances
and under certain conditions, the Internet can present a cost-effective alternative or
supplement to traditional disclosure methods.387
As discussed above, we extended Rule 312 until December 31, 2010 so that the
staff could continue to explore whether a filing mechanism for static pool information on
386

Currently, filers may submit documents on EDGAR in PDF format, however such documents are
unofficial copies. See Rule 104 of Regulation S-T [17 CFR 232.104].
387

See, e.g., Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, Release No. 34-55146 (Jan. 22, 2007) [72 FR
4148] (adopting release for voluntary E-Proxy rules) and Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, Release
No. 34-52926 (Dec. 8, 2005) [70 FR 74598] (proposing release for voluntary E-Proxy rules). See also

Investment Companies, Release No. 33-8998 (Jan. 13, 2009) [74 FR 4546] at Section III.A.4.c (adopting
Item 11(g)(2) of Form N-1A under the Investment Company Act of 1940 which allows exchange-traded
funds to provide premium/discount information on a Web site rather than in a prospectus or annual report)
and SectionVI.B.1 of the Offering Reform Release (adopting “access equals delivery” model for final
prospectus delivery).

242 


EDGAR would be feasible. We received three comment letters to the Static Pool
Extension Proposing Release that addressed the proposed extension.388 Two commenters
supported the extension. One of these commenters expressed a strong preference among
both its issuer and investor members for web-based presentation of static pool
information due to its efficiency, utility and effectiveness and the current lack of an
adequate filing alternative.389 The other commenter expressed its belief that the
accommodation has been highly successful and of great value to investors.390 A third
commenter that did not support the extension believed that the Commission should
require structured disclosure using an industry standard computer language.391
For the reasons discussed below, we continue to believe it is preferable to have
the disclosure filed with the Commission on EDGAR, and we are proposing to permit as
an alternative to ASCII or HTML that the static pool information could be filed as a PDF.
Filing on EDGAR would preserve continuous access to the information if a Web site is
not maintained, for example, due to distress in the market or if the sponsor ceases
operations.392

See letter from Paul Wilkinson.

392

Rule 312 of Regulation S-T [17 CFR 232.312] currently requires that the static pool information
remain posted on an unrestricted Web site free of charge for a period of not less than five years. The
registrant has to retain all versions of the information provided on the Web site for a period of not less than
five years. The corresponding undertaking makes clear that information provided on the Web site pursuant
to Rule 312 is deemed to be part of the prospectus included in the registration statement. As we indicated
in the 2004 ABS Adopting Release, if the conditions of Rule 312 are satisfied, then the information will be
deemed to be part of the prospectus included in the registration statement and thus subject to all liability
provisions applicable to prospectuses and registration statements, including Section 11 of the Securities
Act.Section III.B.4.b. of the 2004 ABS Adopting Release.

243 


In addition, filing the disclosure on EDGAR will ensure that the data provided at
the time of each offering is preserved. Some issuers have used the same Web site to
centralize static pool data as well as ongoing performance data for their prior securitized
pools. In the case of static pool data, updating without indicating or preserving data
delivered at the time of each offering makes it difficult to determine what material was
part of the prospectus.393 While we do not want to discourage issuers from providing
updated information, we believe it is important to be able to identify which information
was provided at the time of the offering. Requiring filing on EDGAR would address that
concern.
We also note that most of the static pool information posted on the Web sites has
been provided in PDF format. In response to the Regulation AB Proposing Release,
commenters argued that a Web site-based approach could provide greater dynamic
functionality and utility both for the ability of issuers to present the information and the
ability of investors to access and analyze the information, including interactive facilities
for organizing and viewing the information.394 While we encourage issuers to provide
the data on their Web sites so that investors may take advantage of those capabilities, we
believe it should be filed on EDGAR to centralize and preserve the disclosure provided at
the time of the offering. Instead, we are proposing to permit the information be filed on
EDGAR in PDF as an official filing. Providing the information on EDGAR also would
address the concern of providing a single place for investors to retrieve all information
for the offering.
393

When we adopted Rule 312, we attempted to address this concern by requiring the registrant to
indicate whether any changes or updates have been made.

244 


We received comment at the time of the Static Pool Extension release that much
of the information for prior securitized pools or the sponsor’s portfolio would be similar
from one transaction to the next, and a Web site would provide flexibility to allow the
information to be presented in one place for multiple prospectuses, therefore, reducing
the burdens of repeating the data for each prospectus.395 However, we believe our
proposal to require filing static pool disclosure on EDGAR will not pose a burden on
issuers because, as we noted above, most issuers already provide static pool disclosure as
PDF documents on their Web sites. And, as is the case today, our rules would allow
incorporation by reference of previously filed disclosure into the prospectus for the
related issuance.396 Therefore, we are proposing to revise Rule 312 to remove the
temporary accommodation set to expire on December 31, 2010 for asset-backed issuers
to post the static pool information required by Item 1105 on an Internet Web site under
conditions set forth in Regulation AB.
In addition, in lieu of providing the static pool information in the form of
prospectus or in the prospectus for the offering, we are proposing to allow issuers to file
the disclosure on Form 8-K and incorporate it by reference. In the prospectus, issuers
would need to identify the Form or report on which the static information was filed by
including the CIK number, file number and the date on which the static pool information
was filed. We believe that this accommodation would allow more flexibility for issuers

to provide static pool information and would allow users to easily search and locate static
pool disclosure on EDGAR. Such information would be filed with the Form 8-K on the
same date that the form of prospectus is required to be filed under proposed new Rule
424(h) and incorporated by reference into the prospectus. We are proposing to amend
Form 8-K and Item 601 to add a new item requirement that would identify filings made
to include static pool information.
Request for Comment
•	 Would our proposal to allow static pool data to be filed in PDF on EDGAR
accommodate the interests of market participants? Would another format be more
appropriate? What should we consider in adopting a format? What should we do
in the interim? What format would provide the easiest way for users to search
and find static pool on EDGAR?
•	 Could PDF documents be prepared in a way that would facilitate conversion of
data into a useable format? We solicit comment as to whether some other format
would be an appropriate method to file static pool data on EDGAR for all market
participants. Would the data need to be tagged? If so, what would be the
appropriate tagging?
•	 Are there any other changes we should consider making to Rule 312 of 

Regulation S-T?

•	 We are proposing to allow, but not require, registrants to file static pool
information on Form 8-K and incorporate it by reference into the prospectus, in
lieu of filing it in the prospectus. Is this accommodation appropriate? Should we
instead require that all static pool disclosure be filed in the prospectus?

Exhibit Filing Requirements

In the 2004 ABS Adopting Release, we stated that, consistent with Item 601 of
Regulation S-K, governing documents and material agreements for an ABS offering such
as the pooling and servicing agreement,397 the indenture and related documents must be
filed as an exhibit.398 Item 1100(f) of Regulation AB allows ABS issuers to file
agreements or other documents as exhibits on Form 8-K and, in the case of offerings on
Form S-3, incorporate the exhibits by reference instead of filing a post-effective
amendment. In the staff’s experience with the filing of these documents, ABS issuers
have delayed filing such material agreements with the Commission until several days or
even weeks after the offering of securities off of a shelf registration statement.
These transaction agreements and other documents provide important information
on the terms of the transactions, representations and warranties about the assets, servicing
terms, and many other rights that would be material to an investor. As noted above,
investors have expressed concerns regarding the timeliness of information in ABS
offerings, and we believe that the information in the exhibits is an important part of the
overall information package to investors. We are proposing to revise Item 1100(f) of
Regulation AB to explicitly state that the exhibits filed with respect to an ABS offering
registered on Form SF-3 must be on file and made part of the registration statement at the
latest by the date the final prospectus is required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424.399

397

We stated that the management or administration agreement for the issuing entity also must be
filed in addition to describing their material terms in the prospectus. See Section III.B.3.c of the 2004 ABS
Adopting Release.
398

See Sections III.A.3.b, III.B.3.c. and III.B.3.d of the 2004 ABS Adopting Release. Also, issuers
are reminded that any attachments or schedules to an exhibit which is required to be filed pursuant to Item
601 of Regulation S-K must also be filed with the Commission.

399

Finalized agreements at the time of the offering may be filed in preliminary form as provided by
Instruction 1 to Item 601 of Regulation S-K. The filing requirement for an exhibit (other than opinions and

247 


ABS shelf offerings were designed to mirror non-shelf offerings in terms of filing
exhibits and final prospectuses. All exhibits to Form S-1 must be filed by the time of
effectiveness. Consistent with these requirements, under our proposed amendments,
exhibits must be on file by the date of filing the final prospectus, upon which a new
effective date for the registration statement is triggered.400
Request for Comment
•	 Is our proposed amendment to Item 1100(f) appropriate? Is there any reason that
exhibits to the registration statement could not be filed by time the final
prospectus is required to be filed under Rule 424?
•	 Do investors need the complete exhibits sooner? Is it appropriate instead to
require filing at the time of filing the Rule 424(h) filing? Could issuers satisfy
such a requirement? Should a draft of each material agreement be required to be
filed at that time if the final agreement is not available then?
G.

Other Disclosure Requirements that Rely on Credit Ratings

Items 1112 and 1114 of Regulation AB require the disclosure of certain financial
information regarding significant obligors of an asset pool and significant credit
enhancement providers relating to a class of asset-backed securities. An instruction to
Item 1112(b) provides that no financial information regarding a significant obligor,
however, is required if the obligations of the significant obligor, as they relate to the pool

consents) may be satisfied by filing the final form of the document to be used; the final form must be
complete, except that prices, signatures and similar matters may be omitted. Such exhibits may not be
incorporated by reference into any subsequent filing made with the Commission. See Elimination of
Certain Pricing Amendments and Revision of Prospectus Filing Procedures, Release No. 33-6714 (June 5,
1987) [52 FR 21252].
400

We note that this filing date will be after the time of sale of the security for purposes of Rule 159
and Securities Act Section 12(a)(2). The documents should be fully described in the prospectus because

248 


assets, are backed by the full faith and credit of a foreign government and the pool assets
are securities that are rated investment grade by an NRSRO. 401 Item 1114 of Regulation
AB contains a similar instruction that relieves an issuer of the obligation to provide
financial information when the obligations of the credit enhancement provider are backed
by a foreign government and the enhancement provider has an investment grade rating.402
Under both Items 1112 and 1114, to the extent that pool assets are not investment grade
securities, information required by paragraph (5) of Schedule B of the Securities Act may
be provided in lieu of the required financial information.403
In the 2008 Proposing Release, we proposed to revise Item 1112 and Item 1114 of
Regulation AB to remove references to credit ratings.404 We proposed to revise the
instructions to these items so that exceptions based on investment grade ratings to the
requirements of Items 1112 and 1114 of Regulation AB would no longer apply, and
information required by paragraph (5) of Schedule B would be required in all situations
when the obligations of a significant obligor are backed by the full faith and credit of a
foreign government. We received one comment on the proposed change that supported
the amendments, although the commenter noted its general opposition to the 2008 shelf
eligibility proposals for ABS offerings.405

information conveyed to the investor after the time of sale will not be taken into account for purposes of
Section 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act. See Rule 159.

402	

Instruction 3 to Item 1114 [17 CFR 230.1114].

403	

Paragraph 5 of Schedule B requires disclosure of three years of the issuer’s receipts and
expenditures classified by purpose in such detail and form as the Commission prescribes.

249 


We are proposing again to eliminate the exceptions based on investment grade
ratings. We are not aware of any benchmark comparable to an investment grade rating
here, and we continue to believe the information would be readily available and therefore
the proposed change would not impose substantial costs or burdens to an ABS issuer.
We believe that these changes are consistent with our revisions to eliminate ratings from
the shelf eligibility criteria for asset-backed issuers.
Request for Comment
•	 Is it appropriate to require the information about foreign government issuers, even
if their securities are rated investment grade, as proposed? Is there a different
way to replace investment grade ratings in Items 1112 and 1114 of Regulation
AB?
•	 Would the proposed change impose undue burdens on issuers?
•	 Would the disclosure be useful to investors?
IV.

Definition of an Asset-Backed Security
As part of our effort to provide more timely and detailed disclosure regarding the

pool assets to investors, we are proposing revisions to the Regulation AB definition of an
asset-backed security. Currently, a security must meet the definition of an “asset-backed
security” under Regulation AB406 in order to utilize the disclosure requirements of
Regulation AB and be eligible for shelf registration on Form S-3.407 Prior to 2004, an
“asset-backed security” was defined only for purposes of Form S-3 eligibility. In 2004,
the Commission incorporated the basic definition of an “asset-backed security” from

406

See Item 1101(c) of Regulation AB. 


407

See General Instruction I.B.5 of Form S-3 and Item 1100 of Regulation AB. 


250 


Form S-3 into Regulation AB. This definition requires, among other things, that the
security be primarily serviced by the cash flows of a discrete pool of assets.408
In the 2004 ABS Adopting Release, we noted that the definition of “asset-backed
security” outlines the parameters for the types of securities that are appropriate for the
alternate disclosure and regulatory regime provided by Regulation AB.409 We also noted
that the further a security deviates from the core purpose of the definition, the more acute
the concerns, which include concerns regarding the sufficiency of disclosure to investors,
are that the security should not be treated in the same way as other securities that meet
the definition.410 If a security does not meet the definition under Regulation AB, the
offering may still be registered with the Commission on Form S-1. As noted in the 2004
ABS Adopting Release, the staff has worked with issuers offering structured securities
outside the Regulation AB definition of an asset-backed security to develop appropriate
disclosures under our regulations for such securities.411
A core principle of the Regulation AB definition of an asset-backed security is
that the security is backed by a discrete pool of assets that by their terms convert into
cash, with a general absence of active pool management. However, in response to
commenters and previous staff interpretation, we adopted certain exceptions to the
“discrete pool” requirement in the definition of asset-backed security to accommodate
master trusts, prefunding periods, and revolving periods.412 Based on our experience
with the definition, we are concerned that pools that are not sufficiently developed at the
408

See Item 1101(c).

251 


time of an offering to fit within the ABS disclosure regime may, nonetheless, qualify for
ABS treatment, which may result in investors not receiving appropriate information about
the securities being offered. 413 Consequently, we are proposing amendments to these
exceptions to address these concerns. We believe that our proposals would restrict
deviations from the discrete pool of assets requirements without substantially changing
market practice.414
First, we are proposing to carve back the availability of the exceptions to the
discrete pool requirement. We are proposing to amend the master trust exception for
securities that are not backed by assets that arise out of revolving accounts.415 Under the
existing requirement, securitizations that are not backed by such revolving account assets
– for example, mortgages – qualify for an exception from the discrete pool requirement
of the definition of an asset-backed security. As a result, additional assets that are nonrevolving can be added to the pool of assets backing all the securities issued by the
master trust in connection with subsequent offerings of securities. While we do not
believe that it is important to repeal the accommodations for revolving assets under
Regulation AB, we also do not believe that there is a similar need to accommodate an
exception to the discrete pool requirement for offerings backed by non-revolving assets.
In light of concerns, which we have noted above, about sufficient disclosure about the
pool assets, we are proposing to revise the definition of an asset-backed security to
restrict the use of Regulation AB for master trust issuers backed by non-revolving assets.
413

Issuers will also need to consider Rule 3a-7 under the Investment Company Act or other
applicable exclusions under the Act. The changes we propose today to the definition of ABS in Regulation
AB would not in and of themselves change the analysis under the Investment Company Act. As such,
securities that would not meet the Regulation AB definition of ABS may be registered on Form S-1.
414

See fn. 418, 420 and 423 below.

415

See discussion of issuers that utilize master trust structures in Section II.C. above.

252 


Under our proposed revision, if the master trust is not supported by assets arising out of
revolving accounts, the securitization would no longer qualify for the exception.416 We
believe that it is appropriate to carve back on the expansion of the definition of an assetbacked security that was provided in 2004417 so that investors have sufficient information
relating to the pool assets.418
Second, we are proposing to limit further the number of years for revolving
periods of non-revolving assets. The current provision allows the offering to contemplate
a revolving period where cash flows from the pool assets may be used to acquire
additional pool assets, provided, that for securities backed by non-revolving assets, the
revolving period does not extend for more than three years from the date of issuance of
the securities and the additional pool assets are of the same general character as the
original pool assets.419 We are proposing to reduce the permissible duration of the

416

Some stranded cost securitizations are set up as a series trust or a master trust. As explained in the
2004 ABS Adopting Release, series trusts do not meet the definition of an asset-backed security under Item
1101(c) of Regulation AB. Under our proposed change to the master trust exception, a stranded cost
securitization set up as master trust would not be able to issue securities using registration statements filed
on Forms SF-1 or SF-3. However, if a stranded cost securitization is structured as a stand alone trust, then
such securitization structure should meet the definition of an asset-backed security.
417

See 2004 ABS Adopting Release.

418

We are aware of only four issuers backed by non-revolving assets that utilize the master trust
structure. Some issuers of ABS backed by mortgages originated in the United Kingdom structured as
master trusts would not qualify for the exception from the definition of ABS, because the underlying
mortgages would not be revolving in nature. Under our proposal, such structures would still be able to
register transactions on Form S-1. Such sponsors would also be able to structure their ABS as stand-alone
trusts. See Fitch Ratings Report “Masters of the House – A Review of UK RMBS Master Trusts”, June 8,
2005 (noting that large prime mortgage lenders have preferred the master trust structure over the passthrough mechanism used by other UK RMBS issuers in, for example, buy-to-let and non-conforming
markets, as the master trust structure allows for larger transactions)]. See Jennifer Hughes, MBS Market
Reopens in Old Style, Financial Times, October 28, 2009 (noting that because new loans are added to the
existing collateral pool when new bonds are issued, the performance statistics of the older loans are diluted
by the new loans). See also Jennifer Hughes, Concern Over Mortgage Master Trusts, Financial Times,
October 28, 2009 (noting difficulties with analyzing master trusts because the pool of loans backing the
bonds is constantly changing).

See Item 1101(c)(3)(iii).

253 


revolving period from three years to one year.420 While we have not experienced
problems with the use of this feature to date, we believe that a one-year revolving period
limit would help to better ensure that investors have sufficient information about their
securities by limiting the amount of time that assets may be added to the pool.
Third, we are proposing to decrease the limit on the amount of prefunding
permitted by the prefunding exception to the discrete pool requirement. During
prefunding periods, pool assets may be added within a specified period of time after the
issuance of the asset-backed securities using a portion of the offering proceeds. Under
the existing requirement, the amount of prefunding may not exceed 50% of the offering
proceeds, or, in the case of master trusts, 50% of the aggregate principal balance of the
total asset pool whose cash flows support the asset-backed securities.421 We propose to
lower this ceiling to 10% of the offering proceeds or, for master trusts, 10% of the
aggregate principal balance of the total asset pool whose cash flows support the assetbacked securities.422 We believe that the combination of shortening the revolving period
and lowering the ceiling of prefunding, as proposed, should better align the offerings that
use these features with our goal of maintaining the integrity of the discrete pool
requirement in offerings that use these features, consistent with investor demand for more
meaningful asset-level data.423

420

We believe that currently the revolving period exception to the discrete pool requirement is not
widely used in standalone amortizing trust structures. Based on staff review, we believe only a few issuers
which have registered with the Commission have used a revolving period of more than one year.
421

Item 1101(c)(3)(ii).

422

A current report on Form 8-K would be required to be filed when additions to the pool are made,
even if contemplated in the registration statement, as proposed.
423

Based on staff review, we believe that use of prefunding accounts is generally limited to select
sponsors, approximately 25% or less of the principal balance or proceeds are set aside for prefunding and
the prefunding period generally extends for approximately one year.

254 


Requests for Comment
•	 Is the proposed revision relating to master trusts not backed by revolving account
assets appropriate? Are there any asset classes or types of ABS issuers that would
be excluded from the revised definition of an asset-backed security that should not
be?
•	 Is it appropriate for ABS structured as master trusts that are backed by nonrevolving accounts to register on S-1? How would existing and prospective
investors be able to analyze the pool if it is constantly changing? Please be
specific in your response.
•	 Is 10% the appropriate ceiling for the amount of permissible prefunding? Should
that amount be higher (e.g., 20%, 30%, 40%), lower (e.g., five percent), or
disallowed altogether under the definition of an asset-backed security? Under the
existing definition, the duration of the prefunding period is limited to one year
from the date of issuance of the asset-backed securities. Should the one-year
limitation be shortened?
•	 Is the one-year permissible length of the revolving period for non-revolving
assets, as proposed, the appropriate amount of time? Should the permissible
length be a different amount of time (e.g., two years)? Should any other
amendments be made to the allowance for revolving periods?
V.

Exchange Act Reporting Proposals
A.

Distribution Reports on Form 10-D

We are proposing to revise General Instruction C.3. of Exchange Act Form 10-D.
The instruction provides that if information required by an Item has been previously

255 


reported, the Form 10-D does not need to repeat the information.424 Because information
that is previously reported may relate to a different issuer from the issuer to which the
report relates, such information may be difficult to locate, and therefore, we believe a
clear reference to the location of the previously reported information should be provided
in the Form 10-D.425 We are proposing to amend Form 10-D to require disclosure of a
reference to the Central Index Key number, file number and date of the previously
reported information.
We also are proposing to add a new requirement to Item 1121 of Regulation AB
to address concerns about the activities of parties obligated to repurchase assets for
breach of a representation or warranty in declining trustee or investor demands to
repurchase assets from the pool for a possible breach of a representation or warranty.426
Under this proposed new item requirement, for the assets in the pool backing securities
covered by the distribution report, the report would be required to contain disclosure
relating to the amount of repurchase demands made of the obligated party during the
period covered by this report for the assets in the pool of securities covered by this
report.427 This new item requirement would require disclosure of any demands made of
the obligated party in the period covered by the report to repurchase the assets in the pool

424

The term “previously reported” is defined in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2 (17 CFR 240.12b-2).

425

For instance, in the case of master trusts, Item 3 of Form 10-D requires disclosure of information
related to the sales of securities backed by the same pool or issuing entity during the reporting period,
regardless of whether the transaction is registered. Because the information regarding registered offerings
of securities backed by the same pool would have been previously reported by the filing of a prospectus
pursuant to Rule 424, no additional report regarding the issuances would be required on Form 10-D. The
staff has observed, however, that because the information has been previously reported, no disclosure
appears under this item. Thus, it was unclear whether no disclosure was provided because no issuances
occurred, or because the information had been previously reported, and also it may not be clear to investors
or other market participants how to locate the information.
426

See proposed Item 6A in Part II of Form 10-D.

See Section II.B.3.b. above.

backing the securities due to a breach in the representations and warranties concerning
the pool assets as provided in the transaction agreements. This disclosure would include
the percentage of that amount that was not then repurchased or replaced by the originator.
Of those assets that were not then repurchased or replaced, we would require disclosure
whether an opinion of a third party not affiliated with the obligated party had been
furnished to the trustee that confirms that the assets did not violate a representation or
warranty.
In addition, we are proposing to reverse our position for delinquency presentation
in periodic reports. In the 2004 ABS Adopting Release, we stated that delinquency and
loss information for the Form 10-D reporting period, like the other listed items in Item
1121(a) of Regulation AB, is based on materiality, and not on Item 1100(b) of Regulation
AB.428 Item 1100(b) outlines the minimum requirements for presenting historical
delinquency and loss information, such as requiring delinquency experience be presented
in 30 or 31 day increments, through the point that assets are written-off or charged-off as
uncollectible.429 Therefore, consistent with our efforts to standardize the disclosure
across all ABS, we are proposing to add an instruction to Item 1121(a)(9) to provide
pool-level disclosure in periodic reports in accordance with Item 1100(b) of Regulation
AB.

428

See fn. 477 of the 2004 ABS Adopting Release.

429

See Item 1100(b)(1) of Regulation AB.

257 


Further, we are proposing to revise the cover page of the Form 10-D to include
the name and phone number of the person to contact in connection with the filing. This
information would assist the staff in its review of asset-backed filings.430
Request for Comment
•	 Should we amend, as proposed, Form 10-D to require disclosure of a
reference to the Central Index Key number, file number and date of the
previously reported information?
•	 Should we amend, as proposed, Item 1121 to require disclosure regarding the
amount of repurchase demands made of the obligated party during the period
covered by the report for the assets in the pool of securities covered by the
report? Should we require, as proposed, disclosure regarding the percentage
of those assets that were subject to a repurchase demand that were not
repurchased? Should we also require, as proposed, disclosure whether an
opinion of a third party not affiliated with the obligated party had been
furnished to the trustee that confirms that the assets that were not repurchased
or replaced did not violate a representation or warranty.
•	 Should we add, as proposed, an instruction to Item 1121(a)(9) to provide
pool-level disclosure in periodic reports in accordance with Item 1100(b) of
Regulation AB?
•	 Should we specify the format for reports on Form 10-D? Should we specify
line items that issuers must disclose in order to meet the requirements in
current Item 1121 of Regulation AB (e.g., disclosure of sources and uses of
430

Issuers are also encouraged to provide the name and phone number of the outside attorney or other
contact in accompanying correspondence to their reports on Form 10-K.

258 


monthly cash flows, changes in asset pool balance from the beginning to the
end of the reporting period)? For instance, in the case of a credit card master
trust, should we specify line item disclosure for changes in the assets of the
trust (e.g., beginning balance, amount of account additions, amount of
accounts withdrawn, amounts collected, gross charge-offs, and ending
balance)? 431
B.

Servicer’s Assessment of Compliance with Servicing Criteria

The Form 10-K report of an asset-backed issuer is required to contain, among
other things, an assessment of compliance with servicing criteria that is set forth in Item
1122 of Regulation AB432 by each party participating in the servicing function.433 The
servicer’s assessment is filed as an exhibit to the report, and the body of the Form 10-K
report must also contain disclosure regarding material instances of non-compliance with
servicing criteria.434 In order to provide enhanced information regarding instances of
non-compliance with servicing criteria with respect to the offering to which the report
relates, including information on steps taken to address non-compliance, we are
proposing to expand the disclosure required to be contained in the body of the Form 10­
K. We are also proposing to codify certain staff positions with respect to the servicer’s

431

See e.g., Appendix A, Attachment III. of the MetLife FDIC Letter.

432

17 CFR 229.1122.

433

Exchange Act Rules 13a-18(b) and 15d-18(b) [17 CFR 240.13a-18(b) and 17 CFR 240.15d-18(b)]
and Item 1122 of Regulation AB. Item 1122 of Regulation AB defines “a party participating in the
servicing function” as any entity (e.g., master servicer, primary servicers, trustees) that is performing
activities that address the criteria in paragraph (d) of this section, unless such entity’s activities relate only
to 5% or less of the pool assets. See Instruction 2 to Item 1122. For purposes of this discussion, we refer
to the party that is required to provide a servicer’s assessment as the “servicer.”
434

See Item 1122(c) of Regulation AB. Item 1122 requires an assessment of compliance with
servicing criteria exactly as set forth in Item 1122(d); the criteria cannot be modified. If the servicer’s
process differs from one or more of the criteria, then the servicer must disclose that it is not in compliance
with those criteria.

259 


assessment, as we believe codifying these positions will make them more transparent and
readily available to the public.
A particular servicer may provide servicing for several asset-backed issuers that
may not be related. As discussed in the 2004 ABS Adopting Release and in an
instruction to Item 1122, the servicer’s assessment is required to be made at the platform
level,435 which means the servicer’s assessment should be made with respect to all assetbacked securities transactions involving the asserting party that are backed by assets of
the type backing the asset-backed securities covered by the Form 10–K report.436
Typically, one servicer’s assessment relating to several issuers backed by the same type
of assets will be filed as an exhibit to each of the issuers’ Forms 10-K. Therefore, it may
not be clear whether the asset-backed securities covered in the Form 10-K report may
have been impacted by the material instance of non-compliance.
In order to elicit disclosure regarding the material instances of non-compliance
with respect to the particular securities to which the Form 10-K report relates, we are
proposing to require that, along with disclosure of material instances of noncompliance
with servicing criteria, the body of the annual report also disclose whether the identified

435

See Section III.D.7.c of the 2004 ABS Adopting Release. In contrast, the servicer’s compliance
statement under Item 1123 of Regulation AB which must be included in a Form 10-K report relates to the
specific asset pool for the securitization that is covered by the Form 10-K. Thus, an instance of non­
compliance that is not material to the servicer’s platform would still need to be disclosed in the servicer’s
compliance statement under Item 1123 if the instance of non-compliance is material to the servicing of the
specific asset pool covered by the report. Further, the issuer is required to disclose a known instance of
noncompliance that is material to the asset pool in its Exchange Act reports. See the Division of
Corporation Finance’s Manual of Publicly Available Interpretations on Regulation AB and Related Rules,
Interpretation 17.05.

436

See also Instruction 1 to Item 1122 (stating that if certain servicing criteria are not applicable to
the asserting party based on the activities it performs with respect to asset-backed securities transactions
taken as a whole involving such party and that are backed by the same asset type backing the class of assetbacked securities, the inapplicability of the criteria must be disclosed in that asserting party’s and the
related registered public accounting firm’s reports).

260 


instance of noncompliance involved the servicing of the assets backing the asset-backed
securities covered in the particular Form 10-K report.437
We are also proposing to require that the body of the annual report discuss any
steps taken to remedy a material instance of noncompliance previously identified by an
asserting party for its activities made on a platform level. This disclosure would be
required whether or not the instance of non-compliance involved the servicing of assets
backing the securities covered in the particular Form 10-K. We believe that if a material
instance of non-compliance exists at the platform level, investors should know whether
any steps have been taken to remedy the material instance of non-compliance.
We also are proposing to codify certain staff positions issued by the Division of
Corporation Finance relating to the servicer’s assessment requirement, with some
modification. First, we are proposing to codify a staff interpretation relating to
aggregation and conveyance of information between a servicer and another party (who
may also be a servicer for purposes of the servicer’s assessment requirement). In the
fulfillment of its duties as set forth in transaction agreements, a servicer will often
provide information to another party. Such information conveyed is generated by a
servicing activity that falls under a particular criterion in Item 1122(d). Likewise, the
second servicer may use the information in a servicing activity that falls under a
particular criterion in Item 1122(d). While the conveyance of information to another
party is not explicitly contained in any of the criterion in Item 1122(d), the staff in the
Division of Corporation Finance has taken the position that the accurate conveyance of

437

While some information about instances of non-compliance may also be required by Item 1123 of
Regulation AB to be provided, because of the differences in the definition of servicer between Item 1122
and Item 1123, we believe that Item 1123 does not cover the same information that our proposed revision
to Item 1122 would cover.

261 


the information is part of the same servicing criterion under which the activity that
generated the information is assessed.438
We are now proposing to codify the staff’s interpretation; however, unlike the
staff’s position that the conveyance of the information is part of the same servicing
criterion under which the activity that generated the information is assessed, we are
proposing to add a new servicing criterion to Item 1122. This new criterion, as
proposed,439 would state that if information obtained in the course of duty is required by
any party or parties in the transaction in order to complete their duties under the
transaction agreements, the aggregation of such information, as applicable, is
mathematically accurate and the information conveyed accurately reflects the information
that was obtained. Any servicer that is responsible for either aggregation or conveyance
of information should assess whether there are any instances of noncompliance with
respect to such activities that should be reported under the proposed criteria. We are
proposing a new criterion because we believe that a separate criterion for the accurate
aggregation and conveyance of information to other parties would better elicit disclosure
regarding a servicer’s compliance with its duties.
438

See the Division of Corporation Finance’s Manual of Publicly Available Interpretations on
Regulation AB and Related Rules, Interpretation 11.03. According to the interpretation, the following
example demonstrates how the position should be applied:
For example, if Servicer A is responsible for administering the assets of
the pool and passing along the aggregated information about the assets
in the pool to Servicer B, and Servicer B is responsible for calculating
the waterfall or preparing and filing the Exchange Act reports with that
information, Servicer A’s activity is assessed under Item 1122(d)(4). In
addition to assessing Servicer A’s maintenance of the records and other
activities, this Item requires assessment of Servicer A’s aggregation
and conveyance of such information to Servicer B. If instead of
aggregating the individual asset information, Servicer A conveys it un­
aggregated, then Servicer B must include its own aggregation of the
individual asset data in Servicer B’s assessment of calculating the
waterfall or preparing and filing Exchange Act reports.

262 


In a publicly available telephone interpretation,440 the staff explained that the
platform for reporting purposes should not be artificially designed, but rather, it should
mirror the actual servicing practices of the servicer. However, the staff also noted that if
in the conduct of servicing the transactions, the servicer has made divisions in its
servicing function by geographic locations or among separate computer systems, the
servicer may take these factors into account in determining the platform for reporting
purposes. Absent changes in circumstances such as a merger between servicers, we
expect that the groupings of transactions included in a platform would remain constant
from period to period. Also, if the servicer includes in its platform less than all of the
transactions backed by the same asset type that it servicers, we expect a description of the
scope of the platform would be included in a servicer’s report submitted pursuant Item
1122.
We are proposing to codify these interpretations relating to the scope of the Item
1122 servicer’s assessment in an instruction to Item 1122. The proposed instruction also
states that the servicer’s assessment should cover, except if disclosure is provided as
required below, all asset-backed securities transactions involving such party and that are
backed by the same asset type backing the class of asset-backed securities which are the
subject of the Commission filing. The proposed instruction states that the servicer may
take into account divisions among transactions that are consistent with the servicer’s
actual practices. However, if the servicer includes in its platform less than all of the
transactions backed by the same asset type that it services, the proposed instruction

439

See proposed Item 1122(d)(1)(v) of Regulation AB. 


440

See the Division of Corporation Finance’s Manual of Publicly Available Interpretations on

Regulation AB and Related Rules, Interpretation 17.03.


263

provides that a description of the scope of the platform should be included in the
servicer’s assessment.
Request for Comment
•	 Would additional disclosure in the body of the Form 10-K as to whether the
identified instance of noncompliance involved the servicing of the assets
backing the asset-backed securities covered in the particular Form 10-K
report, as we are proposing to require, provide investors with meaningful
additional disclosure that is not already covered by the existing requirements?
Would the proposed requirement to disclose any steps taken to remedy the
previously identified instances of noncompliance provide helpful information
to investors?
•	 Should we, as proposed, add a separate criterion addressing the accurate
aggregation and conveyance of information by one servicer to another party
who must use the information in the performance of its duties? Would it be
better not to add the criterion but instead revise Item 1122 to provide, similar
to the staff’s position, that accurate conveyance of the information is part of
the same servicing criterion under which the activity that generated the
information is assessed? Should timeliness of conveyance of this information
also be included as part of the proposed servicing criterion?
•	 Should we codify prior staff interpretations relating to the scope of Item 1122
by adding the proposed instruction? Does the proposed instruction to Item
1122 reflect current servicer’s practices? Do servicers conduct servicing in
any ways different from what is contemplated in the proposed instruction?

264 


C.

Form 8-K

1.

Item 6.05

Item 6.05 of Form 8-K441 applies to asset-backed securities offerings registered on
Form S-3 and, if our proposed amendments are adopted, will apply to offerings registered
on Form SF-3. Under the existing item requirement, if any material pool characteristic of
the actual asset pool at the time of issuance of the securities differs by five percent or
more (other than as a result of the pool assets converting to cash in accordance with their
terms) from the description of the asset pool in the prospectus filed for the offering
pursuant to Securities Act Rule 424, the issuer must provide certain disclosure regarding
the actual asset pool, such as that required by Item 1111 and 1112 of Regulation AB.
In light of the new requirements regarding asset-level disclosure, which reflect the
significance of the composition of the assets, we are proposing to revise Item 6.05 of
Form 8-K to require that the issuer file a current report with disclosure pursuant to Item
1111 and Item 1112 if any material pool characteristic of the actual asset pool at the time
of issuance of the asset-backed securities differs by one percent or more from the
description of the asset pool in the prospectus filed for the offering pursuant to Securities
Act Rule 424 (other than as a result of the pool assets converting into cash in accordance
with their terms). We believe that changes below one percent are likely de minimis
changes. We believe that except for the assets acquired through prefunding, the assets of
the pool underlying the securities should be set and described in the prospectus. For shelf
offerings, much of this information would already be provided by means of the Rule
424(h) filing. We remind issuers that information about significant changes in pool asset

441

17 CFR 249.308.

265 


composition provided to an investor after the sale may not have been adequately
conveyed at the time of sale for the purpose of Securities Act Rule 159.442
The item, as proposed to be revised, also requires a description of the changes that
were made to the asset pool, including the number of assets substituted or added to the
asset pool.443 In some transactions, the pooling and servicing agreement may provide for
investments of cash collections and reserve funds in “eligible” or “permitted”
investments. 444 However, even though investments of cash collections are contemplated
at the time of the offering, the investment of cash collections and reserve funds may be a
material change to the asset pool. Consequently, disclosure of the change would be
required under Item 6.05 of Form 8-K.
Request for Comment
•	 Should we revise Item 6.05 of Form 8-K as proposed? Is 1% an appropriate
threshold to trigger disclosure on Form 8-K? Should it be higher or lower
such as 0.5% or 2%?
•	 Is the language for the proposed item appropriate?
•	 Should we also require, as proposed, a description of the changes to the asset
pool?
•	 Should we provide by rule that changes in pool assets of more than 10% (or
some other amount) from the description of the asset pool in the prospectus

442

See fn. 87 above.

443

In addition, we are proposing to require that asset data files be included as an exhibit on the same
date of the filing of an Item 6.05 Form 8-K. See proposed Item 6.06 of Form 8-K.
444

If those instruments are securities, they must be registered or exempt from registration as provided
in Securities Act Rule 190. See Section III.a.1.e.v. and fn. 277 above.

266 


filed pursuant to Rule 424 must be conveyed to investors for purposes of Rule
159?
•	 How often would ABS issuers cross the 1% threshold? We propose, above, to
eliminate the current exception to the shelf eligibility condition that requires
timely filing of an Item 6.05 Form 8-K. Is there a risk that pool assets may
change by more than 1% without the sponsor being aware soon enough that an
issuing entity has crossed this threshold in order to be able to comply with the
shelf eligibility criteria, as proposed to be revised? If so, how should we
address that risk while still providing incentive for timely compliance?
2.	 Change in Sponsor’s Interest in the Securities
We are proposing to add a new item to require the filing of a Form 8-K to
describe any material change in the sponsor’s interest in the securities. Under this Item, a
Form 8-K would be required to be filed if there is a material change in the sponsor’s
interest in the securities. We believe that such disclosure would assist an investor in
monitoring the sponsor’s interest in the securities, including its retention of risk in
connection with the proposed shelf eligibility requirements discussed above. Under the
proposal, the report on Form 8-K would be required to include disclosure of the amount
of change in interest and a description of the sponsor’s resulting interest in the
transaction.
Request for Comment
•	 Should we require, as proposed, the issuer to file a Form 8-K if there is a
material change in the sponsor’s interest in the securities? Should we provide
a quantitative measure for the trigger for disclosure on Form 8-K? For

267 


example, should we require the filing of a Form 8-K if the sponsor’s interest
has changed by 1%, 5% or 10%?
•	 Is the proposed disclosure that would be required to be provided on Form 8-K
appropriate? Would other types of disclosure provide more useful
information for investors?
•	 Should we also require the issuer to file a Form 8-K if an originator’s interest
in the securities has changed? If such a requirement were adopted, what
would be the costs of monitoring an originator’s interest?
•	 Should we instead require that the issuer file a report each fiscal quarter that
discloses the scope of the sponsor’s interest in the securities as of a particular
date? If so, what date should that be?
D. 	

Central Index Key Numbers for Depositor, Sponsor and Issuing
Entity

We are proposing amendments to make it easier for interested parties to locate the
depositor’s registration statement and periodic reports associated with a particular
offering and information related to the sponsor of the offering. Currently, ABS offerings
with a particular file number may be associated with a registration statement with a
different file number. Further, Forms 8-K for ABS offerings may be filed under the
depositor file number, making it difficult to track material for the related offering with
only the information provided in the Form 8-K. In order to facilitate the ability of
investors to find information that is filed on EDGAR relating to the depositor, the issuing
entity and the sponsor more easily, we are proposing to require that the cover pages of
registration statements on Form SF-1 and Form SF-3 include the CIK number of the

268 


depositor, and if applicable, the CIK number of the sponsor.445 We are also proposing to
require that the cover pages of the Form 10-D, Form 10-K, and Form 8-K for ABS
issuers include the CIK number of the depositor and of the issuing entity, and if
applicable, the CIK number of the sponsor.
Request for Comment
•	 Should we require, as proposed, CIK numbers for the depositor, the issuing
entity, and the sponsor (if applicable) on the cover pages of Forms 10-K, 10-D
and 8-K for ABS issuers? Should we require, as proposed, CIK numbers for
the depositor and the sponsor (if applicable) on the cover pages of proposed
Forms SF-1 and SF-3?
•	 Are there any other changes we should make to the forms to make it easier to
locate materials related to an ABS offering or ABS issuer?
VI.

Privately-Issued Structured Finance Products
We are proposing significant revisions to the safe harbors for exempt offerings

and resales of asset-backed securities. In the U.S., all CDO issuances have taken place in
the private exempt markets. An offering of CDOs in the private market typically is a
two-step process involving an exempt private sale by the issuer to one or more initial
purchaser or purchasers446 under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act447 immediately
followed by a private resale by the initial purchaser or purchasers to eligible investors

445

See proposed revision to Item 1102(a) of Regulation AB. 


446

The initial purchaser is typically a registered broker-dealer. 


447

15 U.S.C. 77d(2). Section 4(2) provides an exemption from registration for transactions by an

issuer not involving any public offering.

269 


made in reliance on the Securities Act Rule 144A safe harbor.448 In addition, while it
may not be typically used in the private market for structured finance products, Rule
506449 of Regulation D450 provides any issuer, regardless of the type of security it issues,
a safe harbor for the Section 4(2) private offering exemption from Securities Act
registration.
Securitization in the private, unregistered market played a significant role in the
financial crisis. In particular, the CDO market has been cited as central to the crisis.451
While the CDO market comprised a large part of the capital market at the time of the
financial crisis,452 many have asserted that the lack of information about CDOs and other
structured securities in the private market exacerbated the harm to investors and the
markets as a whole during the financial crisis.453 In addition, other market participants
and regulators did not have access to important information about this significant

Markets, Second Edition, (Eliot J. Katz et al. eds., 2nd ed., Thomson West 2005)(noting that “[t]ogether,

financial instruments that were not understood by investors), at 53, and Gillian Tett, Fools Gold (2009).
See also the PWG March 2008 Report, at 9 (discussing subprime mortgages and the write-down of AAArated and super-senior tranches of CDOs as contributing factors to the financial crisis).
452

In 2005, worldwide CDO issuance exceeded $250 billion. See, e.g., Securities Industry and
Financial Markets Association, “Global CDO Issuance Data,” available at
http://www.sifma.org/research/research.aspx?ID=10806. According to information that the staff has
compiled from AB Alert, available at www.ABAlert.com, and SDC, U.S. issued Rule 144A offerings of
asset-backed securities totaled approximately $200 billion in 2005 and $160 billion in 2006.
453

See the 2008 CRMPG III Report, at 53 (noting that lack of comprehension of CDOs by market
participants resulted in the display of price depreciation and volatility far in excess of levels previously
associated with comparably rated securities, causing both a collapse of confidence in a very broad range of
structured product ratings and a collapse in liquidity for such products). See also the Turner Review, at 16
(describing CDOs and CDO squared as opaque).

component of the capital markets.454 Further, the costs of information asymmetry for
ABS issuances can differ significantly from those incurred in the issuances of most other
securities. Asset-backed securities are issued by single purpose issuers whose only
business purpose is holding financial assets and may involve numerous parties that
participate in the chain of securitization (i.e., originator, sponsor, servicer, etc.). Thus,
unlike the securities of other companies where information needed to value the securities
might be able to be gleaned from a review of basic summary information and discussions
with management, information about the assets and the parties in the securitization chain
facilitates an understanding of the valuation of asset-backed securities. To address these
concerns, we are proposing revisions relating to Rule 144A offerings of structured
finance products and Rule 506 of Regulation D to provide for specific disclosures for
private offerings of structured finance products, as well as additional public information
about private structured finance products offerings conducted in reliance upon these safe
harbors.
We acknowledge that the steps we are proposing to take in the private placement
market are significant. We recognize that structured finance products issuers may
conduct offerings in reliance on a statutory exemption under the Securities Act without
seeking the safe harbor provided by Rule 506 of Regulation D or without representing

that the securities are eligible for sale under Rule 144A.455 As a result, our proposed
amendments to the safe harbors would not apply to these offerings, and as such, may not
fully address the concerns we seek to address in all securitization transactions.
A.

Rule 144A and Regulation D

We adopted Securities Act Rule 144A456 in 1990.457 The rule provides a safe
harbor for a reseller of securities from being deemed an underwriter within the meaning
of Sections 2(a)(11) and 4(1) of the Securities Act for the offer and sale of non-exchange
listed securities to “qualified institutional buyers” (QIBs), as defined in Rule 144A. The
Rule 144A safe harbor can be claimed only by persons other than the issuer. The safe
harbor has been utilized to develop a private market for collateralized debt obligations
and other asset-backed securities458 that may not meet the definition of an asset-backed
security under Regulation AB, and, therefore, are not eligible for the particularized
regulation regime of Regulation AB.459
One condition of the Rule 144A safe harbor requires the issuer to provide the
security holder or a prospective purchaser designated by the security holder, certain

455

For example, we understand that asset-backed commercial paper is often sold in reliance on the
private placement statutory exemption and the so-called Section “4(1-1/2)” exemption for private resales
rather than the safe harbors provided under Rule 506 of Regulation D or Rule 144A.
456

17 CFR 230.144A.

457

See the Rule 144A Adopting Release.

458

For example, a vast majority of resecuritizations of real estate mortgage conduits, known as “ReRemics,” are offered through resales made in reliance on Rule 144A safe harbor. See Deloitte’s Speaking
of Securitization, “The Re-Remic Phenomenon” (June 2009), at 2.
459

Many CDOs do not meet the “discrete pool of assets” component of the Regulation AB definition
of an asset-backed security because CDOs permit the active management of the assets for a period of time
(e.g., five years), a component which is inconsistent with the principle set forth in Item 1101(c). Also,
other structured products like synthetic securities do not meet the definition of an asset-backed security
under Regulation AB. See Section III.A.2.a. of the 2004 ABS Adopting Release. In addition, activelymanaged CDOs and issuers that offer synthetic securities generally do not meet the requirements of Rule
3a-7 under the Investment Company Act and typically rely on one of the private investment company
exclusions under that Act. See fn. 39 above.

272 


information relating to the issuer, which is required to be reasonably current in relation to
the date of resale under the rule.460 To satisfy the rule, the information must be provided
upon the security holder’s request, or the prospective purchaser must have received such
information at or prior to the time of sale, upon the prospective purchaser’s request to the
security holder or issuer. In the original adopting release for Rule 144A, we noted that
this condition had been proposed in response to commenters’ concerns regarding the lack
of available information about issuers in the exempted transaction.461
This information requirement in Rule 144A delineates the type of information that
should be provided by corporate issuers.462 However, there is no discussion in the text of
the rule regarding the type of information that is required for ABS offerings. In the
original adopting release for Rule 144A, we stated that the information requirements in
Rule 144A with respect to asset-backed issuers require, “basic, material information
concerning the structure of the securities and distributions thereon, the nature,
performance and servicing of the assets supporting the securities, and any credit
mechanism associated with the securities.”463 Under these requirements, purchasers of
asset-backed securities in Rule 144A transactions may receive only a minimal amount of
information about their investment.

460

17 CFR 230.144A(d)(4).

461

See Section II.D. of the Rule 144A Adopting Release.

462

In particular, the holder or prospective purchaser should be provided with: a statement of the
nature of the issuer’s business and the products and services that it offers, the issuer’s most recent balance
sheet and profit and loss and retained earnings statements, and similar financial statements for the part of
the two preceding fiscal years as the issuer has been in operation. See 17 CFR 230.144A(d)(4)(i). The rule
also explains how the issuer’s financial statements and other information could be presumed to be
“reasonably current.” See 17 CFR 230.144A(d)(4)(ii).

463

See Section II.D. of the Rule 144A Adopting Release.

273 


Under the existing provisions in Regulation D, when the issuer sells securities in
reliance on Rule 506 to a purchaser that is not an “accredited investor,” as defined in
Regulation D, an issuer must furnish information akin to what is required in a registration
statement on Form S-1.464 The prescribed information, however, need not be provided to
a purchaser that is an accredited investor. Except for a few types of ABS, we believe that
investors in privately issued asset-backed securities typically would qualify as accredited
investors, and therefore, issuers would not be required to provide the prescribed
information to them in order rely on Rule 506 of Regulation D for the sale of the
securities. Thus, if an ABS issuer were to rely on Rule 506 of Regulation D for the sale
of its securities, purchasers in the offering may receive only a minimal amount of
information regarding the securities, though they may request the information that they
desire.
B.

Proposed Information Requirements for Structured Finance Products

1.

General

In order to address concerns about the lack of information available to investors in
the private markets for structured finance products, we are proposing amendments to our
safe harbors and new related rules regarding the information that must be made available
to investors in privately-issued asset-backed securities. In summary, we are proposing to:
•	 require that, in order for a reseller of a “structured finance product” to sell
a security in reliance on Rule 144A, or in order for an issuer of a
“structured finance product” to sell a security in reliance on Rule 506 of
Regulation D:

464

See Rule 502(b)(2) of Regulation D.

274 


o	 the underlying transaction agreement for the securities must grant
to purchasers, holders of the securities (or prospective purchasers
designated by the holder) the right to obtain from the issuer of such
securities the information, upon request, that would be required if
the transaction were registered under the Securities Act and such
ongoing information as would be required by Section 15(d) of the
Exchange Act if the issuer were required to file reports under that
section; and
o	 the issuer must represent that it will provide such information.
•	 conform the informational requirement of Securities Act Rule 144465 to the
above revisions; and
•	 add a new Securities Act rule that would require a structured finance
product issuer that had represented and covenanted to provide information
as proposed to be required by Rule 144, Rule 144A and Rule 506 of
Regulation D to provide such information, upon request.
2.

Application of Proposals

Our proposals would apply to a “structured finance product,” which would be
more broadly defined than the Regulation AB Item 1101(c) definition of “asset-backed
security” in order to reflect the wide range of securitization products that are sold in the
private markets. In addition to traditional “asset-backed securities,” the proposed
definition of “structured finance product” would cover:
•	 a synthetic asset-backed security; or

465

17 CFR 230.144.

275 


•

a fixed-income or other security collateralized by any pool of self-liquidating
financial assets, such as loans, leases, mortgages, and secured or unsecured
receivables that entitles its holder to receive payments that depend on the cash
flow from the assets -- including:
o	 an asset-backed security as used in Item 1101(c) of Regulation AB
(§229.1101(c));
o	 a collateralized mortgage obligation;
o	 a collateralized debt obligation;
o	 a collateralized bond obligation;
o	 a collateralized debt obligation of asset-backed securities;
o	 a collateralized debt obligation of collateralized debt obligations; or
o	 a security that at the time of the offering is commonly known as an assetbacked security or a structured finance product.466
We believe that the enumerated characteristics in our proposed definition

generally distinguish structured finance products from other types of securities. This
proposed definition of structured finance product would encompass certain managed
asset-backed securities (where a manager is appointed and paid fees to make changes to
the collateral or a referenced portfolio). In this proposed definition, there would be no

466

This proposed definition is based in part, on the definition of asset-backed security used in the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)’s proposal to designate asset-backed securities as
eligible for Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine, the vehicle developed by FINRA to facilitate the
mandatory reporting of over the counter secondary market transactions. See Notice of Filing of
Amendment No. 1 and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of a Proposed Rule Change, as modified by
Amendment No. 1 Thereto, to Require the Reporting of Transactions in Asset-Backed Securities to
TRACE, Release No. 34-61566 (Feb. 22, 2010)(release approving the rule change that would require the
reporting of trading in asset-backed securities to TRACE). Our proposed definition provides some more
specificity on the defining characteristics of a structured finance product and, unlike the FINRA proposed
definition, includes a security that is commonly known at the time of the offering as an asset-backed
security or a structured finance product.

276 


requirement of a discrete pool of assets so as to include CDOs, which are typically
managed for some period of time.467
3.

Information Requirements

We are proposing to condition the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Rule 506 of
Regulation D on a requirement that, if the securities offered or sold are structured finance
products, an underlying transaction agreement (such as an indenture or servicing
agreement) must contain a provision requiring the issuer to provide specified information
to any purchaser (and also, in the case of Rule 144A, any security holder or prospective
purchaser designated by the security holder).468 Also, the issuer must represent that it
will provide such information upon request. For securities to be eligible for resale under
Rule 144A, we would require that an underlying transaction agreement grant any initial
purchaser, any security holder or any prospective purchaser designated by a security
holder the right to obtain from the issuer promptly, upon the request of the purchaser or
security holder, information as would be required if the offering were registered on Form
S-1 or Form SF-1 under the Securities Act and any ongoing information regarding the
securities that would be required by Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act if the issuer were

467

We also believe that any residual tranche of the instrument would be included in the proposed
definition. Asset-backed commercial paper is also covered in this definition.
468

In the original adopting release for Rule 144A, we stated that with respect to mortgage- or other
asset- backed securities, since the servicer or trustee, on behalf of the trust or other legal entity, has title to
the assets of the trust, they would be deemed to be the “issuer” for purposes of the information requirement
in Rule 144A. In a no-action letter, the staff later explained that this language “was not intended in any
way to cause the analysis of issuer status under the federal securities laws to be any different for privately
placed mortgage-backed or asset-backed securities than public offerings of such securities” but “intended
only to identify the party from whom the holder and a prospective purchaser designated by the holder must
have the right to obtain the information about the securities and underlying asset pools of the limited
purpose financial entity.” See letter from the Division of Corporation Finance to Kutak Rock & Campbell
(Nov. 29, 1990). While we recognize that the servicer or trustee would typically be the party that delivers
information to security holders (or prospective purchasers), we intend for our proposed amendment to
apply to an issuer of structured finance products (i.e., the depositor as it relates to the issuing entity),
consistent with the definition of issuer in Securities Act Rule 191 for ABS purposes.

277 


required to file reports under that section. For an offering made in reliance on Rule 506
of Regulation D, we would require that an underlying transaction agreement contain a
provision granting any purchaser in the Rule 506 offering the right to obtain from the
issuer promptly, upon the purchaser’s request, information that would be required if the
offering were registered on Form S-1 or Form SF-1 under the Securities Act.
The specific disclosure that would need to be provided to satisfy this condition
would vary depending on the type of security offered. For an offering of structured
finance products where the securities meet the Regulation AB definition of an assetbacked security, the disclosure requirements of Form SF-1 would apply. For offerings of
structured finance products where the securities fall outside the Regulation AB definition,
the requirements of Form S-1 would apply. In the latter case, the issuer would be
required to provide information required under Regulation AB regarding the assets and
parties as well as additional information required under Regulation S-K.469 For a
managed CDO offering, we would expect disclosure regarding the asset and collateral
managers, including fees and related party transaction information, their objectives and
strategies, any interest that they have retained in the transaction or underlying assets, and
substitution, reinvestment and management parameters. For a synthetic CDO offering,
we would expect, among other things, disclosure of the differences between the spreads
on synthetic assets and the market prices for the assets, the process for obtaining the

not meet the Regulation AB definition of an asset-backed security and noting “[d]epending on the structure
of the transaction and the terms of the securities, some disclosure aspects of Regulation AB may be
applicable, but aspects from the traditional disclosure regime also may be applicable. In some instances, a
third approach might be more appropriate”). Material information that is required by Regulation S-K
would be required but not all of the item requirements in Regulation S-K may be applicable to the issuer.

credit default swap or other synthetic assets, and the internal rate of return to equity if
that was a consideration in the structuring of the transaction.

Proposed Rule 144 Revisions

In addition, we are proposing to revise Securities Act Rule 144. Rule 144 creates
a safe harbor for the sale of securities under the exemption set forth in Section 4(1) of the
Securities Act. One of the conditions of Rule 144 requires the availability of adequate
current public information with respect to the issuer of the securities (“the current public
information requirement”). This current public information requirement is only at issue
if the seller who is relying on Rule 144 is an affiliate of the issuer.470 Under Rule 144,
affiliates of non-reporting companies may resell securities in reliance on the rule only
after the securities have been held for at least one year after purchase and if certain
conditions are met, including the current public information requirement.
We are proposing to revise the current public information requirement in Rule
144 for non-reporting issuers of structured finance products. If the securities are
structured finance products, and the issuer of the securities is not subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of Exchange Act, then in order to satisfy the current
public information requirement, two conditions must be satisfied. First, the underlying
transaction agreement of the issuer must grant any purchaser, any security holder and any
prospective purchaser of the securities designated by the holder the right to obtain, upon
request of the purchaser or security holder, information that would be required if the
470

See Revisions to Rule 144 and Rule 145 to Shorten Holding Period for Affiliates and NonAffiliates, Release No. 33-8813 (June 20, 1997)[72 FR 36822](adopting release shortening holding period
and amending other Rule 144 conditions). Prior to 2007, non-affiliates of the issuer relying on the rule for
the resale of securities were subject to the current public information requirement after holding the
securities for one year. Since 2007, non-affiliates of a non-reporting issuer who satisfy a one-year holding
period requirement are no longer required to comply as a condition to reliance on Rule 144 with the current
public information requirement.

279 


offering were registered on Form S-1 or Form SF-1 under the Securities Act and any
ongoing information regarding the securities that would be required by Section 15(d) of
the Exchange Act, if the issuer were required to file reports under that section. Second,
the issuer must have represented that it would provide such information to the purchaser,
security holder, or prospective purchaser, upon request of the purchaser or security
holder.
5.

New Rule 192 of the Securities Act

We are proposing new Rule 192 to require an issuer of privately-issued structured
finance products to provide, upon the investors’ request, information as would be
required if the transaction were registered (or ongoing information). If an issuer of
structured finance products has represented and covenanted to provide such offering
information in order to rely on Rule 506 of Regulation D or has represented and
covenanted to provide both offering or ongoing information pursuant to the proposed new
provision of Rule 144A or Rule 144, then the issuer must provide such information, upon
request of the purchaser or security holder. Recent events have shown the importance of
structured finance product issuers complying with a representation to provide initial and
ongoing information to security holders and prospective purchasers.471 In making
investment decisions, ABS investors should be able to rely on the continued availability
of information to themselves and prospective purchasers as a prophylactic measure
against the possibility of fraud. Indeed, failure to provide such information upon request

471

See Gary Gorton, Slapped in the Face by the Invisible Hand: Banking and the Panic of 2007, May
9, 2009, prepared for the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s 2009 Financial Markets Conference: Financial
Innovation and Crisis (noting that at a crucial point in the financial crisis, lack of information regarding
some securities greatly exacerbated the situation).

280 


may constitute a fraud in the offer of securities.472 Thus, the Commission could bring an
enforcement action under this rule against an issuer that failed to provide the required
information.
The obligation to provide information under proposed new Rule 192 would not be
a condition of the Rule 144, Rule 144A, or Regulation D safe harbors. As proposed new
conditions of the safe harbors for structured finance products, the underlying transaction
agreements must contain the specified representations and covenants to provide
information. If the issuer does not include the representation and covenant, it would have
failed to satisfy the safe harbor and may not be entitled to the exemption under Sections
4(1) or 4(2), as applicable. If, on the other hand, the transaction agreements contain the
representation and covenant but the issuer fails to provide, for example, some of the
information to a security holder or prospective purchaser, upon their request, that failure,
in and of itself, would not mean the conditions of the safe harbor would not have been
met. We have concerns that a potential claim arising under Section 5 of the Securities
Act may not be the appropriate remedy under these circumstances but believe it
appropriate that there be regulatory consequences. Investors should nevertheless be able
to take appropriate action under those transaction agreements regarding the provision of
information and the Commission could bring an action for violation of Rule 192.

472

Securities Act Section 17(a) contains the general antifraud prohibitions applicable in the offer or
sale of securities. In particular, Section 17(a)(3) (15 U.S.C. 77q(a)(3)) states that it shall be unlawful for
any person in the offer or sale of any securities or any security-based swap agreement by the use of any
means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or by use of the mails,
directly or indirectly to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would
operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser. The Supreme Court has held that Section 17(a)(3) does not
require a finding of scienter. Aaron v. SEC, 446 U.S. 680 (1980).

281 


Request for Comment
•	 We recognize that our proposals would impose significant changes to the existing
requirements in the safe harbors for private offers, sales and resales of structured
finance products, and we request comment on all aspects of our proposed
approach. This will be the first time, for example, that we would require an
undertaking to provide information to accredited investors as a condition to the
safe harbor in Rule 506 of Regulation D, and the first time we would require an
undertaking to provide such specific information to QIBs in Rule 144A
transactions. While we recognize that the proposals may impose substantial
additional requirements on ABS issuers in the private market, we believe that, if
adopted, these proposals would help to provide needed transparency in the private
markets for structured finance products. As a practical matter, how feasible will
an exempt private offering be in light of the requirements? Is the rationale offered
for distinguishing ABS from other securities for purposes of our proposal
appropriate?
•	 We request comment on the proposed definition of “structured finance products”
for purposes of our proposed revisions to Rule 144A, Regulation D and other
rules. Is the proposed definition appropriate? Should other types of securities be
included that are not included? Should any types of included securities not be?
•	 Is it appropriate to require, as proposed, that as a condition of Rule 144A, the
transaction agreements contain a provision that would require an issuer of
structured finance products to provide to investors promptly, upon investors’
request, such information that would be required if the offering were registered on

282 


Forms S-1 or SF-1 and any ongoing information regarding the securities as would
be required by Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act if the issuer were required to
file reports under that section? Is it appropriate to require, as proposed, the same
requirement as a condition of Rule 506 of Regulation D for sales to accredited
investors?
•

Should we require instead that, as a condition of Rule 144A, issuers make the
required information (both offering and ongoing information) available at all
times, rather than only upon investor’s request? Could an issuer, for example, be
required to post the information on a password-protected website?

•

Is new Rule 192 appropriate? Should we require, as a matter of federal securities
law, that an issuer of structured finance products that has represented and
covenanted to provide information pursuant to the safe harbors under Rule 144A,
Regulation D, or Rule 144 provide such information?

•

Should we provide more specificity in the rules covering what disclosure would
be required to be provided? If so, what types of disclosure should we specifically
require? Should the required disclosures differ by type of security? If so, in what
way?

•

Are our proposals with respect to ongoing information regarding the securities
appropriate? Is there any reason that we should not require structured finance
product issuers that utilize the safe harbors to comply with the proposed
requirements for ongoing information?

•

Is our proposed approach of requiring the transaction agreements to contain a
provision requiring the issuer to provide information upon request appropriate?

283 


Should we instead condition the availability of the safe harbors of Rule 144A and
Regulation D on the actual provision of the information if the securities sold are
structured finance products? Would that approach have a chilling effect on the
private markets if not providing some of the information required under our
revised rule might raise the possibility of a Section 5 violation, with the resultant
rescission right under Section 12(a)(1)? If so, should we address that potential
concern by providing that no failure to provide information as required solely
under such a provision of Rule 144A would result in a loss of the safe harbor for
purposes of Section 12(a)(1) liability as long as the other conditions of Rule 144A
are satisfied and basic material information concerning the securities is provided,
including information regarding the structure of the securities, distributions on the
securities, nature, performance and servicing of the assets, and any credit
enhancements? Such an approach would be designed to enable the Commission
to bring an action, if appropriate, based on Section 5 if the required information
were not provided while limiting litigation by a purchaser seeking to rescind the
transaction to situations where there was a significant failure to provide basic
information. By contrast, is it necessary or appropriate to rely on the possibility
of a rescission right to foster compliance with the proposed information
requirements?
•	 Are our proposed amendments to Rule 506 of Regulation D appropriate? Should
we require, as proposed, that information regarding structured finance products be
provided to any purchaser, regardless of whether the purchaser meets the
definition of an accredited investor?

284 


•	 Should our proposed conditions apply to offerings made pursuant to Rule 505,
which are made under the Securities Act Section 3(b) exemption from registration
rather than Section 4(2)? How likely would it be for issuers of structured finance
products to conduct Rule 505 offerings?
•	 Instead of amending Rule 506, should we adopt a new Regulation D safe harbor
just for structured finance products? Since it appears that issuers of structured
finance products have relied on the statutory private placement exemption rather
than Regulation D, would such a safe harbor be used?
•	 Even if there was not extensive use of Regulation D for private offerings of
structured finance products, is it necessary or appropriate for us to amend Rule
506 of Regulation D, as proposed, in order to forestall potential future problems
in the private markets for structured finance products?
•	 Is our proposed amendment to Rule 144 appropriate?
•	 As proposed, the revisions to Rule 144A, Regulation D and Rule 144 require that
the underlying transaction agreement include a provision that the issuer provide
information to investors upon request. Should we revise the requirement to
provide that the servicer, collateral administrator or some other party provides the
information?
•	 The proposed revisions to Rule 144A, Regulation D, and Rule 144 also require
that the issuer represent that prescribed information would be provided to
investors. Is the proposal appropriate?
•	 Would the proposed rule revisions provide investors and market participants with
sufficient transparency regarding private sales of structured finance products?

285 


Would additional or other requirements promote greater transparency? For
example, should we make the safe harbors, such as Rule 144A, unavailable for
offerings of structured finance products? Would this result in structured finance
products being offered and sold in registered transactions, or in private
transactions without the benefit of the safe harbor? Would a new safe harbor for
private ABS offerings designed to make information available to investors and the
market (e.g., a limited public offering exemption) be a more appropriate
approach?
•	 The proposed amendments would have the effect of treating offers and sales in
reliance on safe harbors substantially similar to public ones in terms of the
relevant disclosure requirements. Is this appropriate? Why or why not? To what
extent and in what way should our regulatory regime account for the nature of the
investors (e.g., accredited investors and QIBs) who participate in private
offerings? What would the impact be on the securitization market if offerings of
ABS in reliance on the safe harbors were subject to the disclosure requirements
that we propose?
•	 Should we address private resales of ABS outside of our safe harbors by
interpreting the definition of “underwriter” for purposes of the statutory
exemptions to include any sales of asset-backed securities where information that
would be required in the registered context is not provided? Why or why not?
Would doing so prevent issuers from engaging in transactions that are not subject
to the proposed requirements by using a statutory exemption (and not the safe
harbors) for the unregistered sale of asset-backed securities?

286 


•	 To the extent we adopt the proposed changes to Rule 144A or Regulation D, we
request comment on whether issuers of structured finance products would be
more likely to sell such products outside the United States in reliance on the safe
harbor provided by Regulation S473 under the Securities Act. Should we adopt
similar changes under Regulation S as we are proposing for Rule 144A and
Regulation D to cover sales of structured finance products outside the United
States? Are there any extra or special considerations relating to offshore sales of
structured finance products that are different from considerations under Rule
144A and Regulation D that we should take into account in considering adopting
similar changes under Regulation S?
•	 In order to facilitate unsolicited ratings in unregistered transactions, should we
require that the issuer also provide information to an NRSRO if the rating agency
intends to rate the security?
•	 Are there other disclosure approaches that would better satisfy the objectives we
have identified? For example, should we require more targeted disclosures in
private placements? Should we give issuers or investors other options for
addressing issues in the ABS private market? If so, how? Should all asset classes
be treated the same?
C.	

Notice of Initial Placement of Securities Eligible For Sale Under Rule
144A and Revisions to Form D

In light of the role that privately-issued structured finance products play in our
capital markets and concerns raised by the lack of transparency in the private market, we
also believe it is important to implement rules that will provide information to us and to
473

17 CFR 230.901 et seq.

287 


the markets at large about sales of structured finance products in the private markets.
Consequently, we are proposing to require that a notice of an initial placement of
structured finance products be filed with the Commission.
Form D474 is the official notice of an offering of securities made without
registration under the Securities Act in reliance on an exemption provided by Regulation
D.475 While Form D is not a condition to the availability of the Regulation D exemption,
Rule 507476 of Regulation D disqualifies an issuer from using a Regulation D exemption
in the future if it has been enjoined by the court for violating the Regulation D provision
that requires the filing of Form D. Form D serves an important data collection objective,
among other things.477 On February 27, 2008, we adopted changes to mandate the
electronic filing of the form and to revise the form.478 Currently, there is no such notice
filing requirement for offerings made in reliance on Rule 144A.
We are proposing to require a notice of the offering to be filed with the
Commission for the initial placement of structured finance products that are represented
as eligible for resale under Rule 144A,. The notice would include information regarding
major participants in the securitization, the date of the offering and initial sale, the type of
securities being offered, the basic structure of the securitization, the assets in the

474

17 CFR 239.500.

475

See Rule 503 of Regulation D [17 CFR 230.503].

476

17 CFR 230.507.

477

In Electronic Filing and Revision of Form D, Release No. 33-8891 (Feb. 6, 2008) [73 FR 10592],
we noted that previous statements on Form D have suggested that, at the federal regulatory level, Form D
filings serve both to collect data for use in the Commission’s rulemaking efforts and for the enforcement of
the federal securities laws, including enforcement of the exemptions in Regulation D. See Section I.A of
Release No. 33-8891.
478

See id.

288 


underlying pool, and the principal amount of the securities being offered. Like Form D,
the notice would be required to be filed in XML tagged format.479
The notice would also provide that in submitting the notice, the issuer is
undertaking to furnish the offering materials relating to the securities to the Commission
upon written request. We also are proposing to add an amendment to Rule 30-1 of the
Commission’s Rules of General Organization to provide delegated authority to the
Director of the Division of Corporation Finance to request information that the issuer
would be required to undertake to provide to the Commission upon request. This
proposed amendment to Rule 30-1 would also apply to the existing undertaking in Form
D and provide the Director of the Division of Corporation Finance the authority to
request information from issuers of structured finance products that file Form D.
This notice, which we are proposing to call Form 144A-SF, 480 would be signed
by the issuer and filed with the Commission no later than 15 calendar days after the first
sale of securities in the offering, unless the end of that period falls on a Saturday, Sunday
or holiday, in which case the due date would be the first business day following such
period. This timeframe is based on the current timeframe for filing a Form D. Similar to
Form D, the Form 144A-SF notice requirement is not proposed to be a condition of the
availability of the Rule 144A safe harbor. However, in light of the importance of this
information, we are proposing to provide that if an issuer has failed to file Form 144A­
SF, then Rule 144A will not be available for subsequent resales of newly issued
structured finance products of the issuer or affiliates of the issuer.

479

Similarly, filers submit Form D online through the Commission’s EDGAR system, which stores
the information in tagged format.
480

See proposed 17 CFR 239.144A.

289 


Also similar to Form D, hardship exemptions in Regulation S-T would be
unavailable to Form 144A-SF.481 We believe that issuers should have access to the
Internet and be able to file this notice within 15 calendar days after the first sale of
securities in the offering (i.e. the initial placement of securities), as proposed. We also
believe hardship exemptions should not be available for Form 144A-SF because of the
relative ease of filing, the limited value of paper filings and the utility of a uniform,
comprehensive database.
We also are proposing to amend Form D to collect the same information that we
are proposing to require to be provided in proposed Form 144A-SF. Further, we are
proposing to add a checkbox to Form D that would indicate if the issuer is offering or
selling structured finance products.482
Request for Comment
•	 Is our proposal to require a notice of the initial placement of structured finance
products that may be resold in reliance on Rule 144A appropriate?
•	 Instead of, or in addition to, a notice, should we require that the offering circular
be filed? If we require that the offering circular be filed, should the filing be with
the Commission on a non-public basis? Should it be made available to the
public? If so, when should it be made public (e.g., immediately or after some
period of time)? If it were made public, would there be any general solicitation
concerns? If so, how should we address them?

481

We are proposing to amend Rules 201 and 202 of Regulation S-T to make the hardship
exemptions unavailable to proposed Form 144A-SF.
482

In order to better organize the information in Form D in light of these changes, we also are
proposing to re-order the items in Form D.

290 


•	 Should proposed Form 144A-SF be required to be filed, as proposed, in XML
tagged format? Similar to Form D, should we provide a Web site page where
issuers can submit directly to EDGAR the information required by Form 144A­
SF, which would automatically tag the information that is delivered? Would
issuers of structured finance products benefit from such a webpage?
•	 Are the items of information that are proposed to be required in proposed Form
144A-SF appropriate? Are there other items that are useful and should be
required to be provided on proposed Form 144A-SF? Are there particular ways
that these items should be required to be tagged?
•	 Should the Rule 144A safe harbor be conditioned on the filing of this notice, or is
it better to require the notice separate from the conditions of the Rule 144A safe
harbor, as proposed? Is our proposal relating to the consequences for failure to
file the notice appropriate?
•	 Should we require the filing of proposed Form 144A-SF sooner than proposed
(e.g., three or four business days from the date of first sale) or should we provide
issuers with more time for filing the notice (e.g., 20 calendar days from the date of
first sale)? Should we provide a hardship exemption for filing proposed Form
144A-SF, or is our proposal to make the hardship exemptions unavailable
appropriate?
•	 Should we revise Form D, as proposed? Are the proposed revisions to Form D
appropriate?
•	 Should we also adopt changes under Regulation S to require a notice of sales of
ABS that are to be sold in reliance on that safe harbor, similar to the proposed

291 


requirement under Rule 144A? Are there any extra or special considerations
relating to offshore sales of structured finance products that are different from
considerations under Rule 144A that we should take into account in considering
adopting a similar filing requirement under Regulation S?
VII. 	 Codification of Staff Interpretations Relating to Securities Act Registration
We also are proposing to codify certain staff positions relating to the registration
of asset-backed securities. These codifications should simplify our rules by making these
positions more transparent and readily available to the public.
A. 	

Fee Requirements for Collateral Certificates or Special Units of
Beneficial Interest

In some ABS transactions backed by auto leases, the auto leases and car titles are
originated in the name of a separate trust to avoid the administrative expenses of retitling
the physical property underlying the leases.483 The separate trust will issue to the issuing
entity for the asset-backed security a collateral certificate, often called a “special unit of
beneficial interest” (SUBI). The issuing entity will then issue the asset-backed securities
backed by the SUBI certificate.
Rule 190 governs the registration requirements for underlying securities of an
asset securitization. Rule 190(c) provides that if the asset pool for the asset-backed
securities includes a pool asset representing an interest in or the right to the payments or
cash flows of another asset pool, then that pool asset is not considered an “underlying
security” that must be registered in accordance with the other provisions in Rule 190 if
certain conditions are met. These conditions are:
483

See also discussion of these types of transactions in Section III.A.2.c of the 2004 ABS Adopting
Release and John Arnholz and Edward E. Gainor, Offerings of Asset-Backed Securities, Aspen Publishers
(2008 Supplement), at §2.03[B].

292 


•	 both the issuing entity for the asset-backed securities and the entity issuing the
pool asset were established under the direction of the same sponsor and
depositor;
•	 the pool asset is created solely to satisfy legal requirements or otherwise
facilitate the structuring of the asset-backed securities transaction;
•	 the pool asset is not part of a scheme to evade registration or the requirements
of Rule 190; and
•	 the pool asset is held by the issuing entity and is a part of the asset pool for the
asset-backed securities.484
In a publicly available telephone interpretation, the staff has advised that the offer
and sale of the collateral certificate or SUBI involved in asset-backed transactions must
also be registered (along with the securities themselves).485 However, the staff has
advised that, if the collateral certificate or SUBI meets the requirements of Rule 190(c) of
the Securities Act, no additional registration fee for the offering of the collateral
certificates or SUBIs should be required.486 We are proposing to codify the staff’s
positions in this respect in Rule 190 and Rule 457 under the Securities Act,487 which
relates to the computation of Securities Act registration fees. Under the proposed
amendment to Rule 190, notwithstanding other provisions, if the pool assets for the assetbacked securities are collateral certificates or SUBIs, those collateral certificates or
484	

See 17 CFR 230.190(c). Rule 190(c) provides for the conditions in which an asset-backed issuer is
not required to register a pool asset representing an interest in or the right to the payments or cash
flows of another asset.

See Interpretation 13.01 of the Division’s Manual of Publicly Available Interpretations on
Regulation AB and Related Rules.

486	

See id.

487	

17 CFR 230.457.

293 


SUBIs must be registered concurrently with the registration of the asset-backed
securities.488 Pursuant to the proposed revision to Rule 457, where the securities to be
offered are collateral certificates or SUBIs underlying asset-backed securities which are
being registered concurrently, no separate fee for the certificates or SUBIs will be
payable.489
B.

Incorporating by Reference Subsequently Filed Periodic Reports

Currently, the prospectus for an offering of securities registered on Form S-3 is
required to incorporate by reference all subsequently filed periodic and other reports filed
under Exchange Act Sections 13(a) and 15(d)490 prior to the termination of the
offering.491 For corporate issuers, information regarding the issuer that is allowed to be
omitted from the registration statement is made available through the Exchange Act
reports.
With respect to asset-backed issuers, information filed with a current report on
Form 8-K492 prior to the termination of the offering would often be important to
incorporate into the prospectus. For example, disclosure under Item 6.05 of Form 8-K
may provide information regarding a change in the composition of the pool assets.
However, the staff has previously noted that asset-backed issuers should not be required

See proposed revision to Rule 190(c).

See proposed paragraph (s) to Rule 457.

17 CFR 249.308.

294 


to incorporate information filed with their Form 10-D or Form 10-K493 reports into the
prospectus.494
We are proposing to codify in proposed Form SF-3 the staff’s position regarding
incorporation by reference of subsequently filed Exchange Act reports for offerings of
asset-backed securities. Because, except for issuers that utilize master trust structures,
the Form 10-D and Form 10-K that is filed prior to the termination of the offering is
generally for a different ABS issuer than the ABS issuer that has filed the prospectus
(even though the issuers are affiliated), Form 10-D and Form 10-K reports may not be
relevant to asset-backed offering that is the subject of the prospectus. Thus, under the
proposed codification, rather than state that all reports subsequently filed by the registrant
pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, prior to the
termination of the offering shall be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the
prospectus, the registration statement may, alternatively, state that all current reports on
Form 8-K filed by the registrant pursuant to 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act, prior to the termination of the offering shall be deemed to be incorporated by
reference into the prospectus.495
Request for Comment
•	 Should we codify the above staff positions?
•	 Should we make any changes to the staff positions? For example, should we
require master trust issuers to state that all Exchange Act reports subsequently

See Interpretation 15.02 of the Division’s Manual of Publicly Available Interpretations on
Regulation AB and Related Rules. The staff noted that the 2004 ABS Adopting Release noted

prospectus rather allow them to incorporate by reference only Form 8-K?
•	 Should we revise any of the positions we are proposing to be codified? Does
the proposed language in any of the codifications modify, or create an
ambiguity that we should revise?
VIII. Transition Period
We are considering the appropriate timing for implementation of the proposals, if
adopted. Because sponsors of asset securitizations typically are large issuers,496 we
preliminarily believe that a tiered approach to implementation based on size of the
sponsor would not be appropriate for asset-backed issuers. We believe that some of our
proposed amendments, including asset-level and data tagging requirements, may initially
impose significant burdens on sponsors and originators as they adjust to the new
requirements. This could include changes to how information relating to the pool assets
is collected and disseminated to various parties along the chain of securitization. While
we believe that compliance dates should not extend past a year after adoption of the new
rules, we request that commenters provide input about feasible dates for implementation
of the proposed amendments. We currently anticipate that, if adopted, the new and
amended rules, including the proposed asset-level information requirements and the
changes with respect to privately-issued asset-backed securities, would apply to asset­

backed securities that are issued after the implementation date of the new
requirements.497
Request for Comment
•	 Should implementation of any proposals be phased-in? If so, explain why and
provide a reasonable timeframe for a phase-in (e.g., six months, one or two
years)?
•	 Should implementation be based on a tiered approach that relates to a
characteristic other than the size of the sponsor? Is there any reason to structure
implementation around asset class of the securities?
IX.

General Request for Comments
We request comment on the specific issues we discuss in this release, and on any

other approaches or issues that we should consider in connection with the proposed
amendments. We seek comment from any interested persons, including investors, assetbacked issuers, sponsors, originators, servicers, trustees, disseminators of EDGAR data,
industry analysts, EDGAR filing agents, and any other members of the public.

Paperwork Reduction Act
A.

Background

Certain provisions of the proposed rule amendments contain “collection of
information” requirements within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995
(PRA).498 The Commission is submitting these proposed amendments and proposed rules
to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review in accordance with the

497

Thus, resecuritizations after the implementation date would be subject to the new requirements,
regardless of whether issuance of underlying securities predates the implementation date.

The paperwork burden from Regulation S-K is imposed through the forms that are subject to the
requirements in those regulations and is reflected in the analysis of those forms. To avoid a
Paperwork Reduction Act inventory reflecting duplicative burdens and for administrative
convenience, we assign a one-hour burden to Regulation S-K.

298 


The regulations and forms listed in Nos. 1 through 8 were adopted under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and set forth the disclosure requirements for
registration statements and periodic and current reports filed with respect to asset-backed
securities and other types of securities to inform investors. Regulation S-T specifies the
requirements that govern the submission of electronic documents. Form D is filed by
issuers as a notice of sales without registration under the Securities Act based on the
claim of an exemption under Regulation D of the Securities Act.
The regulations and forms listed in Nos. 9 through 14 are newly proposed
collections of information under the Securities Act and Exchange Act. Form SF-1 and
Form SF-3, if adopted, would represent the new registration forms for offerings of assetbacked securities, as defined in Item 1101(c) of Regulation AB. Form SF-3 would
represent the registration form for offerings that meet certain shelf eligibility conditions
and can be offered on a delayed basis under Rule 415. Form SF-1 would represent the
registration forms for other asset-backed offerings. Asset Data File and Waterfall
Computer Program are proposed new collections of information that would relate to the
regulations and proposed new forms for asset-backed issuers under the Securities Act and
Exchange Act that set forth certain disclosure requirements for registration statements
and periodic and current reports for asset-backed issuers. Under the requirements, an
asset-backed issuer would be required to submit to the Commission specified, tagged
information on assets in the pool underlying the securities and a computer program that
gives effect to the flow of funds or “waterfall” provisions of the transaction agreements.
Form 144A-SF would represent a new notice requirement for certain offerings made in
connection with the safe harbor provided in Rule 144A. Finally, Privately-Issued

299 


Structured Finance Product Disclosure is the disclosure that issuers would be required to
agree to provide to investors when an ABS issuer sells securities that are eligible for
resale under the Rule 144A safe harbor or when an ABS issuer sells securities in reliance
on the Regulation D safe harbor.
Compliance with the proposed amendments would be mandatory except that the
amendments that would impose collection of information requirements on privatelyissued structured finance products would only be required if the issuer is relying on the
safe harbors to which those collection of information requirements relate. Responses to
the information collections would not be kept confidential and there would be no
mandatory retention period for proposed collections of information.
B.

Revisions to PRA Reporting and Cost Burden Estimates

Our PRA burden estimates for each of the existing collections of information,
except for Form 10-D, are based on an average of the time and cost incurred by all types
of public companies, not just ABS issuers, to prepare a particular collection of
information. Form 10-D is a form that is only prepared and filed by ABS issuers. In
2004, we codified requirements for ABS issuers in these regulations and forms,
recognizing that the information relevant to asset-backed securities differs substantially
from that relevant to other securities.
Our PRA burden estimates for the proposed amendments are based on
information that we receive on entities assigned to Standard Industrial Classification
Code 6189, the code used with respect to asset-backed securities, as well as information

300 


from outside data sources.501 When possible, we base our estimates on an average of the
data that we have available for years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. In some
cases, our estimates for the number of asset-backed issuers that file Form 10-D with the
Commission are based on an average of the number of ABS offerings in 2006, 2007,
2008, and 2009.502
1.

Form S-3 and Form SF-3

Our current PRA burden estimate for Form S-3 is 236,959 annual burden hours.
This estimate is based on the assumption that most disclosures required of the issuer are
incorporated by reference from separately filed Exchange Act reports. However, because
an Exchange Act reporting history is not a condition for Form S-3 eligibility for ABS,
ABS issuers using Form S-3 often must present all of the relevant disclosure in the
registration statement rather than incorporate relevant disclosure by reference. Thus, our
current burden estimate for ABS issuers using Form S-3 under existing requirements is
similar to our current burden estimate for ABS issuers using Form S-1. During 2004
through 2009, we received an average of 99 Form S-3 filings annually related to assetbacked securities.
We are proposing to move the requirements for asset-backed issuers into new
forms that would be solely for the registration by offerings of asset-backed securities.
Under our proposal, proposed Form SF-3 would be the ABS shelf equivalent form of
existing Form S-3. For purposes of our calculations, we estimate that the proposals

501

We rely on two outside sources of ABS issuance data. We use the ABS issuance data from AssetBacked Alert on the initial terms of offerings, and we supplement that data with information from
Securities Data Corporation (SDC).
502

Form 10-D was not implemented until 2006. Before implementation of Form 10-D, asset-backed
issuers often filed their distribution reports under cover of Form 8-K.

301 


relating to shelf eligibility and new shelf procedures would cause a 10% movement in the
number of filers (i.e., a decrease of ten registration statements) out of the shelf system
due to the new requirements of risk retention and ongoing reporting for shelf registration
eligibility.503 On the other hand, we estimate the number of shelf registration statements
for ABS issuers would increase by five as a result of the proposed elimination of base and
supplement prospectuses for these issuers.504 Thus, we estimate that the number of shelf
registration statements will decrease by five altogether. Accordingly, we estimate that
the proposals would cause a decrease of 99 ABS filings on Form S-3 and a corresponding
number of 94 Form SF-3s filed annually.505
In 2004, we estimated that an ABS issuer, under the 2004 amendments, would
take an average of 1,250 hours to prepare a Form S-3 to register ABS.506 For registration
statements, we estimate that 25% of the burden of preparation is carried by the company
internally and that 75% of the burden is carried by outside professionals retained by the
registrant at an average cost of $400 per hour.507 In this release, we are proposing new
and revised disclosure requirements for ABS issuers that if adopted, would be a cost to
filing on Form SF-3.
We are proposing a significant new disclosure requirement that the issuer provide
asset-level information for each of the assets in the underlying pool. Credit card ABS
503

We calculated the decrease of ten Form SF-3s by multiplying the average number of Form S-3s
filed (99) by 10 percent.
504

Based on staff reviews, we believe it is very unusual to see ABS registration statements with
multiple unrelated collateral types such as auto loans and student loans. There are occasionally multiple
related collateral types such as HELOCs, subprime mortgages and Alt A mortgages in ABS registration
statements.
505

This is based on the number of registration statements for ABS issuers filed on Form S-3 and the
two changes due to our rule proposal.
506

See 2004 ABS Adopting Release and 2004 ABS Proposing Release.

302 


issuers would be required to provide grouped asset data. Another new disclosure
requirement would be the filing of a waterfall computer program that gives effect to the
waterfall provisions of the transaction. For purposes of the PRA, we are including the
costs relating to providing this disclosure on the assets in the estimate for our newly
proposed collection of information entitled “Asset Data File.” We are also including the
costs related to the filing of the waterfall computer program as a separate collection of
information, as discussed in the section below entitled “Waterfall Computer Program.”
We are also proposing some additional disclosure requirements that may impose some
additional costs to ABS issuers with respect to registration statements.
If the proposals are adopted, we estimate that the incremental burden for ABS
issuers to complete the disclosure requirements in Form SF-3, prepare the information,
and file it with the Commission would be 100 burden hours per response on Form SF-3.
As a result, we estimate that each Form SF-3 would take approximately 1,350 hours to
complete and file.508 We estimate the total internal burden for Form SF-3 to be 31,725
hours and the total related professional costs to be $38,070,000.509 This would result in a
corresponding decrease in Form S-3 burden hours of 30,937.5 and $37,125,000 in
professional costs.510

507

See, e.g., Credit Ratings Disclosure, Release No. 33-9070 (Oct. 7, 2009)[74 FR 53086].

508

The total burden hours to file Form SF-3 are calculated by adding the existing burden hours of
1,250 that we estimate for Form S-3 and the incremental burden of 100 hours imposed by our proposals for
a total of 1,350 total burden hours.
509

To calculate these values, we first multiply the total burden hours per Form SF-3 (1,350) by the
number of Form SF-3s expected under the proposal (94), resulting in 126,900 total burden hours. Then, we
allocate 25 percent of these hours to internal burden, resulting in 31,725 hours. We allocate the remaining
75 percent of the total burden hours to related professional costs and use a rate of $400 per hour to calculate
the external professional costs of $38,070,000.
510

To calculate these values, we first multiply the total burden hours per Form S-3 (1,250) by the
average number of Form S-3s over the period 2004-2009 (99), resulting in 123,750 total burden hours.
Then, we allocate 25 percent of these hours to internal burden, resulting in 30,937.5 hours. We allocate the

303 


2.

Form S-1 and Form SF-1

We are proposing to move the requirements for asset-backed issuers into new
forms that would be solely for the registration of asset-backed issuers. Proposed Form
SF-1 would be the non-shelf equivalent form of existing Form S-1 under our proposal.
As noted above, for purposes of our calculation, we estimate that the new proposals for
shelf eligibility and new shelf procedures would cause small movement in the number of
filers from the shelf system to the non-shelf system. For purposes of the PRA, we
estimate three ABS issuers will move from the shelf system to the non-shelf system of
proposed Form SF-1.511 From 2004 through 2009, an average of four Form S-1s were
filed annually by ABS issuers. Correspondingly, we estimate that the number of filings
on Form SF-1 will be seven, which is the sum of the four average filings per year and the
estimated incremental three filings from shelf to Form SF-1.
For ABS filings on Form S-1, we have used the same estimate of burden per
response that we used for Form S-3, because the disclosures in both filings are similar.512
Even under the proposals, the disclosures would continue to be similar for shelf
registration statements and non-shelf registration statements. The burden for the
proposed requirements for the asset data file and the waterfall computer program to be
filed as exhibits to Form SF-1 are included in the newly proposed collections of
information discussed below rather than in this section for Form SF-1. Thus, we estimate

remaining 75 percent of the total burden hours to related professional costs and use a rate of $400 per hour
to calculate the external professional costs of $37,125,000.
511

We estimate in the section above that the proposals relating to shelf eligibility and new shelf
procedures would cause a ten percent movement in the number of filers out of the shelf system. We
assume, for the purposes of our PRA estimates, that the other filers that do not move to Form SF-1 would
utilize the private markets or offshore offerings for offerings of ABS.
512

See Section IV.B.2 of the 2004 ABS Proposing Release.

304 


that an ABS Form SF-1 filing will impose an incremental burden of 100 hours per
response, which is equal to the incremental burden to file Form SF-3. We estimate the
total number of hours to prepare and file each Form SF-1 at 1,350, the total annual
burden for the issuer at 2362.5 hours and added costs for professional expenses at
$2,835,000.513 This would result in a corresponding decrease in Form S-1 burden hours
of 1,250 and $1,500,000 in professional costs.514
3. Form 10-K
The ongoing periodic and current reporting requirements applicable to operating
companies differ substantially from the reporting that is most relevant to investors in
asset-backed securities. For asset-backed issuers, in addition to a limited menu of Form
10-K disclosure items, the issuer must file a servicer compliance statement, a servicer’s
assessment of compliance with servicing criteria, and an attestation of an independent
public accountant as exhibits to the Form 10-K.
One of our proposed ABS shelf eligibility conditions (i.e., criteria that must be
met in order to be eligible to register ABS on Form SF-3) would require the issuer to
undertake to file Exchange Act reports as long as non-affiliates hold any of its securities
that were sold in registered transactions. Except for master trust issuers, the requirement
to file Form 10-K for ABS issuers is typically suspended after the year of initial issuance
513

The total burden hours to file Form SF-1 are calculated by adding the existing burden hours of
1,250 and the incremental burden of 100 hours imposed by our proposals for a total of 1,350 hours. To
calculate the annual internal and external costs, we first multiply the total burden hours per Form SF-1
(1,350) by the number of Form SF-1s expected under the proposal (7), resulting in 9,450 total burden
hours. Then, we allocate 25 percent of these hours to internal burden, resulting in 2,363.5 hours. We
allocate the remaining 75 percent of the total burden hours to related professional costs and use a rate of
$400 per hour to calculate the external professional costs of $2,835,000.
514

To calculate these values, we first multiply the total burden hours per Form S-1 (1,250) by the
average number of Form S-1s filed during 2004-2009 (4), resulting in 5,000 total burden hours. Then, we
allocate 25 percent of these hours to internal burden, resulting in 1,250 hours. We allocate the remaining

305 


because the issuer has fewer than 300 security holders of record.515 Therefore, the
incremental impact to the number of Forms 10-K filed by ABS issuers would increase
each year after the proposal is adopted by the number of ABS shelf offerings. The yearly
average of ABS registered shelf offerings with the Commission over the period from
2004 to 2009 was 929.516 In the first year after implementation, we use 958, which is the
average number of all offerings over 2004-2009, as an estimate for the number of Forms
10-K we expect to receive. In the second year after implementation, we increase our
estimate of the number of Forms 10-K expected by 929 to a total of 1,887. In the third
year after implementation, the addition of another 929 brings the total to 2,817. The
average number of Forms 10-K over three years would, therefore, be 1,887. As a result,
for PRA purposes, we estimate an increase in Form 10-K filings of 929 filings.
We estimate that, for Exchange Act reports, 75% of the burden of preparation is
carried by the company internally and that 25% of the burden is carried by outside
professionals retained by the registrant at an average cost of $400 per hour. In 2004, we
estimated that 120 hours would be needed to complete and file a Form 10-K for an ABS
issuer. We estimate that our proposals relating to Form 10-K would not increase the
estimate for the time needed to complete and file Form 10-K for an ABS issuer.
However, our proposed amendments may have a limited impact on the
preparation of Form 10-K for the sponsor of the ABS issuer, if the sponsor is a company
that is required to report under the Exchange Act. Though we are not proposing changes

75 percent of the total burden hours to related professional costs and use a rate of $400 per hour to calculate
the external professional costs of $1,500,000.
515

See Exchange Act Section 15(d).

516

The 929 ABS registered shelf offerings is 97 percent of the average yearly number of ABS
offerings from 2004 through 2009.

306

to Form 10-K disclosure requirements for sponsors, our proposals may impact the work
that sponsors would have to do to disclose in their Form 10-K the securities they are
required to hold as a result of the proposals and the investments they make to manage
risks associated with the new requirements. We estimate that our proposals will cause an
increase in the number of hours the sponsor will incur to prepare, review and file Form
10-K by 10 hours. From 2004 to 2009, the number of unique ABS sponsors was 343, for
an average of 57 unique sponsors per year. Therefore, we estimate that, for PRA
purposes, the total annual increase in the number of hours to prepare, review, and file
Form 10-K would be 112,050.517 We allocate 75% of those hours (84,038 hours) to
internal burden and the remaining 25% to external costs totaling $11,205,000 using a rate
of $400 per hour.
4. Form 10-D
In 2004, we adopted Form 10-D as a new form for only asset-backed issuers.
This form is filed within 15 days of each required distribution date on the asset-backed
securities, as specified in the governing documents for such securities. The form contains
periodic distribution and pool performance information. We have derived an estimate of
the number of Form 10-Ds filed by registered ABS issuers using the average annual
number of ABS registered offerings completed over the period 2004-2009.518 The
average over those years was 958 offerings annually.

517

The 112,050 total burden hours are calculated by adding the impact on ABS issuers, which equals
929 incremental Forms 10-K times 120 burden hours per filing, and the impact on sponsors of ABS issuers,
which equals 57 sponsors times 10 incremental burden hours.
518

Even though we adopted Form 10-D in 2004 and its implementation was not effective until 2006,
we use the longer time period of 2004-2009 to match the years used for our estimate of the expected Form
10-Ks to be filed.

307 


As discussed above, we are proposing to require, as a condition to shelf eligibility,
an undertaking from the issuer that it will continue to file Exchange Act reports as long as
non-affiliates hold any of its securities that were sold in registered transactions. As with
the Form 10-K, we believe that our proposals would result in an increase in the number
of Form 10-Ds filed. Except for master trust issuers, the requirement to file Form 10-D
for ABS issuers is typically suspended after the year of initial issuance because the issuer
has fewer than 300 security holders of record.519 Therefore, the incremental impact to the
number of Forms 10-D filed by ABS issuers would increase each year after the proposal
is adopted by the number of ABS shelf offerings older than one year where any of its
securities are held by non-affiliates. From 2004 to 2009, the yearly average of ABS
registered shelf offerings filed with the Commission was 929.520 Since Form 10-D is
required on a periodic basis based on the distribution schedule of the security, we
estimate the total number of Form 10-Ds filed in the first year after implementation to be
5,748.521 In the second year after implementation, we increase our estimate of the
number of Forms 10-D expected by 5,576 for a total of 11,324.522 In the third year after
implementation, the addition of another 5,576 brings the total to 16,899. The average
number of Forms 10-D over three years would, therefore, be 11,324. Therefore, for PRA
purposes, we estimate an increase in Form 10-D filings of 5,576 filings.
519

See Exchange Act Section 15(d).

520

The 929 ABS registered shelf offerings is 97 percent of the average yearly number of ABS
offerings from 2004 through 2009.
521

We are estimating that the number of Forms 10-D per year would be a multiple of six times the
number of offerings per year (958) for a total of 5,748 Form 10-D filings per year. Different types of assetbacked securities have different distribution periods, and the Form 10-D is filed each distribution period.
We derived the multiplier of six by comparing the number of Forms 10-D that have been filed since 2006
with the number of Forms 10-K (which are only required to be filed once a year) that have been filed.

308 


In 2004, we estimated that it would take 30 hours to complete and file Form 10­
D.523 As discussed below, we are proposing to add asset-level disclosure requirements
that relate to ongoing performance of the assets to the requirements of Form 10-D. For
credit card ABS issuers, we are proposing to add to Form 10-D a requirement that such
issuers provide grouped asset data. Those proposed requirements are included in our
estimate of the asset-level disclosure collection of information requirements, as discussed
below in the section entitled “Asset Data File.” We believe that our other proposed
revisions to Form 10-D would not increase the burden hours for the form. Therefore, we
estimate that the total annual increase in the number of hours to prepare, review, and file
Form 10-D would be 167,280.524 We allocate 75% of those hours (125,460 hours) to
internal burden and the remaining 25% to external costs totaling $16,728,000 using a rate
of $400 per hour.
5. Form 8-K
Our current PRA estimate for Form 8-K is based on the use of the report to
disclose the occurrence of certain defined reportable events, some of which are applicable
to asset-backed securities.
The number of ABS issuers filing Form 8-Ks on an annual basis may be affected
by our proposal to require an ABS issuer that wishes to be shelf-eligible to undertake to
file Exchange Act reports on an ongoing basis. In addition, our proposal to revise
existing Item 6.05 of Form 8-K, which currently requires disclosure for any change in the
522

We calculate the incremental number of Forms 10-D by multiplying our previous estimate of 929
shelf offerings per year by our estimate of six Forms 10-D filed per offering for a total of 5,576 filings per
year.
523

See the 2004 ABS Adopting Release.

524

The burden hours are calculated by multiplying 5,576 incremental Forms 10-D by the 30 burden
hours required to complete the form for a total of 167,280 hours.

309

actual asset pool over five percent from the description in the prospectus, by instead
requiring an ABS issuer to instead provide information for any change equal to or greater
than one percent in the asset pool from the prospectus description, may lead to an
increase of Form 8-K filings.525 We are also proposing to add a requirement that the
sponsor provide disclosure on Form 8-K for a material change in its interest in the
transaction.526
In 2004, we estimated that the new items added to Form 8-K to address ABS
disclosure would cause an increase of two reports on Form 8-K per ABS issuer per
year.527 We estimate that our proposals would cause an increase of 1.5 reports on Form
8-K per ABS issuer per year, or a total of approximately 1,437 additional reports per
year.528
In 2004, we estimated that an average ABS issuer would spend about five hours
completing the form.529 We estimate that the average burden for the disclosure per Form
8-K would remain relatively the same. Accordingly, we estimate the total annual
increase in the number of hours to prepare, review, and file Form 8-K would be 7,185,
with 75% of those hours (5,389) allocated to internal burden and the remaining 25%
allocated to external costs of $718,500 using a rate of $400 per hour.530

525

Our estimate here does not include an increase that would result in filing Item 6.06 or Item 6.07
Forms 8-K which are instead included in the our burden estimate for the newly proposed collection of
information requirements for asset-level data and the waterfall computer program.
526

See existing Item 6.03 of Form 8-K.

The number of ABS offerings is based on the average number of ABS deals issued annually over
2004 through 2009.

530

The total burden hours are calculated by multiplying the expected number of Form 8-K reports per
year (1,437) times the estimated hours per filing (5) for a total of 7,185. Then, we allocate 75 percent of
these hours to internal burden, resulting in 5,389 hours. We allocate the remaining 25 percent of the total

6. Regulation S-K and Regulation S-T
Regulation S-K, which includes the item requirements in Regulation AB, contains
the requirements for disclosure that an issuer must provide in filings under both the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act. As noted above, Regulation S-T contains the
requirements that govern the electronic submission of documents. In 2004, we noted that
the collection of information requirements associated with Regulation S-K as it applies to
ABS issuers are included in Form S-1, Form S-3, Form 10-K and Form 8-K. We assign
one burden hour to Regulation S-K for administrative convenience to reflect that the
changes to the regulation did not impose a direct burden on companies.531
The proposed changes would make revisions to Regulation S-K and Regulation S­
T. The collection of information requirements, however, are reflected in the burden
hours estimated for the various Securities Act and Exchange Act forms related to ABS
issuers. The rules in Regulation S-K and Regulation S-T do not impose any separate
burden. Consistent with historical practice, we have retained an estimate of one burden
hour each to Regulation S-T and Regulation S-K for administrative convenience.
7. Asset Data File
This new collection of information corresponds to asset data file information
requirements that we are proposing to add to proposed Form SF-1, proposed Form SF-3,
Form 10-D, and Form 8-K. They would be required to appear in exhibits to these forms.
Our proposed standard definitions for asset-level information are similar to, and in part
based on, other standards that have been developed by the industry, such as those

burden hours to related professional costs and use a rate of $400 per hour to calculate the external
professional costs of $718,500.
531

See 2004 ABS Adopting Release.

311

developed under ASF’s Project RESTART and those developed by the CRE Finance
Council (formerly CMSA). These proposed standard definitions employ widely used
metrics relating to asset-level information and, based on discussions with the industry, we
believe that much of asset-level information may already be available for collection,
although the format of such information may not be the one that we propose to require.
We also believe that first year implementation costs may be much more significant than
ongoing implementation costs.
An ABS issuer filing on proposed Form SF-1 or proposed Form SF-3 would be
required to provide this new information. For the most part, this new information would
be provided at the time that the newly proposed Rule 424(h) filing is required to be filed,
at the time the final prospectus is required to be filed, and after there are certain changes
to the pool, such as the substitution or addition of assets. Certain information would be
required to be filed on an ongoing basis. We believe the information is currently
available to the ABS issuer but additional time and expense will be involved in including
the information in registration statements in the format that we are proposing.
The requirements are tailored by asset class. All asset classes except credit card
receivables and stranded costs are required to provide asset-level information on each
asset in the pool. Information relating to the performance of the assets would be required
to be filed on an ongoing basis. Credit card ABS issuers would be required to provide
grouped asset data, both at the time of securitization and on an ongoing basis. The
grouped asset data could be incorporated by reference (from a previously filed Form 10­
D).

312 


We believe that the costs of implementation would include software costs, costs
to tag the required data, costs of maintaining the required information, and costs of filing.
The number of unique ABS sponsors over 2004-2009 was 343, for an average of 57
unique sponsors per year. We estimate that there are 10 unique sponsors of credit card
securitizations over a three-year period (or three unique sponsors per year). We base our
burden estimates for this collection of information on the assumption that most of the
costs of implementation of the proposed asset-level data filing requirements would be
incurred before the sponsor files its first asset-level data filing in compliance with the
proposed rules. Because asset-backed issuers are currently required by Regulation AB to
file pool-level information on the assets in the underlying pool,532 we assume, for
purposes of our PRA estimates, that much of the information that is required to be
provided by the new disclosure requirements should be accessible from existing sponsor
data systems.
Because of the number of fields involved, our estimates for the proposed assetlevel requirements are based on EDGAR data on RMBS and CMBS issuers. We estimate
that, for purposes of the PRA burden estimate for the asset-level disclosure requirements,
approximately two percent of the proposed asset-level data fields that are required at the
time of securitization and approximately two percent of the asset-level data fields that are
required on an ongoing basis would require the sponsor to adjust its systems and
procedures for collecting information on each asset. We estimate that, for purposes of an
initial filing of asset-level information at the time of securitization, a sponsor would be
required to expend at least 18 minutes for each item where adjustments must be made for
532

Also, some registered issuers may be providing asset-level information to investors, although such
information is not standardized.

313 


each asset in a pool. We estimate that an RMBS sponsor would incur a one-time setup
cost for the initial filing of 3,194 hours to adjust its existing systems to provide the
required information at the time of securitization for each asset in the initial filing, 86
hours for a CMBS sponsor, and 2,010 hours for a credit card receivables sponsor.533
After a sponsor has made the necessary adjustments to its systems and after an initial
filing of asset-level data has been made, we estimate that subsequent filings for assetlevel data will take approximately ten hours to prepare, review, and file. For credit card
ABS sponsors, grouped asset data may be incorporated by reference, as proposed, and
therefore, we are not including additional costs for subsequent filings by a credit card
master trust.
Similarly, we estimate that for purposes of an initial filing of asset-level ongoing
information, a sponsor would be required to expend at least 18 minutes for each item
where adjustments must be made for each asset in a pool. We estimate that an RMBS
sponsor would incur a one-time set-up cost of 3,811 hours to adjust its existing systems to
provide the required ongoing information for each asset in the initial filing, 92 hours for a
CMBS sponsor, while a credit card receivables sponsor would not incur additional setup
costs for ongoing information.534 After a sponsor has made the necessary adjustments to

533

For RMBS and CMBS issuers, this is based on an average pool size for RMBS of 3,317 assets and
an average pool size for CMBS of 165 assets and also includes ten hours for tagging and filing the required
asset-level disclosure. Because we believe that the information that is required by the proposed grouped
asset data requirement would be information that a credit card ABS sponsor already collects in its existing
systems, we believe the initial set-up costs for a sponsor would not include expenses necessary to adjust
systems to collect new information. However, a sponsor may expend some additional effort for other
adjustments due to the requirement and therefore, we estimate that the initial filing of grouped asset data
would require 2000 hours for a credit card ABS sponsor, plus an added ten hours for tagging and filing the
information.
534

For RMBS and CMBS issuers, this is based on an average pool size for RMBS of 3,317 assets and
an average pool size for CMBS of 165 assets and also includes ten hours for tagging and filing the required
asset-level disclosure. We do not believe that sponsors credit card receivables would incur additional setup

314 


its systems in connection with the proposed rule and, after an initial filing of asset-level
ongoing information has been made, we estimate that subsequent filings for asset-level
ongoing information by a sponsor will take approximately ten hours to prepare, review,
and file. We estimate that filings of grouped asset data for credit card ABS issuers would
take approximately ten hours to prepare, review and file.
Based on the number of loans that may be securitized in a particular offering and
the asset-level requirements for each of the asset classes, and the number of offerings for
each of the asset classes, we estimate that the total annual burden hours for preparing,
tagging and filing asset-level disclosure or grouped asset data at the time of securitization
will be 151,368.535 We allocate 25% of those hours (37,842.04) to internal burden hours
for all ABS issuers and 75% of the hours to out-of pocket expenses for software
consulting and filing agent costs at a rate of $250 per hour totaling $28,381,527.95. We
estimate that the average annual hours for preparing, tagging and filing asset-level
disclosure or grouped asset data on an ongoing basis with the Form 10-D will be 207,009
hours for all ABS issuers.536 We allocated 75% of those hours (155,256.5 hours) to
internal burden hours and 25% of those hours for out-of-pocket expenses for software

costs for filing grouped asset data information on an ongoing basis since the information that is filed on an
ongoing basis is the same information that is required at the time of securitization
535

We apportion the burden according to the proportion of offerings in each asset class using the
following asset classes: (1) CMBS, (2) Credit Cards, (3) RMBS and other. We believe that using the
RMBS estimates to represent the burden for other asset classes offers a conservative burden estimate
because of the number of data items necessary for RMBS. To calculate the proportions, we divide the
average number of offerings per year for each asset class (79 for credit cards, 43 for CMBS, and 836 for
RMBS or other asset classes) by the average number of offerings for all asset classes (958).
536

Again, we apportion the burden according to the proportion of offerings in each asset class using
the following asset classes: (1) CMBS, (2) Credit Cards, (3) RMBS and other. We believe that using the
RMBS estimates to represent the burden for other asset classes offers a conservative burden estimate
because of the number of data items necessary for RMBS. To calculate the proportions, we divide the
average number of offerings per year for each asset class (79 for credit cards, 43 for CMBS, and 836 for
RMBS or other asset classes) by the average number of offerings for all asset classes (958).

315 


consulting and filing agent costs at a rate of $250 per hour totaling $12,938,042.83.
Thus, we estimate the total annual incremental burden for the asset-level disclosure
requirements or grouped asset data at 193,098.6 hours537 and the added total amount of
out-pocket expenses for software and filing agent costs at $41,319,570.78.538
8. Waterfall Computer Program
While the proposed requirement that ABS issuers file machine-readable computer
code detailing the waterfall of the ABS securities issued would be a new collection of
information, we believe issuers already produce such a code to structure the ABS deal.
However, issuers would bear the costs of converting the code that they typically create
into code that meets our proposed requirements. We believe that a substantial portion of
those costs will be incurred for each sponsor at the time of implementation of the rule to
set up mechanisms to convert the typical program used for waterfall purposes.
Some examples of the need for such mechanisms are: (i) waterfall programs
written in languages not directly portable to Python that will have to be adapted to the
Python language, (ii) code within the waterfall program that is not required by the rule or
necessary for investors to use and understand the waterfall may need to be removed or
adapted for the program to run as required by the rule, (iii) and additional functionality of
the program, such as a user interface to input assumptions or to input the asset data file,
not currently used by sponsors will have to be incorporated. We estimate that issuers will
incur a one-time setup cost of 672 hours to create such mechanisms to meet this filing

537

193,098.6 = 37,842.04 + 155,256.5

$41,319,570.78 = $28,381,527.95 + $12,938,042.83.

316 


requirement.539 Additionally, we estimate a two-hour burden at the time of filing for
each ABS deal for which a waterfall program is required to be filed to verify that the
mechanisms worked properly and that the program meets the requirements of the rule.
As noted above, the number of unique ABS sponsors over 2004-2009 was 343,
for an average of 57 unique sponsors per year. Therefore, we estimate that it would take
a total of 38,304 hours for ABS issuers to set up the mechanisms to file the waterfall
computer program.540 We allocate 25 percent of these hours (9,576 hours) to internal
burden for all sponsors. For the remaining 75 percent of these hours (28,728 hours), we
use an estimate of $250 per hour for the costs of computer programmers to derive an
external cost of $7,182,000.541
The yearly burden at the time of filing for each deal is estimated to be 1,916
hours.542 For PRA purposes we allocate 25% of these hours (479 hours) to internal
burden hours and 75% for out-of-pocket expenses for professional costs totaling
$574,800 using a rate of $400 per hour. Therefore, the total internal burden hours are
10,055 and the total external costs are $7,756,800.543

539

The value of 672 hours for setup costs is based on staff experience and is calculated using an
estimate of two computer programmers for two months, which equals 21 days per month times two
employees times two months times eight hours per day.
540

The burden of 38,304 hours to set up mechanisms to file the waterfall program is calculated by
multiplying the average number of unique sponsors (57) by the estimated set up hours per sponsor (672).
541

Multiplying the 28,728 external cost hours by the $250 per hour estimate results in the external
cost of $7,182,000.
542

Multiplying the average number of ABS issues per year (958) by the burden hours at the time of
filing each deal (2.0) results in 1,916 hours.
543

We sum the internal burden hours from setup of the waterfall code mechanisms (9,576) and the
per-offering internal filing burden hours (479) to get the total internal burden of 10,055. The total external
cost of $7,756,800 is calculated by adding the cost from setup ($7,182,000) and the cost from filing each
waterfall at the time of offering ($574,800).

317 


9. Form 144A-SF and Form D
Form 144A-SF is a new collection of information that would cover the notice of
sales of asset-backed securities that would be required under the proposed revisions to
Rule 144A. This notice would contain information related to major participants in the
securitization, the date of the offering, the type of securities offered, the basic structure of
the securitization and the principal amount of the securities offered. Over the period
2004-2009, the annual average number of Rule 144A ABS offerings was 716.544
We believe that the burden assigned to Form 144A-SF should reflect the cost of
preparing the notice and the cost of filing the notice. We estimate that preparing, tagging,
and filing the Form 144A-SF will require approximately 2.0 hours per response. Using
the annual average of 716 Rule 144A offerings, the total burden hours equals 1,432. We
allocate 25% as a burden to the seller and 75% as costs of counsel utilized for the
preparation and filing of the form. Therefore, the incremental annual impact of Form
144A-SF will be 358 hours and $429,600 in professional costs using an hourly rate of
$400.
Form D is an existing collection of information under the PRA. Form D is a
notice of sales for offerings made under Regulation D. Currently, we estimate that the
burden hours of Form D to be approximately 4.0 hours per response, of which one hour is
borne internally and three hours are borne externally. Under the proposal, Form D would
be revised to collect, in addition to the information that the form currently collects, the
same information as proposed Form 144A-SF when filed in connection with an ABS

544

This is based on ABS issuance data from Asset-Backed Alert and information from Securities
Data Corporation (SDC).

318 


offering. We are aware of only one Form D filed for an ABS offering in 2009.545 Thus,
we believe that the change to this collection of information should be very small. For
PRA purposes, we estimate that the Form D filing burden would not increase. Therefore,
we continue to estimate that the burden hours for Form D will be 4.0 hours.
10. Privately-Issued Structured Finance Product Disclosure
This new collection of information relates to proposed disclosure requirements
for structured finance product issuers that wish to take advantage of the safe harbors
provided by Rule 144A, Regulation D and Rule 144. Under the proposed amendments,
such issuers would be required to provide the purchaser or prospective purchaser with the
same information that would be required if the offering were registered with the
Commission. Some of the information that is required for registered offerings, we
believe, is being provided to investors who purchase structured finance products in the
private markets.546 For purposes of the PRA, we are assuming that the hours that private
structured finance product issuers expend to provide information to investors are
approximately the same hours that would be required to prepare information in the
registered context. Therefore, our estimate for this new collection of information will be
based on the incremental costs that the proposed amendments in this release would
include. Although information for a private ABS issuer is not required to be filed with
the Commission, the cost of preparing such information should be relatively the same as

545

We believe typically private offerings of ABS are conducted pursuant to Section 4(2) of the
Securities Act without reliance on the safe harbor of Regulation D and are followed by resale(s) of the
securities in reliance on Rule 144A.
546

Because of the lack of transparency in the private structured finance product market, we do not
have estimates regarding the amount of information and completion time that a typical private structured
finance product issuer will need in order to provide investors offering and ongoing information nor
estimates of the cost of such information. As discussed below, we are requesting comment on this
information.

319 


the estimated burdens for preparing and filing information required in the registered
context. We estimate that it will take approximately 300 hours per offering to prepare
additional offering information that would be required under the proposed amendments.
This is based on the incremental cost of the proposed amendments to ABS issuers that
register their offerings with the Commission, along with the cost estimates for the asset
data file that would be filed at the time of securitization and the waterfall computer
program that we are proposing to require be filed for each ABS offering. Under our
proposal, ABS issuers that relied on the safe harbors would be required to provide the
same ongoing information that would be required in registered offerings. We estimate
that it will take an issuer approximately 18 hours to complete a distribution report
accompanied by asset-level and grouped asset data ongoing information for the
distribution period. This is based on the incremental costs of providing Form 10-K, Form
10-D, and Form 8-K reports, which would comprise of the cost estimates for the asset
data file that is required to be filed on an ongoing basis, as proposed.
As noted above, the average number of private offerings of ABS per year
pursuant to Rule 144A over the period 2004-2009 was 716. Based on that number, we
estimate an average number of 8,592 ongoing reports containing distribution information
and ongoing asset data file information would be provided to investors each year,547 and a
total of 716 annual reports that would be provided to investors each year. Therefore, at
the time of securitization, we estimate that the proposed collection of information will

547

This is based on an average number of such ongoing reports that we estimate private structured
finance product issuers would provide to investors over the three years after implementation. Consistent
with our estimates in the registered context, we estimate that issuers would provide such ongoing reports at
a multiple of six times the number of offerings per year.

320 


impose a total annual burden of 214,791 hours,548 with 25% of the cost borne internally
(53,698 hours) and the remainder of hours paid to outside professionals or software
consulting and programming costs ($48,328,318).549 For information that is provided on
an ongoing basis, we estimate that the proposed collection of information will impose a
total annual burden of 157,067 hours,550 with 75% of the cost borne internally (117,800
hours) and the remainder paid to outside professionals or software consulting costs
($9,816,658).551 Thus, the total estimate for internal burden hours is 171,498,552 and the
total estimate for outside costs is $58,144,976.553
11. Summary of Proposed Changes to Annual Burden Compliance in
Collection of Information
Table 1 illustrates the changes in annual compliance burden in the collection of
information in hours and costs for existing reports and registration statements and for the
proposed new registration statements for asset-backed issuers. Below, the asset data file
is annotated as “Asset Data,” the waterfall computer formula is annotated as “WCP”, and
privately-issued structured-finance disclosure is annotated as “P-SF.” Bracketed numbers
indicate a decrease in the estimate.

548

We calculate the total annual burden of 214,791 hours by multiplying the expected number of
filings per year (716) times the burden hours per securitization filing (300).
549

We estimate that hours related to providing asset-level information and the waterfall computer
program is allocated to software consulting or other labor costs ($22,621,125) at a cost of $250 per hour
and hours related to providing other types of information is allocated to costs of outside professionals
($21,480,000) at a cost of $400 per hour.
550

We calculate the total annual burden of 157,067 hours by adding the total number of hours we
believe it would take to provide ongoing asset-level information (18 hours*8,592 reports).
551

We estimate that hours relating to asset-level information paid to software consultants or other
labor costs would be paid at cost of $250 per hour.

171,498 = 53,698 + 117,800

Benefit-Cost Analysis
A.

Background

The proposed amendments to our regulations and forms for asset-backed
securities relate to the offering process, disclosure and reporting requirements for these
securities. We also are proposing amendments to safe harbor rules for exempt offerings
and resales to require additional disclosure by ABS issuers. In this section, we examine
the benefits and costs of our proposed rules in each of these areas. We request that
commenters provide their views along with supporting data as to the benefits and costs of
the proposed amendments.
First, we are proposing to revise shelf registration for ABS issuers and create new
registration forms that would be applicable only to ABS offerings. Under the proposals,
for ABS issuers that wish to register their offerings on a shelf basis, for offerings to be
conducted after the shelf registration statement is effective, transaction-specific
information relating to each offering of securities must be filed with the Commission at
least five business days ahead of the first sale in the offering. We also are proposing to
replace the existing shelf eligibility requirement that the securities must be investment
grade rated by an NRSRO with alternate requirements. Instead of the investment grade
ratings requirement, the following would be required for any offering off the shelf
registration statement:

324 


•	 the sponsor must retain a portion of each tranche of the securities sold in the
offering, net of hedging and on an ongoing basis;
•	 the chief executive officer of the depositor must certify that the securitized
assets backing the issue have characteristics that provide a reasonable basis to
believe that they will produce, taking into account internal credit
enhancements, cash flows at times and in amounts necessary to service any
payments of the securities as described in the prospectus;
•	 the pooling and servicing agreement must contain a provision that would
require third party review for assets that were not repurchased or replaced by
an obligated party after being put back for breach of a representation or
warranty; and
•	 the ABS issuer must undertake to file Exchange Act reports so long as nonaffiliates of the depositor hold any of the issuer’s securities sold in registered
transactions.
We also are proposing to eliminate the exception from the 48-hour preliminary
prospectus delivery requirement for ABS adopted in 2004 under Exchange Act 15c2­
8(b), such that in connection with all issuances of ABS, regardless of whether the issuer
has previously been required to file reports pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, or exempted from the reporting requirements by Section 12(h) of the
Exchange Act, broker-dealers would be subject to the 48-hour preliminary prospectus
delivery requirement. Further, we are proposing several revisions to enhance the
disclosures made by asset-backed issuers in prospectuses and Exchange Act reports. For
most asset classes, we are proposing to require information regarding each asset in the

325 


pool in addition to the existing requirements relating to pool-level disclosures. Issuers of
ABS backed by credit card receivables would be required to provide grouped asset data.
This information would be provided according to standardized definitions and filed with
the Commission in XML. In addition, we are proposing to require that ABS issuers file a
computer program on EDGAR that gives effect to the flow of funds, or “waterfall,” of the
transaction. This computer program would be required to provide users with the ability
to input the asset data file and other assumptions.
We also are proposing revisions to our disclosure requirements for ABS issuers
that would require, among other things:
•	 additional information on exception loans;
•	 enhanced static pool disclosure;
•	 disclosure regarding the loans that were put back to the originator or sponsor
for repurchase;
•	 additional information regarding an originator, including its interest in the
securitization and, to the extent there is material risk that the financial
condition of the originator could have a material impact on the origination of
the originator’s assets in the pool or on its ability to comply with provisions
relating to the repurchase obligations for assets, its financial condition;
•	 additional information regarding a sponsor, including its interest in the
securitization and, to the extent there is a material risk that the financial
condition could have a material impact on its ability to comply with the
provisions relating to the repurchase obligations for assets or otherwise
materially impact the pool, its financial condition;

326 


•	 a description of the standards in the pooling and servicing agreement for
modifying the terms of the underlying assets;
•	 a statement whether the pooling and servicing agreement contains a fraud
representation; and
•

the description of the flow of funds in a single place in the prospectus.

We also are proposing revisions to the definition of an asset-backed security to further
restrict the type of security that may be sold under the framework set forth in Regulation
AB. While securities that do not meet the proposed definition may still be registered with
the Commission, an issuer may need to provide additional disclosure regarding the
securities and consider issues that are not contemplated by Regulation AB. We are
proposing to limit the amount of prefunding accounts and revolving periods that may be
utilized under the definition, and we are proposing to exclude master trusts that are
backed by non-revolving assets (e.g., mortgages) from the definition.
We also address privately-issued structured finance products in our proposals. In
order to foster additional transparency in the exempt securitization markets, we propose
to require the issuer to agree to provide additional disclosure to the investor for any resale
made under the Rule 144A safe harbor or offering under the Regulation D safe harbor.
We also are proposing to amend the current public information requirement in Rule 144
to require that, in order to satisfy that requirement, in the case of a non-reporting ABS
issuer, the issuer must agree to provide additional disclosure to the investor. In addition,
we propose to require that the issuer file with the Commission a notice of the sales for the
initial placement of securities that are to be sold under Rule 144A that provides basic
information on the sale and a description of the securities sold.

327

Benefits

The proposed amendments are designed to increase investor protection by
improving the disclosure and offering process of asset-backed securities, and thereby
enhancing the transparency of the securitization market. This should result in an increase
in investors’ understanding of the underlying pool of assets.
In 2009, there were 87 registered ABS offerings as compared to 1,306 in 2004.555
The market for securitized assets has suffered dramatically, in part due to the perception
of inadequacies in the disclosure and transparency of the underlying pool of assets in the
securitization process.556 Securitization is a large component of borrowing and lending,
which can benefit borrowers by lowering borrower costs.557
1.

Securities Act Registration

The lack of time to adequately consider deal-specific information in an offering
has been a longstanding concern of ABS investors, as discussed in the 2004 Adopting
Release.558 Based on our experience with the financial crisis, we continue to have
concerns regarding the lack of time for investors to analyze asset-backed securities. By
requiring that information about the specific offering be filed at least five business days
before first sale, we seek to provide investors with the benefit of additional time to value
and assess the issuance.

555

This is based on data from Asset-Backed Alert and information from Securities Data Corporation.

328 


Unlike other types of securities, the payments on asset-backed securities primarily
depend on the credit quality of the assets in the underlying pool. Each offering of assetbacked securities involves a new set of assets, which requires investment analysis to be
done anew. Our proposal to require an issuer to file a form of preliminary prospectus at
least five business days ahead of first sale seeks to give investors additional time to
review offering documents without unduly burdening issuers.559 We believe that this
additional time will benefit investors by increasing their ability to assess an offering and
to perform a better analysis of information provided by the parties to the securitization.
This in turn should lead to better investment decisions.
We believe that investment grade credit ratings may no longer be an appropriate
criterion for use as a shelf eligibility requirement for ABS.560 In addition to promoting
independent analysis, we believe that replacing investment grade ratings requirement for
shelf eligibility conditions for ABS offerings would reduce the appearance that the
Commission has placed an imprimatur on credit ratings.
Our proposed risk retention requirement for shelf-registration eligibility is aimed
at better aligning the incentives of an ABS sponsor with those of investors. By doing so,
risk retention provides investors with an assurance that the quality and characteristics of
the underlying assets are consistent with the disclosures and representations of the
sponsor. The proposed risk-retention requirement may also make it more likely that
sponsors select assets of higher quality for the pool than they would have, absent the
559

We are also proposing to repeal the exception for asset-backed securities from the 48-hour
preliminary prospectus delivery requirement in Rule 15c2-8(b). The 48-hour preliminary prospectus
delivery requirement would apply to all ABS issuers, including those exempted from the requirement to file
reports pursuant to section 12(h) of the Exchange Act.

329 


requirement. Thus, although we do not believe that risk retention would result in only
investment-grade ABS being shelf-registered, we do nonetheless consider it an
appropriate partial replacement for the existing shelf eligibility condition that ABS have
investment-grade rating.
We are proposing to require the sponsor to retain five percent of each tranche, net
of hedging and on an ongoing basis. Spreading the sponsor’s economic interest across all
tranches evenly is designed to better address the overall risk assessment and quality of the
entire offering rather than only aspects that relate to a specific tranche. Risk retention in
the amount of five percent of a tranche is aimed at increasing alignment of incentives of
transaction participants in securitizations that will in turn lead to better performing
securities without placing an undue burden on issuers.
We note that our proposal only mandates the minimum amount of risk that the
issuer is required to retain to have access to shelf registration. A sponsor may voluntarily
retain an amount in a tranche greater than that required by our proposed requirement,
which could alter the alignment in incentives between the sponsor and the investor.
We also are proposing that, in the case of revolving exposures, a sponsor can meet
the risk retention requirement by retaining the originator’s interest of not less than five
percent. This is proposed to accommodate the special structure of revolving asset master
trusts. For example, credit card ABS issuers already retain a seller’s percentage that is
equivalent to a portion of the pool.561 Allowing an alternative to the proposed vertical
slice requirement for these particular ABS sponsors would benefit investors by allowing

561

The originator’s interest, also known as the “seller’s interest,” also may serve an additional
function of absorbing seasonal fluctuations in credit card receivables balance. See Fitch IBCA, ABCs of
Credit Card ABS, July 17, 1998; Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Manual on Credit Card ABS,
available at http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/examinations/credit_card_securitization/.

330 


incentive alignment aimed at achieving better quality assets to be compatible with the
nature of revolving assets.
Requiring the sponsor to meet the risk retention condition rather than the
originator may provide benefits to both originators and investors. We are aware that
smaller originators may not have the resources to retain such risks. In addition, by not
placing the requirement on originators, these institutions could have greater capital
resources available to make loans which could ultimately benefit borrowers and financial
systems as a whole. We are also aware that implementing an originator-based risk
retention requirement would be difficult in a securitization involving multiple originators
and may unnecessarily increase the cost of such securitizations.
We believe that our proposal requiring the pooling and servicing agreement or
other governing document for an ABS shelf transaction to contain a provision that
requires third party loan review of loans that are not repurchased or replaced by the
originator after being put back because of a breach in a representation or warranty should
strengthen the enforcement mechanisms surrounding representations and warranties for
shelf transactions. ABS investors have expressed concerns with the integrity and
enforceability of bargained-for contractual provisions in underlying transaction
documents ABS offerings.562 By requiring that the third party be unaffiliated, investors
can be better assured that the opinion as to whether a representation and warranty has
been breached is impartial. This requirement, which strengthens enforcement
mechanisms of representations and warranties, should incentivize obligated parties to
better consider the characteristics and quality of the assets underlying the securities,

562

See fn. 131 and accompanying text.

331 


making it an appropriate partial replacement for the existing shelf eligibility requirement
that requires the securities to have an investment grade rating.
We believe our proposal to require a certification by the depositor’s chief
executive officer will focus the certifier on the transaction and the disclosure. Such
certification should enhance investors’ confidence in the securitization. We believe that a
certification may cause these officials to review more carefully the disclosure, and in this
case the transaction, and to participate more extensively in the oversight of the
transaction making it an appropriate partial replacement the existing shelf requirement
relating to investment grade ratings.
Under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, investors in most asset-backed
securities may not receive ongoing reporting pursuant to the Act, as most ABS issuers
may have less than 300 record holders. Given recent history, we believe ongoing
reporting for ABS is important even if the number of holders is low.563 Our proposal to
require that the issuer in an ABS shelf offering undertake to file Exchange Act reports
would provide investors with ongoing access to information. Although some issuers
already provide ongoing information to investors pursuant to transaction agreement
provisions, we believe that our requirements and the undertaking would impose greater
discipline on issuers to provide such information and thereby provide further
transparency for investors, especially when combined with the proposed loan level
disclosure requirements. Investors would benefit from greater transparency on the
continuing performance, composition and disposition of assets which can be used to
evaluate both their investment as well as the performance of sponsors and originators.

2.

Disclosure

We believe that the proposed requirements for asset-level disclosures in XML
format and with standardized data definitions will benefit investors in several important
ways. First, such required disclosures should reduce investors’ cost of information
production by reducing duplicative efforts on their part to gather such data on their own
or purchase it through data intermediaries. Although some ABS issuers currently provide
asset-level data to investors, this is not the case across all asset classes. For example,
issuers of certain asset classes, such as credit card receivables, dealer floorplans or
equipment loans, typically do not consistently provide asset-level information. As
discussed in further detail below, we are proposing an exemption from the asset-level
disclosure requirement for a few asset classes. We are unaware of any publicly available
data standards for asset classes other than mortgage-backed securities and currently there
is no mandatory requirement that issuers follow any of these standards for reporting to
investors in asset-backed securities.564 For the ABS offerings of asset classes that fall
within our proposed requirement, our proposal seeks to provide investors with consistent
and equal access to asset-level information.
We believe that requiring the asset-level disclosures in XML format and utilizing
standardized definitions of material loan, obligor, and collateral characteristics will
further benefit investors. The machine-readable format should lower the cost of
information processing, and the standardized definitions should increase comparability of
information across issuers. Currently, one sponsor’s use of a term in asset-level
information may differ from another sponsor’s use. For example, “reduced

564

See discussion in Section III.A.1. above.

333 


documentation” may not have the same meaning from one sponsor to another or from one
originator to another. The XML format that is proposed to be required, along with the
utilization of standardized definitions, should allow issuers to provide investors with
asset-level information in an immediately usable format. Investors could promptly
download and input this information into software tools for analysis of the assets in the
underlying pool and pricing of the asset-backed securities.
This process will be further aided by the proposed requirement to provide a
programming language representation of the ABS waterfall, which we refer to as the
waterfall computer program requirement. This is intended to benefit investors by
facilitating their ability to run simulations of expected cash flows under different
prepayment, loss and loss-given-default assumptions, while obtaining the full benefit of
the loan-level data that we are proposing to require. Requiring the filing of a
programming language representation of the waterfall will provide information about the
terms of the securities to investors in a form they can readily use for computerized
valuation methods of ABS. This will make more relevant information available to
investors and allow them to make better-informed investment choices.
The proposal should eliminate the transaction costs for single institutional
investors individually to script the waterfall provisions into a programming language
representation. This should reduce some of the information asymmetry between the
sponsor and a prospective investor that arises because the sponsor, as the person creating
the contractual cash flows has access to a programming language representation of the
waterfall, a necessary element of ABS valuation using computer simulations of security
performance, at the time of the initial public offering, and the investor does not.

334 


Asset-level data in easy to use format and accompanied by the waterfall computer
program will likely improve investors’ ability to conduct independent analysis and reduce
their reliance on credit ratings. With usable information on the composition of the asset
pool, investors can evaluate the sponsor’s disclosed characteristics of the pool. This, in
turn, will allow them not only to price the issue more efficiently but to evaluate the
investment potential of the issue better. Indeed, there is some evidence that a major
benefit of asset-level disclosure, and more specifically borrower-characteristics
disclosure, is an ability to price ABS more accurately.565 In addition, if asset-level data
reduces investors’ uncertainty about the composition of the asset pool, investors should
be willing to pay higher prices for the security.566 We believe that the proposed grouped
asset data requirement applicable to credit cards ABS issuers offers benefits similar to
that of the proposed asset-level data requirements.
We also are proposing to require asset-level disclosure be provided on an ongoing
basis. Ongoing disclosure of asset-level information should encourage better monitoring
of the security by investors and other market participants. Such information would be

Income, June 2001, Vol. 11, No. 1, at 8-15.

Information uncertainty tends to increase credit spreads. Yu (2005) and Sengupta (1998) show
that the cost of bond financing increases as the borrowing firm’s accounting reports become less
informative. Yu, F., “Accounting Transparency and the Term Structure of Credit Spreads,” Journal of
Financial Economics (2005) at 75, 53-84. Sengupta, P., “Corporate Disclosure Quality and the Cost of
Debt,” Accounting Review (1998) at 73, 459-474. Güntay and Hackbarth (2006) find that higher
dispersion of analysts’ forecasts is associated with significantly higher bond spreads. Güntay, L. and D.
Hackbarth, “Corporate Bond Credit Spreads and Forecast Dispersion,” working paper: Washington
University – St. Louis (2006). Thompson and Vaz (1990) document that credit-rating agency
disagreements on a firm’s credit rating also widens bond credit spreads even after controlling for the firm’s
default risk. Thompson, G. R. and P. Vaz, “Dual Bond Ratings: A Test of the Certification Function of
Rating Agencies,” Financial Review (1990) at 25, 457-471. Finally, Wittenberg-Moerman (2007)
documents that loan rates are higher for firms with higher bid-ask spreads on loans traded in the secondary

useful for tracking the performance of the assets, as well as an assessment of performance
of the originator, sponsor, or servicer. This would allow investors to continue their
independent analysis of the asset-backed securities rather than rely on NRSRO credit
ratings to alert them of changes in the ABS risk-return profile.
Our proposed asset-level information requirements, notably, are tailored by asset
class. We have taken under consideration situations in which the amount of asset- level
disclosure would be too voluminous, or investors are unlikely to find such disclosure
meaningful. We have decided to modify these requirements or not impose them at all, if
they do not appear to justify the compliance costs imposed on issuers. For example,
instead of asset-level information, we propose to require that issuers of ABS backed by
credit card receivables provide grouped asset data. Such issuers will be required to
disclose information on the assets in the underlying pool by grouping these assets into
different combinations of standardized pool characteristics. Similarly, we believe that the
potential costs of requiring issuers of stranded-costs ABS to provide asset-level
disclosures would not justify the benefits, so we are not proposing to require such
disclosures.567
Our proposed enhancements to pool-level disclosure are intended to help elicit
important information in areas that became problematic in the recent financial crisis, such
as with respect to exception loans. We also are proposing to amend the definition of an
asset-backed security to further restrict the type of securities that may utilize the
framework provided in Regulation AB. We believe that the restrictions on exceptions to

Maturity,” working paper: The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania (2007).

336

the discrete pool requirement of an asset-backed security benefits investors by
maintaining the integrity of the discrete pool requirement and is consistent with investor
demand for more meaningful asset-level data. Our proposed revisions to Item 6.05 of
Form 8-K would require that issuers file a current report and provide pool information
when there is a one percent or greater change in a material pool characteristic of the asset
pool. These revisions to the rules, we believe, assist in closing existing gaps by which
the asset pool composition could be changed significantly or without necessary
accompanying disclosure. Investors will be able to evaluate the consequences of asset
pool composition changes in order to determine the continuing suitability of the
investment.
Certain of the proposed disclosure requirements should benefit investors by
helping them to more easily and effectively assess the structure of the ABS transaction
and the parties involved. For example, where assets have been put back to an originator
or sponsor in the offering in the last three years and those assets have not been
repurchased or replaced, we are proposing to require disclosure of the number of those
assets that have not been repurchased or replaced. Similarly, disclosure on the
originator’s and sponsor’s financial condition where material, as provided in the
proposal, should benefit investors by allowing them to assess whether the condition of the
originator or sponsor may have bearing on their ability to make payments relating to their
repurchase obligations. Our proposed requirement relating to disclosure of a fraud
representation in the transaction documents would allow an investor to consider the
existence of the representation (or lack thereof) in making an investment decision.
Finally, our proposed disclosure requirement relating to the originator’s and sponsor’s

337 


interest in the securitization program, including risk retention, would allow an investor to
better consider the incentive structure and other possible risks relating to such party.
We also have several proposals relating to the presentation of information in the
prospectus for ABS offerings, including our proposal on the flow of funds, our proposal
eliminating the use of a base prospectus and accompanying prospectus supplement, and
our proposed revisions to the static pool information requirements. Through such
proposals, we seek to improve the presentation of information in ABS offering materials,
which may be unwieldy and contain duplicative disclosure, jargon or discussion
inapplicable to the specific transaction at hand. These proposed revisions aim to facilitate
more ready access to the information for investors and other market participants.
In addition, in coordination with the expiration of the temporary accommodation
in Rule 312 allowing ABS issuers to file static pool information on an Internet Website,
issuers would need to file static pool information with the Commission. We are
proposing to permit that such information be filed in PDF format. Implementation of the
requirement to file static pool information on EDGAR addresses concerns relating to the
maintenance of websites and the presentation of static pool information while our
proposal to allow issuers to file such information in PDF format would allow this
disclosure to be provided to investors in an easy to read format.
3.

Privately-Issued Structured Finance Products

Many ABS and similar structured finance products are offered and resold in
reliance on the Rule 144A safe harbor.568 Rule 144A is a safe harbor from being deemed
an underwriter within the meaning of Sections 2(a)(11) and 4(1) of the Securities Act for

338 


the resale of securities to qualified institutional buyers. Many of the types of assetbacked securities that caused significant concern in the financial crisis included securities
that are typically sold in private transactions.569 Our proposal to require more disclosure
for privately-issued structured finance products are designed to provide investors in such
securities, which can have complex incentive structures among various parties and whose
valuation is dependent on an understanding of the assets in the underlying pool, with
better information than they currently receive.
Our proposal to require a notice of sales for the initial placement of securities to
be sold in reliance on Rule 144A, we believe, would improve transparency in the assetbacked securitization market. This notice could in turn help regulators with monitoring
developments in the securitization market and determining whether future rulemaking or
other actions with regard to asset-backed securities may be necessary. This notice could
also have the additional benefit of supporting the Commission’s efforts to enforce the
federal securities laws relating to asset-backed securities. The items proposed to be
added to Form D for asset-backed issuers would have similar benefits to the extent ABS
issuers rely on Rule 506 of Regulation D.
C.

Costs

Our proposals for asset-backed securities are designed to improve disclosure to
ABS investors but would impose costs on ABS issuers and other participants in the chain
of securitization in various ways. The proposals to revise shelf registration and to replace
the investment grade ratings requirement for shelf eligibility would impose additional
568

See, e.g., SEC Staff Report, "Enhancing Disclosure in the Mortgage-Backed Securities Markets,"
(Jan. 2003), available at http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/mortgagebacked.htm (noting that almost all
private-label MBS that are not sold pursuant to a registration statement are sold in the 144A market).
569

See discussion in Section VI. above.

339

costs on ABS issuers offering securities through shelf registration. Sponsors of shelf
registered issuers would also incur direct costs, as a result of the proposed risk retention
shelf eligibility condition that would require the sponsor to retain and maintain five
percent of each tranche, or, in the case of revolving assets, five percent of the pool.
Some of the proposed disclosure requirements refine existing disclosure
requirements; however the proposal to require standardized asset-level information or
grouped asset data and to provide a computerized program of the issue’s waterfall are
new disclosure requirements, and thus issuers would be required to incur additional costs
to which they were previously not subject. Our proposals relating to the disclosure by
privately-issued structured finance product issuers would impose additional costs on such
issuers seeking to rely on certain regulatory safe harbors.
1.

Securities Act Registration

The proposed requirement to file a form of preliminary prospectus at least five
business days before the date of first sale and the proposed requirement that brokers
deliver a preliminary prospectus 48 hours ahead of sale would require that issuers provide
information to investors earlier in the process than is currently the case. During that
period, issuers may be exposed to the risk of changing market conditions; however, such
uncertainty is similar to that faced by other issuers of underwritten initial public offerings
of debt whose final offer prices are not set for weeks or months after filing.
The two methods to satisfy the risk retention shelf eligibility condition that we are
proposing to allow for shelf eligibility may increase costs of securitization to sponsors.
We note, however, if issuers find the cost of risk retention too high, ABS offerings could
be registered without being subject to a risk retention requirement, as long as such

340 


offerings are registered on proposed Form SF-1. For purposes of PRA analysis, we
estimate the total movement out of the shelf registration system to be 10% of the current
number of shelf offerings, although not all of this movement is estimated to move to
proposed Form SF-1 and some may move to private markets.
We also note that the risk retention shelf eligibility condition may impact the risk
management process of a sponsor. Some financial institutions are impacted through
requirements to hold capital against the risk to which they are exposed, which would put
them at a disadvantage to other institutions. Reserving capital for risk retention reduces
the amount of funds available for lending which will increase a borrower’s cost of funds.
Any such reduction in lending capacity suffered by the ABS issuer may be passed
through to the financial institution’s investors and customers as a cost of the
securitization process.
In addition, as we noted in our PRA estimates, while we are not imposing
additional disclosure requirements for the Form 10-K for sponsors, they may incur some
additional costs in preparing their annual reports in determining the impact of the
required risk retention on their disclosure. We estimate, for purposes of the PRA, that
sponsors will need an additional 10 hours to prepare their Form 10-K filings at a total
cost of $2,500 per sponsor.570
Also, under our proposed shelf eligibility conditions, issuers in shelf registrations
would be subject to additional costs of hiring a third party to review assets that have been

570

This estimate is based on the estimated total burden hours of the amendments associated with the
schedules and forms that would include the new disclosure, an assumed 75%/25% split of the burden hours
between internal staff and external professionals with respect to proxy and information statements, an
assumed 25%/75% split of the burden hours between internal staff and external professionals with respect
to registration statements, and an hourly rate of $200 for internal staff time and $400 for external
professionals.

341 


put back to an obligated party, usually the sponsor or originator, for breach of the
representation and warranties. Additionally, the value of these opinions is dependent on
investors’ perception of the expertise of the entity providing the opinion. This proposed
shelf eligibility condition also might create incentives for originators or sponsors to agree
to repurchase or replace assets that have been put back to them even in cases where these
assets were not in breach. Under our proposals, ABS offerings that are shelf registered
would be required to include a certification signed by the depositor’s chief executive
officer regarding the characteristics of the assets, which will impose some additional
disclosure burden.
Our proposed shelf eligibility condition to require ABS issuers to undertake to file
Exchange Act reports would also impose certain costs on ABS issuers on shelf. The
Exchange Act reporting requirements for ABS issuers take into account existing
reporting obligations to investors required under ABS transaction agreements. Many
ABS transaction agreements contemplate continued reporting to investors, but those
reports, while provided to investors, are not required to be filed if the issuer has
suspended its Exchange Act reporting obligation. Because our proposal would require
the issuers to undertake to file reports with the Commission, an ABS issuer registered on
shelf would include additional costs to file ongoing information with the Commission.
Certain types of asset-backed securities, such as ABS backed by credit cards, continue to
issue securities backed by the same pool, and thus are required to continue to report on an
ongoing basis, and thus would not incur additional costs as a result of the proposed
amendments. Other asset-backed securities are exchange-listed and are subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and thus our proposal

342 


would not impose additional costs of them. We estimate in the PRA that the incremental
cost of the proposed changes relating to Exchange Act reporting is $71,628,900.571
These proposed shelf eligibility conditions would replace, in part, the prior
reliance on investment grade ratings as a condition for shelf eligibility. A potential cost
of this substitution is that investors may incorrectly believe that these requirements are an
indication that shelf registrations are, effectively, investment grade offers. Under the
proposed requirements, securitizations would be eligible for shelf registration if they
meet the rule’s requirements regardless of their credit rating, which may or may not be
investment grade.
The costs associated with both the shelf registration requirements and asset-level
disclosures detailed above could be passed down the chain of securitization. If the
market is much more concentrated at the sponsor level than at the originator level,
sponsors may be able to pass on to originators some of the costs of our proposals.
Originators could, in turn, pass some of these costs onto borrowers, although their ability
to do so might be constrained by competition from non-securitizing lenders.
2.

Disclosure

Although some issuers currently provide asset-level information, this is not a
consistent practice across all issuers. 572 Our proposals to require disclosure of asset-level

571

This amount is calculated using the increases in burden hours for Form 10-K, Form 10-D, and
Form 8-K from the PRA. We allocate 75% of these hours to issuer internal costs at a rate of $200 per hour
and 25% to professional costs at a rate of $400 per hour.
572

For example, CMBS issuers frequently provide loan-level information in accordance with industry
standards. See fn. 224 above and accompanying text. RMBS issuers sometimes file loan-level mortgage
schedules with the Commission or provide loan-level information to rating agencies. See, e.g., “Moody's
Proposes Enhancements to Non-Prime RMBS Securitization,” Structured Finance Special Report,” Sept.
25, 2008. It is suggested that certain of the issuers of securities backed by auto loans provide loan-level
information. See “S&P’s Auto Loan-Level Model Enhances Understanding of Loss Performance,”
Structured Finance, available at http://www.vehiclefinanceconference.com/pdf/handout5.pdf.

343 


information are designed to provide, investors with equal access to such information with
certain exceptions discussed below. This will lead to additional costs being imposed on
sponsors to compile and report asset-level data. As noted in the PRA, we estimate that it
will cost issuers $79,939,291 to compile and report asset-level information.573
Where we believe individual asset-level disclosures would be overly burdensome
and of little utility to investors, we are proposing to require less granular disclosures or no
disclosures altogether. For instance, credit-card ABS are backed by millions of accounts.
For this ABS class, asset-level disclosures likely would produce an overwhelming
amount of data, which we believe would not be useful for investors. Thus, we are
proposing that issuers of ABS backed by credit and charge card receivables provide
information on the assets in the underlying pool grouped along specified standardized
dimensions. Based on similar considerations, we propose to exclude from the required
asset-level disclosures issuers of ABS backed by stranded costs.
Our proposed standard definitions for asset-level information are similar to, and in
part based on, other standards that have been developed by the industry, such as those
developed under ASF’s Project RESTART or those developed by CRE Finance Council.
Because these proposed standard definitions employ widely used metrics for asset-level
information, we also believe that these standards should be similar to other standards
used for reporting purposes, including the mortgage metrics that national banks and
thrifts must provide to the Office of Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift
Supervision.574 To the extent that there are differences between standards on the same

information, additional costs would be imposed on issuers and servicers to track the
differences between one standard and another. Further, servicers may incur some costs in
monitoring their compliance with servicing criteria and requirements under the servicing
agreement with respect to reports on asset-level information.
Under the proposed requirements, issuers of ABS would be subject to additional
ongoing asset-level or grouped asset disclosure requirements. Because we believe the
information required already should be available, we do not expect significant increase in
information gathering costs. However, we do believe that the costs discussed above of
reconciling variable definitions, tagging required asset data and filing information with
the Commission will be incurred in the process of continued reporting.575 For purposes
of our PRA analysis, we estimate that after the sponsor has incurred initial setup costs
and after it has made its first filing, ongoing asset-level disclosure requirements would
impose an additional cost of 10 burden hours per filing, which is equivalent to $2,125.576
The proposed requirements for asset data disclosure might have important
implications for originators’ ability to remain competitive and retain their lending market
share. Once detailed data on borrower characteristics matched to loan terms becomes
publicly available in XML format, a disclosing originator’s competitors may be able to
more easily infer its loan pricing model and might use the data to increase their own
market share at the disclosing originator’s expense. This may have an adverse impact on

575

We note that the CRE Finance Council is now requiring that asset-level information for
commercial mortgage-backed securities be provided in XML. See CRE Finance Council Investor
Reporting Package x 6.0 Preliminary Exposure Draft #1, Jan. 1, 2009, available at http://www.crefc.org/.
In this regard, issuers of commercial mortgage-backed securities may already be subject to the costs of
XML data tagging.

the profitability of credit institutions that choose to securitize some of the credit they
extend.
Disclosures about an originator’s or a sponsor’s refusal to repurchase or replace
assets put back to them for breach of representations and warranties (as well as the
proposed third party opinion shelf eligibility condition, as noted above) might create
incentives for originators to agree to repurchase or replace such assets even in cases
where these assets were not in breach. If investors regard such disclosures as indicative
of a willingness to comply with representations and warranties in the future, then
originators or sponsors might try to preserve their reputation by taking back assets even
when they do not have to do so. This might create an incentive for sponsors and possibly
trustees to ask for repurchase or replacement of poorly performing assets that represent
no breach of representations or warranties.
The proposed requirement to provide a programming language representation of
the waterfall computer program would facilitate the ability of ABS investors to
meaningfully use the asset data disclosed by the ABS issuer at the time of the public
offering and with the monthly or other periodical distribution reports on Form 10-D filed
with the Commission. We believe that the sponsor of an ABS generally will have in its
possession at the time of the public offering a representation in computer programming
language of the waterfall. However, additional time and expense will be involved in
filing this computer programming language as source code on EDGAR concurrently with
the filing of the Rule 424 prospectus, as the waterfall computer program may have to be
subjected to additional review before it is filed with the Commission. We are proposing
to exempt issuers of offerings backed by stranded costs from the proposed requirement,

346 


as they are not required to provide asset-level information under the proposal. As
discussed in the PRA section, we believe that initial startup costs for preparing waterfall
computer program for ABS would be approximately 672 burden hours per sponsor at a
cost of $159,600.577 Also in our PRA analysis, we estimate the ongoing costs associated
with converting the waterfall computer program to the necessary format to be two hours
per securitization, which equals $700.578
The asset data and waterfall computer program disclosure requirements might
impose costs on entities other than the securitization participants. Making such
information available to the public for free may adversely impact the business model of
firms currently selling such information to investors. If waterfall formulas are available
to investors free of charge, in program form, investors may face a reduced incentive to
purchase existing products that provide essentially the same service.
Sponsors may face costs in addition to the initial and ongoing mechanical costs of
waterfall preparation. Increased product transparency may reduce some effects of
product complexity, potentially enabling investors to more accurately value securities.
The resulting price transparency may place new constraints on sponsors’ latitude in
pricing the products, potentially lowering the profitability of bringing ABS to market.
Rating agencies may also face costs related to implementation of the waterfall
computer program requirement. To the extent that rating agency analysis has served as a
proxy, for some investors, for in-depth modeling, investors may rely less on this analysis

577

To calculate the total dollar costs, we allocate 25% of these hours to issuer internal costs at a rate
of $200 per hour and 75% to computer programmer costs at a rate of $250 per hour.

347 


as a result of being more readily able to perform their own calculations, potentially on an
automated basis.
We believe that our proposals to amend the discrete pool exception in the
Regulation AB definition of an asset-backed security, for the most part, only carve back
on outlier structures and should result in little cost to asset-backed issuers.579 Our
proposed revisions to the Regulation AB definition of an asset-backed security should be
minimal, and, if adopted, a security that does not meet the new Regulation AB definition
of an asset-backed security could still register with the Commission as long as additional,
suitable disclosure is provided regarding the offering, the securities and transaction
parties.
We note that our proposals to revise the pool-level information requirements and
information requirements on originators and sponsors further refine the disclosure
requirements rather than impose significant burdens, which is why we expect no material
increase in compliance costs. Our proposal to eliminate the base prospectus and
prospectus supplement format for ABS issuers may cause a small increase in the number
of registration statements filed with the Commission and a corresponding increase in the
cost to issuers to prepare and file such registration statements. In addition, this proposal
and our proposal to require the filing of a post-effective amendment for additional
structural features or credit enhancements could increase some compliance costs for ABS
issuers. However, we believe that our proposal to allow ABS issuers to use a “pay-as-

579

We are aware of only four issuers backed by non-revolving assets that utilize the master trust
structure. Based on staff review, we believe that use of prefunding accounts is generally limited to select
sponsors, approximately 25 percent or less of the principal balance or proceeds are set aside for prefunding
for those select sponsors, and the prefunding period in those cases generally extends for approximately one
year. In addition, we believe that revolving periods are not widely used across asset classes or by
standalone amortizing trust structures.

348 


you-go” registration system for each offering would offset some of those costs by
providing ABS issuers with greater flexibility that would improve the utility of shelf
registration, increase efficiency and thereby ultimately reduce costs for issuers.
3.

Privately-Issued Structured Finance Products

The costs of complying with the shelf registration requirements may make
alternate offering mechanisms, such as private placements or exempt offerings more
attractive. To improve investor protection in these types of offerings, our proposed
regulations would give investors the right to obtain the same level of disclosure as
required in a registered Form S-1 or proposed Form SF-1 offering (and ongoing
information that would be required if the issuer were subject to Exchange Act reporting
obligations) when sales are made in reliance on Rule 506 of Regulation D or resales are
made in reliance on Rule 144A. We also are proposing to require that transaction
agreements contain a provision by which the issuer promises and represents to provide
this disclosure to investors and prospective purchasers upon request.
While the costs to implementing this new information requirement may be
significant to ABS issuers, we believe that such costs are justified in light of the role that
privately-placed issued ABS played in the financial crisis. We believe that the recent
financial crisis exposed deficiencies in the information available about CDOs and other
privately-issued structured finance products.580 Not only does it appear that these
instruments were not well understood by investors, but market participants and regulators
did not have access to important information about this significant component of the

580

See the 2008 CRMPG III Report, at 53.

349 


capital markets.581 We also recognize that the additional proposed requirements that
would be imposed on issuers who wish to rely on the safe harbors may possibly result in
changes in the number of ABS offerings and increased use of offshore ABS offerings.
For purposes of PRA analysis, we estimate for that total annual number of internal
burden hours that would be imposed by the proposed amendments is 171,498 hours,
while the total annual external cost estimate is be $58,144,976.
We believe that costs of the proposed requirement that issuers file a notice of
sales for the initial placement of securities to be sold in reliance on Rule 144A should be
minimal. In addition, we are proposing to add disclosure requirements specific to ABS
issuers to Form D. For purposes of PRA, we estimate that proposed requirement on
issuers to file Form 144A-SF would take approximately two hours per response per year
at a total dollar cost of $700.582 For purposes of the PRA, the added requirements to
Form D would not increase the current four- hour estimate for completing the form.

Consideration of Burden on Competition and Promotion of Efficiency,
Competition and Capital Formation
Section 23(a) of the Exchange Act583 requires the Commission, when making

rules and regulations under the Exchange Act, to consider the impact a new rule would
have on competition. Section 23(a)(2) prohibits the Commission from adopting any rule
that would impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of
the purposes of the Exchange Act. Section 2(b) of the Securities Act584 and Section 3(f)

583

15 U.S.C. 78w(a).

584

15 U.S.C. 77b(b).

352 


of the Exchange Act585 require the Commission, when engaging in rulemaking that
requires it to consider whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest,
to consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action would promote
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. Below, we address these issues for each
of the proposed, substantive changes to ABS offerings.
A.

Shelf Registration Requirements

1.

Risk Retention

The impact of our proposed shelf eligibility condition to require that issuers retain
a certain amount of risk in each tranche of the securitization is similar to the existing
regulations imposed by the EU. Under EU regulations, certain investing institutions may
not hold a position in asset-backed securities unless the sponsor or originator agrees to
retain a certain amount of the exposures in the securitization. Because the EU- and the
U.S.-issued shelf registered ABS (which had comprised most of the publicly offered ABS
market) would then have comparable risk retention features, our proposed shelf eligibility
condition should not cause a reduction in U.S. competitiveness from the status quo that
existed prior to the current EU regulations.
Risk retention may have the additional effect on capital adequacy for those issuers
who are subject to the regulatory capital requirements. The risk retention requirement
may put sponsors subject to regulatory capital requirements at a competitive disadvantage
with those who are not.
In addition, we recognize that some issuers may not wish to retain risk and
requiring those issuers to retain risk in order to conduct a shelf offering could reduce the

585

15 U.S.C. 78c(f).

353 


investment alternatives available to investors. Therefore, our proposal would allow an
issuer to register an offering on proposed Form SF-1 without retaining risk. The tradeoff
facing the issuer is that offers on proposed Form SF-1 would likely have a longer wait
before being able to go to market, for instance possibly waiting for the registration
statement to be declared effective for 60 to 90 days compared to five business days for
the proposed revised shelf registration procedures. The amount of time in non-shelf
registration is greater than that of shelf offerings in order to allow the Commission staff
the ability to review and comment on the filing and give investors additional time to
consider the issue and make a better informed investment decision. These features of our
proposal could have the pro-competitive effect of providing more alternatives to issuers.
Alternatively, some or all issuers could decide that registration is not an acceptable
alternative, which could result in fewer alternatives for investors.
The proposed risk retention shelf eligibility condition promotes capital formation
and efficiency by improving the alignment of sponsors’ interest with that of investors.
This could result in an allocation of capital to the most productive uses and lead to gains
in overall economic efficiency.
2.

Representations and Warranties in Pooling and Servicing Agreements

One of the problems in the ABS market that was highlighted during the financial
crisis is the inability to efficiently enforce contractual provisions and unilateral
modification of those ABS provisions. Our proposed ABS shelf eligibility condition
relating to the representations and warranties stated in a pooling and servicing agreement
promotes a better understanding of the enforceability of those representations and
warranties. As a result, investors should have greater certainty and transparency about

354 


the consequences of breaches of the representations and warranties. With respect to shelf
offerings of ABS, all other things equal, this proposal is competitively neutral.
3.

Depositor’s Chief Executive Officer Certification

Our ABS shelf eligibility condition that the chief executive officer of the
depositor certify that to his or her knowledge the assets have characteristics that provide a
reasonable basis to believe that the underlying pool of assets will produce cash flows at
times and in amounts necessary to service payments on the securities as described in the
prospectus promotes capital formation by providing investors in shelf offerings with
additional assurance that the sponsor has performed the necessary evaluation of the
underlying assets and this evaluation is consistent with the disclosure provided in the
prospectus.
4.

Ongoing Exchange Act Reporting

Our proposals would require that issuers of ABS using shelf registration provide
ongoing Exchange Act reporting. We believe that this will promote both efficiency and
capital formation by making information useful for monitoring and assessing the
performance of both the assets and the sponsor available to investors and the markets in
general. More public information on an ongoing basis should assist investors to make
better informed decisions on how to allocate capital, and should promote allocational
efficiency by enabling investors to better match their preferences for risk and return.
5.

Eliminate Ratings Requirement

We propose to eliminate the current ABS shelf eligibility condition that relies on
the ratings provided by an NRSRO. Our proposal, however, does not prohibit an investor
from using a credit rating in its investment decision in an offering under a shelf

355 


registration statement if they should find this information useful. Rather, we would be
eliminating the reference to credit ratings in our rules in order to reduce the likelihood of
undue reliance and remove the appearance of an imprimatur that such references may
create. This is designed to decrease the appearance that we sanction the use of ratings
over investor analysis in an investment decision. We believe that doing so promotes
investor protection by reducing the possibility that our rules encourage investors to rely
unduly on ratings586 rather than conduct their own analysis of the securities. If the
proposals are adopted, investors may still utilize ratings. It is also possible that ABS
sponsors will continue to have their offerings rated. Even if ratings agencies see a
decline in their business due to this regulation and other information being made
available by sponsors, we believe that the benefits of the proposals would justify these
potential indirect costs. The proposals provide an efficient means of assessing the quality
and character of ABS shelf offerings, which thus would not impose a burden on
competition.
B.

Five-Business Day Filing and Prospectus Delivery Requirements

In the case of shelf registration, once the registration statement is effective, we are
effectively proposing to increase the time that issuers are required to provide information
about the offering from no minimum to at least five business days before first sale in the
offering off the shelf. This additional time is designed to provide investors with
additional time to analyze and understand the risk profile of the securities being offered

586

In other recent actions, we have addressed significant issues relating to the credit ratings process
by an NRSO, seeking to improve the transparency relating to ratings shopping, methodologies of rating the
securities. See Amendments to Rules for Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, Release
No. 34-61050 (Nov. 23, 2009); Credit Ratings Disclosure, Release No. 33-9070 (Oct. 7, 2009) [74 FR
53086]; Proposed Rules for Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, Release No. 34-61051
(Nov. 23, 2009)[74 FR 63866].

356 


and to make more informed and better investment decisions that will improve pricing
efficiency, and should assist investors to make better informed decisions on how to
allocate capital.
Our proposal to require brokers to provide investors with a preliminary prospectus
at least 48 hours before confirmations are sent would apply to all registered ABS
offerings, regardless of whether they are made under a shelf registration statement. Given
that each ABS offering requires a consideration of new and different assets, we propose
to treat ABS offerings in this regard similarly to any other initial public offering of
securities. Because all registered ABS offerings will have the same requirement, this
proposal is competitively neutral with respect to all public issuers.
C.

Disclosure

As a result of the financial crisis and subsequent events, the market for securitized
assets has suffered dramatically due, in part, to the recession, lower housing prices and
increased consumer debt load—but also because of perceived problems in the
securitization process that affected investors’ willingness to participate in these issues.
Increased transparency of the underlying assets is valuable because it provides better
information that should allow the market to price these products more accurately. Greater
disclosure should give investors better tools to evaluate the underlying assets and to
determine whether or not to invest in the instrument and at what price. By doing so, the
Commission intends to promote efficient capital allocation. Consequently, each of these
regulations, described individually below, should provide the following:
•	 Productive efficiency: The underwriter and sponsor are in the best position to
be the lowest cost providers of the loan level information that we are

357 


proposing. Making such information available will reduce the amount of
investor and third party research that is repetitive. Requiring that this data be
easily machine-readable will allow parties to perform, at relatively low cost,
larger scale analysis than now occurs.
•	 Allocational efficiency: Investors will be better able to match their risk/return
preferences with ABS issues having the same risk return profile;
•	 Capital formation: Better disclosure should increase demand for these
securities that will then be used to increase capital formation.587
We note that some of our proposals refine rules to provide investors with a better
understanding of the offering, the transaction parties, or the material characteristics of the
pool assets, including the underwriting of the assets. These proposals do not significantly
change the framework that exists under our current rules for asset-backed securities.
1.

Asset Data File and Waterfall Computer Program

Under our proposed asset-level disclosure requirements, issuers would be required
to provide certain standardized information on each asset that is in the pool underlying
the securities, or on standardized groupings in the case of credit card receivables. Such
information would not only be required at the time of securitization but also on an
ongoing basis. This should be an efficiency-enhancing requirement because issuers and

587

Indeed, this was the original motivation for the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. Investing had all but ceased in the Great Depression. The conceptual framework for these
laws was that increased disclosure would promote ethical behavior in the securities industry leading to
greater investor confidence leading, in turn, to more investment and capital formation. Revitalization of the
securitization market through additional disclosure has also been espoused by others. See, e.g., Ralph
Atkins and David Oakley, “Disclosure move aims to revive ABS market,” Financial Times, May 17, 2009
(European Central Bank pushing for an increase in the amount of information that has to be disclosed about
asset-backed securities as part of efforts to revive ABS market and encourage investors that have been
deterred for lack of transparency in the market to buy asset-backed securities) and European Central Bank,
Public consultation on the provision of ABS loan-level information in the Eurosystem collateral
framework, available at http://www.ecb.int/paym/cons/previous/html/abs.en.html.

358 


underwriters have ready access to the asset-level information that we propose be
provided; consequently, the information will be publicized by the lowest cost provider.
As evidence that this is not an onerous burden, some issuers already provide much of the
information to investors (although such information is not standardized). Nonetheless,
where we believe the costs in providing this information may not be justified in light of
the limited benefit to investors and with consequent potentially negative effects on
efficiency, competition and/or capital formation, we are proposing to exclude those
issuers from the asset-level requirements, or, in the case of credit card ABS issuers, to
modify the approach. Asset data file information requirements are proposed to be applied
equally to shelf eligible and non-shelf eligible offerings alike, thus applying the burdens
equally to all publicly offered ABS issuers.
As described in the Benefit-Cost section above, the proposed asset-level
disclosure requirements are likely to increase competition in lending markets by making
information more cheaply available. Large datasets of loan-level information on credit
terms and borrower characteristics are now available--but often at a considerable cost to
subscribers and with incomplete information for some mortgage originators of the loans
in the underlying pool. The data can be used to reverse engineer an originator’s lending
strategy in general or loan-pricing model in particular. Such information can be used by
lenders to compete more effectively and even more generally can lower barriers to entry
into geographic or product lending markets. By making this information more cheaply
available, small loan originators may have access in the future to data that only the larger
institutions could afford. As such, the provision of this data will be pro-competitive in
lending markets.

359 


We are mindful that forced disclosure of detailed information may create
disincentives for innovation. At the present time, however, asset-level data are
sometimes available from third party vendors for a price. Consequently, there should be
little incremental effect on innovation from our proposed disclosure requirement.
We expect that the proposed asset-level and waterfall-computer-program
disclosure requirements may negatively impact the profitability of providers of similar
information and products currently being marketed. If the individual-asset data and cashflow generating code are available free of charge, investors will no longer have the
incentive to purchase similar products from third party vendors. Thus, some data vendor
product market share may be negatively impacted by our requirements. However, the
free availability of this data could give rise to new products from third party vendors who
will offer data analyses, data analysis services and even user software to process the data
that has features absent from the proposed waterfall computer program requirement.
Our proposals should benefit consumers because, first, the same information will
be available at lower cost than is now the case and, second, we expect to see innovations
in information processing and delivery to provide insights to investors that may now be
prohibitive.
2.

Pay-As-You-Go Registration and Revisions to Registration Process

Some of our proposals are directed at the format and presentation in which
information is provided to investors to facilitate analysis of offering materials and, thus,
promote more efficient capital formation through greater understanding of ABS. For
example, we propose to eliminate the base prospectus and prospectus supplement format
for disclosure. We believe that this should significantly improve disclosure for investors.

360 


While we acknowledge that the proposal may increase costs for issuers by increasing the
number of registration statements that must be filed, our proposal to allow a “pay-as-you­
go” registration system for ABS issuers should help to offset those costs and thereby
improve efficiency for ABS issuers.
3.

Restrictions on Use of Regulation AB

Part of our proposed changes would change the definition of an asset-backed
security to restrict the types of structures that could be utilized under the Regulation AB
framework. The proposed revisions should impact only a few offerings. Inasmuch as
this is basically delineating the securities that are not suitable for the Regulation AB
framework, this action does not significantly change the status quo and therefore has no
effect on efficiency, competition and capital formation.
D.

Safe Harbors for Privately-Issued Structured Finance Products

We also note that some of our changes to registered offerings of ABS may make
alternate offering mechanisms, such as private placements or exempt offerings more
attractive. We are proposing to revise our rules relating to offers and sales made in
reliance on Rule 506 of Regulation D and resales made in reliance on Rule 144A to give
the investors the right to obtain the same level of disclosure as required in a registered
Form S-1 or proposed Form SF-1 offerings. This in turn may make offers and sales
pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act or resales pursuant to so-called Section 4(1­
½) more attractive to issuers. We think this will promote efficiency by bringing
transparency to formerly opaque private structured finance product market, particular for
CDOs and similar products.
E.

Combined Effect of Proposals

361 


If sponsors/issuers bear the costs discussed above, this could put private-label
RMBS sponsors/issuers at further disadvantage relative to government sponsored
enterprises 588 whose RMBS are exempt from SEC registration (e.g., Freddie Mac, Fannie
Mae and Ginnie Mae). Increasing the costs of securitization may give a competitive
advantage to residential mortgage originators who can securitize through government
sponsored enterprises and may increase the cost of non-conforming loans to borrowers.
Such GSEs are not required to disclose loan-level information and/or commit to the
requirements of SEC registration. If the proposed costs are sufficiently high relative to
the resulting benefits of these regulations to investors, originators could receive a better
price from selling conforming loans to these agencies as opposed to private conduits, thus
increasing the competitive advantage of GSEs. In addition, the better selling price of
conforming loans to GSEs could adversely affect originators’ incentives to underwrite
non-conforming loans, since these cannot be securitized through GSEs. The combined
effect might be a reduction in the number of assets available for securitization by nonGSE ABS issuers and could provide GSEs with greater market power at the expense of
conforming loan lenders and non-conforming borrowers. We believe that to the extent
the consideration of risk and return makes non-GSE more attractive than GSEs, this
competitive advantage could be reduced.
In summary, taken together the proposed amendments to our regulations and
forms on asset-backed securities are designed to improve investor protection, reduce the
likelihood of undue reliance on ratings, and increase transparency to market participants.

securities and help recovery in the ABS market with attendant positive effects on
efficiency, competition and capital formation.

views, if possible. We also request comment on whether our proposed changes to
Exchange Act Rule 15c2-8(b), the disclosure requirements and Exchange Act forms
would impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the
purposes of the Exchange Act.
XIII.

Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act
For purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of

1996,589 a rule is “major” if it has resulted, or is likely to result in:
•	 an annual effect on the U.S. economy of $100 million or more;
•	 a major increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries; or
•

significant adverse effects on competition, investment, or innovation.

We request comment on whether our proposed amendments would be a “major rule” for
purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act. We solicit
comment and empirical data on:
•	 the potential effect on the U.S. economy on an annual basis;
•	 any potential increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries;
and

any potential effect on competition, investment, or innovation.
Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification

The Commission hereby certifies pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that the proposals
contained in this release, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities. The proposals relate to the registration, disclosure
and reporting requirements for asset-backed securities under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act. Securities Act Rule 157590 and Exchange Act Rule 0-10(a)591 defines an
issuer, other than an investment company, to be a “small business” or “small
organization” if it had total assets of $5 million or less on the last day of its most recent
fiscal year. As the depositor and issuing entity are most often limited purpose entities in
an ABS transaction, we focused on the sponsor in analyzing the potential impact of the
proposals under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Based on our data, we only found one
sponsor that could meet the definition of a small broker-dealer for purposes of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act.592 Accordingly, the Commission does not believe that the
proposals, if adopted, would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities.
XV.

document under the authority set forth in Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 17(a), 19(a), and 28 of

(A)

the user’s own assumptions regarding the future performance and

cash flows coming from the pool assets underlying the asset-backed security,
including but not limited to assumptions about future interest rates, default rates,
prepayment speeds, loss-given-default rates, and any other assumptions required
to be described pursuant to Section 229.1113; and
(B)

the current state and performance of the pool assets underlying the

asset-backed security by uploading directly into the computer program the initial
XML-based Asset Data File (as defined in §232.11 of this chapter) and any
subsequent monthly updates to that file; and
(iii)

produces a programmatic output, in machine-readable form, of all

resulting cash flows associated with the asset-backed security, including the amount and
timing of principal and interest payments payable or distributable to a holder of each
class of securities, and each other person or account entitled to payments or distributions
in connection with the securities, until the final legal maturity date as a function of the
inputs described in paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section.
Instruction: For purposes of this definition, the transaction agreement provisions that
should be given effect to include, but are not limited to, any provisions setting forth the
priorities of payments or distributions (and any contingencies affecting such priorities) to
the holders of each class of securities and any other persons or accounts entitled to
payments or distributions, and any related provisions necessary to determine the

427 


quantitative results of such provisions (including without limitation the provisions
required to be described in Item 1113(b), Item 1113(c), Item 1113(d), and items (2)-(4),
(6), (7) and (9) of Item 1113(a)) .

Provide a sample expected output for each class of securities in the asset-

backed transaction. The sample should be based on the Asset Data File (as defined in
232.11 of this chapter) filed pursuant to Item 1111(h)(1) and filed with the Waterfall
Computer Program. The sample should disclose the sample input assumptions used to
generate the expected output.
(3)

subparagraph (h) is provided as a downloadable source code for a computer program in
the Python programming language filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on its website at www.sec.gov. Identify the CIK and file number of the filing.
(4)

File the Waterfall Computer Program as part of any prospectus filed in

accordance with Rule 424(h) (§230.424(h)) or any final prospectus meeting the
requirements of section 10(a) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77j(a)(a)) filed in
accordance with Rule 424(b) (§230.424(b)). The Waterfall Computer Program shall give
effect to the transaction provisions as of the date of such filing.
(5) With respect to a credit card master trust, file the Waterfall Computer
Program in accordance with Item 6.07(b) of Form 8-K (§249.308). The Waterfall
Computer Program shall give effect to the transaction provisions as of the date of such

Instructions to Item 1122
1.

The assessment should cover all asset-backed securities transactions

involving such party and that are backed by the same asset type backing the class of
asset-backed securities which are the subject of the Commission filing. The asserting
party may take into account divisions among transactions that are consistent with actual
practices. However, if the asserting party includes in its platform less than all of the
transactions backed by the same asset type that it services, a description of the scope of
the platform should be included in the assessment.

required by section 6(b)(2) of the Act on the following conditions:

457(s) in advance of or in connection with an offering of securities from the registration
statement at the time of filing the prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(h) for the offering; and
(ii)

The issuer reflects the amount of the pay-as-you-go registration fee paid or

must indicate that the issuer is relying on Rule 456(c) but does not need to include the
number of units of securities or the maximum aggregate offering price of any securities
until the issuer updates the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table to reflect payment of
the registration fee, including a pay-as-you-go registration fee in accordance with Rule
456(c). The registration fee shall be calculated based on the fee payment rate in effect on
the date of the fee payment.

Where the securities to be offered are collateral certificates or special unit

of beneficial interest underlying asset-backed securities (as defined in §229.1101(c))

1933 (“Securities Act”) which are offered in any transaction specified in paragraph (b)
provided that the requirement applicable to the specified transaction are met. Terms used

(a)

Registrant Requirements. Registrants must meet the following conditions

in order to use Form SF-3 for registration under the Securities Act of securities offered in
transactions paragraph (b) below:
(1)

To the extent the sponsor, with respect to the depositor or an issuing entity

previously established by the depositor or affiliate of the depositor, was required to retain
risk with respect to a previous ABS offering involving the same asset class, pursuant to
paragraph (b)(1)(i) below, at the time of filing this registration statement, such sponsor
was holding the required risk.

503 


(2)

To the extent the depositor or any issuing entity previously established,

directly or indirectly, by the depositor or any affiliate of the depositor (as defined in Item
1101 of Regulation AB (17 CFR 229.1101)) are or were at any time during the twelve
calendar months and any portion of a month immediately preceding the filing of the
registration statement on this Form required to comply with the transaction requirements
in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (b)(1)(iii), and (b)(1)(iv) with respect to a previous offering of
securities involving the same asset class, the following requirements shall apply:
(i)

Such depositor and each such issuing entity must have filed on a timely

basis all transaction agreements containing the provision that is required by paragraph
(b)(1)(ii) below;
(ii)

Such depositor and each such issuing entity must have filed on a timely

basis all certifications required by paragraph (b)(1)(iii) below;
(iii)

Such depositor and each such issuing entity must have filed all reports

would be required under section 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m, 78n or
78o(d)) if they were subject to the reporting requirements of that section.
(3)

The registrant has provided disclosure in the registration statement that it

has met the registrant requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) above.
(4)

To the extent the depositor or any issuing entity previously established,

directly or indirectly, by the depositor or any affiliate of the depositor (as defined in Item
1101 of Regulation AB (17 CFR 229.1101)) are or were at any time during the twelve
calendar months and any portion of a month immediately preceding the filing of the

504 


registration statement on this Form subject to the requirements of section 12 or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78l or 78o(d)) with respect to a class of asset-backed
securities involving the same asset class, such depositor and each such issuing entity must
have filed all material required to be filed regarding such asset-backed securities pursuant
to section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m, 78n or 78o(d)) for such
period (or such shorter period that each such entity was required to file such materials).

result of a business combination transaction during such period, the filing of any material

issuing entity previously established, directly or indirectly, by such affiliated depositor is
excluded from this section, provided such business combination transaction was not part
of a plan or scheme to evade the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.

Item 512(a)(7)(ii) of Regulation S-K (§229.512(a)(7)(ii)) as long as non-affiliates of the
depositor hold any of the issuer’s securities that were sold in registered transactions. This

510 


This instruction sets forth registrant requirements and transaction requirements for
the use of Form SF-3. Any registrant which meets the requirements of I.A. below
(“Registrant Requirements”) may use this Form for the registration of asset-backed
securities (as defined in 17 CFR 229.1101(c)) under the Securities Act of 1933
(“Securities Act”) which are offered in any transaction specified in I.B. below
(“Transaction Requirement”) provided that the requirement applicable to the specified
transaction are met. Terms used in this form have the same meaning as in Item 1101 of
Regulation AB.
A. Registrant Requirements. 	Registrants must meet the following conditions in
order to use this Form SF-3 for registration under the Securities Act of securities
offered in transactions specified in I.B. below:
1.	 To the extent the sponsor, with respect to the depositor or an issuing entity
previously established by the depositor or affiliate of the depositor, was
required to retain risk with respect to a previous ABS offering involving the
same asset class, pursuant to General Instruction I.B.1(a) of this form, at the
time of filing this registration statement, such sponsor was holding the
required risk.
2.	 To the extent the depositor or any issuing entity previously established,
directly or indirectly, by the depositor or any affiliate of the depositor (as
defined in Item 1101 of Regulation AB (17 CFR 229.1101)) are or were at
any time during the twelve calendar months and any portion of a month
immediately preceding the filing of the registration statement on this Form
required to comply with the transaction requirements in General Instructions

511 


I.B.1(b), I.B.1(c), and I.B.1(d) of this form with respect to a previous offering
of securities involving the same asset class, the following requirements shall
apply:
(a) Such depositor and each such issuing entity must have filed on a
timely basis all transaction agreements containing the provision that is
required by General Instruction I. B.1(b);
(b) Such depositor and each such issuing entity must have filed on a
timely basis all certifications required by General Instruction I. B.1(c);
(c) Such depositor and each such issuing entity must have filed all reports
they had undertaken to file for the previous twelve months (or such
shorter period that each such entity had undertaken to file reports)
regarding such asset-backed securities as would be required under
section 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m, 78n or 78o(d)) if
they were subject to the reporting requirements of that section.
3.	 The registrant has provided disclosure in the registration statement that it has
met the registrant requirements of General Instruction I.A.1 and I.A.2 of Form
SF-3.
4.	 To the extent the depositor or any issuing entity previously established,
directly or indirectly, by the depositor or any affiliate of the depositor (as
defined in Item 1101 of Regulation AB (17 CFR 229.1101)) are or were at
any time during the twelve calendar months and any portion of a month
immediately preceding the filing of the registration statement on this Form
subject to the requirements of section 12 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15

512 


U.S.C. 78l or 78o(d)) with respect to a class of asset-backed securities
involving the same asset class, such depositor and each such issuing entity
must have filed all material required to be filed regarding such asset-backed
securities pursuant to section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C.
78m, 78n or 78o(d)) for such period (or such shorter period that each such

filed in a timely manner, other than a report that is required solely pursuant to
Item 1.01, 1.02, 2.03, 2.04, 2.05, 2.06, 4.02(a), 6.01, or 6.03 of Form 8-K (17

from this section, provided such business combination transaction was not
part of a plan or scheme to evade the requirements of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act. See the definition of “affiliate” in Securities Act Rule 405 (17

for which the trustee has asserted a breach of a representation or
warranty and for which the asset was not repurchased or replaced

515 


not violate a representation or warranty contained in the pooling
and servicing agreement or other transaction agreement.
(c) Certification. The registrant files a certification in accordance

(d) Undertaking to file Exchange Act Reports. With respect to each
offering of securities that is registered on this form, the registrant
undertakes to file reports as would be required by Sections 13(a) or
15(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder if the registrant
were subject to the reporting requirements of that section, in
accordance with Item 512(a)(7)(ii) of Regulation S-K
(§229.512(a)(7)(ii)) as long as non-affiliates of the depositor hold
any of the issuer’s securities that were sold in registered
transactions. This registration statement shall also provide
disclosure in the prospectus that is filed as part of the registration
statement that the registrant has undertaken to, and will, file with

the securitized pool balance as of the measurement date.
2.	 Securities relating to an offering of asset-backed securities registered
in accordance with General Instruction I.B.1. where those securities
represent an interest in or the right to the payments of cash flows of
another asset pool and meet the requirements of Securities Act Rule
190(c)(1) through (4) (17 CFR 240.190(c)(1) through (4)).
II. Application of General Rules and Regulations
A.	

Attention is directed to the General Rules and Regulations under the 

Securities Act, particularly Regulation C thereunder (l7 CFR 230.400 to 

230.494). That Regulation contains general requirements regarding the 

preparation and filing of registration statements. 


B.	

Attention is directed to Regulation S-K (17 CFR Part 229) for the
requirements applicable to the content of the non-financial statement portions
of registration statements under the Securities Act. Where this Form directs
the registrant to furnish information required by Regulation S-K and the item
of Regulation S-K so provides, information need only be furnished to the
extent appropriate. Notwithstanding Items 501 and 502 of Regulation S-K, no

517 


table of contents is required to be included in the prospectus or registration
statement prepared on this Form. In addition to the information expressly
required to be included in a registration statement on this Form SF-3,
registrants also may provide such other information as they deem appropriate.
C.	

Where securities are being registered on this Form, Rule 456(c) permits, but
does not require, the registrant to pay the registration fee on a pay-as-you-go
basis and Rule 457(s) permits, but does not require, the registration fee to be
calculated on the basis of the aggregate offering price of the securities to be
offered in an offering or offerings off the registration statement. If a registrant
elects to pay all or a portion of the registration fee on a deferred basis, the Fee
Table in the initial filing must identify the classes of securities being
registered and provide that the registrant elects to rely on Rule 456(c) and
Rule 457(s), but the Fee Table does not need to specify any other information.
When the registrant amends the Fee Table in accordance with Rule
456(c)(1)(ii), the amended Fee Table must include either the dollar amount of
securities being registered if paid in advance of or in connection with an
offering or offerings or the aggregate offering price for all classes of securities
referenced in the offerings and the applicable registration fee.

D.	

Information is only required to be furnished as of the date of initial
effectiveness of the registration statement to the extent required by Rule
430D. Required information about a specific transaction must be included in
the prospectus in the registration statement by means of a prospectus that is
deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement pursuant to

518 


Rule 430D, a post-effective amendment to the registration statement, or a
periodic or current report under the Exchange Act incorporated by reference
into the registration statement and the prospectus and identified in a
prospectus filed, as required by Rule 430D, pursuant to Rule 424(h) or Rule
424(b) (§230.424(h) or §230.424(b) of this chapter)

III.Registration of Additional Securities Pursuant to Rule 462(b). With respect to
the registration of additional securities for an offering pursuant to Rule 462(b)
under the Securities Act, the registrant may file a registration statement
consisting only of the following: the facing page; a statement that the contents
of the earlier registration statement, identified by file number, are incorporated
by reference; required opinions and consents; the signature page; and any
price-related information omitted from the earlier registration statement in
reliance on Rule 430A that the registrant chooses to include in the new
registration statement. The information contained in such a Rule 462(b)
registration statement shall be deemed to be a part of the earlier registration
statement as of the date of effectiveness of the Rule 462(b) registration
statement. Any opinion or consent required in the Rule 462(b) registration
statement may be incorporated by reference from the earlier registration
statement with respect to the offering, if: (i) such opinion or consent expressly
provides for such incorporation; and (ii) such opinion relates to the securities
registered pursuant to Rule 462(b). See Rule 411(c) and Rule 439(b) under the
Securities Act.

519 


IV.

Registration Statement Requirements. Include only one form of

prospectus for the asset class that may be securitized in a takedown of assetbacked securities under the registration statement. A separate form of prospectus
and registration statement must be presented for each country of origin or country
of property securing pool assets that may be securitized in a discrete pool in a
takedown of asset-backed securities. For both separate asset classes and
jurisdictions of origin or property, a separate form of prospectus is not required
for transactions that principally consist of a particular asset class or jurisdiction
which also describe one or more potential additional asset classes or jurisdictions,
so long as the pool assets for the additional classes or jurisdictions in the
aggregate are below 10% of the pool, as measured by dollar volume, for any
particular takedown.

Securities Offered. Select the appropriate type or types of securities offered as to
which this notice is filed. If the securities are debt convertible into other
securities, however, select “Debt” and any other appropriate types of securities
except for “Equity.” For purposes of this filing, use the ordinary dictionary and
commonly understood meanings of these categories, except for the term
“structured finance product,” which is defined in Rule 501(a) of the Securities Act
of 1933, 17 CFR 230.501(a). For instance, equity securities would be securities
that represent proportional ownership in an issuer, such as ordinary common and
preferred stock of corporations and partnership and limited liability company
interests; debt securities would be securities representing money loaned to an
issuer that must be repaid to the investor at a later date; pooled investment fund
interests would be securities that represent ownership interests in a pooled or
collective investment vehicle; tenant-in-common securities would be securities
that include an undivided fractional interest in real property other than a mineral
property; and mineral property securities would be securities that include an
533 


undivided interest in an oil, gas or other mineral property. For issuers of
structured finance products, identify the sponsor for the securities, the principal
originators for the assets in the underlying pool, and the servicer or collateral

state revenues in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP). Foreign issuers should calculate revenues in U.S. dollars
