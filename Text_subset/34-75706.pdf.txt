In the Matter of

ORDER APPROVING
APPLICATION OF FUND
ADMINISTRATOR FOR
PAYMENT OF FEES
AND EXPENSES

On December 12, 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“Commission” or “SEC”) issued an Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-andDesist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”) against GLG
Partners, Inc. and GLG Partners, L.P. Pursuant to the Order, GLG Partners, Inc. and
GLG Partners, L.P. (“Respondents”) agreed to pay disgorgement of $7,766,667,
prejudgment interest of $437,679 and civil money penalties totaling $750,000 to the
Commission.1 The Commission found, among other things, that Respondents failed to
maintain sufficient controls relating to the valuation of fund assets resulting in
Respondents overvaluing a 25% private equity stake in an emerging market coalmining company (“Coal Co.”). The overvaluation of the asset led to misstatements in
Respondents’ filings with the SEC relating to the period from 2008 through the second
quarter of 2010, as well as Respondents collecting inflated fee revenue in the amount

of the disgorgement. The Order also created a Fair Fund pursuant to Section 308(a) of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended.
On May 23, 2014, the Commission issued an order appointing Boston
Financial Data Services, Inc. (“Boston Financial”) as the Fund Administrator and
setting the administrator’s bond in the amount of $8,954,346.2 On September 19,
2014, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Plan of Distribution and
Opportunity for Comment.3 No comments were received. The Plan of Distribution
(“Plan”) was approved on October 24, 2014.4
Under the Plan, the present value of incorrectly collected fees will be distributed to
Eligible Clients5 from the net fair fund. Eligible Clients were determined harmed only if
that client paid inflated or excessive management and administrative fees as a result of the
conduct described in the Order. The staff identified for the Fund Administrator 988
Eligible Clients to receive distribution payments from the Fair Fund.

The Plan also provides for the payment of the Fund Administrator’s fees and
expenses. The Plan states that all reasonable administrative fees, costs and expenses,
including the administrator bond premium, will be paid from the Fair Fund.
In accordance with Rule 1105(d) of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and
Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1105, the Fund Administrator has submitted an
invoice for March 2015 for the period from May 2014 to March 2015 totaling
$18,350.26 to Commission staff. The Commission staff has reviewed the Fund
Administrator’s invoice, confirms that the services have been provided, and finds the
fees and expenses of $18,350.26 to be reasonable and in accordance with the Plan.

The Commission staff has requested that the Commission authorize the payment of the
Fund Administrator’s invoiced fees and expenses of $18,350.26 from the Fair Fund.
Additionally, to streamline the process for future payments, the staff requests that the
Commission authorize, at the direction of the Assistant Director of the Office of
Distributions, the payment of the Fund Administrator’s future fees and expenses up to,
but not to exceed, $25,000 per monthly invoice, so long as the total amount paid to the
Fund Administrator, as of the date of the invoice to be paid, does not exceed the total
amount of the cost proposal submitted by the Fund Administrator by more than
$5,000.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, pursuant to the Commission’s Rules on
Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1101, et seq., that:
A.

The Commission shall pay the Fund Administrator’s invoice in the

amount of $18,350.26; and

amount of the cost proposal submitted by the Fund Administrator by more than
$5,000.

By the Commission.
