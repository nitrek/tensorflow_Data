In the Matter of
MICHAEL S. WILSON, CPA
and COTTERMAN-WILSON
CPAs, INC.,
Respondents.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that public
administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted against Michael S.
Wilson, CPA (“Wilson”) and Cotterman-Wilson CPAs, Inc. (the “Firm”) (collectively,

“Respondents”) pursuant to Section 4C1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”),
Section 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”), and Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) of
the Commission’s Rules of Practice.2
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondents have submitted Offers
of Settlement (the “Offers”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V, Respondents consent
to the entry of this Order Instituting Public Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings
Pursuant to Section 4C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Section 203(k) of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings,
and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.
III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offers, the Commission finds3 that:
SUMMARY
1.
This proceeding arises out of Respondents’ failure to complete surprise
examinations pursuant to Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-2 thereunder (the

1

Section 4C provides, in relevant part, that:
The Commission may censure any person, or deny, temporarily or permanently, to any person the
privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission in any way, if that person is found . . . (1) not
to possess the requisite qualifications to represent others . . . (2) to . . . have engaged in . . . improper
professional conduct; or (3) to have willfully violated, or willfully aided and abetted the violation of, any
provision of the securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder.
2

Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) provides, in pertinent part, that:
The Commission may . . . deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of appearing or practicing
before it . . . to any person who is found . . . to have engaged in . . . improper professional conduct.
The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents’ Offers of Settlement and are not binding on any
other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

“Custody Rule”) in 2009, 2010, and 2011.4 Professional Investment Management, Inc. (“PIM”), a
registered investment adviser, had custody of client assets held in three omnibus accounts at all
relevant times and was required by the Custody Rule to engage an independent public accountant
to conduct annual surprise examinations to verify those assets. PIM engaged the Firm to perform
these required annual surprise examinations from 1999 to 2011. Respondents completed the
surprise examinations on an annual basis from 1999 to 2008. However, Respondents failed to
complete the surprise examinations (i.e., conduct fieldwork, prepare and issue a surprise
examination report, and file Form ADV-E with the Commission) or withdraw from the surprise
examinations in 2009, 2010, and 2011, and, thus, caused PIM to violate the Prior Custody Rule or
the Custody Rule, as applicable, for each of those years. In addition, Wilson engaged in improper
professional conduct, within the meaning of Section 4C of the Exchange Act and Rule 102(e)(1)(ii)
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, in connection with the surprise examinations from 2009
through 2011.
RESPONDENTS

On December 30, 2009, the Commission adopted amendments to the Custody Rule, which became
effective March 12, 2010. See Custody of Funds or Securities of Clients by Investment Advisers, Release
No. IA-2968 (Dec. 30, 2009). Respondents’ conduct in 2009 was governed by the Custody Rule in effect
before the December 30, 2009 amendments (the “Prior Custody Rule”). See Custody of Funds or
Securities of Clients by Investment Advisers, Release No. IA-2176 (Sept. 25, 2003). The significant
differences between the Custody Rule and the Prior Custody Rule, as relevant to this specific proceeding,
are described below in Paragraph 11.

owned by Douglas E. Cowgill (“Cowgill”), Owner A, and Owner B. PIM was registered with the
Commission as an investment adviser from 1978 through September 30, 2013, and from June 24,
2014 to today. PIM provides third-party administration services and investment advisory services
to approximately fifteen retirement plan clients (which consist of approximately 325 participants
who, in turn, own approximately 425 individual retirement accounts that PIM advises), and also
provides investment advisory services to approximately twenty-five individual clients for their own
(non-retirement plan) accounts. PIM has approximately $120 million of regulatory assets under
management, and has custody of client assets through three omnibus accounts. PIM is the only
SEC registrant that the Firm or Wilson has ever had as a client.
FACTS
5.
The Commission filed suit against Cowgill and PIM in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Ohio on April 29, 2014 alleging that Cowgill and PIM violated
the antifraud provisions of the U.S. securities laws, and that PIM violated, and Cowgill aided and
abetted and caused PIM’s violations of, the registration provisions of the Advisers Act, the Prior
Custody Rule, and the Custody Rule. The Commission filed an Amended Complaint on August 7,
2014 that included additional counts against Cowgill and PIM, and the Court entered a Judgment
by Consent against Cowgill on August 21, 2014 as to all counts asserted in the Amended
Complaint. The Commission alleged that PIM and Cowgill hid a shortfall of more than $700,000
in client assets by sending false account statements to clients.
6.
At all relevant times, PIM maintained client funds in an omnibus checking account
held on an agency basis at Custodian 1, and client securities in two omnibus accounts held on an
agency basis at Custodian 2 and Custodian 3. All client funds were initially deposited into the
omnibus checking account held at Custodian 1, and then were transferred for investment to various
firms, including Custodians 2 and 3.
7.
PIM maintained records for the omnibus accounts held at Custodians 1, 2, and 3 on
a client level (i.e., PIM kept track of the assets in these accounts on a client-by-client basis), and
sent directly to its clients periodic (typically quarterly) account statements that it generated based
upon its own internal records.
8.
However, neither Custodian 1, Custodian 2, nor Custodian 3 maintained records for
the omnibus accounts on a client level (indeed, none of these custodians was privy to PIM’s client
information), and neither Custodian 1, Custodian 2, nor Custodian 3 sent quarterly account
statements to any of PIM’s clients.
9.
The Custody Rule requires, and the Prior Custody Rule required, registered
investment advisers with custody of client funds or securities, like PIM, to implement certain
controls designed to protect those client assets from loss, misappropriation, misuse, or the adviser’s
insolvency.

4

10.
Specifically, the Prior Custody Rule required registered investment advisers to
either: (i) have a reasonable basis for believing that a “qualified custodian,” such as a bank or
broker-dealer, was sending quarterly account statements to each of the clients for which they
maintained funds or securities; or (ii) send the quarterly account statements themselves and obtain
an annual surprise examination by an independent public accountant to verify all of the client funds
and securities.
11.
The Custody Rule amended the Prior Custody Rule by, among other things,
requiring all registered investment advisers with custody of client funds or securities to undergo an
annual surprise examination by an independent public accountant to verify all of the client funds
and securities, regardless of whether such advisers had a reasonable basis for believing that a
“qualified custodian,” such as a bank or broker-dealer, was sending quarterly account statements to
each of the clients for which they maintained funds or securities.5
12.
PIM thus was obligated in 2009 under the Prior Custody Rule to have the client
assets held in omnibus accounts at Custodians 1, 2, and 3 verified through surprise examination
by an independent public accountant because none of these custodians sent quarterly account
statements directly to PIM’s clients (and PIM did not have a reasonable basis for believing that they
did so), and also was obligated in 2010 and 2011 under the Custody Rule to have the client assets
held in omnibus accounts at Custodians 1, 2, and 3 verified through surprise examination by an
independent public accountant because PIM had custody of those assets.
PIM Engaged the Firm to Perform the
2009, 2010, and 2011 Surprise Examinations
13.
PIM engaged the Firm to complete PIM’s surprise examinations for the periods of
time ending April 30, 2009 (the “2009 Exam”), April 30, 2010 (the “2010 Exam”), and May 31,
2011 (the “2011 Exam”).

5

As reflected in Rule 206(4)-2(a)(4), the Custody Rule also amended the Prior Custody Rule to require
all surprise examinations be conducted pursuant to a written agreement between the adviser and the
accountant that explicitly requires the accountant to: (i) file Form ADV-E with the Commission within
120 days of the time chosen by the accountant stating that it has examined the client funds and securities
and describing the nature and extent of the examination; (ii) notify the Commission within one business
day of its finding any material discrepancies; and (iii) file Form ADV-E within four business days of
resignation or dismissal from, or other termination of the engagement, along with a statement that
includes, among other things, the date of such resignation, dismissal, removal, or other termination, and
an explanation of any problems that contributed to such resignation, dismissal, removal, or other
termination. The Custody Rule thus established a new contractual reporting obligation for accountants
regarding their resignation or dismissal from, or other termination of the engagement, and established a
120-day deadline by which surprise examinations must be completed.

5

14.
Owner A, on behalf of PIM, engaged the Firm on or about May 28, 2009 to
perform the 2009 Exam by signing a three-page letter in which the Firm represented, among other
things, that:
We will examine management’s assertion, included in the
Management Statement Regarding Compliance with Certain
Provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Act), that
Professional Investment Management, Inc. (the Company)
complied with certain provisions of rules 204-2(b) and 206(4)-2 of
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 as of April 30, 2009 and
during the period June 1, 2008 to April 30, 2009. The Company is
responsible for compliance with the requirements of the [A]ct.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
assertion about the Company’s compliance based on our
examination.
Our examination will be conducted in accordance with attestation
standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants [(“AICPA”)]. . . . .6
15.

PIM also engaged the Firm to perform the 2010 and 2011 Exams.

16.
Wilson was the sole CPA on each of the 2009, 2010, and 2011 Exams, and was
solely responsible for completing the planning and fieldwork, supervising the two non-CPAs
who performed largely ministerial work on these exams, issuing a report or choosing to withdraw
from the engagement, and ensuring that Form ADV-E was filed with the Commission for each of
the years for which the Firm was engaged by PIM to perform a surprise examination.
Respondents’ 2009 Exam Report Lacks Reasonable Basis
17.
Respondents performed field work in connection with the 2009 Exam. Indeed, the
Firm sent invoices to PIM reflecting the work it had performed, and PIM paid each of these
invoices in full.

6

The AICPA attestation standards applicable to surprise examinations performed pursuant to the Prior
Custody Rule and the Custody Rule are set forth in AT Section 101, “Attest Engagements” and AT
Section 601, “Compliance Attestation.” See, e.g., Commission Guidance Regarding Independent Public
Accountant Engagements Performed Pursuant to Rule 206(4)-2 Under the Investment Advisers Act of
1940, Release No. IA-2969 (Dec. 30, 2009). This December 30, 2009 interpretative guidance had not
been published at the time that PIM engaged the Firm to perform the 2009 Exam, but was published prior
to both the date that the Firm issued its report for the 2009 Exam and the dates that PIM engaged the Firm
to perform the 2010 and 2011 Exams.

6

18.
Respondents signed a final report for the 2009 Exam on or about July 27, 2010,
which provides the following opinion:
We have examined management’s assertion, included in the
accompanying Management Statement Regarding Compliance with
Certain Provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, that [PIM]
complied with certain provisions of rules 204-2(b) and 206(4)-2 of the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 as of and during the period ended April
30, 2009.
* * *
In our opinion, management’s assertion that [PIM] complied with the
requirement of subparagraphs (1) of rule 206(4)-2(a) under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 as of April 30, 2009, and has complied with rule
204-2(b) and the requirements of subparagraphs (2) and (3) of rule 206(4)2(a) under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 as of and during the
period from June 1, 2008 through April 30, 2009, is fairly stated, in all
material respects.
19.

Respondents’ opinion lacks reasonable basis for two reasons:
a. First, AT Section 601.11 requires an accountant to obtain a written assertion as
part of engagement performance. Respondents, however, did not obtain a
management assertion upon which their opinion is purportedly based. Wilson
knew that AT Section 101 requires a conclusion that a scope limitation exists
if the accountant fails to obtain a written assertion, 7and necessitates a
decision to provide a qualified opinion, to disclaim an opinion, or to
withdraw.8
b. Second, Respondents identified material variances, as of April 30, 2009, in the
records of certain of PIM’s client securities-holding accounts. Wilson sent a
fax to Cowgill on May 12, 2010 that identified these variances and directed
Cowgill to call Wilson to discuss, but Respondents’ workpapers do not show
that Respondents obtained evidence to explain these variances or otherwise
reconcile these variances. Respondents thus lacked sufficient evidence to
provide a reasonable basis for issuing a report containing an opinion that

See AT Section 101.58 (“When the practitioner’s client is the responsible party, a failure to obtain a
written assertion should result in the practitioner concluding that a scope limitation exists.”).
7

8

See AT Section 101.73-74.

7

management’s assertion that PIM complied with the Prior Custody Rule was
fairly stated, in all material respects. See AT Section 101.51.
Respondents Failed To File Form ADV-E With The Commission
In Connection With The 2009 Exam
20.
Respondents failed to file Form ADV-E with the Commission in connection with
the 2009 Exam. The Prior Custody Rule obligated the adviser to require the accountant to file with
the Commission Form ADV-E within 30 days of completing the surprise examination in order for
the adviser to comply with the Prior Custody Rule. Respondents never filed Form ADV-E in
connection with the 2009 Exam.
Respondents Failed To Complete The 2010 and 2011 Exams,
Did Not Timely Withdraw From These Engagements, and
Never Filed Form ADV-E With The Commission In Connection With These Exams
21.
Respondents were aware at the time that PIM engaged them to perform the 2010
Exam that the Prior Custody Rule had been amended by the Custody Rule, and understood that
the Custody Rule obligated the adviser to require the accountant to file Form ADV-E with the
Commission within 120 days from the date that the accountant had begun the surprise
examination in order for the adviser to comply with the Custody Rule.
22.
Respondents had never completed a surprise examination for PIM in less than 120
days. For instance, the surprise examination reports prepared in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and
2009 were prepared 391, 414, 213, 247, and 453 days after the commencement of each
respective surprise examination.
23.

Nevertheless, Respondents accepted the engagement for the 2010 Exam.

24.
By all accounts, Respondents performed field work in connection with the 2010
Exam. PIM did not cooperate with Respondents’ requests for information in connection with the
2010 Exam, but Respondents did not terminate the engagement. Instead, Respondents sent
periodic invoices to PIM reflecting the work they had performed. PIM paid each of these
invoices in full.
25.
Sometime in 2011 Wilson informed at least one PIM owner that Respondents
would be unable to complete the 2010 Exam within 120 days from the date that they had begun
the 2010 Exam. In response, a PIM owner proposed that Respondents begin the 2011 Exam,
complete the fieldwork that was necessary to complete both the 2010 and 2011 Exams, and then
simultaneously file Form ADV-E with the Commission for the 2010 and 2011 Exams.

8

26.
Respondents agreed to this proposal, accepted the engagement for the 2011 Exam,
and began simultaneously performing field work in connection with both the 2010 and 2011
Exams.
27.
PIM did not cooperate with Respondents’ requests for information in connection
with the 2010 and 2011 Exams, but Respondents did not terminate the engagement for either of
these examinations. Instead, the Firm sent invoices to PIM reflecting the work it had performed
in connection with these examinations, sending the last of such invoices to PIM on or about
October 30, 2011. PIM paid each of these invoices in full.
28.
Respondents never issued a report for either the 2010 or 2011 Exam, did not
timely withdraw from the engagements to conduct these examinations and notify PIM of their
decision to withdraw, and never filed Form ADV-E with the Commission in connection with
either of these examinations. See AT Section 101.64 (“The practitioner who accepts an attest
engagement should issue a report on the subject matter or the assertion or withdraw from the attest
engagement.”); AT Section 101.39 (requiring accountant to exercise “due professional care” in the
planning and performance of the engagement and the preparation of the report); AT Section 601.38
(requiring accountant to exercise “due care” in planning and performing an examination
engagement).
29.
It was not until January 11, 2013, more than 15 months after submitting their last
invoice to PIM in connection with the 2010 and 2011 Exams, that Respondents notified PIM that
they did not intend to perform any additional services for PIM.
30.
Months later, Owner A and Owner B asked Respondents to resume performing
surprise examinations for PIM. Respondents declined this request.
Respondents Caused PIM’s Violations of the Custody Rule and the Prior Custody Rule
31.
Respondents caused PIM’s violation of Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and
Rule 206(4)-2 thereunder.
32.
Wilson was the engagement partner for the 2009, 2010, and 2011 Exams, and was
the only CPA to perform work in connection with these exams. Respondents agreed to perform
the 2009, 2010, and 2011 Exams, and understood that PIM had engaged them to: (i) conduct the
2009, 2010, and 2011 Exams; (ii) verify funds and securities through actual examination; and
(iii) file with the Commission Form ADV-E within the time periods required by the Prior
Custody Rule and the Custody Rule.

9

33.

With respect to the 2009 Exam, Respondents failed to:
a. obtain a reasonable basis for issuing a report containing an opinion that
management’s assertion that PIM complied with the Prior Custody Rule was
fairly stated, in all material respects, because they failed to obtain:
i. a management assertion; and
ii. sufficient evidence to support such an opinion; and
b. file Form ADV-E with the Commission.

34.

With respect to the 2010 Exam, Respondents failed to:
a. complete the examination or withdraw from the engagement and notify PIM
of such withdrawal on a timely basis; and
b. file Form ADV-E with the Commission.

35.

With respect to the 2011 Exam, Respondents failed to:
a. complete the examination or withdraw from the engagement and notify PIM
of such withdrawal on a timely basis; and
b. file Form ADV-E with the Commission.
Respondents Engaged in Improper Professional Conduct

36.
Section 4C of the Exchange Act and Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) provide that the
Commission may censure or temporarily or permanently deny an accountant the privilege of
appearing or practicing before it if it finds, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that the
accountant engaged in “improper professional conduct.” Rule 102(e)(1)(iv) and Section 4C(b)
define “improper professional conduct” to include: (1) “intentional or knowing conduct,
including reckless conduct, that results in a violation of applicable professional standards”9; or
(2) negligent conduct in the form of: (i) “a single instance of highly unreasonable conduct that
results in a violation of applicable professional standards in circumstances in which [an
accountant] knows, or should know, that heightened scrutiny is warranted”; or (ii) “repeated
9

The Commission defines recklessness under Rule 102(e) to be the same as recklessness under the
antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws: conduct which is an extreme departure from the
standards of ordinary care. See Amendment to Rule 102(e) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 63 Fed.
Reg. 57164, 57167 (Oct. 26, 1998).

10

instances of unreasonable conduct, each resulting in a violation of applicable professional
standards, that indicate a lack of competence to practice before the Commission.”10
37.
During the 2009, 2010, and 2011 Exams, Respondents engaged in the following
improper professional conduct:
a. Respondents failed to file Form ADV-E with the Commission in connection
with the 2009, 2010, and 2011 Exams. See AT Section 101.39 (requiring
accountant to exercise “due professional care” in performing engagement);
AT Section 601.38 (requiring accountant to exercise “due care” in performing
engagement).
b. Respondents failed to complete the 2010 and 2011 Exams or withdraw from
these engagements and notify PIM of such withdrawals on a timely basis. See
AT Section 101.64 (“The practitioner who accepts an attest engagement
should issue a report . . . or withdraw from the attest engagement.”).
c. Respondents issued a report containing an unqualified opinion in connection
with the 2009 Exam in contravention of AT Section 101’s and AT Section
601’s requirements that they obtain a management assertion from PIM in
order to do so. See AT Section 101.58 (“When the practitioner’s client is the
responsible party, a failure to obtain a written assertion should result in the
practitioner concluding that a scope limitation exists.”); AT Section 601.11
(“[T]he practitioner should obtain from the responsible party a written
assertion . . . .”).
d. Respondents lacked a reasonable basis to conclude in their 2009 Exam report
that management’s assertion that PIM complied with the Prior Custody Rule
was fairly stated, in all material respects, because they identified material
variances in the records of certain of PIM’s client securities-holding accounts,
but did not obtain evidence to explain these variances or otherwise reconcile
these variances. See AT Section 101.51.
38.

Respondent appears or practices before the Commission as an
independent accountant, to comply with all requirements of the
Commission and the Board, including, but not limited to, all
requirements relating to registration, inspections, concurring
partner reviews and quality control standards.

F.
The Commission will consider an application by Respondent Firm to resume
appearing or practicing before the Commission provided that its state CPA license is current and
it has resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of accountancy.
However, if state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the Commission, the Commission
will consider an application on its other merits. The Commission’s review may include
consideration of, in addition to the matters referenced above, any other matters relating to
Respondent Firm’s character, integrity, professional conduct, or qualifications to appear or
practice before the Commission.
G.
Respondent Firm shall, within ten (10) days of the entry of this Order, pay to the
Securities and Exchange Commission: (i) a civil money penalty in the amount of $25,000; (ii)
disgorgement in the amount of $10,868, which represents profits gained as a result of the conduct
described herein; and (iii) prejudgment interest of $1,029. If timely payment is not made,
additional interest shall accrue pursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 3717 and SEC Rule of Practice 600.
Payment must be made in one of the following ways:
(1)

Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which
will provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;

(2)

Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov
through the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or

Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying
Respondent Firm as a Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these proceedings; a
copy of the cover letter and check or money order must be sent to Paul Montoya, Associate
Director, Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission, Chicago Regional
Office, 175 West Jackson Boulevard, Suite 900, Chicago, IL 60604-2908.
I.
Pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, a Fair
Fund is created for the disgorgement, interest and penalties referenced in paragraphs IV.C and
IV.G, above. Regardless of whether any such Fair Fund distribution is made, amounts ordered to
be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be treated as penalties paid to the
government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To preserve the deterrent effect of the
civil penalty, Respondents agree that in any Related Investor Action, they shall not argue that they
are entitled to, nor shall they benefit by, offset or reduction of any award of compensatory damages
by the amount of any part of Respondents’ payment of a civil penalty in this action (“Penalty
Offset”). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a Penalty Offset, Respondents
agree that they shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting the Penalty Offset, notify
the Commission’s counsel in this action and pay the amount of the Penalty Offset to the Securities
and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be deemed an additional civil penalty and
shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil penalty imposed in this proceeding. For
purposes of this paragraph, a “Related Investor Action” means a private damages action brought
against any or both of the Respondents by or on behalf of one or more investors based on
substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the Commission in this
proceeding.
V.
It is further Ordered that, solely for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in Section
523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 523, the findings in this Order are true and admitted by
Respondents, and further, any debt for disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalty or other
amounts due by Respondents under this Order or any other judgment, order, consent order, decree
or settlement agreement entered in connection with this proceeding, is a debt for the violation by
Respondents of the federal securities laws or any regulation or order issued under such laws, as set
forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(19).
By the Commission.
