In the Matter of

EXTENSION ORDER

The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has requested an extension of time until
June 18, 2014 to submit a Proposed Plan of Distribution under Rule 1101(a) of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 CFR 201.1101(a).
On December 12, 2013, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist
Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making
Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”) against GLG Partners, Inc. and
GLG Partners, L.P. (collectively, “Respondents”). 1 The Order required Respondents to pay a
total of $8,954,346 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties to the
Commission and created a Fair Fund pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, as amended.
In its request for an extension of time, the Division states that it is in the process of
soliciting proposals from fund administrators. The Division requires additional time to seek
approval of the appointment of the fund administrator and approval of a bond and to develop a
distribution plan.
