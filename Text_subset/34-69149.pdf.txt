In the Matter of

EXTENSION ORDER

The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has requested an additional extension of
time, until June 18, 2013, to submit a proposed Plan of Distribution under Rule 1101(a) of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans.
In its first request, the Division stated that after the issuance of the Commission’s
August 14, 2012, Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings pursuant
to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), Section 15(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, and Section 9(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, Making
Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”) finding
that, among other things, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Shawn Patrick McMurtry willfully
violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, the Division discussed a
potential distribution and determined that it needed additional time to identify eligible
claimants, develop a plan methodology, and propose a Plan of Distribution pursuant to
Paragraph IV. J of the Order. Exchange Act Rel. 67972 (Oct. 3, 2012). After further
deliberations, the Division has now determined that it requires an additional extension of time
to submit a proposed Plan of Distribution.

Accordingly, for good cause shown, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Division’s
request for an extension of time until June 18, 2013, for the submission of a proposed Plan of
Distribution is granted.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Elizabeth M. Murphy
Secretary
