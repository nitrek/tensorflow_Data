DISCUSSION OF AMENDMENTS
Form S-1 is the form used by domestic issuers to register the offer and sale of securities

under the Securities Act of 1933 when no other form is authorized or prescribed, and Form F-1 is
the corresponding form used by foreign private issuers. 5 Item 512 of Regulation S-K describes
the undertakings that an issuer must include in a registration statement.
Section 71003 of the FAST Act 6 amends Section 102 of the Jumpstart Our Business
Startups (“JOBS”) Act 7 to allow an emerging growth company 8 that is filing a registration
statement (or submitting a draft registration statement 9 for confidential review) under Section 6

3

15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.

4

17 CFR 229.512.

5

A “foreign private issuer” is defined in Rule 405 [17 CFR 230.405] under the Securities Act to mean any foreign
issuer other than a foreign government, except for an issuer that has more than 50% of its outstanding voting
securities held of record by U.S. residents and any of the following: a majority of its officers and directors are
citizens or residents of the United States, more than 50 percent of its assets are located in the United States, or its
business is principally administered in the United States.

7

Pub. L. No. 112-106, 126 Stat. 306 (Apr. 5, 2012).

8

An “emerging growth company” is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77b(a)(19)] to
mean an issuer with less than $1 billion in total annual gross revenues during its most recently completed fiscal
year. If an issuer qualifies as an emerging growth company on the first day of its fiscal year, it maintains that status
until the earliest of the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer during which it has total annual gross revenues of $1
billion or more; the last day of its fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the first sale of its common equity
securities pursuant to an effective registration statement; the date on which the issuer has, during the previous 3-year
period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or the date on which the issuer is deemed to be a “large
accelerated filer” (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2 [17 CFR 240.12b-2]). Section 71002 of the FAST Act
amends Section 6(e)(1) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77f(e)(1)] to provide that an issuer that qualifies as an
emerging growth company at the time it initiates the registration process, either by submitting a draft registration
statement or by filing it publicly, but which subsequently ceases to be an emerging growth company, will continue
to be treated as an emerging growth company until the earlier of the date on which the issuer consummates its initial
public offering pursuant to that registration statement or the end of the 1-year period beginning on the date the
company ceases to be an emerging growth company. Section 71002 became effective upon enactment.
9

Prior to filing a Form S-1 or F-1 for an initial public offering, emerging growth companies can submit draft
registration statements to the Commission for confidential review.

3

of the Securities Act on Form S-1 or Form F-1 to omit financial information 10 for historical
periods 11 otherwise required by Regulation S-X 12 if it reasonably believes the omitted
information will not be required to be included in the filing at the time of the contemplated
offering, so long as the issuer amends the registration statement prior to distributing a
preliminary prospectus to include all financial information required by Regulation S-X at the
time of the amendment. This provision takes effect 30 days after the date of enactment of the
FAST Act. In addition, Section 71003 directs the Commission to revise the general instructions
to Form S-1 and Form F-1 to reflect this self-executing change.
Section 84001 of the FAST Act requires the Commission to revise Form S-1 to permit a
smaller reporting company 13 to incorporate by reference into its registration statement any
documents filed by the issuer subsequent to the effective date of the registration statement. We
are adding a new paragraph to Item 12 of Form S-1 to effect this provision. 14
Currently, there are eligibility requirements for any issuer to use historical incorporation
by reference on Form S-1 for documents filed before the effective date of the registration

10

The historical financial statements that may be omitted are not limited to the financial statements of the emerging
growth company. For example, an emerging growth company may also omit the historical financial statements of
an acquired business from its filing or submission if the company reasonably believes those financial statements will
not be required at the time of the offering.
11

Emerging growth companies must include two years of audited financial statements in a registration statement for
an initial public offering of common equity securities. [15 U.S.C. 77g (a)(2)(A)]
12

Form F-1 filers are subject to the financial reporting requirements of Regulation S-X and Form 20-F. Item 8.A.
of Form 20-F [17 CFR 249.220f] contains the requirements for the historical periods applicable to foreign private
issuers filing on Form F-1.
13

A “smaller reporting company” is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act to mean an issuer that had a
public float of less than $75 million as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter
or had annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year for which audited
financial statements are available.

14

New paragraph (b) to Item 12 of Form S-1.

statement. These requirements will not be affected as a result of these amendments. 15 Smaller
reporting companies must meet each of these existing eligibility requirements and conditions to
use forward incorporation by reference on Form S-1. 16 For example, to be eligible to use
forward incorporation by reference, smaller reporting companies will be required to be current
by having filed (a) an annual report for its most recently completed fiscal year and (b) all
required Exchange Act reports and materials during the 12 months immediately preceding filing
of the Form S-1 (or such shorter period that the smaller reporting company was required to file
such reports and materials). Smaller reporting companies that are blank check companies, shell
companies (other than business combination related shell companies) or issuers for offerings of
penny stocks will not be permitted to forward incorporate by reference into a Form S-1. In
addition, the ability to forward incorporate by reference will be conditioned on the smaller
reporting company making its incorporated Exchange Act reports and other materials readily
available and accessible on a web site maintained by or for the issuer and disclosing in the
prospectus that such materials will be provided upon request.
Finally, we are making a conforming change to Item 512(a) of Regulation S-K to provide
for forward incorporation by reference of Exchange Act reports filed or furnished after the
effective date of the registration statement on Form S-1. 17 Our revised forms will be effective
for disclosure made on or after [insert date of publication in the Federal Register]. 18

15

General Instruction VII to Form S-1 sets forth the eligibility requirements for incorporation by reference.

16

Currently, forward incorporation by reference is not permitted for any issuers on Form S-1.

17

The undertakings in Item 512(b) of Regulation S-K will also be required in Form S-1 registration statements filed
by smaller reporting companies that use forward incorporation by reference.
18

The amendments being adopted today apply to emerging growth companies omitting financial information from
Form S-1 or Form F-1 and to smaller reporting companies using forward incorporation by reference in Form S-1.
The staff will consider whether the amendments discussed in this release should be made available to a larger group

II.

REQUEST FOR COMMENT
We invite comment on whether the interim final rules should be extended to other

registrants or forms. In addition, we request and encourage any interested person to submit
comments on any aspect of our interim final rules, other matters that might have an impact on the
rules, and any suggestions for additional changes. With respect to any comments, we note that
they are of greatest assistance if accompanied by supporting data and analysis of the issues
addressed in those comments.
III.

PROCEDURAL AND OTHER MATTERS
Under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), a notice of proposed rulemaking is not

required when the agency, for good cause, finds that notice and public comment are
impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. 19 Because these amendments
merely conform the specified forms to the requirements of a newly enacted statute, the FAST
Act, the Commission finds that notice and public comment are unnecessary. 20 These
amendments revise the Commission’s forms to make them consistent with the provisions of the
FAST Act pertaining to simplified disclosure requirements for emerging growth companies and
forward incorporation by reference for smaller reporting companies on Form S-1 and therefore
do not involve the exercise of Commission discretion.
The APA generally requires publication of a rule at least 30 days before its effective
of registrants, and for additional form types. Any future rulemaking proposal that may stem from the staff’s
consideration would be subject to notice and public comment.
19

5 U.S.C. 553(b).

20

This finding also satisfies the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 808(2), allowing the rule amendment to become effective
notwithstanding the requirement of 5 U.S.C. 801 (if a federal agency finds that notice and public comment are
impractical, unnecessary or contrary to the public interest, a rule shall take effect at such time as the federal agency
promulgating the rule determines). The amendments also do not require analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility
Act. See 5 U.S.C. 604(a) (requiring a final regulatory flexibility analysis only for rules required by the APA or
other law to undergo notice and comment).

6

date. 21 The Commission finds there is good cause for the amendments to take effect on [insert
date of publication in the Federal Register] because without the amendments the Commission’s
applicable forms do not conform to the requirements of Section 102 of the JOBS Act, as
amended by Section 71003 of the FAST Act and Section 84001 of the FAST Act. 22
Additionally, the Commission finds that the amendments relieve restrictions in the
Commission’s forms.
The amendments to Form S-1, Form F-1, and Item 512 of Regulation S-K will have an
effect on existing “collection of information” requirements within the meaning of the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1995. 23 We estimate the total annual decrease in the paperwork burden for all
affected companies to comply with the collection of information requirements in these
amendments is approximately 70,214 hours of company personnel time and approximately
$84,256,400 for the services of outside professionals. 24
IV.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
We are mindful of the costs imposed by and the benefits obtained from our rules and

amendments. 25 The Commission is adopting amendments to implement the specific statutory
mandates of Sections 71003 and 84001 of the FAST Act. Accordingly, the costs and benefits of

21

See 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).

22

Section 71003 of the FAST Act takes effect 30 days after enactment, and Section 84001 of the FAST Act
requires the Commission to revise Form S-1 within 45 days of enactment.
23

44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.

24

We are seeking emergency approval from the Office of Management and Budget for the revised burden estimates
associated with the final rule amendments to Forms S-1 and F-1 in accordance with the procedures of the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1995. In a separate notice, we are seeking public comment on the revised burden estimates as well
as a three-year extension of the same collections of information.
25

Section 2(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77b(b)] requires the Commission, when engaging in rulemaking
where it is required to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, to
consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action will promote efficiency, competition and
capital formation.

7

these amendments stem entirely from the statutory mandates of Sections 71003 and 84001. 26
A. Baseline
The baseline for our economic analysis is the filing requirements prior to passage of the
FAST Act and the amendments being adopted today. The amendments will impact disclosure
requirements for emerging growth companies (“EGCs”) that file Forms S-1 and F-1 and smaller
reporting companies (“SRCs”) that file Form S-1 for conducting a registered public securities
offering and elect to use forward incorporation by reference. Investors who rely on issuer
disclosures for making investment decisions will also be affected by the amendments mandated
by Sections 71003 and 84001 of the FAST Act.
Prior to the effectiveness of Section 71003, EGCs were required, when filing or
submitting Form S-1 or Form F-1 with the Commission prior to an initial public offering
(“IPO”), to provide all financial statements for historical periods required by Regulation S-X at
the time of the filing or submission, even though information for some historical periods may not
be required to be included in the prospectus contained in the registration statement at the time of
the contemplated offering. For example, prior to the effectiveness of Section 71003, an EGC that
intended to conduct an IPO during early 2016 and that submitted or filed its registration
statement in December 2015 would need to include audited financial statements for 2013 and
2014 in that registration statement to comply with the rules, even though at the time the issuer
intended to market the offering only 2014 and 2015 audited financial statements would be
required.

26

As the intent of this rulemaking is to implement the specific regulatory changes mandated by Congress, this
analysis focuses on the economic effects arising from those changes. We recognize that these amendments could be
made available to a larger group of registrants, and for additional form types. However, such discretionary
amendments would be beyond the scope of this rulemaking. See supra note 18.

8

The amendment pursuant to Section 71003 of the FAST Act will impact Form S-1 and F1 filings and draft registration statement submissions by domestic and foreign EGCs that conduct
initial public offerings. An analysis of EDGAR filings indicates that 504 EGCs filed Form S-1
for an IPO during calendar year 2014, compared to 363 EGCs that filed a Form S-1 during
calendar year 2015, through December 28th. The number of Form F-1 filings for an IPO by
EGCs totaled 65 and 51 for calendar years 2014 and 2015, respectively (Table 1). 27
Additionally, 299 and 133 EGCs submitted a draft registration statement during 2014 and 2015,
respectively, for confidential Commission review. 28

Currently, forward incorporation by reference is not permitted for any issuers on Form S1, 29 and issuers are required to file a post-effective amendment to disclose material information,

27

The Commission staff derived these estimates by analyzing filings made with the Commission during calendar
years. Data for 2015 is for the period January 1 to December 28, 2015. The Forms S-1 and F-1 filings include filings
for offerings that were later withdrawn or abandoned. Until October 2012, a significant number of EGCs submitted
draft registration statements through email and as a result are not included in EDGAR filings for that year.
28

Some of the issuers that submitted a draft registration statement may have also filed a Form S-1 or F-1.

29

Forward incorporation by reference allows an issuer to automatically incorporate by reference reports filed
pursuant to the Exchange Act, such as reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, subsequent to the effectiveness of the
registration statement.

9

including updates required as a result of Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act, 30 that may have
occurred prior to the completion of the offering. Forward incorporation by reference is available
under Form S-3, 31 the short-form registration statement for a follow-on offering, but only issuers
that meet specific registrant and transaction requirements can utilize that form. Because many
SRCs are ineligible to use Form S-3, they are required to use Form S-1 for conducting a
registered securities offering. 32 As Table 2 presents, approximately 448 SRCs filed Form S-1 for
conducting a follow-on offering while 150 SRCs filed Form S-3 during calendar year 2014. 33

The amendment pursuant to Section 84001 of the FAST Act will impact the number and
disclosure content of post-effective amendments filed by eligible SRCs. Analysis of EDGAR
filings indicates that approximately 204 SRCs filed 379 post-effective amendments during 2014,
while another 217 filed 404 such amendments during calendar year 2015, through December

30

15 U.S.C. 77j(a)(3). When a prospectus is used more than nine months after the effective date of the registration
statement, the information contained therein cannot be dated more than sixteen months prior to such use.
31

17 CFR 239.13.

32

SRCs may be eligible to use Form S-3 for secondary offerings if the securities are listed on a national securities
exchange or are quoted on the automated quotation system of a national securities association. See Instruction I.B.3
of Form S-3. In addition, SRCs may be eligible to use Form S-3 for limited primary offerings if the SRC has at least
one class of common equity securities listed on a national securities exchange. See Instruction I.B.6. of Form S-3.
33
The Commission staff derived these estimates by analyzing filings made with the Commission during calendar
years. SRCs status was determined based on the filer status checked on the cover page of Form 10-K filed during the
year.

10

15th. 34 Some SRCs could have avoided at least some post-effective amendment filings if forward
incorporation had been available.
B. Analysis of the Amendments
The statutory change to Section 102 of the JOBS Act and the corresponding amendment
to our forms pursuant to Section 71003 of the FAST Act allow EGCs to omit certain historical
financial statements required under Regulation S-X from their pre-initial public offering
registration statement, which simplifies and reduces disclosure requirements for those EGCs. As
Table 1 shows, up to 569 EGCs filing Form S-1 or F-1 and 299 EGCs submitting draft
registration statements during calendar year 2014 could possibly have benefitted from such
scaled down disclosure requirements. These amendments to the statute and our forms will ease
the filing requirements for EGCs, which could promote small business capital formation through
initial public offerings.
The amendments that implement Section 71003 will enable EGCs to provide only
information that they reasonably expect will be required at the time they are marketing their
initial public offerings. This will lower the regulatory burden and thereby reduce the registration
costs for EGCs. The amendments may also shorten the time necessary to complete the initial
registration statement of an IPO, which could improve an issuer’s ability to raise capital in a
timely manner. To the extent issuers have sensitive material in their historical financial
information, the amendments may also enable EGCs to protect their competitive position by not
publicly disseminating information beyond what is required when the securities offering is
34

Some of these filings may relate to non-Section 10(a)(3) updates, such as for deregistering securities. These
filings will not be affected by an SRC’s new ability to forward incorporate by reference. Additionally, some filings
may comprise Section 10(a)(3) updates, as well as updates that will continue to be required as post-effective
amendments.

11

conducted. 35 Such benefits are more likely to accrue to EGCs that have higher proprietary costs
of disclosure. 36
At the same time, the amendments may reduce the amount and quality of public
information, thereby potentially increasing the level of information asymmetry and adversely
impacting the informational efficiency of the securities market. 37 As a result, investors could
become more risk averse and require a higher rate of return to compensate for such loss in
disclosure. This would lower the amount of potential issuer proceeds, which would offset the
lower disclosure costs stemming from the simplified disclosure requirements. 38 We believe,
however, that the amendment’s potential adverse impact on investors would be marginal because
such omitted financial information is not expected to be used by issuers in marketing their
offering and also because investors will have access to more recent and updated information.
The amendment pursuant to Section 84001 of the FAST Act to permit forward
incorporation by reference by SRCs in Form S-1 will further integrate disclosures under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and increase regulatory simplification. Forward
incorporation by reference will eliminate the need to update information in a filing that has
become stale or is incomplete. The amendment should decrease the existing filing burdens by
reducing multiple disclosure filings, thereby allowing SRCs to satisfy Form S-1 disclosure
requirements and access capital markets at a lower cost. As discussed above, during 2014 almost
35

For example, R&D-intensive firms may have competitive incentives to provide limited disclosure about their
R&D investments, material agreements or acquisitions in previous years.
36

See Jesse Ellis, C. Edward Fee & Shawn Thomas, Proprietary Costs and the Disclosure of Information about
Customers, 50 J. ACCT. RES. 685−727 (2012).

37

Market participants also can obtain information from Commission staff comment letters (publicly available after
the IPO) sent in connection with the staff’s review of a draft or filed registration statement. To the extent the lower
level of disclosure affects the information content of Commission staff comment letters, the post-IPO liquidity and
stock price volatility outcomes of EGCs could also be impacted.
38

See Susan Chaplinsky, Kathleen Weiss Hanley & S. Katie Moon, The JOBS Act and the Costs of Going Public
(Working Paper, Oct. 2015), available at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2492241.

12

half of the SRCs that filed a Form S-1 also filed a post-effective amendment to update
information in that form. In addition to the reduced audit and legal costs of not having to file
post-effective amendments, cost savings could also result from lower printing and delivery costs
for a smaller sized prospectus. Such reduction in costs could be offset, to some extent, by
ongoing costs related to the issuer’s new obligations to make the incorporated Exchange Act
reports and other materials readily available and accessible to investors on a web site maintained
by or for the issuer, or provided upon request.
The revision to Form S-1 will make its requirements more consistent with those of Form
S-3, which will particularly benefit SRCs that cannot use Form S-3 and have to rely on the
longer Form S-1 to register their securities offering. The amendment will be most effective for
continuous offerings, and those involving resales of securities, that often require repeated
informational updates. By avoiding the need to file certain post-effective amendments, SRCs
may be able to move quickly to raise capital when a ‘market window’ is open. Easing the filing
burden for such issuers may promote efficiency in SRC capital formation.
At the same time, revising Form S-1 to allow SRCs to forward incorporate by reference
could increase the analytical burden and search costs for potential investors. Instead of having
all the information available in one location, investors may need to separately access on a web
site or request the incorporated reports in order to price the offering security. As a result, costs to
investors for assembling and assimilating necessary information could increase. We do not have
data to assess if, and to what extent, the Form S-1 revision will be burdensome to investors. To
the extent that investors previously benefitted from the Commission staff’s selective review of
post-effective amendment filings, allowing forward incorporation by reference may eliminate
such reviews and, as a result, possibly increase the costs to investors.

13

As discussed above, the same eligibility requirements that currently apply to any issuer to
use historical incorporation by reference on Form S-1 will apply to forward incorporation by
reference by SRCs. Using these well-established eligibility requirements should provide
certainty to issuers and investors about when forward incorporation by reference may be used.
Requiring the SRCs to be current in their filing requirements will ensure that only issuers with a
demonstrated ability to comply with Exchange Act reporting requirements are eligible to forward
incorporate by reference, which will help to address concerns about investors being able to
readily procure updated information through Exchange Act filings that would otherwise have
been available through a post-effective amendment.
