ORDER APPROVING
DISTRIBUTION PLAN
OF A FAIR FUND AND
APPOINTING A FUND
ADMINISTRATOR

On March 16, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”)
issued an Order Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions Pursuant to Section 8A of
the Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as
to Prime Capital Services, Inc. and Gilman Ciocia, Inc. (Rel. No. 33-9113) (the “Order”).
Simultaneously with the entry of the Order, the Commission accepted settlement offers from
Respondents Prime Capital Services, Inc. (“PCS”) and Gilman Ciocia, Inc. (“G&C”) in which
they consented to the entry of the Order without admitting or denying the Order’s findings. PCS
was ordered to pay total of $144,262.58 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest to the
Commission, and G&C was ordered to pay total of $450,001.00 in disgorgement and civil
penalties to the Commission. The Commission established a Fair Fund pursuant to Section 308

of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for these payments (the “Fund”). The funds received by the
Commission have been deposited at the U.S. Treasury. Payments from other respondents in this
administrative proceeding may be added to the Fund if so ordered by the Commission. Other
than these items, it is not anticipated that the Fund will receive additional funds.
On February 1, 2011, the Commission published a “Notice of Proposed Modified Plan
and Opportunity for Comment” (“Notice”) in connection with this proceeding pursuant to Rule
1103 of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1103,
(Exchange Act Release No. 63813) and posted the Notice on the Commission’s website,
www.sec.gov.1 The Notice advised interested parties that they could obtain a copy of the
proposed modified plan of distribution (“Modified Distribution Plan”) by printing a copy from
the Commission’s public website, http://www.sec.gov/ or by submitting a written request to
Robert J. Keyes, Associate Regional Director and Chief of Regional Office Operations of the
New York Regional Office, United States Securities and Exchange Commission, 3 World
Financial Center, Room 400, New York, New York 10281-1022.
The Notice also advised that all persons desiring to comment on the Modified
Distribution Plan could submit their views, in writing, no later than thirty days from the date of
the Notice to the Office of the Secretary, United States Securities and Exchange Commission,
100 F Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20549-1090; or by using the Commission’s Internet

proposed Modified plan can be found at http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2011/34-63813-mdp.pdf.

comments@sec.gov. The Commission received no comments on the Modified Distribution
Plan.2
The Modified Distribution Plan states that monies from the Fund will be distributed to
eligible investors who paid fees and charges associated with their variable annuity investments
and who were described in the Order and/or who testified about their investment experience at an
administrative hearing. The Modified Distribution Plan describes the procedures that will be
used to identify the eligible investors who will receive distributions, and the methodology that
will be used to calculate payments.
The Division of Enforcement requests that the Commission approve the Modified
Distribution Plan as written. The Division also requests that the Commission approve the
appointment of Robert J. Keyes, Associate Regional Director and Chief of Regional Office
Operations of the New York Regional Office, as the Fund Administrator, as proposed in the
Modified Distribution Plan.
The Commission finds that the Modified Distribution Plan provides for an appropriate
distribution of monies paid by PCS and G&C pursuant to the Order.
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, pursuant to Rule 1104 of the Commission’s
Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1103, that the Modified
Distribution Plan is approved.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, pursuant to Rule 1105 of the Commission’s Rules on Fair
Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1105, that Robert J. Keyes is appointed as the
Fund Administrator in accordance with the terms of the Modified Distribution Plan and that, in

The Division of Enforcement previously filed a different version of a proposed distribution plan, which was
noticed for comment on September 23, 2010. Prime Capital Services, Inc. et al., Exchange Act Rel. No. 62979
(Sep. 23, 2010). No comments were received on the original plan.

accordance with Rule 1105(c), 17 C.F.R. § 201.1105(c), no bond is required since the Fund
Administrator is a Commission employee.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Secretary
