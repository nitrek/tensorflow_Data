In the Matter of

APPROVING FUND
ADMINISTRATOR BOND AMOUNT

On August 14, 2012, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative and
Cease-and-Desist Proceedings pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section
15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Section 9(b) of the Investment Company
Act of 1940, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist
Order (“Order”) finding that Wells Fargo Brokerage Services, LLC n/k/a Wells Fargo
Securities, LLC (“Wells Fargo”) and Shawn Patrick McMurtry (collectively “Respondents”)
willfully violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933. (Securities Act
Rel. No. 9349 (Aug. 14, 2012)). Pursuant to the Order, Wells Fargo paid disgorgement of
$65,000, prejudgment interest of $16,571.96, and a civil money penalty of $6,500,000, and
Shawn Patrick McMurtry paid a civil money penalty in the amount of $25,000 for a total
payment of $6,606,571.96. The Order directed that these funds be used to create a Fair Fund
pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and required
Wells Fargo to pay all reasonable costs and expenses for the distribution of the Fair Fund.
The Order further required Wells Fargo to retain a Fund Administrator “not unacceptable” to

Commission staff. Wells Fargo has informed the Division of Enforcement staff that it
proposes Michael J. Liccar and Company LLC (“Liccar”) as the Fund Administrator.
The Division of Enforcement staff now seeks the appointment of Liccar as the Fund
Administrator and the approval of a fund administrator bond in the amount of $6,606,571.96
that is equal to size of the Fair Fund. The Division of Enforcement staff evaluated Liccar’s
ability to serve as the Fund Administrator for the distribution of the Fair Fund and determined
that Liccar was not unacceptable.
Accordingly, pursuant to Rules 1105(a) and 1105(c) of the Commission’s Rules on
Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1105, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that
Liccar is appointed as the Fund Administrator, and that Liccar will obtain a bond in the
manner prescribed in Rule 1105(c) in the approved amount of $6,606,571.96.
By the Commission.
