Amendment No. 1 and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of a Proposed Rule Change, as
Modified by Amendment No. 1, Consisting of Proposed Revisions to MSRB Rule G-30, on Prices
and Commissions and the Deletion of Rule G-18, on Execution of Transactions
I.

Introduction
On January 29, 2014, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (the “MSRB” or

“Board”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC” or “Commission”),
pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Act”) 1 and Rule 19b-4
thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change consisting of proposed revisions to MSRB Rule G-30, on
prices and commissions and the deletion of Rule G-18, on execution of transactions. The
proposed rule change was published for comment in the Federal Register on February 19, 2014. 3
The Commission received two comment letters on the proposal. 4 On April 29, 2014, the
MSRB submitted a response to these comments 5 and filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed

as modified by Amendment No. 1, on an accelerated basis.
II.

Description of the Proposed Rule Change
The MSRB states that the purpose of the proposed rule change is to codify the substance

of existing fair-pricing obligations of brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers
(collectively, “dealers”) and further streamline the MSRB’s Rule Book. 7 Fair-pricing provisions
are currently organized in two separate rules, Rules G-18 and G-30, with interpretive guidance
under Rule G-30 as well as under a third rule, Rule G-17, on fair dealing. 8
According to the MSRB, the proposed rule change will achieve this purpose by
consolidating Rules G-18 and G-30 into a single fair-pricing rule, and consolidating the existing
interpretive guidance under Rules G-17 and G-30 9 and codifying that guidance in the same

MSRB, dated April 29, 2014 (the “MSRB Amendment Letter”), available at
http://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-msrb-2014-01/msrb201401-3.pdf. In Amendment No.
1, the MSRB partially amended the text of the original proposed rule change to (i) revise
Supplemental Material .05 of Rule G-30 to reference MSRB Rule G-48 (Transactions with
Sophisticated Municipal Market Professionals) rather than MSRB Rule G-17; (ii) amend
the text of MSRB Rule G-48(b) to reference MSRB Rule G-30 rather than Rule G-18; (iii)
preserve rule number G-18 for possible future rulemaking; and (iv) insert a clarifying
clause into Supplementary Material .02(b) of Rule G-30. The MSRB also requested that
the proposed rule change be made effective 60 days after Commission approval.

The formal fair-pricing guidance under current Rule G-30 that is to be codified was not
filed with the Commission, and is as follows: Review of Dealer Pricing Responsibilities
(Jan. 26, 2004) (“2004 Notice”); Interpretive Notice on Commissions and Other Charges,
Advertisements and Official Statements Relating to Municipal Fund Securities (Dec. 19,
2001); Republication of September 1980, Report on Pricing (Oct. 3, 1984); Interpretive
Notice on Pricing of Callable Securities (Aug. 10, 1979); Interpretive Letter – Rules G2

rule. 10 The MSRB states that it will archive the past interpretive guidance, current as of January
1, 2013, on its website. 11 The MSRB states that, to the extent that the past interpretive guidance
does not conflict with any MSRB rules or interpretations thereof, it remains potentially
applicable, depending on the facts and circumstances of a particular case. 12
The MSRB believes the proposed rule change will significantly enhance regulated
entities’ ability to understand and comply with their fair-pricing obligations by organizing them
together in a single location. 13 Further, the MSRB believes the relevant information from the
existing interpretive guidance will be succinctly stated in the new rule. 14 The MSRB believes
this could be particularly beneficial for new municipal market entrants, which would be in a
position to focus, with respect to fair-pricing obligations, on the new, consolidated rule. 15 The
MSRB states that the proposed rule change will ease burdens on dealers and reduce costs by

21, G-30 and G-32 (Dec. 11, 2001); and Factors in Pricing (Nov. 29, 1993). The formal
fair-pricing guidance under Rule G-17 that is to be codified that was not filed with the
Commission is as follows: Guidance on Disclosure and Other Sales Practice Obligations
to Individual and Other Retail Investors in Municipal Securities (Jul. 14, 2009); MSRB
Reminds Firms of their Sales Practice and Due Diligence Obligations When Selling
Municipal Securities in the Secondary Market (Sept. 20, 2010); and Bond Insurance
Ratings – Application of MSRB Rules (Jan. 22, 2008). The formal guidance under Rule
G-17 that is to be codified that was filed with the Commission is contained in Restated
Interpretive Notice Regarding the Application of MSRB Rules to Transactions with
Sophisticated Municipal Market Professionals (Jul. 9, 2012).

1. Proposed Changes to Rule G-30
Following is a summary of the provisions and the supplementary material comprising the
proposed changes to Rule G-30:
Rule Language
Proposed revised Rule G-30(a) applies to principal transactions and states that a dealer
can only purchase municipal securities for its own account from a customer, or sell municipal
securities for its own account to a customer, at an aggregate price (including any mark-up or
mark-down) that is fair and reasonable. 17
Proposed revised Rule G-30(b) applies to agency transactions. Subsection (i) states that
when a dealer executes a transaction in municipal securities for or on behalf of a customer, the
dealer must make a reasonable effort to obtain a price for the customer that is fair and reasonable
in relation to prevailing market conditions. 18 Subsection (ii) states a dealer cannot purchase or
sell municipal securities for a customer for a commission or service charge in excess of a fair and
reasonable amount. 19
Supplementary Material
Supplementary Material .01 specifies five general principles concerning the fair-pricing
requirements: (a) that a dealer, whether effecting a trade on an agency or principal basis, must
16

Id.

17

Proposed revised Rule G-30(a) is substantially similar to the first clause of existing Rule
G-30(a).

18

Subsection (i) of proposed Rule G-30(b) is derived from current Rule G-18.

19

Subsection (ii) of proposed Rule G-30(b) is derived from the first clause of existing Rule
G-30(b).

4

exercise diligence in establishing the market value of the security and the reasonableness of the
compensation received on the transaction; (b) that a dealer effecting an agency transaction must
exercise the same level of care as it would if acting for its own account; (c) that a “fair and
reasonable” price bears a reasonable relationship to the prevailing market price of the security;
(d) that dealer compensation on a principal transaction is considered to be a mark-up or markdown that is computed from the inter-dealer market price prevailing at the time of the customer
transaction; 20 and (e) that reasonable compensation differs from fair pricing. 21
Supplementary Material .02 provides a non-exhaustive list of relevant factors in
determining the fairness and reasonableness of prices. 22
Supplementary Material .03 provides a non-exhaustive list of relevant factors in
determining the fairness and reasonableness of commissions or service charges. 23 According to

20

This language was added to address comments the MSRB received in response to its
August 6, 2013, request for comment on a draft of the proposed rule change.

21

Supplementary Material .01 is derived from the 2004 Notice.

22

Supplementary Material .02(a) is derived from the 2004 Notice. Supplementary Material
.02(b) is derived from Rule G-30(a), the 2004 Notice, the MSRB Interpretive Letter –
Rule s G-21, G-30 and G-32 (Dec. 11, 2001), the MSRB Interpretive Letter – Factors in
Pricing (Nov. 29, 1993), the Republication of September 1980, Report on Pricing (Oct. 3,
1984); and the Interpretive Notice on Pricing of Callable Securities (Aug. 10, 1979).

23

Supplementary Material .03 is derived from existing Rule G-30(b), the 2004 Notice and
Republication of September 1980, Report on Pricing (Oct. 3, 1984). Supplementary
Material .03(a)(viii) refers to Rule 2830 of the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. (“NASD”), which provides a sales charge schedule for registered investment
company securities, and remains in effect in the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority,
Inc. rulebook. The MSRB has stated it recognizes that, due to the limitations of Section
15B(b)(2)(C) of the Act, it could not, by rule or interpretation, “impose any schedule or
fix rates of commissions, allowances, discounts, or other fees to be charged” by dealers
for the sale of municipal fund securities. The MSRB believes, however, that the charges
permitted by FINRA under NASD Rule 2830 may, depending upon the totality of the
facts and circumstances, be a significant factor in determining whether a dealer selling
5

the MSRB, the proposed rule change makes it easier for market participants to find these relevant
factors.
Supplementary Material .04 discusses the application of fair-pricing requirements to
some of the situations that may create large intra-day price differentials. 24
Supplementary Material .05 discusses the general duty under proposed revised Rule G30(b)(i) of dealers operating alternative trading systems to act to investigate any alleged pricing
irregularities on their systems brought to their attention, which duty applies equally to
transactions effected for SMMPs.25
III.

Summary of Comments Received and the MSRB’s Response
As noted previously, the Commission received two comment letters on the proposed rule

change and a response letter from the MSRB. 26 The comment letters each raised specific
concerns discussed in more detail below.
1. SIFMA Letter
As noted above, the Commission received a comment letter from SIFMA on the proposed
rule change. SIFMA is generally supportive of the proposed rule change. 27 At the same time,

municipal fund securities is charging a commission or other fee that is fair and
reasonable.
24

Supplementary Material .04 is derived from the 2004 Notice.

25

Supplementary Material .05 is derived from interpretive guidance that was previously
filed with the Commission and recently approved by the Commission to be generally
codified in Rule G-48 based on its relevance to SMMPs. See Restated Interpretive Notice
Regarding the Application of MSRB Rules to Transactions with Sophisticated Municipal
Market Professionals (Jul. 9, 2012) and Securities Exchange Act Release No. 71655 (Mar.
7, 2014), 79 FR 14321 (Mar. 10, 2014). New MSRB Rule G-48 will become effective
July 5, 2014.

26

See supra notes 4 and 5.

SIFMA expressed concerns about the timing of the proposed rule change and suggested that the
MSRB modify the proposed rule change in some respects. 28
On February 19, 2014, after the filing of the proposed rule change, the MSRB published a
request for comment on a draft best-execution rule. 29 SIFMA stated that the proposed rule
change and the draft best-execution rule should be viewed together because of the interplay and
practical effects between best execution and fair pricing. 30 SIFMA requested that the SEC not
move forward at this time to allow the MSRB to submit, and allow market participants to
comment on, a single filing on dealer execution and fair pricing obligations. 31
The MSRB responded that any potential interplay between a best-execution rule and fairpricing rules would be unchanged by this non-substantive codification of the MSRB’s existing
fair-pricing requirements. 32 The MSRB noted that any concerns about interplay can and should
be raised and addressed in the context of any future rulemaking process for the proposed bestexecution rule, which would involve substantive changes to dealers’ existing obligations. 33 In
addition, the MSRB stated that delaying the review of the proposed rule change would not
provide the SEC with any additional information that would aid its review or serve any other

beneficial purpose that cannot be adequately served in any future rulemaking process for a bestexecution rule. 34 The MSRB noted that a delay, however, would prolong the MSRB Rule Book
consolidation initiative designed to ease the burden on market participants who are seeking to
understand, comply with, and enforce fair-pricing requirements. 35
SIFMA stated that all factors discussed in existing MSRB interpretive guidance which
may be relevant in making pricing determinations should be listed in Supplementary Material
.02. 36 Specifically, SIFMA requested inclusion of the following factors: (i) improved market
conditions; and (ii) trading history, which could encompass such matters as the degree of market
activity for the securities and the existence or non-existence of market-makers in the securities. 37
SIFMA noted that its members’ experience with enforcement regulators is that a factor listed in
the rule is given more weight than an equally relevant, or arguably more relevant, factor that is
not contained in the rule. 38 SIFMA also requested that the first sentence of Supplementary
Material .02(b) be amended as follows: “Other factors include (but are not limited to)”
(SIFMA’s proposed additional language underlined). 39
The MSRB responded that the substance of the interpretive guidance is codified in the
proposed amendments to Rule G-30. 40 The MSRB noted that Supplementary Material .02(a)

encompasses the concept of “improved market conditions.” 41 Specifically, Supplementary
Material .02(a) refers to the “yield on other securities of comparable quality, maturity, coupon
rate, and block size then available in the market” (emphasis added in MSRB Response Letter). 42
As a more general matter, the MSRB has agreed with SIFMA’s suggestion to amend the first
sentence of Supplementary Material .02(b) by inserting a clarifying clause (i.e., “but are not
limited to”), and has filed Amendment No. 1 concurrently with the submission of its response. 43
The MSRB stated that the existing rules and interpretive guidance do not purport to exhaustively
identify all relevant factors. 44 According to the MSRB, the list of factors in Supplementary
Material .02(b) is (and was intended to be) non-exhaustive. 45 The MSRB further stated that
SIFMA’s suggested clarification is consistent with the substance of the existing rules and
guidance. 46 Additionally, as the MSRB stated in the proposed rule change, the interpretive
guidance that would be deleted from the MSRB Rule Book will be archived on the MSRB’s
website and, to the extent that past interpretive guidance does not conflict with any MSRB rules
or interpretations thereof, it remains potentially applicable, depending on the facts and
circumstances of a particular case. 47 The MSRB concluded that, on these grounds, the potential

relevance of the “improved market conditions” and “trading history” factors, if the proposed rule
change as amended were approved, would remain unchanged. 48
SIFMA stated that improvements should be considered whenever rules are being
reviewed, amended, or created. 49 SIFMA highlighted the extensive process required in
rulemaking and noted that because rules are amended so infrequently, this is a lost opportunity
especially in light of the MSRB’s recent practice of including, within a rule itself, supplemental
material that was historically issued in the form of interpretive guidance. 50
The MSRB stated that not all rulemaking activity requires consideration of substantive
changes and the MSRB has discretion to define the scope of its individual rulemaking
initiatives. 51 The MSRB determined that the objective of this initiative was to codify, not
substantively change, the existing fair-pricing requirements. 52 The MSRB noted that the limited
purpose of the proposed rule change is to improve the ability to locate, understand and comply
with fair-pricing standards. 53 The MSRB further stated that the request for comment,
accordingly, apprised commenters of the limited scope of the initiative. 54 The MSRB also stated
that, in another recent rulemaking initiative within the MSRB’s same overall plan to streamline

its Rule Book, the SEC approved the proposed rule change, which also had a limited scope. 55 In
such proposed rule change, the SEC believed that the MSRB, through its response, addressed
commenters’ concerns, other than those the MSRB determined were outside the scope of the
proposal. 56 The MSRB further stated that it values all comments that may be relevant to its
statutory charge to improve its rules and the municipal securities market, and will take all of
SIFMA’s additional, substantive suggestions under advisement for future rulemaking
initiatives. 57
2. Individual Investor Letter
As noted above, the Commission received a comment letter from an individual investor
on the proposed rule change. The individual investor expressed concerns about the pricing of
municipal bonds by dealers and the mark-ups observed in municipal securities transactions. 58
The individual investor described the mark-ups as inappropriate and abusive. 59 The individual
investor inquired about the possibility of establishing a centralized electronic trading platform for
municipal securities. 60
The MSRB stated that it appreciates input from individual investors and the commenter’s
letter touches on areas that the MSRB is monitoring. 61 The MSRB noted that these comments,

however, are outside the scope of the current rulemaking initiative to streamline the Rule Book
by non-substantively codifying existing fair-pricing standards. 62 The MSRB stated that it will
take these comments under advisement for future rulemaking initiatives. 63
IV.

Discussion and Commission Findings
The Commission has carefully considered the proposed rule change, as modified by

Amendment No. 1, as well as the two comment letters received and the MSRB’s response. The
Commission finds that the proposed rule change, as amended, is consistent with the requirements
of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the MSRB. In particular, the
proposed rule change is consistent with Section 15B(b)(2)(C) of the Act, which provides that the
MSRB’s rules shall be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to
promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons
engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating
transactions in municipal securities and municipal financial products, to remove impediments to
and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market in municipal securities and municipal
financial products, and, in general, to protect investors, municipal entities, obligated persons, and
the public interest. 64
The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section
15B(b)(2)(C) of the Act because it protects investors by preserving the substance of the current
requirement that dealers must exercise diligence in establishing the market value of a security and
the reasonableness of the compensation received on a transaction. The Commission also believes
62

Id.

63

Id.

64

15 U.S.C. 78o-4(b)(2)(C).

12

the proposed rule change will remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and
open market by easing burdens on dealers and clarifying existing dealer obligations.
In approving the proposed rule change, the Commission has considered the proposed
rule’s impact on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. 65 The Commission believes that
the proposed rule change includes accommodations that help promote efficiency and legal
certainty. Specifically, the MSRB’s retention of its interpretative guidance and the continuing
applicability of such guidance to the extent it does not conflict with any MSRB rules or
interpretations provide continuity to dealers. Furthermore, the Commission does not believe that
the proposed rule change would impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The proposed rule change makes no substantive change
to existing dealer obligations and, therefore, does not add any burden on competition. Moreover,
the Commission believes that the proposed rule change will, by contrast, ease burdens on dealers
by clarifying existing dealer obligations.
As noted above, the Commission received two comment letters on the filing. While
commenters suggested means to improve the filing or opposed certain aspects of the proposal, the
Commission notes that no commenters argued that the proposed rule change was inconsistent
with the applicable provisions of the Act.
For the reasons noted above, including those discussed in the MSRB Response Letter and
MSRB Amendment Letter, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change, as amended
by Amendment No. 1, is consistent with the Act.

VI.

Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change as Modified by Amendment No. 1
The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change, as amended

by Amendment No. 1, prior to the 30th day after the date of publication of notice in the Federal
Register. As discussed above, Amendment No. 1 amends the proposed rule change by: (i)
revising Supplemental Material .05 of Rule G-30 to reference MSRB Rule G-48 (Transactions
with Sophisticated Municipal Market Professionals) rather than MSRB Rule G-17; (ii) amending
the text of MSRB Rule G-48(b) to reference MSRB Rule G-30 rather than Rule G-18; (iii)
preserving rule number G-18 for possible future rulemaking; and (iv) inserting a clarifying
clause into Supplementary Material .02(b) of Rule G-30. 66 The MSRB also requested that the
proposed rule change be made effective 60 days after Commission approval. 67
The MSRB has proposed the revisions included in items (i) and (ii) because, since the
filing of the proposed rule change, other amendments to MSRB rules are being implemented that
will make these existing references in Rules G-30 and G-48 no longer accurate. 68 The MSRB
has proposed item (iii) to preserve rule number G-18 for possible future rulemaking activities
after its text is deleted by the proposed rule change. 69 The MSRB has proposed item (iv) to
clarify that the list of fair-pricing factors in Supplementary Material .02(b) of Rule G-30 is a

66

See MSRB Amendment Letter.

15

non-exhaustive list of factors. 70 Lastly, the MSRB requested that the proposed rule change be
made effective 60 days after Commission approval because the original proposed rule change did
not propose a specific effective date.
The Commission believes that Amendment No. 1 does not alter the substance of the
original proposed rule change and clarifies the original proposed rule change to more accurately
reflect existing MSRB rules and interpretive guidance. Accordingly, the Commission finds good
cause for approving the proposed rule change, as modified by Amendment No. 1, on an
accelerated basis, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act.

Conclusion
IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 71 that the

approved on an accelerated basis.
