SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: We are proposing amendments to Item 601 of
Regulation S-K, 1 Forms 20-F 2 and F-10, 3 and Rules 11, 4 102 5 and 105 6 of Regulation S-T. 7
I.

Introduction

Since the Commission’s implementation of the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and
Retrieval system (“EDGAR”) in 1984 to automate the receipt, processing, and dissemination of
documents required to be filed under the federal securities laws, 8 we have sought to make
EDGAR more efficient and comprehensive. For example, in 2000, we adopted rule and form
amendments in connection with the modernization of EDGAR that allowed registrants to file
EDGAR documents in the HTML format. 9 In addition, we expanded the permissible use of
hyperlinks in EDGAR filings to allow filers to hyperlink to other documents within the same
filing and to hyperlink to documents contained in other filings in the EDGAR database.
Recently, we issued a concept release examining the business and financial information
Regulation S-K requires registrants to disclose, how this information is presented, where and
how this information is disclosed and how we can leverage technology as part of these efforts. 10

The S–K Concept Release was a product of the staff’s work on the Disclosure Effectiveness
Initiative, which is part of a comprehensive evaluation of the Commission’s disclosure
requirements recommended in the staff’s Report on Review of Disclosure Requirements in
Regulation S–K (‘‘S–K Study’’). 11 In furtherance of the objectives of the Disclosure
Effectiveness Initiative, we are proposing rule amendments to Item 601 of Regulation S-K and
Rules 102 12 and 105 of Regulation S-T to require registrants to include a hyperlink to each
exhibit identified in the exhibit index in any registration statement or report that is required to
include exhibits under Item 601. 13 In addition, because the text-based American Standard Code
for Information Interchange (“ASCII”) format cannot support functional hyperlinks, we are
proposing to require registrants filing such registration statements or reports to file these forms
on EDGAR in HTML. We discuss these proposed amendments in more detail below.
II.

Discussion of the Proposed Amendments

Item 601 of Regulation S-K specifies the exhibits that registrants must file with
registration statements filed under the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) 14 and Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) 15 and with periodic and current reports under the
Exchange Act, which we will refer to collectively in this release as the “registration statements
and reports.” Item 601 also requires registrants to include an exhibit index that lists each exhibit

requirements in Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229 et seq.] and Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210 et seq.], and is considering
ways to improve the disclosure regime for the benefit of both public companies and investors.
11

The S-K Study was mandated by Section 108 of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. See Pub. L. 112–106,
Sec. 108, 126 Stat. 306 (2012).
12

Rule 102 of Regulation S-T sets forth requirements for exhibits included in electronic filings.

13

The proposed amendments exclude exhibits filed with Form ABS-EE [17 CFR 249.1401] and any eXtensive
Business Reporting language (“XBRL”) exhibits. See futher discussion below.

included with the filing. 16 Once an exhibit is filed, registrants can incorporate it by reference to
meet the exhibit requirements in subsequent filings to the extent permitted by our rules or the
applicable disclosure form. 17
Currently, filers must submit electronic filings to the Commission using the EDGAR
system in either the ASCII format or the HTML format. HTML has features that allow
electronic documents prepared in this format to include hyperlinks that link to another place
within the same document or to a separate document. A document filed in ASCII format can
include a cross-reference, but it cannot support a functional hyperlink. Since the time we
updated the EDGAR system to accept HTML formatted documents, HTML has become the
predominant format used by registrants. During 2015, over 99% of the filings that were made on
the forms that would be affected by the proposed amendments were filed in HTML. 18
Under the current system, someone seeking to retrieve and access an exhibit that has been
incorporated by reference must review the exhibit index to determine the filing in which the
exhibit is included, and then must search through the registrant’s filings to locate the relevant
filing to review for the particular exhibit. This process can be both time consuming and
cumbersome. We believe that requiring registrants to include hyperlinks from the exhibit index
to the actual exhibits filed would facilitate easier access to these exhibits for investors and other
users of the information.

16

See Item 601(a)(2) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.601(a)(2)], Rule 102 of Regulation S-T [17 CFR 232.102]
and Exchange Act Rule 0-3(c) [17 CFR 240.0-3(c)].
17

See, e.g., Item 10(d) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.10(d)]. Item 10(d) provides, with certain exceptions, that
where rules, regulations, or instructions to forms of the Commission permit incorporation by reference, a document
may be so incorporated by reference to the specific document and to the prior filing or submission in which such
document was physically filed or submitted.
18

During the 2015 calendar year, over 114,000 of these forms were filed on EDGAR. Approximately 845 of those
filings were submitted in the ASCII format.

5

Rule 105 of Regulation S-T sets forth the limitations on, and liability for, the use of
HTML documents and hyperlinks in EDGAR filings. Rule 105, among other things, currently
permits hyperlinking to other documents within the same filing, such as exhibits, and to
documents contained in other forms or schedules that have been previously filed on EDGAR.
Rule 105 prohibits hyperlinking to sites, locations or documents outside of the EDGAR system.
We are proposing to amend Item 601 of Regulation S-K and Rules 11, 102 19 and 105 of
Regulation S-T to require registrants to include a hyperlink to each filed exhibit as identified in
the exhibit index, unless the exhibit is filed in paper pursuant to a temporary or continuing
hardship exemption under Rules 201 or 202 of Regulation S-T or pursuant to Rule 311 of
Regulation S-T. 20 The proposed amendments would apply to nearly all of the forms that are
required to include exhibits under Item 601, 21 specifically Forms S-1, 22 S-3, 23 S-4, 24 S-8, 25 S-11, 26
F-1, 27 F-3, 28 F-4, 29 SF-1, 30 and SF-3 31 under the Securities Act; and Forms 10, 32 10-K, 33 10-Q, 8-

19

Rule 102 of Regulation S-T requires each exhibit to an electronic filing to be filed electronically unless there is an
applicable exemption.
20

17 CFR 232.201, 232.202 and 232.311.

21

The proposed amendments exclude Form ABS-EE, see footnote 13 above. Although the disclosure forms used by
registered investment companies would not be covered by the proposed amendments, some investment companies
file annual reports on Form 10-K. Those investment companies would be subject to the proposed amendments. The
staff will consider whether the proposals discussed in this release should be extended to a broader group of
registrants or additional form types. Any future rulemaking proposals that may stem from the staff’s consideration
would be subject to notice and public comment.

K, 34 and 10-D 35 under the Exchange Act. In addition, we are proposing corresponding
amendments to Form F-10 and Form 20-F.
The proposed amendments exclude the exhibits filed with Form ABS-EE because the
form is used solely to facilitate the filing of tagged data and related information that must be
filed as exhibits to the form. Form ABS-EE does not permit exhibits to be incorporated by
reference and the exhibits are in unconverted code. Therefore, we believe it is not necessary to
require that Form ABS-EE include hyperlinks to the exhibits that must be filed with the form.
The proposed amendments also exclude any XBRL exhibits that are filed with the affected forms
because the XBRL exhibits similarly are in unconverted code and not incorporated by reference
into other filings. 36
Under the proposed amendments, a registrant would be required to include an active
hyperlink to each exhibit identified in the exhibit index of the filing. If the filing is a periodic or
current report under the Exchange Act, a registrant would be required to include an active
hyperlink to each exhibit listed in the exhibit index when the report is filed. If the filing is a
registration statement, the registrant would only be required to include an active hyperlink to

The Commission has recently announced a time-limited program to permit registrants to voluntarily file structured
financial statement data using Inline XBRL. Inline XBRL will allow registrants to file the required information and
data tags in one document rather than requiring a separate exhibit for the interactive data, and may help inform
future Commission rulemaking in this area. Order Granting Limited and Conditional Exemption Under Section
36(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 from Compliance with Interactive Data File Exhibit Requirement in
Forms 6-K, 8-K, 10-Q, 10-K, 20-F and 40-F to Facilitate Inline Filing of Tagged Financial Data, Release No. 3478041 (June 13, 2016) [81 FR 39741]. The amendments we are proposing in this release and the Inline XBRL
program are part of the Commission’s continuing efforts and interest in modernizing the format of the information
filed on EDGAR to make it more accessible to investors and other users.

each exhibit in the version of the registration statement that becomes effective. 37 We preliminary
believe that this would ensure that the most complete exhibit index is hyperlinked and located in
one primary document.
Because the ASCII format does not support hyperlink functionality, the exhibit
hyperlinking requirement would be feasible only if registrants are required to file in HTML. We
are therefore proposing that all registrants be required to file the forms affected by the proposals
in HTML format. 38
We also propose to revise Item 601(a)(2) to remove obsolete language from the item
relating to paper filings.
Request for Comment
1.

Should we require registrants to include hyperlinks from the exhibit index to the

exhibits identified in the index for the registration statements and reports, as proposed?
2.

Should we exclude the Form ABS-EE exhibits and the XBRL exhibits that are

filed with other forms as proposed? What would be the costs and benefits to requiring registrants
to hyperlink to such exhibits?
3.

Registrants often file multiple pre-effective amendments before a registration

statement becomes effective. Each pre-effective amendment may include one or more exhibits
that the registrant has not filed previously. For example, when a registrant first files a Form S-1,

37

Similarly, for a registration statement, or post-effective amendment to a registration statement, that becomes
effective upon filing with the Commission, an active hyperlink to each exhibit listed in the exhibit index of such
registration statement or post-effective amendment would be required at the time of filing. See proposed
amendments to Rule 105 of Regulation S-T.

38

We are also considering ways to further enhance the presentation and usability of the exhibit index. HTML tags
identifying the exhibit index would make it possible to include a hyperlink to the exhibit index on a registrant’s
search results EDGAR landing page. This could allow investors and other users to more easily access the exhibits.

8

the registrant will list the exhibits and indicate by asterisk and footnote those that will be filed in
future amendments. By the time the registration statement becomes effective, the registrant
typically has filed most or all of the exhibits in previous amendments. Should we require
registrants to include hyperlinks to the exhibits filed with the initial registration statement and
each pre-effective amendment? Should we require registrants to include hyperlinks from the
exhibit index to the exhibits included in each pre-effective amendment to all of the exhibits filed
with each such amendment, as well as previously filed exhibits to the registration statement?
Should we require that active hyperlinks be included in other pre-effective registration
statements, such as those that include a preliminary prospectus distributed in connection with an
offer, often known as a red herring prospectus?
4.

Should we revise Form 6-K filed by foreign private issuers and/or other MJDS

forms, such as Forms F-7, F-8, and F-80, to require exhibit hyperlinks even though all exhibits
filed with these forms will be attached to them?
5.

Are there any particular difficulties in requiring registrants to provide hyperlinks

to the exhibits identified in Item 601 of Regulation S-K that are filed with a registration
statement or report as proposed?
6.

Our rules currently do not require a registrant that filed an exhibit in paper prior to

the time that it became subject to mandated electronic filing on EDGAR to refile the exhibit in
electronic format, although the registrant has the option to do so. 39 Our rules permit a registrant
to incorporate by reference an exhibit previously filed in paper into electronic filings.
Accordingly, there may be some instances in which a registrant incorporates by reference an
39

See Rule 102(a) of Regulation S-T. Rule 102(a) states an electronic filer may, at its option, restate in electronic
format an exhibit it incorporated by reference that was originally filed in paper format.

9

exhibit previously filed in paper, such as its articles of incorporation, into a Form 10-K or other
form, but cannot include a hyperlink to that paper-based exhibit. Accordingly, a proposed
instruction to amended Rule 105 of Regulation S-T would provide that no hyperlink is required
for any exhibit incorporated by reference that has not been filed in electronic format. Should we
require registrants to refile electronically any exhibit previously filed in paper so that they can
include a hyperlink from the exhibit index to the exhibit? If so, how long should registrants be
given to refile such exhibits? Are there alternatives that we should consider to address this
situation?
7.

Would smaller reporting companies and non-accelerated filers that currently file

in ASCII face any specific difficulties or incur any unreasonable costs in converting their filings
to HTML format? If so, should we keep the ASCII format as an EDGAR filing option for these
filers? 40
8.

Are there more effective ways to improve access to documents filed as exhibits by

registrants that we should consider? As an alternative to the proposed amendments, should we
require registrants to file and update a compilation of exhibits separately from the Form 10-K or
other forms? If so, which exhibits should be included in the compilation and how frequently
should registrants have to update them? Should we revise the exhibit numbering scheme to help
investors more readily identify exhibits? Would a more detailed numbering or identification
system improve investors’ access to the information filed as exhibits?
III.

Economic Analysis

40

We estimate that in calendar year 2015, 175 registrants filed a registration statement or report in ASCII.
Approximately 74% of these ASCII filings were filed by smaller reporting companies or non-accelerated filers.

10

As discussed above, we are proposing amendments that would require registrants that file
registration statements and reports that are subject to the exhibit requirements under Item 601 of
Regulation S-K, or that file on Forms F-10 or 20-F, to include a hyperlink to each exhibit
identified in the exhibit index of these filings and to submit all such filings in HTML format. 41
We are sensitive to the costs and benefits of the proposed amendments. In this economic
analysis, we examine the existing baseline, which consists of the current regulatory framework
and market practices, and discuss the potential benefits and costs of the proposed amendments,
relative to this baseline, and their potential effects on efficiency, competition, and capital
formation. 42 We also consider the potential costs and benefits of reasonable alternatives to the
proposed amendments.
Where practicable, we attempt to quantify the economic effects of the proposed
amendments; however, in certain cases, we are unable to do so because we lack the necessary
data. We do, however, provide a qualitative assessment of the likely economic effects. We
request comment on all aspects of the economic effects, including the costs and benefits of the
proposals and possible alternatives to the proposed amendments. We particularly welcome
comments that include data or qualitative information that would enable us to quantify the costs
and benefits associated with the proposals and alternative implementations of the proposed
amendments.
A.

41

Baseline

As indicated in note 13 above, the proposed amendments exclude Form ABS-EE.

42

Exchange Act Section 23(a)(2) [15 U.S.C. 78w(a)] requires us, when adopting rules, to consider the impact that
any new rule would have on competition. In addition, Section 2(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77b(b)] and
Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78c(f)] direct us, when engaging in rulemaking that requires us to
consider or determine whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, to consider, in addition to
the protection of investors, whether the action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation.

11

The proposed amendments would affect all registrants that file registration statements
and reports that are required to include exhibits under Item 601 of Regulation S-K, specifically
Forms S-1, S-3, S-4, S-8, S-11, SF-1, SF-3, F-1, F-3, and F-4 under the Securities Act and Forms
10, 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, and 10-D under the Exchange Act. In addition, the proposed amendments
would affect Forms F-10 and 20-F. Although registrants that currently file registration
statements and reports in HTML format would not be affected by the requirement to file in
HTML format, they would be required to include hyperlinks from the exhibits identified in the
exhibit index to the actual exhibits that are filed with the document or that were previously filed
with another document. Because the ASCII format does not support hyperlink capabilities,
registrants that currently file these forms and reports in ASCII format would be required to file in
HTML in addition to complying with the proposed exhibit hyperlink requirement.
We estimate that, in calendar year 2015, 9,589 registrants filed either a registration
statement or a report in HTML, while 175 registrants made filings in ASCII. Table 1 below
shows the number of registration statements and reports that registrants filed with the
Commission in calendar year 2015. Table 1 also presents the number of filings submitted in
HTML format and ASCII format, respectively, excluding amendments. Because hyperlinking is
not available in ASCII format, we present the baseline analysis of filings separately for HTML
and ASCII formats.

As shown in Table 1, among the types of forms affected by the proposed amendments,
Forms S-1, S-8, 10-K, 10-Q, 10-D, and 8-K were the most frequently filed in HTML format in
2015. As a proxy for registrants’ size, we used the filer status that registrants reported in their
Form 10-K in calendar year 2015. We found that 32% of the registration statements and reports
(excluding amendments) filed in HTML format were filed by large accelerated filers, 20% by
accelerated filers and 44% by smaller reporting companies or non-accelerated filers. 45 In
calendar year 2015, on average, large accelerated filers filed more registration statements and
reports in HTML format (16.5) than accelerated filers (14.9) or smaller reporting companies and
non-accelerated filers (9.7).
In calendar year 2015, a limited set of form types were filed in ASCII format. In
particular, Forms 8-K, 10-D, 10-Q and 10-K were the form types that were most frequently filed
in ASCII format. We found that only 4% of the registration statements and reports (excluding
amendments) filed in ASCII were filed by large accelerated filers; 3% by accelerated filers; and

43

The number of Form 10s includes Forms 10-12B and 10-12G.

44

The number of Form 8-Ks also includes Form 8-K12Bs.

45

The remaining 4% of 2015 filings in HTML format were filed by registrants whose filer status was not indicated.

13

74% by smaller reporting companies or non-accelerated filers. 46 As in the case of filings in
HTML format, in calendar year 2015, on average, large accelerated filers more registration
statements and reports in ASCII format (7.4) than accelerated filers (6.8) or smaller reporting
companies and non-accelerated filers (5.6).
i.

HTML Filers

To draw a baseline indicative of the current disclosure practices by HTML filers, we
selected a random sample of 570 filings from 2015 registration statements and reports (excluding
amended filings). This sample included 150 randomly selected Form 10-K filings and 420
randomly selected other filings in HTML format.
The proposed amendments would require registrants to include hyperlinks for all exhibits
listed in the exhibit index, whether included with the filing or incorporated by reference from a
previously filed document. Table 2 below shows the average and median number of exhibits 47
listed in the random sample of 570 filings by the type of forms affected by the proposed
amendments.

The remaining 19% of 2015 filings in ASCII format were filed by registrants whose filer status was not indicated.

47

In counting the number of exhibits, we did not include exhibits filed by pre-effective amendment because they
would not be affected by the proposed amendments as only the version of a registration statement that becomes
effective would require hyperlinks. Moreover, we did not include the following exhibits: 101.INS XBRL Instance
Taxonomy; 101.SCH XBRL Taxonomy Extension Schema Document; 101.CAL XBRL Taxonomy Extension
Calculation Linkbase Document; 101.DEF XBRL Taxonomy Extension Definition Linkbase Document; 101.LAB
XBRL Taxonomy Extension Labels Linkbase Document; and 101.PRE XBRL Taxonomy Extension Presentation
Linkbase Document because XBRL exhibits are not covered by the proposal.

Table 2 shows a significant variation in the number of exhibits listed in the exhibit index
across different types of forms. Among the Securities Act registration statements, Forms S-1, S4, S-11, F-1, F-4 and F-10 typically contain a large number of exhibits, while among the
Exchange Act reports, Forms 20-F and 10-K contain significantly more exhibits than other form
types. Overall, Forms S-1, S-4, S-11, F-1, F-4, F-10, 20-F and 10-K had a median number of 25
exhibits, compared to a median of four exhibits in the other nine types of registration statements
and reports. Forms S-1, S-4, S-11, F-1, F-4, F-10, 20-F and 10-K also had significantly more
exhibits incorporated by reference than the other nine types of registration statements and reports
affected by the proposed amendments.

49

Median represents the middle number of exhibits for each form type when the numbers of exhibits are listed from
the smallest to the largest. For instance, for Forms S-1, the number of exhibits listed in the index ranged from 0 to
125, with 21 as the middle number.

15

In general, the number of exhibits increases with a registrant’s size. Of the 570 sampled
filings, the filings by large accelerated filers had a median of 16 exhibits, of which six were
incorporated by reference; filings by accelerated filers had a median 14 exhibits, of which five
were incorporated by reference; and filings by smaller reporting companies and non-accelerated
filers had a median of 12 exhibits, of which only two were incorporated by reference.
Of the 570 sampled filings, we found that the exhibit indexes of only 6% of the filings
included hyperlinks. We found only two filings that included hyperlinks for all exhibits. In the
30 instances when registrants did not include hyperlinks for all exhibits, they were more likely to
include hyperlinks to exhibits filed with the document. Of the sampled filings on Form S-1, S-4,
S-11, F-1, F-4, F-10, 20-F and 10-K, approximately 7% had exhibit indexes that contained
hyperlinks for one or more exhibits in the index (“partially hyperlinked”). In particular, while
we found no fully hyperlinked Form 10-K, 8% of the 150 sampled Form 10-Ks were partially
hyperlinked.
To check whether current hyperlinking practices differ among registrants, we looked at
registrants’ filer status and found that smaller reporting companies and non-accelerated filers
were more inclined to include hyperlinks to their exhibits than large accelerated filers or
accelerated filers. We also reviewed the most recent Form 10-Ks filed in calendar year 2015 by
each of the companies on the Fortune 100 list, which includes the largest 100 U.S. companies. 50
We found no companies in the Fortune 100 list that provided hyperlinks to any of the exhibits
listed in their most recent Form 10-K exhibit indexes.

As discussed below, under the proposed amendments, the hyperlink requirement would
make exhibits incorporated by reference in the affected registration statements and reports more
easily accessible. For the exhibits incorporated by reference that were listed in the 570 sampled
filings, Table 3 shows the form types from which the exhibits were incorporated. The majority
of exhibits were incorporated from the same registration statements and reports affected by the
proposed amendments. For example, exhibits in Forms S-1 were largely incorporated from
previously filed Forms 8-K, 10-K, S-1, 10-Q, and 10. Only a small percentage of exhibits were
incorporated from form types without an exhibit index requirement, such as proxy statements.
ii.

ASCII Filers

51

Pursuant to Securities Act Rule 411 [17 CFR 230.411] and Exchange Act Rule 12b-23 [17 CFR 240.12b-23],
registrants can, under certain conditions, incorporate information by reference in answer, or partial answer, to an
item of a registration statement or report. Generally, the incorporated information must be filed as an exhibit to the
registration statement or report. In our analysis of the 570 sampled filings, we found several exhibits that were filed
for this purpose.

17

We reviewed 183 registration statements and reports filed in ASCII format in calendar
year 2015. In particular, we reviewed all of the 63 Form 10-Ks and a randomly selected sample
of 120 other forms filed in ASCII format. The exhibit indexes in the ASCII filings listed
significantly lower averages and median numbers of exhibits than in HTML filings. For
example, the sampled Form 10-Qs reported a median of three exhibits, of which two were filed
with the form. The 63 Form 10-Ks filed in ASCII format in 2015 included a median of seven
exhibits, mostly incorporated by reference. Given that the ASCII format does not support
hyperlinks, no exhibit index included hyperlinks.
B.

Potential Economic Effects

Relative to conventional, unlinked cross-references, hyperlinks would not only supply
users with the location of a specific exhibit, but also allow users to reach that location more
easily and quickly. Requiring exhibit hyperlinks would help investors and other users to access a
particular exhibit more efficiently as they would not need to search within the filing or through
different filings made over time to locate the exhibit. We expect that hyperlinks would be more
beneficial in reducing search costs in the case of exhibits incorporated by reference than in the
case of exhibits filed with the filing, and in particular, we expect these benefits to be most
pronounced in the case of incorporation by reference from a filing that was not recently filed
because more recent filings are displayed first. Further, we expect hyperlinks would have greater
benefits in the case of registrants that submit more filings. Overall, we believe the proposed
amendments would reduce search costs for investors. For example, depending on the nature of
the business or size of the registrant, a registrant may file multiple registration statements or
reports in a given quarter or fiscal year. Requiring exhibit hyperlinks would make it easier for
investors and other users to find and access a particular exhibit that was originally filed with a

18

previous filing.
To the extent that hyperlinks ease the navigation process for investors and other users,
hyperlinks may also facilitate a more thorough review of a registrant’s registration statements
and reports and encourage more effective monitoring over time. The potential reduction of
search costs and the enhanced ability of investors to review a registrant’s disclosure may result in
more informed investment and voting decisions, potentially enhancing allocative efficiency and
capital formation by registrants.
As a result of the proposed amendments, we expect that both HTML and ASCII
registrants would incur compliance costs to include hyperlinks in their exhibit indexes. The cost
of inserting a hyperlink to an exhibit incorporated by reference would likely be greater than the
cost of inserting a hyperlink to an exhibit filed with the document. While the average cost itself
of inserting an hyperlink is minimal,52 the total hyperlinking costs for registrants would be a
function of two main factors: (1) how many registration statements and reports a registrant files
that require an exhibit index; and (2) how many exhibits in the exhibit index of these registration
statements and reports are either filed with the filing or incorporated by reference. Overall, we
expect that these costs would increase with the size of the registrant as larger filers tend to file
more registration statements and reports and have more exhibits.
In particular, for filers reporting in HTML, our baseline analysis indicates that few filers
currently include fully hyperlinked exhibit indexes in registration statements and reports. Our
analysis of a random sample of registration statements and reports filed in 2015 indicates that
approximately 6% of HTML filers included at least a partially hyperlinked exhibit index in their

52

See Section IV. Paperwork Reduction Act, C. Burden and Cost Estimates Related to the Proposed Amendments,
for costs estimates related to the proposed rule.

19

filings. For these HTML filers, the cost of fully hyperlinking their exhibit indexes could be less
than for those HTML filers that did not hyperlink their exhibit indexes.
Filers reporting in ASCII would incur costs to switch to HTML, in addition to the costs
of including hyperlinks in their exhibit indexes. While the registrants that filed in ASCII that
would be affected by the proposal to require HTML are primarily small entities, we expect that
the costs of switching to HTML would not be significant because the cost of software with builtin HTML and hyperlink features is minimal. Overall, given the modest costs involved, we do
not expect that the proposed amendments would have significant competitive effects for
registrants.
C.

Alternatives

We considered four alternatives to the proposed amendments. First, instead of requiring
hyperlinks in the exhibit index within registration statements and reports requiring an exhibit
index under Item 601 of Regulation S-K and Forms F-10 and 20-F, we considered requiring
registrants to include hyperlinks in a subset of these registration statements and reports. For
example, we could have limited the hyperlinks requirement to exhibit indexes in those
registration statements and reports that typically include lengthy exhibit indexes. Our analysis of
a random sample of registration statements and reports filed in calendar year 2015 indicates that
exhibit indexes are more frequently filed in Forms S-1, S-8, 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, and 10-D, but are
lengthier in Forms S-1, S-4, S-11, F-1, F-4, F-10, 20-F, and 10-K based on the average and
median number of exhibits included in the exhibit index. For example, Forms 8-K and 10-Q are
frequently filed but typically list a limited number of exhibits, most of which are included in the
filing itself. Relative to the proposed amendments, the alternative of limiting the scope of the
exhibit hyperlink requirement to fewer form types would lead to cost savings for registrants but

20

also a smaller reduction in search costs for investors and other users.
Second, instead of requiring registrants to hyperlink each exhibit included in the exhibit
index, we considered requiring registrants to hyperlink only exhibits incorporated by reference.
Our analysis of the random sample of 2015 filings indicates that, among the registration
statements and reports, Forms 20-F and 10-K typically include a higher number of exhibits
incorporated by reference. This alternative would lead to nominal cost savings for registrants but
also a smaller reduction in search costs for investors, although search costs related to exhibits
filed with the document may be relatively limited.
Third, we considered requiring registrants to file and update a compilation of exhibits
separately from the Form 10-K and other forms. A separate compilation of exhibits could have
more prominence and make it easier for investors and other users to access relevant information
on EDGAR, as there would be only one compilation for all exhibits regardless of what forms a
registrant may file. Requiring a separate compilation, however, would impose an additional
burden on registrants to prepare, file and update this disclosure and could make our disclosure
regime more complex to the extent that relevant information is spread over multiple filings.
Fourth, we considered excluding ASCII filers from the proposed requirement to
hyperlink to each exhibit identified in the exhibit index and permitting them to continuing filing
in ASCII. Relative to the proposed amendments, this alternative could be beneficial to ASCII
filers as they would not incur the additional, although minimal, compliance costs of switching to
HTML and hyperlinking their exhibit indexes. However, under this alternative, investors and
other users of the information disclosed in ASCII filings would not benefit from reduced search
costs.
Request for Comment

21

We request comment on the potential costs and benefits of the proposed rules and
whether the rules, if adopted, would promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation or
have an impact or burden on competition. Commenters are requested to provide empirical data,
estimation methodologies, and other factual support for their views, in particular, on costs and
benefits estimates.

A.

Paperwork Reduction Act
Background

Certain provisions of our rules and forms that would be affected by the proposed
amendments contain “collection of information” requirements within the meaning of the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”). 53 The Commission is submitting the proposal to the
Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) for review in accordance with the PRA. 54 The titles
for the collections of information are:
“Form S-1” (OMB Control No. 3235-0065);
“Form S-3” (OMB Control No. 3235-0073);
“Form S-4” (OMB Control No. 3235-0324);
“Form S-8” (OMB Control No. 3235-0066);
“Form S-11” (OMB Control No. 3235-0067);
“Form F-1” (OMB Control No. 3235-0258);
“Form F-3” (OMB Control No. 3235-0256);
“Form F-4” (OMB Control No. 3235-0325);

“Form SF-1” (OMB Control No. 3235-0707);
“Form SF-3” (OMB Control No. 3235-0690);
“Form 10” (OMB Control No. 3235-0064);
“Form 20-F” (OMB Control No. 3235-0288);
“Form 10-K” (OMB Control No. 3235-0063);
“Form 10-Q” (OMB Control No. 3235-0070);
“Form 8-K” (OMB Control No. 3235-0060);
“Form 10-D” (OMB Control No. 3235-0604);
“Regulation S-K” (OMB Control No. 3235-0071); and
“Regulation S-T” (OMB Control No. 3235-0424). 55
The forms, reports and Regulation S-K, were adopted under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and set forth the disclosure requirements for registration statements and reports
filed by registrants to help investors make informed investment and voting decisions. Regulation
S-T was adopted under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and sets forth the requirements
for the electronic submission of documents filed or otherwise submitted to the Commission. The
hours and costs associated with preparing and filing the forms and reports constitute reporting
and cost burdens imposed by each collection of information.

55

The paperwork burdens from Regulations S-K and S-T are imposed through the forms that are subject to the
requirements in these regulations and are reflected in the analysis of those forms. To avoid a PRA inventory
reflecting duplicative burdens and for administrative convenience, we assign a one-hour burden to each of
Regulation S-K and Regulation S-T.

23

An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a
collection of information requirement unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
Compliance with the information collections is mandatory. Responses to the information
collections are not kept confidential and there is no mandatory retention period for the
information disclosed.
B.

Summary of the Proposed Amendments

As described in more detail above, we are proposing amendments to Regulations S-K and
S-T and Forms F-10 and 20-F to require registrants that file registration statements and reports
subject to the exhibit requirements of Item 601 of Regulation S-K, or that file on Forms F-10 and
20-F, to submit these registration statements and reports in HTML format and to include a
hyperlink from each exhibit identified in the exhibit index of such forms to the exhibit as filed on
EDGAR. Because the software tools to prepare and file documents in HTML are widely used
and available at minimal cost, we do not believe this requirement would appreciably change the
existing burden estimates for the affected registration statements or reports, which already
include the time and expense to prepare and file in electronic format on EDGAR.
C.

Burden and Cost Estimates Related to the Proposed Amendments

We anticipate that the proposed amendments requiring registrants to hyperlink to exhibits
would increase the burdens and costs for registrants to prepare and file the affected forms. We
believe the burdens associated with hyperlinking exhibits would be small as the registrant would
already be preparing the exhibits and exhibit index for the related filing and would have readily
available all the information necessary to create the hyperlinks. In addition, we assume that the
average burden hours of requiring exhibit hyperlinks would vary based on the number of exhibits
that are included with a filing. For purposes of the PRA, based on the average and median

24

number of exhibits shown in Table 2 above, we estimate the average burden for a registrant to
hyperlink to exhibits would be three hours for Forms S-1, S-4, S-11, SF-1, F-1, F-4, F-10, 20-F
and 10-K; two hours for Forms S-3, S-8, SF-3, F-3, 10 and 10-Q; and one hour for Forms 10-D
and 8-K.
These estimates represent the average burden for all registrants, both large and small. In
deriving our estimates, we recognize that the burdens will likely vary among individual
registrants based on a number of factors, including the size and complexity of their operations.
The tables below show the total annual compliance burden, in hours and in costs, of the
collection of information resulting from the proposed amendments. 56 The burden estimates were
calculated by multiplying the estimated number of responses by the estimated average amount of
time it would take an issuer to prepare and review the exhibit hyperlinks. The portion of the
burden carried by outside professionals is reflected as a cost, while the portion of the burden
carried by the issuer internally is reflected in hours. For purposes of the PRA, we estimate that
75% of the burden of preparation for Exchange Act reports is carried by the registrant internally
and that 25% of the burden of preparation is carried by outside professionals retained by the
registrant at an average cost of $400 per hour. 57 For the registration statements on Forms 10, S1, S-3, S-4, S-11, F-1, F-3, F-4, SF-1 and SF-3, and the Exchange Act report on Form 20-F, we
estimate that 25% of the burden of preparation is carried by the company internally and that 75%
of the burden of preparation is carried by outside professionals retained by the company at an
average cost of $400 per hour. For the registration statement on Form S-8, we estimate that 50%
56

For convenience, the estimated hour and cost burdens in the table have been rounded to the nearest whole number.

57

We recognize that the costs of retaining outside professionals may vary depending on the nature of the
professional services, but for purposes of this PRA analysis we estimate that such costs would be an average of $400
per hour. This estimate is based on consultations with several registrants, law firms and other persons who regularly
assist registrants in preparing and filing reports with the Commission.

preparation is carried by outside professionals.

Initial Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis

This Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) has been prepared in accordance with
the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 59 It relates to proposed amendments that would require
registrants to submit registration statements and reports in HTML format and to include a
hyperlink to each exhibit that is filed with such registration statement or report.
A.

Reasons for, and Objectives of, the Proposed Action

The main purpose of the proposed amendments is to improve investors’ access to
information—in particular, the ability of EDGAR users to retrieve and access exhibits that are
filed with certain registration statements and reports.
B.

Legal Basis

We are proposing the amendments under Sections 6, 7, 8, 10 and 19(a) of the Securities
Act, and Sections 3, 12, 13, 15(d), 23(a), and 35A of the Exchange Act.
C.

Small Entities Subject to the Proposed Rules

The proposed amendments would affect some companies that are small entities. The
Regulatory Flexibility Act defines “small entity” to mean “small business,” “small organization,”
or “small governmental jurisdiction.” 60 For purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, under our
rules, an issuer, other than an investment company, is a “small business” or “small organization”
if it had total assets of $5 million or less on the last day of its most recent fiscal year and is

59

60

5 U.S.C. 601(6).

28

engaged or proposing to engage in an offering of securities that does not exceed $5 million. 61 An
investment company, including a business development company, 62 is considered to be a “small
business” if it, together with other investment companies in the same group of related investment
companies, has net assets of $50 million or less as of the end of its most recent fiscal year. 63 We
believe that the proposal would affect some small entities that are investment companies. We
estimate that there are 837 issuers that file with the Commission, other than investment
companies, that may be considered small entities. 64 In addition, we estimate that there are 34
investment companies that would be subject to the proposed amendments that may be considered
small entities.
D.

Reporting, Recordkeeping, and other Compliance Requirements

The proposed amendments would impose new compliance requirements for small
entities. Under the proposals, a registrant (including a small entity) would be required to submit
registration statements and reports in HTML format and to include a hyperlink to each exhibit
identified in the exhibit index to such registration statement or report.
E.

Duplicative, Overlapping, or Conflicting Federal Rules

The proposed amendments would not duplicate, overlap, or conflict with other federal
rules.
F.

61

Significant Alternatives

See Securities Act Rule 157 [17 CFR 230.157] and Exchange Act Rule 0-10(a) [17 CFR 240.0-10(a)].

62

Business development companies are a category of closed-end investment company that are not registered under
the Investment Company Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(48) and 80a-53-64].
63

17 CFR 270.0-10(a).

64

This estimate is based on a review of Form 10-K and 20-F filings (from EDGAR XBRL) with fiscal periods
ending between January 31, 2015 and January 31, 2016.

29

The Regulatory Flexibility Act directs us to consider alternatives that would accomplish
our stated objectives, while minimizing any significant adverse impact on small entities. In
connection with the proposed amendments, we considered the following alternatives:
•

Establishing different compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take
into account the resources available to small entities;

•

Clarifying, consolidating or simplifying compliance and reporting requirements under
the rules for small entities;

•

Using performance rather than design standards; and

•

Exempting small entities from all or part of the requirements.

The proposed amendments would require all registrants that file registration statements
and reports that are subject to the exhibit requirements of under Item 601 of Regulation S-K
(other than Form ABS-EE), or that file on Forms F-10 or 20-F, to file these forms in HTML
format and to hyperlink to each exhibit (other than an exhibit filed in XBRL) identified in the
exhibit index contained in the form.
The proposed amendments to require the inclusion of hyperlinks in the exhibit index
would impose only minimal burdens on registrants. Similarly, the requirement to submit
registration statements and reports in HTML format would not impose significant costs. During
calendar year 2015, approximately 0.74% of the forms that would be affected by the proposed
amendments were filed in ASCII, and we believe that the HTML format has largely replaced the
ASCII format for these form types. The limited use of ASCII indicates that the proposed
amendments would affect only a limited number of registrants on a one-time basis. While the
registrants that filed forms in ASCII that would be affected by the proposal to require HTML are
primarily small entities, we expect that the burden to switch from ASCII to HTML would be not

30

be significant because the software tools to file in HTML format are now widely used and
available at a minimal cost. Accordingly, we do not believe that it is necessary to establish
different compliance timetables or reporting requirements or exempt small entities from the
proposed amendments. For similar reasons, we have not sought to clarify, consolidate or
simplify the proposed amendments’ requirements for small entities.
The proposed amendments use design rather than performance standards in order to
promote uniform filing requirements for all registrants.
G.

Request for Comments
We encourage the submission of comments with respect to any aspect of this Initial

Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. In particular, we request comments regarding:
•

the number of small entity issuers that may be affected by the proposed revisions;

•

the existence or nature of the potential impact of the proposed revisions on small
entity issuers discussed in the analysis; and

•

how to quantify the impact of the proposed amendments.
Commenters are asked to describe the nature of any impact and provide empirical data

supporting the extent of the impact. Such comments will be considered in the preparation of the
Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, if the proposed amendments are adopted, and will be
placed in the same public file as comments on the proposed amendments themselves.
VI.

Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act

31

For purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996
(“SBREFA”), 65 a rule is “major” if it has resulted, or is likely to result, in:
•

an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;

•

a major increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries; or

•

significant adverse effects on competition, investment or innovation.

We request comment on whether the proposed amendments would be a “major rule” for
purposes of SBREFA. We solicit comment and empirical data on: (a) the potential annual effect
on the economy; (b) any potential increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual
industries; and (c) any potential effect on competition, investment or innovation.

Exhibits.
*

*
Each electronic filing requiring exhibits must include an exhibit index which must

appear before the required signatures in the document. The index must list each exhibit filed,
whether filed electronically or in paper. For electronic filings on Form F-10 (§239.40 of this
chapter), Form 20-F (§249.220f of this chapter), or filings subject to Item 601 of Regulation S-K
(§229.601 of this chapter) other than Form ABS-EE (§249.1401 of this chapter), each exhibit
identified in the exhibit index (other than an exhibit filed in eXtensible Business Reporting

34

Language) shall include an active hyperlink to the exhibit as filed on EDGAR, whether or not the
exhibit is incorporated by reference, pursuant to §232.105. Whenever a filer files an exhibit in
paper pursuant to a temporary or continuing hardship exemption (§232.201 or §232.202) or
pursuant to §232.311, the filer must place the letter “P” next to the listed exhibit in the exhibit
index of the electronic filing to reflect the fact that the filer filed the exhibit in paper. In addition,
if the exhibit is filed in paper pursuant to §232.311, the filer must place the designation “Rule
311” next to the letter “P” in the exhibit index. If the exhibit is filed in paper pursuant to a
temporary or continuing hardship exemption, the filer must place the letters “TH” or “CH,”
respectively, next to the letter “P” in the exhibit index. Whenever an electronic confirming copy
of an exhibit is filed pursuant to a hardship exemption (§232.201 or §232.202(d)), the exhibit
index should specify where the confirming electronic copy can be located; in addition, the
designation “CE” (confirming electronic) should be placed next to the listed exhibit in the exhibit
index.

(b)

Use of HTML and hyperlinks.
*

*
Electronic filers may not include in any HTML document hyperlinks to sites,

locations, or documents outside the HTML document, except to links to officially filed
documents within the current submission and to documents previously filed electronically and
located in the EDGAR database on the Commission's public web site (www.sec.gov). Electronic

35

filers also may include within an HTML document hyperlinks to different sections within that
single HTML document.
(c)

If a filer includes an external hyperlink within a filed document, the information

contained in the linked material will not be considered part of the document for determining
compliance with reporting obligations, but the inclusion of the link will cause the filer to be
subject to the civil liability and antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws with reference
to the information contained in the linked material.
(d)

Electronic filers submitting Form F-10 (§239.40 of this chapter), Form 20-F

(§249.220f of this chapter), or a registration statement or report (other than Form ABS-EE
(§249.1401 of this chapter)), subject to Item 601 of Regulation S-K (§229.601 of this chapter),
must submit such registration statement or report in HTML and each exhibit identified in the
exhibit index (other than an exhibit filed in eXtensible Business Reporting Language) shall
include an active hyperlink to the exhibit as filed on EDGAR at the time the registration
statement becomes effective or report is filed, whether or not the exhibit is incorporated by
reference, unless such exhibit is filed in paper pursuant to a temporary or continuing hardship
exemption under Rules 201 or 202 of Regulation S-T (§232.201 or §232.202) or pursuant to
Rule 311 of Regulation S-T (§232.311).

A registrant must file the registration statement in electronic format via the

Commission’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system in
accordance with the EDGAR rules set forth in Regulation S-T (17 CFR Part 232). For assistance
37

with technical questions about EDGAR or to request an access code, call the EDGAR Filer
Support Office at (202) 551-8900. For assistance with the EDGAR rules, call the Office of
Information Technology in the Division of Corporation Finance at (202) 551-3600.
Include an exhibit index in the registration statement, which must appear before the
required signatures in the document. The exhibit index must list each exhibit according to the
letter or number assigned to it. If an exhibit is incorporated by reference, note that fact in the
exhibit index. Each exhibit identified in the exhibit index (other than an exhibit filed in
eXtensible Business Reporting Language) must include an active hyperlink to the exhibit as filed
on EDGAR at the time the registration statement becomes effective, whether or not the exhibit is
incorporated by reference, pursuant to Rule 105 of Regulation S-T (17 CFR 232.105). For paper
filings, the pages of the manually signed original registration statement should be numbered in
sequence, and the exhibit index should give the page number in the sequential numbering system
where each exhibit can be found.
If filing the registration statement in paper under a hardship exemption in Rule 201 or
202 of Regulation S-T (17 CFR 232.201 or 232.202), or as otherwise permitted, a registrant must
file with the Commission at its principal office five copies of the complete registration statement
and any amendments, including exhibits and all other documents filed as a part of the registration
statement or amendment. The registrant must bind, staple or otherwise compile each copy in one
or more parts without stiff covers. The registrant must further bind the registration statement or
amendment on the side or stitching margin in a manner that leaves the reading matter legible.
The registrant must provide three additional copies of the registration statement or amendment
without exhibits to the Commission.
