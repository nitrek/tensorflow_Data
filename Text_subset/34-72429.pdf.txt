COMMENT

Notice is hereby given, pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s (“Commission”) Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.1103, that the Division of Enforcement has submitted to the Commission an
amended proposed plan for the distribution of monies placed into a Fair Fund established
in the above-captioned matter. On September 30, 2013, the Commission issued a Notice
of Proposed Plan of Distribution and Opportunity for Comment (Exchange Act Rel. No.
70573 (Sept. 30, 2013)). The Plan has been amended from the Proposed Distribution
Plan previously noticed on September 30, 2013 in order to respond to the comments
received and include two additional Eligible Fair Fund recipients
On July 20, 2012, the Commission issued an Order Making Findings and
Imposing Remedial Sanctions Pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940 and Section 15(b)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 against
Charles L. Rizzo (“Rizzo”) and Gina M. Hornbogen (“Hornbogen”) (collectively,
“Respondents”) (the “Order”) (Exchange Act Rel. No. 67479 (July 20, 2012)). The
Order found that Respondents failed reasonably to supervise Steven Salutric
(“Salutric”), who, while acting as an investment adviser for Results One Financial,
LLC, misappropriated millions of dollars from his advisory clients at Results One.
In the Order, Rizzo was ordered to pay disgorgement of $35,079, prejudgment
interest of $7,731, and civil penalties of $130,000, and Hornbogen was ordered to pay
disgorgement of $15,592, prejudgment interest of $3,467, and civil penalties of $25,000.
The Order created a Fair Fund pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, as amended. The Fair Fund is comprised of the disgorgement, prejudgment
interest and penalties ordered to be paid by Respondents, for distribution to clients of
Results One who suffered a net loss of funds as a result of Salutric’s misappropriation of
funds during the period of time, June 1, 2003 through December 31, 2009, when the
Respondents failed to reasonably supervise Salutric (collectively, “Eligible Clients”).

THE DISTRIBUTION PLAN
The Fair Fund is comprised of the amounts of disgorgement, prejudgment
interest and civil monetary penalties paid by Respondents, less any federal, state, or
local taxes and fees and expenses. Rizzo has paid $172,810 in disgorgement,
prejudgment interest and civil monetary penalties, and Hornbogen has paid
$29,202.05 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties. The
remainder of Hornbogen’s payments in the amount of $14,856.95, plus post-order
interest, is to be paid in installments through July 2015. It is anticipated that there
will be two disbursements to the Eligible Clients, the latter of which is anticipated to
occur after all scheduled payments have been received.
The Amended Plan adds two Eligible Clients and provides for all Eligible
Clients to receive monies from the Fair Fund that represents their proportionate share
of the distributable amount of the Fair Fund. Eligible Clients will not need to go
through a claims process; rather, they will be determined from available records. The
Eligible Clients will not be required to make claims or submit documentation to
establish their eligibility. The Amended Plan provides that on the basis of
information obtained by the Commission staff through review and analysis of
applicable records, the Fund Administrator will identify the Eligible Clients. Within
thirty (30) days of the Commission’s approval of the Amended Plan, the Fund
Administrator will send each Eligible Client a notice by United States Postal Service
regarding the Commission’s approval of the Amended Plan, including as appropriate,
a statement characterizing the distribution, a link to the Amended Plan posted on the
Commission’s website and instructions for requesting a copy of the Amended Plan, a
Net Loss Amount calculation and a preliminary Gross Distribution Amount, a
2

description of the tax information reporting and other related tax matters, the
procedure for the distribution as set forth in the Amended Plan, and the name of the
Fund Administrator to contact with questions regarding the distribution. The Fund
Administrator will coordinate with the appointed Tax Administrator to request
information from each Eligible Client that is needed to accomplish the distribution in
accordance with applicable tax requirements relating to the Fair Fund.
The Amended Plan provides procedures for Eligible Clients to dispute the
amounts received. Disputes will be limited to calculations of disbursement amounts
to Eligible Clients. Should an Eligible Client wish to dispute the amount received, an
Eligible Client must submit a written communication to the Fund Administrator,
Nancy Chase Burton, Esq., United States Securities and Exchange Commission, 100
F Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20549-5631. The Fund Administrator must receive
the written communication detailing the dispute along with any supporting
documentation within thirty days of the date that an Eligible Client’s disbursement is
made. The Fund Administrator will investigate the dispute, and such investigation
will include a review of the written dispute as well as any supporting documentation.
Within thirty days of receipt of the written dispute, the Fund Administrator will notify
the Eligible Client of the resolution of the dispute, which shall be final.
By the Commission.
