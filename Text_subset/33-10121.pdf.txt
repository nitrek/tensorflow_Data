In the Matter of
J.S. OLIVER CAPITAL
MANAGEMENT, L.P. and
IAN O. MAUSNER

PARTIAL STAY ORDER
J.S. Oliver Capital Management, L.P. and Ian O. Mausner seek a stay of a Commission
order (the “Order”) to the extent that it requires them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest,
and civil money penalties.1 The Order also imposed an industry bar on Mausner, revoked the
investment adviser registration of J.S. Oliver, and ordered Respondents to cease and desist from
committing or causing any violations or future violations of the provisions of the securities laws
they were found to have violated. The Commission issued the Order based on findings that
Respondents violated, among other things, antifraud provisions of the securities laws by cherry
picking profitable securities transactions for favored accounts and failing to disclose uses of soft
dollars to their clients. Respondents state that they will file a petition for review of the Order and
request a stay of the monetary sanctions imposed on them until such time as their appeal is
resolved. The Division of Enforcement does not oppose Respondents’ request.

J.S. Oliver Capital Management, L.P., Exchange Act Release No. 78098, 2016 WL
3361166 (June 17, 2016).

2
Although Respondents do not assert that a stay is appropriate under the traditional fourfactor standard,2 the Commission “has at times stayed monetary sanctions pending appeal
without reference to the applicant’s likelihood of success on the merits” or the other components
of the four-factor test.3 Under the circumstances, including that the Division does not oppose the
relief, and in our discretion, we elect to stay the monetary components of the Order.
Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the requirements in the Order that Respondents pay
disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and civil money penalties are STAYED for sixty days
from June 17, 2016 pending the filing of a petition for review with a United States Court of
Appeals and, upon the timely filing of such a petition, pending the determination of that appeal
and the issuance of the court’s mandate. The Order remains effective in all other respects.
For the Commission, by the Office of the General Counsel, pursuant to delegated
authority.

Secretary

See Bernerd E. Young, Exchange Act Release No. 78440, 2016 WL 4060106, at *1 (July
29, 2016) (stating that the “Commission’s consideration of such requests is governed by the
traditional, four-factor standard—namely, (1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong
showing that he or she is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be
irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the
other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies” and that the
“party requesting a stay pending appeal has the burden of establishing that a stay is justified”).
