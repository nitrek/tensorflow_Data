Release Nos. 33-9638; 34-72982; File No. S7-08-10
RIN 3235-AK37
Asset-Backed Securities Disclosure and Registration
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Final rule.
SUMMARY: We are adopting significant revisions to Regulation AB and other rules governing
the offering process, disclosure, and reporting for asset-backed securities (“ABS”). The final
rules require that, with some exceptions, prospectuses for public offerings under the Securities
Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and ongoing reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(“Exchange Act”) of asset-backed securities backed by real estate related assets, auto related
assets, or backed by debt securities, including resecuritizations, contain specified asset-level
information about each of the assets in the pool. The asset-level information is required to be
provided according to specified standards and in a tagged data format using eXtensible Markup
Language (“XML”). We also are adopting rules to revise filing deadlines for ABS offerings to
provide investors with more time to consider transaction-specific information, including
information about the pool assets. We are also adopting new registration forms tailored to ABS
offerings. The final rules also repeal the credit ratings references in shelf eligibility criteria for
ABS issuers and establish new shelf eligibility criteria.
DATES:
Effective Date: [insert date 60 days after publication in the Federal Register].

Compliance Dates:
Offerings on Forms SF-1 and SF-3: Registrants must comply with new rules, forms, and
disclosures no later than [insert date 60 days plus one year after publication in the Federal
Register].
Asset level Disclosures: Offerings of asset-backed securities backed by residential mortgages,
commercial mortgages, auto loans, auto leases, and debt securities (including resecuritizations)
must comply with asset-level disclosure requirements no later than [insert date 60 days plus two
years after publication in the Federal Register].
Forms 10-D and 10-K: Any Form 10-D or Form 10-K that is filed after [insert date 60 days plus
one year after publication in the Federal Register] must comply with new rules and disclosures,
except asset-level disclosures.

Executive Summary
A.

Background

The Commission addressed the registration, disclosure, and reporting requirements for
asset-backed securities in 2004 when it adopted new rules and amendments under the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act. 21 Among other changes, the 2004 rules updated and clarified the
Securities Act registration requirements for asset-backed securities offerings and allowed

Release”).

modified Exchange Act reporting tailored to asset-backed securities offerings. In April 2010, we
proposed revisions to the registration, disclosure, and reporting requirements for ABS offerings
in an effort to improve investor protection and promote more efficient asset-backed markets. 22
In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release we noted that the financial crisis highlighted that
investors and other participants in the securitization market did not have the necessary
information and time to be able to fully assess the risks underlying asset-backed securities and
did not value asset-backed securities properly or accurately. This lack of understanding and the
extent to which it impacted the U.S. and global economy prompted us to revisit several aspects
of our regulation of asset-backed securities. 23 To address these issues, we proposed to require
that, with some exceptions, prospectuses for public offerings of asset-backed securities and
ongoing Exchange Act reports contain specified asset-level information about each of the assets
in the pool in a standardized tagged data format. Further, we proposed a rule that asset-backed
issuers provide investors with more time to consider transaction-specific information about the
pool assets. We also proposed to require asset-backed issuers to file a computer program
modeling the flow of funds, or waterfall, provisions of the transaction to help investors analyze
the offering and monitor ongoing performance. For offerings of asset-backed securities that
qualify for shelf registration, we proposed investor protection-focused shelf eligibility and
offering requirements that would indicate which types of offerings qualify for delayed shelf

22

See Asset-Backed Securities, Release No. 33-9117 (Apr. 7, 2010) [75 FR 23328] (the “2010 ABS
Proposing Release” or the “2010 ABS Proposal”).

eligibility and also proposed to remove the investment-grade ratings requirement. 24 Finally, we
proposed to require disclosure provisions in unregistered ABS transaction agreements as a
condition to certain safe harbors for exempt offerings and resales of ABS.
In July 2010, subsequent to the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, Congress passed the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), 25 which
directed the Commission to prescribe several ABS related rules, some of which were included in
the 2010 ABS Proposals and others of which were not. Two of the proposed shelf eligibility
requirements – risk retention and continued Exchange Act reporting – were addressed by
provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. After taking the Dodd-Frank requirements into account, and
considering comments received in connection with the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, in 2011 we
re-proposed some of the 2010 ABS Proposals, including the shelf eligibility requirements. In

Problems in the ABS Markets

The financial crisis highlighted a number of concerns about the operation of our rules in
the securitization market. 29 The failures of credit ratings to accurately measure and account for
the risks associated with certain asset-backed securities have been well documented by
lawmakers, market observers, and academics. 30 The collapse of these “investment-grade” rated
securities was a major contributor to the financial crisis, and demonstrated the risks to investors
of unduly relying on these securities’ credit ratings without engaging in independent due
diligence. 31 Although academic research suggests that some investors might have been able to

triple-A rated tranches were less informed than investors in lower tranches. 32
In addition, investors have expressed concern about a lack of time to analyze
securitization transactions and make informed investment decisions. 33 Time to analyze an
offering is necessary if investors are being encouraged to perform their own diligence and to not
over rely on credit ratings. While the Commission has not generally built waiting periods into its
shelf offering registration process, 34 and instead has believed investors can take the time they
believe is adequate to analyze securities (and refuse to invest if not provided sufficient time),

investors have indicated that this is not generally possible in the ABS market, particularly in a
heated market. 35
Investors and others have also expressed concerns about other aspects of the
securitization market, including concern about a lack of effective oversight by the principal
officers of the ABS issuer. 36 In particular, investors have been concerned that these officers
have not conducted sufficient due diligence when reviewing the pool assets and designing the
securitization structure. Additionally, investors have noted that the mechanisms for enforcing
the representations and warranties contained in the securitization transaction documents are
weak, and thus they are not confident that even strong representations and warranties provide
them with adequate protection. 37 They have also noted that difficulties in locating fellow ABS
investors have prevented them from exercising rights under the transaction agreement, including

Market participants have also expressed a desire for expanded disclosure about the assets
underlying securitizations in order to conduct an analysis of the offering. 39 The financial crisis
underscored that the information available to investors about ABS may not have provided them
with all the information necessary to fully understand and correctly gauge the risks underlying
the securities. As a result, investors may not have been able to accurately value those
securities. 40
C.

Summary of Final Rules

We are adopting significant revisions to the rules governing disclosure, reporting,
registration, and the offering process for asset-backed securities. The revised rules are designed
to address the problems discussed above and to enhance investor protection in the ABS market. 41
In adopting these changes, we have taken into consideration the comments and recommendations

2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release (“ICI II”).

Requirement below.

See SHEILA BAIR, BULL BY THE HORNS: FIGHTING TO SAVE MAIN STREET FROM WALL STREET AND WALL
STREET FROM ITSELF 52 (2012) (noting that, based on data analysis conducted by the FDIC, ABS investors
did not look at the quality of the individual loans in the asset pools and lacked detailed loan-level
information and adequate time to analyze the information before making an investment decision). See also
footnote 882 and discussions in Section III.A.1 Background and Economic Baseline for the Asset-Level
Disclosure Requirement and Section V.B.1.a) Rule 424(h) and Rule 430D below.

41

The rules do not affect the applicability of the Investment Company Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.) to ABS
issuers, including the availability of exclusions from such Act. See, e.g., Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7)
(15 U.S.C. 80a-3(c)(1) and 80a-3(c)(7)) (for unregistered transactions); Rule 3a-7 [17 CFR 270.3a-7] (for
registered and unregistered transactions).

made by commenters in connection with the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, the 2011 ABS ReProposing Release and the 2014 Re-Opening Release, which are reflected in the changes made in
the final rules. 42 We received a total of 240 comment letters in connection with the 2010 ABS
Proposals, 2011 ABS Re-Proposal and the 2014 Re-Opening Release.
The final rules are intended to provide investors with timely and sufficient information,
reduce the likelihood of undue reliance on credit ratings, and provide mechanisms to help to
enforce the representations and warranties made about the underlying assets. These revisions are
comprehensive and although they will impose new burdens on issuers, we believe they will
protect investors and promote efficient capital formation. The rules cover the following areas:
•

Securities Act and Exchange Act disclosures, including new requirements for certain
asset classes to disclose standardized asset-level information;

•

Revisions to the shelf offering process, eligibility criteria, and prospectus delivery
requirements; and

•

Several changes to the Asset-Backed Issuer Distribution Report on Form 10-D, the
Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the Current Report on Form 8-K. 43

In addition, we are adopting clarifying, technical, and other changes to the current rules.
Some of the rules we are adopting are designed to address and improve areas that we believe

have the potential to raise issues similar to those highlighted in the financial crisis. Furthermore,
some of the rules we are adopting respond to Sections 939A and 942(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act.
1.

Asset-Level Disclosure

Investors, other market participants, academics, and policy makers have increasingly
noted that asset-level information is essential to evaluating an asset-backed security. 44 We
believe that all investors and market participants should have access to the information they need
to assess the credit quality of the assets underlying a securitization at inception and over the life
of a security. In 2010, we proposed to require standardized asset-level information in
prospectuses and on an ongoing basis in periodic reports. The 2010 ABS Proposals called for
ABS issuers to disclose standardized asset-level information for most asset classes.

44

See, e.g., The Private Mortgage Market Investment Act, Part I, Hearing on H.R. 3644 Before the
Subcomm. on Capital Mkts. & Gov’t Sponsored Enters. of the H. Comm. on Fin. Servs., 112th Cong. 3
(2011) (statement of Rep. Scott Garrett, Chairman, Subcomm. on Capital Mkts. & Gov’t Sponsored
Enters.) (stating “in regards to transparency and disclosure, investors should be empowered, if you will, and
enabled to do their own analysis of the assets underlying the securities that they are investing in. So by
disclosing more detailed loan level data, while at the same time protecting the privacy of the borrowers, and
by allowing more time for the investors to study that additional information, investors will be able to
conduct more due diligence and lessen their reliance on rating agencies”); Securitization of Assets:
Problems & Solutions Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Secs., Ins., & Inv. of S. Comm. on Banking,
Housing & Urban Affairs, 111th Cong. 39 (2009) (statement of Patricia McCoy, law professor at the
University of Connecticut School of Law) (recommending that “[t]he SEC should require securitizers to
provide investors with all of the loan-level data they need to assess the risks involved” and “should require
securitizers and servicers to provide loan-level information on a monthly basis on the performance of each
loan and the incidence of loan modifications and recourse”). See also letters from Moody’s Investors
Service dated Aug. 31, 2010 submitted in response to the 2010 ABS Proposing Release (“Moody’s I”)
(suggesting increased ABS data information will restore confidence in the structured finance market),
Prudential Investment Management, Inc. dated Aug. 2, 2010 submitted in response to the 2010 ABS
Proposing Release (“Prudential I”) (supporting the SEC’s proposal for investors to have access to assetlevel data in order to provide investors with a better understanding of risk), and SIFMA I (suggesting that
asset-level data is important to an investor’s investment decision and is needed to restore investor
confidence).

17

We are adopting standardized asset-level disclosure requirements because we believe this
information will allow an investor to better conduct his or her own evaluation of the ongoing
credit quality of a particular asset, risk layering of assets, and overall risks in the pool underlying
the ABS. In our discussion below, we refer to each individual asset-level disclosure requirement
as an asset-level data point. The asset-level data will be provided at the time of the offering and
on an ongoing basis. The disclosures are required to be provided in a standardized XML format,
so that they are more useful to investors and markets. We have revised the required data points
to address commenters’ concerns about a variety of topics that we discuss further below, such as
the availability of data, market practice, need for increased transparency and privacy concerns.
While we are adopting asset-level disclosure requirements for ABS where the underlying assets
consist of residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, auto loans, auto leases and
resecuritizations of ABS that include these asset types, or of debt securities, 45 we are continuing
to consider the best approach for requiring more information about underlying assets for the
remaining asset classes covered by the 2010 ABS Proposal. 46
We have modified some of the proposed data points in response to comments. The new
disclosure requirements include the following standardized data points:

45

Under the proposal, this asset class was titled “corporate debt.” However, we are using the term “debt
security ABS” to provide clarification because, as we discuss below, the same set of requirements will also
apply to resecuritizations.

46

While the 2010 ABS Proposal applied across asset classes, we had also proposed specific requirements for
equipment loans and leases, student loans, floorplan financings, and credit card receivables. As discussed
below, Section 7(c) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77g(c)] also requires, in relevant part, that the
Commission adopt regulations requiring an issuer of an asset-backed security to disclose, for each tranche
or class of security, information about the assets backing that security, including asset-level or loan-level
data, if such data is necessary for investors to independently perform due diligence.

18

•

Data points about the payment stream related to a particular asset, such as the
contractual terms, scheduled payment amounts, basis for interest rate calculations and
whether and how payment terms change over time;

•

Data points that allow for an analysis of the collateral related to the asset, such as the
geographic location of the property, property valuation data and loan-to-value
(“LTV”) ratio;

•

Data points about the performance of each asset over time, for example, data about
whether an obligor is making payments as scheduled; and

•

Data points about the loss mitigation efforts by the servicer to collect amounts past
due and the losses that may pass on to the investors.

Other key data points we are adopting will provide data about the extent to which income and
employment status have been verified, mortgage insurance coverage, and lien position.
We have also made modifications from the 2010 ABS Proposal in light of privacy
concerns. As we discuss below, many commenters were concerned with the privacy
implications of asset-level disclosure, particularly the risk that the information could be
combined with other publicly available information to discover, or “re-identify,” the identities of
the obligors in ABS pools, thereby revealing potentially sensitive personal and financial
information about an obligor. In light of these concerns, we are omitting or modifying certain
asset-level disclosures for RMBS and securities backed by auto loans and leases (collectively,
“Auto ABS”) to reduce the potential risk that the obligors could be re-identified. We refer to this
risk throughout the release as “re-identification risk”. Additionally, in response to commenters’
suggestions, we have sought and obtained guidance from the Consumer Financial Protection
19

Bureau (“CFPB”) on the application of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) 47 to the required
disclosures. We believe these steps implement the statutory mandate of Section 7(c) and will
provide investors with the asset-level information they need while reducing concerns about the
potential re-identification risk associated with disclosing consumers’ personal and financial
information. 48
2.

Other Disclosure Requirements

We are also adopting other amendments to the prospectus disclosure requirements, which
will require:
•

A summary of statistical information about the pool of underlying assets in the
prospectus summary;

•

A description of the provisions in the transaction agreements about modification of
the terms of the underlying assets;

•

More explanatory language about the static pool disclosures and standardized
delinquency presentation and, for static pool filings on Form 8-K, a new separate
Form 8-K item and exhibit number;

•

Expanded disclosure about transaction parties; and

•

Filing of the transaction documents, by the date of the final prospectus, which is a
clarification of the current rules.

47

15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. FCRA generally regulates the use of “consumer reports” furnished by a “consumer
reporting agency,” as those terms are defined in the statute. The CFPB has authority to interpret FCRA.

3.

Securities Act Registration

ABS issuers have emphasized their desire to access the capital markets quickly through
shelf registration. ABS shelf registration offers significant flexibility and timing benefits to
issuers, but these interests must be balanced against investors’ need for adequate information and
time to make informed investment decisions. Investors have expressed concerns about not
having adequate time to review the prospectus in order to make a well-informed investment
decision, especially in an active market. 49 This lack of time to adequately review the transaction
contributed to investors placing undue reliance on the investment-grade ratings of these
securities. 50 Consequently, we are adopting a requirement that ABS issuers using a shelf
registration statement on new Form SF-3 file a preliminary prospectus under new Rule 424(h)
containing transaction-specific information at least three business days in advance of the first
sale of securities in the offering. 51 The preliminary prospectus will give investors additional
time to analyze the specific structure, assets, and contractual rights regarding each transaction.
We had originally proposed that any material change to the preliminary prospectus, other than
offering price, would require the filing of a new preliminary prospectus and re-starting the

49

See the 2010 ABS Proposing Release at 23334, including footnote 80, and the 2011 ABS Re-Proposal at
47950, including footnote 19. See also the discussion in Section V.B.1.a)(1), below (discussing investors’
concerns about the lack of adequate time).

50

See, e.g., Securitization of Assets: Problems & Solutions Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Sec., Ins., &
Inv. of the S. Comm. on Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs, 111th Cong. 71 (2009) (statement of William
W. Irving, Portfolio Manager at Fidelity Investments) (noting “high demand [for ABS] put investors in the
position of competing with each other, making it difficult for any of them to demand better underwriting,
more disclosure, simpler product structures, or other favorable terms”).

We use the term “preliminary prospectus” to mean the Rule 424(h) preliminary prospectus; similarly we
use the term “final prospectus” to mean the Rule 424(b)(2) or (5) prospectus.

21

waiting period. In response to commenters’ concerns, we are requiring, instead, that issuers file
material changes in a prospectus supplement that provides a clear description of how the
information has changed at least 48 hours before the first sale.
As noted above, while we recognize that ABS issuers have expressed the desire to use
shelf registration in order to access the capital markets quickly, we believe that the shelf
eligibility requirements should be designed to help ensure a certain quality and character for
asset-backed securities eligible for delayed shelf registrations given the speed of these offerings.
Prior to today, one of the shelf eligibility requirements for offerings of asset-backed securities
was that the securities were investment-grade securities – meaning that at least one of the
nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (“NRSRO”) rated them in one of its generic
rating categories that signifies investment grade and is typically one of the four highest
categories. As noted above, the financial crisis revealed that credit rating agencies had generally
not appropriately evaluated the credit risk of the securities and that some investors may have
placed too much reliance on these ratings without conducting their own analysis. 52 We proposed
to replace the investment-grade ratings requirement with alternative shelf eligibility criteria.
These proposals were part of a broad ongoing effort to remove references to NRSRO credit

52

See footnote 31. See also, e.g., Joshua D. Coval, Jakub W. Jurek & Erik Stafford, Economic Catastrophe
Bonds, 99(3) AM. ECON. REV. 628-66 (2009) (arguing that senior CDO tranches have significantly different
risk exposures than their credit rating-matched single-name counterparts, and thus should command
different risk premia, and that the information provided by the credit ratings agencies to their customers is
inadequate for purposes of accurately pricing these risks); John Griffin & Dragon Tang, Did Subjectivity
Play a Role in CDO Credit Ratings?, 67(4) J. FIN. 1293-1328 (2012) (analyzing 916 CDOs and finding that
credit rating agencies frequently made favorable pro-issuer adjustments beyond what their own risk models
suggested, thereby subjectively increasing the size of triple-A tranches in the CDOs, and, subsequently, the
CDOs with larger subjective adjustments experienced more severe downgrades during the economic crisis).

22

ratings from our rules in order to reduce the risk of undue reliance on ratings and also to
eliminate the appearance of an imprimatur that such references may create. 53 Additionally,
Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act requires us to review and eliminate the use of credit ratings
as an assessment of creditworthiness in our rules. 54 Consequently, we are adopting four
transaction requirements for ABS shelf eligibility to indicate which types of offerings qualify for
shelf registration, and we are removing the prior investment-grade ratings requirement. The four
new transaction requirements are:
•

A certification by the chief executive officer;

•

An asset review provision requiring review of the assets for compliance with the
representations and warranties upon the occurrence of certain trigger events;

•

A dispute resolution provision; and

53

See, e.g., Security Ratings, Release No. 33-9245 (July 27, 2011) [76 FR 46606] (the “Security Ratings
Release”) (amending rules and forms under the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act); Removal

(Apr. 27, 2011) [76 FR 26550] (proposing amendments to rules and one form under the Securities
Exchange Act).

54

Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act requires that the Commission review any regulation issued by the
Commission that requires the use of an assessment of the credit-worthiness of a security or money market
instrument and any references to or requirements in such regulations regarding credit ratings. We
completed this review and issued a report on July 21, 2011 (see Report on Review of Reliance on Credit
Ratings, available at http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2011/939astudy.pdf). We have removed references
from a significant number of rules and forms both as a result of our broad ongoing effort to remove credit
rating references from our rules as well as in light of the requirements in Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank
Act. See, e.g., Rules 15c3-1 [17 CFR 240.15c3-1], 15c3-3 [17 CFR 240.15c3-3], 10b-10 [17 CFR

Disclosure of investors’ requests to communicate.

We believe that these new shelf eligibility and offering requirements will reduce undue
reliance on credit ratings and also help to ensure that ABS issued in shelf offerings are designed
and prepared with more oversight and care that make them appropriate to be issued off a shelf,
which we define as being “shelf appropriate” securities.
a)

Certification

In the aftermath of the financial crisis, investors have expressed concern that ABS issuers
were creating securitization transactions that could not support the scheduled payments due to
investors. 55 We are concerned, in particular, that issuers were not adequately reviewing the
disclosure provided in the prospectus, examining the assets included in the pool, and assessing
the security structure and the expected pool-asset cash flows. To address this concern, we are
adopting, as a shelf eligibility requirement, a certification by the chief executive officer of the
depositor at the time of each takedown about the disclosures contained in the prospectus and the
structure of the securitization. We believe that a certification should cause the chief executive
officer to participate more extensively in the oversight of the transaction. The certification will
also provide explicit evidence of the certifier’s belief about the securitization at the time of the
takedown.

55

See, e.g., letters from Better Markets and Prudential I (highlighting the problem with the “originate-todistribute” model where the focus is on whether the asset can be sold into a securitization rather than on its
likely long-term performance).

24

We have made revisions to the certification in order to address commenters’ concerns
about the certification constituting a guarantee about future performance and possibly increased
liability for certifiers. To address commenters’ concerns about certifier liability, we have added
a paragraph to clarify that the certifier has any and all defenses available under the securities
laws.
b)

Asset Review Provision

We have noted investors’ concerns about the effectiveness of contractual provisions
related to the representations and warranties about the pool assets and the lack of responsiveness
by sponsors and other parties to the transaction about potential breaches. 56 Commenters shared
this concern 57 and, to address it, we are requiring, as proposed that the relevant transaction
agreements include provisions providing for a review of the underlying assets for compliance
with the representations and warranties upon the occurrence of certain post-securitization trigger
events. The rule is designed to address comments received related to the triggers and potential
costs, while at the same time balance the need for stronger mechanisms to enforce underlying
contract terms. Under the final rule, the agreements must require a review, at a minimum, upon
the occurrence of a two-pronged trigger. The first prong of the trigger is the occurrence of a
specified percentage of delinquencies in the pool. If the delinquency trigger is met, the second

56

See Disclosure for Asset-Backed Securities Required by Section 943 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Release No. 33-9175 (Jan. 20, 2011) [76 FR 4489, 4490] (the
“Section 943 Adopting Release”). We also note, for example, that transaction agreements typically have
not included specific mechanisms to identify possible breaches of representations and warranties or to
resolve a question of whether a breach of the representations and warranties has occurred.

prong of the trigger is the direction of investors by vote. The report of the reviewer’s findings
and conclusions for all assets reviewed will be required to be provided to the trustee in order for
the trustee to determine whether a repurchase request would be appropriate under the terms of
the transaction agreements, and a summary of the report must be included on the Form 10-D.
We believe that this shelf requirement will address investors’ concerns about the enforceability
of the representations and warranties and also will incentivize the obligated parties to better
consider the disclosure, characteristics, and quality of the assets in the pool.
c)

Dispute Resolution

As demonstrated by events surrounding the financial crisis, investors have not only
lacked an effective mechanism to identify potential breaches of the representations and
warranties, they have also lacked a mechanism to require sponsors to address their repurchase
requests in a timely manner. 58 We are requiring that the underlying transaction agreements
include a provision providing that, if an asset subject to a repurchase request is not repurchased
by the end of a 180-day period beginning when notice is received, then the party submitting such
repurchase request would have the right to refer the matter, at its discretion, to either mediation
or third-party arbitration. Under the final rule, the dispute resolution provision is a separate and

25% bondholder votes that pooling and servicing agreements require for a trustee to be forced to take
action against a mortgage servicer”). See also Tom Hals & Al Yoon, Mortgage Investors Zeroing in on

investors needed to demand accountability for faulty loans pooled into investments is a “laborious” task).

distinct shelf eligibility requirement; investors will be able to take advantage of the dispute
resolution provision regardless of whether they had utilized the asset review process.
d)

Investor Communication

The aftermath of the financial crisis has demonstrated that investors have also
encountered difficulty in locating other investors in order to enforce rights collectively under the
terms of the ABS transaction, especially those related to repurchase demands due to breaches of
the representations and warranties. 59 Without an effective means for investors to communicate
with each other, investors have told us that they are unable to utilize the contractual rights
provided in the underlying transaction agreements. To address this concern, we are requiring as
proposed that the underlying transaction agreements must include a provision to require that a
request by an investor to communicate with other investors be included in ongoing distribution
reports filed on Form 10-D.
e)

Other Shelf Offering Provisions

We are also adopting various other changes to the procedures and forms related to shelf
offerings substantially as proposed, with some changes in response to comments, including:
•

Limiting registration of continuous ABS shelf offerings to “all or none offerings.”

•

Eliminating Rule 415(a)(1)(vii) that provided shelf eligibility to certain investmentgrade mortgage related securities regardless of the registration statement form.

59

See Katy Burne, Banker’s Latest Bet: Teamwork on Bonds, WALL ST. J., Jan. 22, 2013 (illustrating the
difficulty that investors encounter in attempting to communicate with one another and noting one investor’s
efforts to locate other RMBS investors by publishing advertisements in national newspapers).

27

•

Permitting a pay-as-you-go registration fee alternative, allowing ABS issuers to pay
registration fees at the time of filing the preliminary prospectus, as opposed to paying
all registration fees upfront at the time of filing the registration statement.

•

Creating new Forms SF-1 and SF-3 for ABS issuers that will replace the usage of
current Forms S-1 and S-3 in order to delineate between ABS filers and corporate
filers and to tailor requirements for ABS offerings.

•

Eliminating the ABS investment-grade exemptive provision in Rule 15c2-8(b) so that
a broker or dealer will be required to deliver a preliminary prospectus at least 48
hours before sending a confirmation of sale.

•

Revising the current practice of providing a base prospectus and prospectus
supplement for ABS issuers and instead requiring that a single prospectus be filed for
each takedown (except that it would be permissible to highlight material changes
from the preliminary prospectus in a separate supplement to the preliminary
prospectus).
4.

Other Changes to ABS Rules

In addition to the prospectus disclosure changes and shelf requirements, we are also
adopting other changes related to ABS. For example, we are adopting a revision to the
prefunding exception provided in the definition of ABS, which will decrease the prefunding limit
from 50% to 25% of the offering proceeds. Additionally, we are adopting several changes to
Forms 10-D, 10-K and 8-K.

28

5.

Proposed Rules Not Being Adopted At This Time

We are not adopting at this time, however, several rules that we proposed in the 2010
ABS Proposing Release or the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release. These proposals remain
outstanding. They include:
•

Requiring issuers to provide the same disclosure for Rule 144A offering as required
for registered offerings;

•

Making the general asset-level requirements applicable to all asset classes and assetclass specific requirements for equipment loans and leases, student loans, and
floorplan financings;

•

Requiring grouped-account disclosure for credit and charge card ABS;

•

Filing of a waterfall computer program of the contractual cash flow provisions of the
securities;

•

Requiring the transaction documents, in substantially final form, be filed by the date
the preliminary prospectus is required to be filed;

•

Exempting ABS issuers from current requirements that the depositor’s principal
accounting officer or controller sign the registration statement and in lieu requiring an
executive officer in charge of securitization sign the registration statement; and

•

Revising when pool disclosure must be updated on Form 8-K.

II.

Economic Overview
We are mindful of the economic consequences and effects, including costs and benefits,

of our rules, and we discuss them throughout this release when we explain the new rules that we
are adopting. Further, Section 2(b) of the Securities Act 60 and Section 3(f) of the Exchange
Act 61 require the Commission, when engaging in rulemaking that requires it to consider whether
an action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, to consider, in addition to the
protection of investors, whether the action would promote efficiency, competition, and capital
formation. In addition, Section 23(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Commission, when
making rules and regulations under the Exchange Act, to consider the impact a new rule would
have on competition. 62 Section 23(a)(2) also prohibits the Commission from adopting any rule
that would impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the
purposes of the Exchange Act. 63
To assess these economic consequences, we are using as our baseline the ABS market as
it exists at the end of 2013, including applicable rules adopted by the Commission but excluding
the rules adopted herein. Because activity in the ABS market has changed due to the financial
crisis, we will refer to market statistics that encompass the pre-crisis period, the crisis period, and
the current period as appropriate in order to provide a more comprehensive picture of the ABS

market. To the extent that certain amendments are mandated by statute, the economic analysis
considers the consequences and effects that stem from statutory mandates, as well as those that
are affected by the discretion we exercise in implementing the mandates. We provide a
qualitative, and whenever possible quantitative, discussion of the costs, benefits, and the effects
on efficiency, competition, and capital formation of individual rule provisions in the
corresponding sections of the release. We anticipate, however, that the elements of the rules will
interact with each other and also with other regulations to generate combined economic effects.
Thus, it is appropriate to expand the analysis to include disparate elements of the rule. While we
make every reasonable attempt to quantify the economic impact of the rules that we are adopting,
we are unable to do so for several components of the new rules due to the lack of available
data. 64 We also recognize that several components of the new rules are designed to change
existing market practices and as a result, existing data may not provide a basis to fully assess the
rules’ economic impact. Specifically, the rules’ effects will depend on how issuers, their
investors, and other parties to the transactions (e.g., trustees, underwriters, and other parties that
facilitate transactions between issuers and investors) will adjust on a long-term basis to these
new rules and the resulting evolving conditions. The ways in which these groups could adjust,
and the associated effects, are complex and interrelated and thus we are unable to predict them
with specificity nor are we able to quantify them at this time.

64

We note the lack of quantitative analysis provided by commenters about the impact of the proposals on the
market. Some commenters did, however, provide us with some limited qualitative descriptions of potential
impacts, which we took into consideration in adopting the final rules.

31

The new rules are designed to improve investor protections and promote a more efficient
asset-backed market. The new transaction requirements for shelf eligibility should encourage
ABS issuers to design and prepare ABS offerings with greater oversight and care and should
incentivize issuers to provide investors with accurate and complete information at the time of the
offering. It is these transactions that are appropriate to be offered to the public off a shelf
without prior staff review. The new requirements for more asset-level information and more
time for investors to review this information will provide more disclosure and greater
transparency about the underlying assets. The effect of the increased disclosure on competition,
efficiency, and capital formation will depend, in part, on the level of granularity and
standardization of information currently available and disclosed. The remaining changes to
Regulation AB that we are adopting are refinements to existing Regulation AB. We recognize
that these new and amended rules that we are adopting may impose costs on asset-backed
issuers, investors, servicers, and other transaction participants and may affect competition,
efficiency, and capital formation. The effect of the refinements to existing Regulation AB will
depend, in part, on issuers’ current methods to comply with the existing rules. While we cannot
predict or quantify precisely all effects the new rules will have on competition, efficiency, and
capital formation, we believe that the rules we are adopting will improve the asset-backed
securities market.
A.

Market Overview and Economic Baseline

For many asset classes, the ABS market before the 2007-2009 financial crisis differed
significantly from the one immediately after the crisis, and even from our baseline, the market
that exists today, as illustrated in Figure 1. Private-label (non-U.S. agency) ABS issuers held
32

$2.6 trillion in assets in 2004, which grew to $4.5 trillion in 2007, and declined to $1.63 trillion
in 2013. 65 This distinction is most stark in the case of private-label residential mortgage-backed
securities (“RMBS”), including home equity lines of credit. In 2004, prior to the crisis, new
issuances of registered private-label RMBS totaled $746 billion. 66 The overwhelming majority
of private-label RMBS deals issued before the crisis were registered offerings. In 2008,
registered private-label RMBS issuance drastically dropped to $12 billion. Today, the privatelabel RMBS market remains exceptionally weak overall and consists almost exclusively of
unregistered RMBS offerings. 67 For 2013, new issuances of registered private-label RMBS
totaled $4 billion, which represents 0.54% of the issuance level in 2004. Similarly, a drop in
issuance level was evident with registered commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”),
which totaled $74 billion in 2004, declined to $11 billion in 2008, and totaled $53 billion in

Integrated Macroeconomic Accounts (published quarterly), available at
http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/. Each report contains data for the previous five years; data for
earlier years can be accessed through the Federal Reserve’s Data Download Program, available at
http://www.federalreserve.gov/datadownload/Choose.aspx?rel=Z.1. We use aggregate data for private
mortgage pools, consumer credit, business loans, student loans, consumer leases, and trade credit
securitization.

66

The figure and statistics in this section are based on the issuance data from AB Alert and CM Alert
databases. The deals are categorized by offering year, underlying asset type, and offering type (SEC
registered, Rule 144A, or traditional private offerings). Private-label RMBS include residential, Alt-A, and
subprime RMBS, and ABS backed by home equity loans and lines of credit. Only private-label (non-GSE)
RMBS deals sold in the United States and sponsors of such deals are counted. Auto loan ABS include
ABS backed by auto loans, both prime and subprime, motorcycle loans, truck loans, and RV loans.

67

As of December 2013, roughly 99% of new residential mortgage-related securitizations were government
sponsored (market statistics from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA)).
See also Tracy Alloway, “Private-Label Mortgage Securities Take Root,” FIN. TIMES (Feb. 22, 2013)
(noting a recent spurt in private-label RMBS issuances but also indicating that the volume of private-label
RMBS is likely to remain suppressed for some time). The outstanding private-label RMBS market fell to
$1.1 trillion in the last quarter of 2013, down from $1.4 trillion in 2011 and $2.3 trillion in 2007. See also
Diana Olick, “Why Private Investors Are Staying Away From Mortgages,” CNBC (Aug. 6, 2012) (citing
lack of investor confidence in the quality and ratings of RMBS).

33

2013. The consumer finance ABS market, including credit card and auto securitizations, also
declined drastically both in terms of number of deals and issuance volume after the financial
crisis. For example, $85 billion of Auto ABS were issued in 2005, but after the crisis, in 2008,
issuance plummeted to $32 billion. Unlike RMBS, consumer finance ABS, especially Auto
ABS, has since 2008 steadily increased to $42 billion of issuance in 2011 and to $62 billion in
2013. Almost all ABS markets experienced historic downturns following the crisis, and the
recovery of these markets has not been uniform.
Figure 1. Issuance volume (in billions of dollars) of SEC-registered ABS deals in 2004-2013 by
main asset classes. For a description of the data, see footnote 66.

The number of sponsors in the registered ABS markets has undergone changes similar to
the issuance activity described above. In 2004 there were 131 sponsors of registered ABS, while

34

currently there are 61 sponsors of registered ABS. 68 The decline in the number of sponsors is
most dramatic in the RMBS segment where only a single sponsor of private-label RMBS was
issuing registered securities as of the end of 2013 – down from 52 sponsors in 2004. In the
RMBS market, private-label RMBS issuers encounter competitive pressure from governmentsponsored enterprises, whose mortgage-backed securities are guaranteed and exempt from
registration and reporting requirements. As private-label issuance has declined, issuance of
agency RMBS has increased. Issuances of Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie
Mae”), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”), and Government National
Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) mortgage-related securities were $1.4 trillion in 2004, and
grew to $1.9 trillion in 2013. 69
Many factors contributed to the financial crisis, including some that involved mortgagebacked securities. 70 The low interest rate environment prior to the crisis drove investor demand
for high-yield, high-credit rated products, including mortgage-backed securities. 71 Among the
many factors relating to mortgage-backed securities that contributed to the financial crisis,

those provided in the 2010 ABS Proposal to include CMBS sponsors from the CM Alert database.

70

A report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) noted that subprime and near-prime
mortgages increased dramatically in popularity during the 2000’s, accounting for nearly 40% of mortgage
originations by 2006. The high foreclosure and default rates of these mortgages contributed precipitously
to the financial crisis. See U.S. Government Accountability Office, Mortgage Reform: Potential Impacts
of Provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act on Homebuyers and the Mortgage Market (July 2011) at 11.

71

See, e.g., Eamonn K. Moran, Wall Street Meets Main Street: Understanding the Financial Crisis, N.C.
BANKING INST.7, 14 & 35 (2009) (“Low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve, as a result, led to low
returns on traditionally safe U.S. Treasury bonds. Therefore, securitized investments, which yielded a
premium but many of which carried AAA-ratings even if the underlying mortgages were dubious, were
quite attractive to domestic and foreign investors.”).

35

mortgage originators largely exhausted the supply of traditional quality mortgages, and to keep
up with investor demand for mortgage-backed securities, subprime lending became increasingly
popular. 72 During the crisis, as the default rate for subprime mortgages soared, such securities,
including those with high credit ratings, lost value (up to 95% for triple-B rated and 70% for
triple-A rated subprime RMBS issued in 2006), making investors reluctant to purchase these
securities. 73 Some of the decline in the value began to reverse in 2010 as housing prices started
to stabilize and investors gained a better understanding of the mortgage modification process.
This reversal has been concentrated in the subprime RMBS tranches that were highly rated. As
indicated above, activity in some parts of the ABS market continues to remain weak.
B.

Economic Motivations

As described at the end of the previous section, during the financial crisis, many
securitizations performed exceptionally poorly as investments. This has been attributed to the
dual problems of moral hazard and asymmetric information. 74 In particular, many believe that
originators and securitizers have more information about the credit quality and other relevant
characteristics of the borrower than the ultimate investors; for example, they may have been

72

See id. at 35 (noting “voracious demand exhausted the supply of prime mortgage loan securitizations and
investment bankers began seeking subprime mortgage loans to continue to generate mortgage-backed
securities”).

73

See, e.g., Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Report to the Congress on Risk Retention,
(Oct. 2010) at 50-51 (discussing the dramatic drop in the triple-A and triple-B ABX.HE 2006-2 index).

74

See, Adam B. Ashcraft & Til Schuermann, Understanding the Securitization of Subprime Mortgage Credit
(Staff Report, Fed. Reserve Bank of N.Y., Working Paper No. 318, 2008) (identifying at least seven
different frictions in the residential mortgage securitization chain that can cause agency and adverse
selection problems in a securitization transaction and explaining that given that there are many different
parties in a securitization, each with differing economic interests and incentives, the overarching friction
that creates all other problems at every step in the securitization process is asymmetric information).

36

aware that the underlying assets were of poor quality and, thus, presented greater risks. This
leads to a potential moral hazard problem – the situation where one party (e.g., the loan
originator or ABS sponsor) may have a tendency to incur risks because another party (e.g.,
investors) will bear the costs or burdens of these risks. Hence, when there are inadequate
processes in place to encourage (or require) sufficient transparency to overcome concerns about
informational differences, the securitization process could lead certain participants to maximize
their own welfare and interests at the expense of other participants. Before and during the crisis,
information regarding the quality of the underlying assets was not generally known by investors,
and certain originators and sponsors were frequently able to transfer the financial consequences
of poor origination decisions by packaging the assets in complex and often opaque securitization
structures. 75 The incentives to maintain opacity were particularly acute for those securitizations
where the originator and securitizer received full compensation for their services before investors
could become informed about the loan quality of the underlying pool. 76
At that time, many investors unduly relied upon the major credit rating agencies for credit
analysis of these structures rather than conducting their own due diligence, and these agencies

Market for Lemons?, 22(7) REV. FIN. STUD. 2457-94 (2009) (stating that the quality of the assets sold to
investors through securitizations is lower than the quality of similar assets that are not sold to investors);

the originating banks did not expend resources to adequately screen the quality of their borrowers).

37

often failed to accurately evaluate and rate the securitization structures. 77 Many observers
believe that inflated and inaccurate credit ratings contributed to the financial crisis in a
significant way. 78 Investment in securitizations has diminished substantially since the financial
crisis, in part, because investors have significantly less trust that incentives are properly aligned
among originators, securitizers, independent evaluators (rating agencies), and investors. 79
The rules we are adopting apply to private-label RMBS securitizations, and do not apply
to Government Sponsored Entities (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, whose
principal and interest on issued securities is currently guaranteed, while the GSEs remain in

77

See footnotes 30, 31 and 52.

78

Observers identified several weaknesses in the credit rating process, which in many instances contributed to
inaccurate ratings and were made apparent in the aftermath of the financial crisis. One of the weaknesses is
the availability of ratings shopping, whereby issuers can request and privately observe multiple ratings and
then choose to disclose publicly only the most favorable. Complex assets that are difficult to rate and that
are likely to generate differences in ratings can create incentives for issuers to shop for ratings and disclose
only those ratings that are high. Competition among credit rating agencies can exacerbate the problem, by
providing rating agencies with incentive to compete for business through favorable ratings and providing
issuers with options to choose among the rating agencies – commonly referred to as a race to the bottom.
As a result of these weaknesses in the credit rating process, overreliance on credit ratings of complex or
potentially opaque assets, such as in the case with asset-backed securities, can lead to excess investment
with poor risk/return characteristics. See, e.g., NAT’L COMM’N ON THE CAUSES OF THE FIN. AND ECON.
CRISIS IN THE U.S., THE FINANCIAL CRISIS INQUIRY REPORT xxv, 43-44 (2011) (“Participants in the
securitization industry realized that they needed to secure favorable credit ratings in order to sell structured
products to investors. Investment banks therefore paid handsome fees to the ratings agencies to obtain the
desired ratings.”); Vasiliki Skreta & Laura Veldkamp, Ratings Shopping and Asset Complexity: A Theory

conservatorship, 80 and otherwise may be perceived by market participants to carry an implicit
guarantee. 81 Private-label RMBS securitizations are not guaranteed by the federal government
and had a much higher serious delinquency rate than GSE-purchased loans, even after
accounting for different underlying loan characteristics. 82 This historical performance-based
evidence suggests that GSE underwriting standards offset the incentive to incur excess risk
because of their capital support, at least in relation to the private-label securitizers that did not
have such capital support. In particular, GSE purchased loans were six times less likely to
default than private-label loans with similar characteristics. 83 The focus of the final rules is on
private-label securitizations, which is the segment of the market where investors are more likely
to experience losses.
We note that the rules are intended to increase transparency about the potential risks in
the ABS market through greater loan-level disclosure and to provide additional recourse for

In September 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac agreed to be placed under direct government control,
through conservatorship.

investors when issues arise, thus providing better tools for investors to evaluate their capital
allocation decisions. These measures should lessen the risk of overreliance on credit ratings as
investors will now be able to conduct their own due diligence using more transparent and fuller
disclosures regarding the assets underlying a securitization. Disclosure of higher quality and
more complete data regarding the loan characteristics of the underlying collateral should result in
better capital allocation decisions, improved capital formation and, ultimately, lower capital costs
by making the markets more informationally-efficient.
One key objective of the final rules is to eliminate the reliance on credit ratings in the
determination of shelf eligibility of asset-backed securities. Replacing the investment-grade
rating requirement for the purposes of shelf eligibility may result in securitizers finding it
uneconomic or unnecessary to obtain credit ratings for their securitizations, thus lowering the
demand for the services of third-party evaluators. The rules do not, however, preclude investors
from utilizing credit ratings in their investment analysis and decision-making, and asset-backed
securities issuers are not prohibited from having their offerings rated. Thus, if there is sufficient
demand for ratings due to a perception of value in the ratings, then securitizers may continue to
obtain ratings and credit rating agencies would suffer a relatively small decrease in the demand
for their ratings services.
The rules we are adopting are designed to work with other regulations to provide
additional disclosures, further align incentives in the securitization market, and restore
confidence in the ABS market. Specifically, Section 941(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act requires

40

regulations that mandate that certain securitizers have “skin in the game” through the retention of
a meaningful risk exposure in securitizations (at least a 5% economic loss exposure). 84 The
requirement that securitizers hold risk exposure is likely to affect their decisions regarding the
quality of assets to include in such structures. While we expect that the risk retention rules
required by the Dodd-Frank Act, when adopted, will result in better underwriting practices, we
believe that further regulation is necessary to align incentives and facilitate credit evaluation in
the securitization market. 85
In summary, the amendments to our regulations and forms for asset-backed securities are
designed to enhance investor protection by reducing the likelihood of overreliance on ratings and
increasing transparency to market participants.
C.

Potential Effects on the ABS Market

We believe that these amendments will work together to also improve investors’
willingness to invest in asset-backed securities and to help the recovery in the ABS market with
attendant positive effects on informational and allocative efficiency, competition, and the level of
capital formation. Enhanced ABS disclosures and the potential for improved pricing accuracy of
the ABS market should ultimately benefit issuers in the form of a lower cost of capital and
increased investor participation. We expect that increased transparency in the market and more

Retention Re-Proposing Release (both proposed to implement the Dodd-Frank requirement).

85

We also continue to separately consider the comments received in connection with the proposal to
implement the prohibition under Section 621 of the Dodd-Frank Act on material conflicts of interest in
connection with certain securitizations. See Prohibition Against Conflicts of Interest in Certain
Securitizations, Release No. 65355 (Sept. 19, 2011) [76 FR 60320] (the “ABS Conflicts Proposal”).

41

certainty about the quality of underlying assets should result in lower required yields, and a
larger number of investors should be willing to participate in the market because of reduced
uncertainty and risk. This, in turn, would allow originators to conserve costly capital and to
diversify credit risks among many investors. Further, we believe that credit risk transfer will
result in greater efficiency in the lending decisions of originators, the lowering of credit costs,
and ultimately greater capital availability through higher loan levels. 86
Asset-level disclosure requirements will provide information about underlying asset
quality that was not consistently available to investors prior to these rules. The new rules also
standardize the reporting of asset-level information, thus lowering the cost of acquiring
information and search costs for investors. The disclosure and the reduction in search costs
should directly increase the transparency of the market and, thus, the informational efficiency in
pricing ABS, both in the primary and secondary markets. This should lead to increased investor
participation and more efficient allocation of capital.

See, e.g., Darrell Duffie, Innovations in Credit Risk Transfer: Implications for Financial Stability (Bank for
Int’l Settlements Working Paper No. 255, 2008), available at http://www.bis.org/publ/work255.pdf (stating
that innovation in credit risk transfer through security design (such as ABS) increase the liquidity of credit
markets, lowers credit risk premia, allows for the efficient distribution of risk among investors, and offers
investors an improved menu and supply of assets and hedging opportunities); A. Sinan Cebenoyan & Philip

sales) in banking are likely to improve the availability of bank credit, but are unlikely to reduce bank risk);

Risk Transfer Markets (Oct. 2006) (unpublished manuscript) (finding that banks that adopt advanced credit

obligation) experience a permanent increase in their target loan levels of around 50%, and interpreting their
findings as a confirmation of the general efficiency enhancing implications of new risk management
techniques).

There are important benefits to issuers from heightened disclosures of a structured
finance asset base. In the absence of adequate information about the quality of assets in the ABS
structure, as was the case in the RMBS market leading up to the start of the financial crisis, the
market for structured products may break down. 87 The continuing problems in the CMBS and
RMBS markets may be an extended manifestation of this problem. 88 Investors that previously
(and erroneously) relied on credit rating agencies to mitigate the informational asymmetry
problem about asset quality can avail themselves of improved disclosures that allow them to
conduct their own due diligence on an issuer’s structured product. This will benefit issuers of
high quality ABS because if investors are better able to independently verify the quality of and
value underlying assets, they will be better able to distinguish high quality ABS issuers from
other issuers, where otherwise the distinction between different types of issuers’ disclosures
would be obfuscated because the quality of the underlying ABS assets could not be verified.
This differentiation between good and bad quality issuers would also lead to more efficient
allocation of capital.
Another consequence of the final rules is the increase in availability of capital through the
potential expansion of the set of ABS eligible for shelf registration. A larger set of ABS will be

87

This is commonly referred to as the “lemons problem.” See, e.g., George A. Akerlof, The Market for
“Lemons”: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism, 84 Q. J. ECON. 488-500 (1970) (discussing the
difficulty of distinguishing good quality from bad quality in the business world and suggesting that many
economic phenomena may be explained and understood as a response to the demand for the need to
distinguish).

88

See Figure 1 in Section II.A Market Overview and Economic Baseline and accompanying discussion
(noting that the RMBS and CMBS markets have not recovered since the crisis, whereas the issuance of
consumer finance ABS, especially Auto ABS, has steadily increased in the recent years and almost reached
the pre-crisis levels).

eligible for shelf registration if they meet the new shelf eligibility requirements, namely, noninvestment grade ABS tranches that were not eligible before. This may result in greater credit
availability to issuers of non-investment grade ABS that would have otherwise been difficult or
more costly to obtain.
D.

Potential Market Participants’ Responses

We recognize that the final rules may have direct and indirect economic impacts on
various market participants. Importantly, as noted above, the market practices of participants are
likely to evolve in response to the final rules. While we lack the ability to predict those effects
with certainty, we qualitatively consider some of the potential effects of these rules by discussing
the trade-offs various market participants may face when complying with these rules.
Most of the direct costs of these rules fall onto the sponsors of ABS, since they will
initially bear any increased costs of compliance and implementation of the new requirements;
however, there is some uncertainty surrounding who will ultimately bear these direct compliance
costs. Depending on market conditions, the degree of competition at different levels of the
securitization chain, and the availability of other forms of credit, the sponsors may attempt to
pass some or all of these costs on to other market participants.
One way in which the sponsors may elect to pass costs to market participants is through
lower returns paid to investors in securitizations. Promised returns to investors will typically
depend on the costs of creating and maintaining the securitized credit structure, including new
costs associated with compliance. If investors are willing to absorb some or all of these costs
and yet still expect to receive an acceptable risk-adjusted return on their investment, then
investor returns could be lower on these investments than in the past. How much of the higher
44

costs sponsors can realistically pass through to investors will depend on the risk and return
opportunities available from other similar investments in the market.
We also recognize that some of the new asset-level disclosure and shelf registration costs
may be passed down the chain of securitization and ultimately to borrowers. In particular, and in
the short term when new reporting and data handling systems have to be developed, borrowers
may ultimately bear higher credit costs to compensate sponsors for these increased compliance
costs. The ability to pass costs on to borrowers will be constrained by competition from lenders
that do not securitize in the registered market. If the costs of compliance are significant, the
competitive position of firms that are subject to the requirements of the final rules and that rely
on securitization in the public market for funding, in particular through shelf registrations, could
weaken relative to other financial firms that are not subject to these requirements, or that have
other sources of funding.
If asset-backed issuers are unable to pass along their shelf registration costs as described
above, and thus bear all or most of these new costs, then they might choose to avoid the shelf
registration process by registering their ABS on Form SF-1 or they might choose to bypass
registration altogether and issue through unregistered offerings instead to avoid the new shelf
registration costs. Similarly, if asset-backed issuers are unable to pass along the costs incurred to
provide asset-level disclosure (for those asset classes subject to it), then they may issue through
unregistered offerings. Such actions could have the effect of reducing efficiency and could
impede capital formation; however, there are reasons to believe that some investors may support
the market for registered ABS despite additional costs. First, because the prospectus disclosure
requirements are the same for both types of registered offerings, a shift from shelf-registration to
45

non-shelf-registration may occur only due to the new shelf registration costs, and the shift would
be constrained by the speed and convenience of shelf takedowns. Moreover, the reallocation of
newly issued registered ABS between shelf- and non-shelf registration should not have a
substantial effect on capital formation as long as new and existing issuers of registered ABS
choose to or continue to choose to issue registered ABS (and accordingly provide the same
disclosures). Second, not all investors satisfy the criteria of qualified institutional buyers
(“QIBs”) under Rule 144A, 89 and, although such investors might be interested in investing in
Rule 144A ABS, they would not be able to do so due to inability to qualify to participate in that
market. To the extent that this segment of the investor base is sufficiently large, ABS issuers
might experience substantial demand for their securities from investors that are not qualified to
invest in unregistered offerings. Such demand would reduce the cost of capital for public ABS
issuers, creating incentives to issue through registered rather than unregistered offerings. Third,
since the final rule applies to registered offerings of ABS, to the extent that there are investors
willing to pay (in the form of a reduced yield) for the resolution of uncertainty regarding the
asset pool quality and reduced risk of investments, there again may be a substantial enough
demand to fund ABS in the registered market. Thus, we believe that the shift from the registered
ABS segment to other market segments should not be substantial. The potential expansion of the

89

The term “qualified institutional buyer” is defined in Rule 144A(a)(1) [17 CFR 230.144A(a)(1)] and
includes specified institutions that, in the aggregate, own and invest on a discretionary basis at least $100
million in securities of issuers that are not affiliated with such institutions. Banks and other specified
financial institutions must also have a net worth of at least $25 million. A registered broker-dealer qualifies
as a QIB if it, in the aggregate, owns and invests on a discretionary basis at least $10 million in securities of
issuers that are not affiliated with the broker-dealer.

46

registered ABS market and wider investor participation discussed previously in this section
should allow ABS sponsors to recoup some of the costs introduced by these rules and, thus,
should increase the attractiveness of issuing ABS through registered offerings as opposed to
through unregistered offerings.
The enhancement of registered transactions could potentially reduce the degree to which
credit is intermediated by banks. 90 In particular, greater availability of credit for borrowers
through securitizations may result in less reliance on traditional bank loans and greater reliance
on other financial intermediation mechanisms. This is especially likely to happen if and when
the new capital and liquidity requirements (Basel III) result in an increase in the regulatory
capital costs for financial institutions subject to regulatory capital and liquidity requirements.
One potential source of competition for private-label securitizers impacted by these rules
is the GSEs in the mortgage market. As previously mentioned, the principal and interest on
GSE-issued securities is currently guaranteed, while the GSEs are in conservatorship. Even
upon resolution of their current status, their congressional charter and past government
intervention will likely perpetuate a widely held view of an implicit federal guarantee of their
securities. 91 This explicit or future implicit government support provides a competitive
advantage over private-label securitizers through lower funding costs. In addition to this cost of

90

See Darrell Duffie, Innovations in Credit Risk Transfer: Implications for Financial Stability (Bank for Int’l
Settlements Working Paper No. 255, 2008), available at http://www.bis.org/publ/work255.pdf (observing
that financial innovations, such as ABS, designed for more efficient credit risk transfer, have facilitated a
reduction in the degree to which credit is intermediated by banks).

47

capital advantage, GSEs will not be subject to these new rules and the costs associated with the
enhanced disclosure rules, 92 which as we previously discussed are less relevant to investors of
GSE securities because of the government support in the event of credit problems. Thus, to the
extent that the adopted rules impose additional costs on securitizers, their offerings will either
not be as competitive as those of the GSEs or potentially be crowded out of the market
altogether.
The current federal guarantee of mortgage-backed securities issued by GSEs (and/or the
market perception of an implicit guarantee) may explain why, among all the securitized asset
categories impacted by the financial crisis, the private-label RMBS and CMBS have been the
slowest to regain volume. 93 Thus, while the rules we are adopting are intended to create
transparency in the market for private-label securitizations, the additional costs imposed on
securitizers may be sufficiently large that, at least as long as the GSEs remain in federal
government conservatorship, the cost differences between GSE and private-label securitizations
may remain large enough to discourage substantial investment through the latter channel. 94

92

MBS issued by these GSE’s and Ginnie Mae have been and continue to be exempt from registration under
the Securities Act and most provisions of the federal securities laws. For example, Ginnie Mae guarantees
are exempt securities under Section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77c(a)(2)) and Section 3(a)(12)
of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(12)). The chartering legislation for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
contain exemptions with respect to those entities. See 12 U.S.C. 1723c and 12 U.S.C. 1455g.

93

See Figure 1 in Section II.A Market Overview and Economic Baseline and accompanying discussion.

94

Even though the GSEs currently collect and disseminate asset-level information to the public (as discussed
in Section III.A.1 Background and Economic Baseline for the Asset-Level Disclosure Requirement), the
disclosure regime for GSEs would not change as a result of adopting these rules. Accordingly, the costs
that GSEs incur due to their current asset-level disclosures will not change, and the GSEs will likely benefit
from the cost advantage over private-label ABS issuers introduced by the rules being adopted.

48

Longer-term, the competitiveness of private-label securitizations may depend as much on the
ultimate fate of the GSEs as on the effectiveness of the rules we adopt.
III.

Asset-Level Disclosure
We are adopting a requirement for standardized asset-level disclosures for ABS where

the underlying assets consist of residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, auto loans, auto
leases, and resecuritizations of ABS that include these asset types or of debt securities. The
disclosure is required to be provided in a standardized tagged XML format. We are also
adopting many of the proposed refinements to other disclosure requirements. At this time, we
are not adopting our proposal for other asset classes.
A.

Asset-Level Disclosure Requirement
1.
Background and Economic Baseline for the Asset-Level Disclosure
Requirement

Prior to these amendments, the Commission had not historically required the disclosure
of asset-level data. Instead, issuers were only required to provide information about the
composition and characteristics of the asset pool, tailored to the asset type and asset pool
involved for the particular offering. 95 In the past, some transaction agreements for
securitizations required issuers to provide investors with asset-level information, or information
on each asset in the pool backing the securities, but generally there was no mandatory regulatory

95

See Item 1111 of Regulation AB [17 CFR 229.1111].

49

requirement that asset-level data be provided. 96 Furthermore, such information was generally
not standardized or required to be standardized.
Many investors and other participants in the securitization market did not previously have
sufficient time and information to be able to understand the risks underlying the ABS and were
not able to value the ABS accordingly. 97 This lack of understanding and the extent to which it
impacted the U.S. and global economies prompted us to revisit several aspects of our regulation
of ABS, including the information available to investors. This review led us to determine that
investors need access to more robust and standardized information about the assets underlying a
particular ABS in order to allow them to make informed investment decisions. To accomplish
this, we proposed in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release several changes to the disclosure
requirements in Regulation AB including, subject to certain exceptions, a new requirement that
issuers provide asset-level information about each asset in the pool backing the ABS. The assetlevel data requirements were proposed to apply to all asset types, except ABS backed by credit
cards, charge cards and stranded costs. For ABS backed by credit or charge card receivables, we
proposed that issuers provide standardized grouped-account disclosures about the underlying
asset pool instead of asset-level disclosures. Taken together, we believed these disclosures
would provide robust data about each ABS, which would allow investors to analyze for each

96

Under Item 1111(b)(9) of Regulation AB [17 CFR 229.1111(b)(9)] as it existed prior to this adoption, if the
asset pool included commercial mortgages, certain non-standardized asset-level information about the
properties underlying the mortgage was required for all commercial mortgages to the extent material.
Further, for each commercial mortgage that represented, by dollar value, 10% or more of the asset pool, as
measured as of the cut-off date, additional non-standardized asset-level information about the properties
was required.

securitization transaction, at the time of inception and over the life of a security, the
characteristics of each asset, including the collateral supporting each asset and the cash flows
derived from each asset in the transaction.
Subsequent to the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act.
Section 942(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act added Section 7(c) to the Securities Act, which requires,
in relevant part, that the Commission adopt regulations requiring an issuer of an asset-backed
security to disclose, for each tranche or class of security, information regarding the assets
backing that security, including asset-level or loan-level data, if such data is necessary for
investors to independently perform due diligence. 98 In July 2011, we re-proposed some of the
rules proposed in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release in light of the provisions added by the DoddFrank Act and comments received on our 2010 ABS Proposals. In the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing
Release, we requested comment on whether the asset-level disclosure requirements proposed in
the 2010 ABS Proposals implemented Section 7(c) effectively and whether there were any
changes or additions that would better implement Section 7(c). The Commission also requested
comment on whether certain asset-level disclosures enumerated in Section 7(c) are necessary for
investor due diligence. 99

98

See Section 7(c) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77g(c)]. Section 7(c) also requires, among other things,
that we set standards for the format of the data provided by issuers of an asset-backed security, which shall,
to the extent feasible facilitate the comparison of such data across securities in similar types of asset
classes.

99

In particular, the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release requested comment on whether asset-level disclosures
of unique identifiers for loan brokers and originators, broker and originator compensation and the risk
retention held by the originator and the sponsor are necessary for investor due diligence. As noted below,
in general, most commenters did not believe those particular asset-level disclosures were necessary for
investor due diligence.

51

We received comments on the potential privacy implications of the proposed asset-level
data requirements, including comments suggesting that the required asset-level information be
provided by means other than public dissemination on the Commission’s Electronic Data
Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system (“EDGAR”). 100 In light of the privacy concerns about
the proposed asset-level requirements, we re-opened the comment period on the 2010 ABS
Proposals and the 2011 ABS Re-Proposals in February 2014 to permit interested persons to
comment on an approach for the dissemination of asset-level data, which was described in the
2014 Staff Memorandum. The 2014 Staff Memorandum summarized the comments that had
been received related to potential privacy concerns and outlined an approach that would require
issuers to make asset-level information available to investors and potential investors through an
issuer-sponsored Web site rather than having issuers file and make all of the information publicly
available on EDGAR (the “Web site approach”). The Web site approach noted various ways in
which issuers could address potential privacy concerns associated with the disclosure of assetlevel information, including through restricting Web site access to such information.

Proposing Release (“VABSS I”), Ally Financial Inc. et al dated Oct. 13, 2011 submitted in response to the
2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release (“VABSS III”), and Ally Financial Inc. et al dated Aug. 3, 2012
submitted in response to the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release (“VABSS IV”) (urging the Commission “to
consider whether loan-level data (or even grouped data) needs to be made publicly available or could be
made available to investors and other legitimate users in a more limited manner, such as through a limited
access website”). See also letters from Consumer Data Industry Association dated Aug. 2, 2010 submitted
in response to the 2010 ABS Proposing Release (“CDIA”) (suggesting that the Commission require parties
that want to access the data on EDGAR register to use the data, acknowledge the sensitive nature of the
data and agree to maintain its confidentiality) and Epicurus Institute dated Aug. 1, 2010 submitted in
response to the 2010 ABS Proposing Release (“Epicurus”) (stating that they believe “that the prospectus
should contain a hypertext link (with instructions for accessing a website to obtain the data)…[and only]
prospective investors should have traceable access to the data, and that they never have the opportunity to
download… raw data in any format”).

52

To assess the economic consequences of these asset-level disclosure requirements, we are
using as our baseline the ABS market as it existed at the end of 2013. Today, we note that for
some types of ABS, issuers have begun or have continued to provide asset-level data. For
instance, some registered RMBS issuers before the financial crisis provided asset-level
disclosures, although the disclosures were not standardized. Since then, there have been a
limited number of registered RMBS transactions. Those transactions have provided asset-level
disclosures pursuant to recently developed industry standards. 101 Further, sellers of mortgage
loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are required to deliver certain asset-level data in a
standardized electronic form. 102 In turn, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provide investors loanlevel disclosures about the assets underlying their securitizations. 103 For CMBS, we note that
issuers commonly provide investors with asset-level disclosures at the time of securitization and
on an ongoing basis pursuant to industry developed standards. 104 For other asset classes, we

101

Since 2010, only one sponsor has been publicly issuing private-label RMBS. This issuer has disclosed at
the time of securitization asset-level data about the assets underlying the RMBS in a format developed by
the American Securitization Forum (ASF). The ASF Project on Residential Securitization Transparency
and Reporting (“Project RESTART”) published a disclosure and reporting package for residential
mortgage-backed securities. See American Securitization Forum RMBS Disclosure and Reporting Package
Final Release (July 15, 2009), available at http://www.americansecuritization.com/. ASF is a securitization
trade association that represents issuers, investors, financial intermediaries, rating agencies, legal and
accounting firms, trustees, servicers, guarantors, and other market participants.

53

remain unaware of any publicly available data standards or instances where issuers have
provided asset-level data.
We also note that prudential regulators in other jurisdictions require asset-level data about
certain ABS in certain instances. For instance, the European Central Bank requires asset-level
information for ABS accepted as collateral in the Eurosystem credit operations. 105 Additionally,
the Bank of England requires that asset-level information be provided for certain ABS submitted
as collateral against transactions with the Bank of England. 106 Some asset-level data is available
today through third-party data providers who collect asset-level information about agency and
non-agency mortgage loans and provide, for a fee, access to the data. 107 In addition, many thirdparty data providers have developed products to analyze and model asset-level data. 108

After considering the comments received, the ABS market and the availability and use of
asset-level data regarding ABS as they exist today, we are adopting, with modifications, the
proposed asset-level disclosure requirements for ABS where the underlying assets consist of
residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, auto loans or auto leases, resecuritizations of ABS
that include these asset types, or of debt securities. 109 We provide detail on the final rules below.
As noted above, the proposed asset-level data requirements were to apply to all asset
types, except ABS backed by credit cards, charge cards and stranded costs. For ABS backed by
credit or charge card receivables, we proposed that issuers provide standardized grouped-account
disclosures about the underlying asset pool instead of asset-level disclosures.
Asset-level information should provide investors with information that allows them to
independently perform due diligence and make informed investment decisions; however, each
asset class presents its own unique considerations. The response to our proposal was mixed,
with some commenters supporting asset-level disclosure across asset classes and some
commenters suggesting that alternative forms of disclosure were more appropriate for certain
asset classes. We believe that the mix of information needed for analysis varies from asset class
to asset class, and as we discuss in greater detail below, we have tailored the requirements for
each asset class. While we are adopting requirements for only certain asset classes, we continue

109

In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, the debt security asset class was categorized as “Corporate Debt.”

55

to consider the appropriate disclosure requirements for other asset classes and those proposals
remain unchanged and outstanding. 110
a)

Proposed Rule

To augment our current principles-based, pool-level disclosure requirements, we
proposed to require that issuers disclose standardized asset-level information about the assets
underlying the ABS at the time of offering and on an ongoing basis in Exchange Act reports. 111
Proposed Item 1111(h) and Schedule L of Regulation AB enumerated all of the data points that
were to be provided for each asset in the asset pool at the time of offering. Proposed Item
1121(d) and Schedule L-D enumerated all of the data points that were to be provided in periodic
reports required under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. These requirements
contained data points requiring general information or item requirements applicable to all asset
types underlying an ABS transaction and specialized item requirements applicable to only certain
asset types. For instance, the proposal included specialized data points for ABS backed by the
following: residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, auto loans, auto leases, equipment
loans, equipment leases, student loans, floorplan financings, and debt securities and also for
resecuritizations. Each proposed data point contained a title, definition, and a standardized
response. The standardized response could be a date, number, text, or coded response. 112

110

See footnote 46 and accompanying text and Section I.C.5 Proposed Rules Not Being Adopted At This
Time.

111

See Section III of the 2010 ABS Proposing Release.

112

If a data point required a “coded response,” we proposed a set of predefined responses that were coded with
a number that an issuer could select in providing the information.

56

Finally, in order to facilitate investors’ use of the asset-level data, we proposed that the data be
filed with the Commission on EDGAR in a standardized tagged data format using XML.
b)

Comments on Proposed Rule

Support for requiring asset-level disclosures varied across asset types, and in some cases,
between issuers and investors. Some commenters, mainly investors, generally indicated broad
support for asset-level disclosure across asset types. 113 In general, these commenters suggested

suggested that we address this concern by either adopting industry standards 126 or adopting a
“provide-or-explain” type regime. 127
In addition to comments indicating general support or opposition to the proposal, as
discussed further below, we also received comments expressing more specific concerns about the
proposal, such as the costs to provide the disclosures, the value of the disclosure to investors, the
liability for errors in the data, individual privacy issues, the potential release of proprietary data,
and whether asset-level disclosures were necessary to evaluate ABS involving certain asset
classes.
Both investors and issuers noted that the disclosure requirements will impose costs and
burdens on ABS issuers. Investors, however, also believed asset-level information is necessary
to properly analyze ABS, and some investors believed that the concerns about the costs and
burdens of providing such data may be exaggerated. For instance, the investor membership of

suggested that under a provide-or-explain regime if an issuer omits any asset-level data point the issuer
would be required to identify the omitted field and explain why the data was not disclosed. These
commenters seemed to suggest that a provide-or-explain regime should apply to any asset type required to
provide asset-level data.

one trade association acknowledged that requiring asset-level disclosures will impose costs and
burdens on ABS issuers, but believed the information is a “necessary and key element of
restoring investor confidence in the ABS markets.” 128 Another investor acknowledged that the
proposed asset-level disclosures, among other proposed reforms, would increase costs, but the
investor believed the reforms would “instill stronger origination and servicing of securitized
assets, allow for more complete investor reviews and foster a more stable securitization market,
which is a benefit to all borrowers, lenders and investors.” 129 One investor noted that the
additional costs allegedly arising from some of the proposed reforms, including asset-level
disclosures, may be “greatly exaggerated.” 130 This investor suggested that the deficiencies in
“governance and transparency have dramatically increased the costs of securitization in the
current market.” The investor also noted that asset-level disclosures are routinely provided in
various global securitization sectors, such as U.S. CMBS and Australian CMBS, and these
markets have not shut down.
Several commenters did not support asset-level requirements for certain asset classes,
noting that the value of the disclosures to investors or market participants may not justify the
potential costs and burdens derived from the disclosures. 131 Commenters expressed these

that the Commission had not evaluated the entire cost of ongoing reporting for RMBS. 139
Another commenter expressed concern that if the new standards are not well integrated with
existing industry practices, the data may be less reliable because reformatting data leads to a
greater possibility for errors in the data. 140 Some commenters advised that the costs to

from the market. 141 A few commenters suggested, without referencing a particular asset type,

that the proposed disclosures may overwhelm investors 142 and a few commenters raised a similar
concern solely with respect to the disclosures applicable to Auto ABS. 143
Commenters also raised concerns about liability for inaccuracies. 144 Some commenters
expressed concern that there will inevitably be errors in documents including typographical
errors, information entered incorrectly (or not at all) into the files and other errors. 145 One
concern was that some data may be difficult to objectively verify, 146 which one commenter
referred to as “soft data.” 147 This commenter defined soft data as data that “is often self-reported
by obligors, cannot be verified by issuers at a reasonable cost, cannot be confirmed by auditors,
may not be consistent with (or comparable to) information obtained or presented by other issuers
and may reflect subjective judgments.” 148 A few commenters noted that some soft data is used
to calculate the response to other item requirements 149 and one of these commenters suggested

issuers should have the discretion to include or exclude soft data from their disclosures. 150 In
general, these commenters suggested that the materiality of individual data points should be
determined on an aggregate basis across the entire asset portfolio, rather than at the level of the
individual loan. Further, these commenters stated that even if an inaccuracy is material to a
particular loan, the inaccuracy should not subject the issuer to the potential remedy of rescission
of the entire issuance. The commenters urged that liability be based on the aggregate materiality
in the context of the entire asset pool, the full offering disclosures and whether the securitization
structure and documentation provide adequate remedies. Another commenter echoed this
point. 151
As noted above, some commenters did not support requiring asset-level disclosures for
certain asset types. For example, several commenters, mainly issuers of ABS backed by
automobile loans or leases, 152 equipment loans or leases, 153 floorplan financings, 154 and student

150

See letter from ABA I (suggesting that the Commission provide issuers the discretion to include or exclude

the Commission clarify that for liability purposes soft data is not part of the prospectus or registration
statement).

See letter from ASF I (suggesting that the extent to which the data in any individual field or group of fields

loans, 155 opposed asset-level disclosures requirements for these asset types because the
disclosures would raise individual privacy concerns, result in the release of proprietary data, and
the disclosures would be of limited value to investors. To alleviate these concerns, some of these
commenters suggested grouped-account disclosure or a combination of grouped account and
standardized pool-level disclosures. 156 For equipment ABS, some commenters suggested
standardized pool-level data was sufficient. 157 As discussed below, individual privacy concerns
were also raised with respect to the proposed asset level disclosures for RMBS 158 and with
respect to the Web site approach described in the 2014 Staff Memorandum. 159
c)

Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Final Rule

As noted above, the public availability of asset-level information has historically been
limited. In the past, some transaction agreements for securitizations required issuers to provide
investors with asset-level information, or information on each asset in the pool backing the

securities. 160 Such information is sometimes filed as part of the pooling and servicing agreement
or as a free writing prospectus; however, the information provided varied from issuer to issuer
and was not standardized. 161 We believe, however, that all investors and market participants
should have access to information to analyze the risk and return characteristics of ABS offerings
and that asset-level information about the assets underlying a securitization transaction at
inception and over the life of a security provides a more complete picture of the composition and
characteristics of the pool assets and the performance of those assets than pool-level information
alone, and forms an integral part of ABS investment analysis. 162 Therefore, we are adopting,
with modifications, a requirement that standardized asset-level data be provided, for certain asset
types, in the prospectus and in Exchange Act reports. We are also adopting a requirement that
the required asset-level disclosures be provided in XML, a machine-readable format.
At this time, we are adopting asset-level requirements for ABS where the underlying
assets consist of residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, auto loans or leases, and
resecuritizations of ABS, or of debt securities and we continue to consider whether asset-level

160

This usually included, for example, information about the principal balance at the time of origination, the
date of origination, the original interest rate, the type of loan (e.g., fixed, ARM, hybrid), the obligor’s debtto-income (“DTI”) ratio, the documentation level for origination of the loan, and the LTV ratio.

161

Under our current requirements the servicing agreement should be filed as an exhibit to the registration
statement. See Item 601 of Regulation S-K and Section III.B.3.c of the 2004 ABS Adopting Release. See
also Item 1108(c)(1) of Regulation AB. We remind registrants that the pooling and servicing agreement
that is filed must contain all parts of the pooling and servicing agreement, including, but not limited to, any
schedules, exhibits, addendums or appendices, unless a request for confidential treatment was submitted
and granted to allow for the redaction of such information. See, e.g., Securities Act Rule 406 [17 CFR
230.406], Exchange Act Rule 24b–2 [17 CFR 240.24b–2], and Division of Corporation Finance Staff Legal
Bulletins Nos. 1 (Feb. 28, 1997) and 1A (July 11, 2001).

162

Others have noted the importance of loan-level data to investors. See, e.g., footnote 44.

disclosure would be useful to investors across other asset classes. Prior to the financial crisis,
RMBS and CMBS had historically represented a large portion of the registered ABS market
while Auto ABS represents a large portion of the current registered ABS market. Accordingly,
these disclosures should benefit the largest number of investors, especially as greater numbers of
RMBS and CMBS are issued. Although comments about the asset-level requirements for Auto
ABS were mixed, with some opposing any asset-level requirements for Auto ABS, Auto ABS
investors have indicated in comment letters that they believe that asset-level data will strengthen
the Auto ABS market and make it more resilient over the long term. 163 We also note that the
European Central Bank recently began requiring the disclosure of standardized asset-level data
for all Auto ABS accepted as collateral in the Eurosystem credit operations. 164 For these
reasons, we prioritized our efforts to develop asset-level requirements for these asset classes.
The asset-level disclosure requirements for debt security ABS are relatively limited in
scope and primarily consist of information that should be readily available to issuers. These
disclosures, while consisting of only the basic characteristics of the debt security, will provide
useful information to investors, such as the cash flows associated with the debt security, and
identifiers, such as the SEC file number of the debt security. Using the SEC file number of the

concerns raised by Auto ABS issuers through our changes to the Auto ABS requirements, as discussed
below.

debt security, investors will be able to access other disclosures filed with the Commission about
the debt security. No commenters specifically opposed these requirements.
We are also adopting asset-level disclosure requirements for resecuritization ABS. In an
ABS resecuritization, the asset pool is comprised of one or more ABS. The new rules require
disclosures about the ABS in the pool and, if the ABS in the asset pool is an RMBS, CMBS or
Auto ABS, issuers are also required to provide asset-level disclosures about the assets underlying
the ABS. We are requiring disclosures about the ABS being resecuritized for the same reasons
we are requiring disclosure for debt security ABS, which is to provide investors with information
about the ultimate source of cash flows of assets underlying the resecuritization. As a result, we
believe investors in resecuritization ABS should derive the same benefits as investors in other
ABS.
Under current requirements the securities being resecuritized must be registered or
exempt from registration under Section 3 of the Securities Act. 165 As a result, all disclosures for
a registered offering are required. Therefore, requiring asset-level data for the assets underlying
resecuritizations of RMBS, CMBS, Auto ABS or debt security ABS is consistent with our
current disclosure requirements, which also prevents issuers from circumventing our asset-level
requirements for these asset classes. We also note that over the past several years there have
been no registered resecuritizations of RMBS, CMBS or Auto ABS. We recognize, however,

165

See Securities Act Rule 190 [17 CFR 230.190]. An asset pool of an issuing entity includes all instruments
which support the underlying assets of the pool. If those instruments are securities under the Securities
Act, the offering must be registered or exempt from registration if the instruments are included in the asset
pool as provided in Securities Act Rule 190, regardless of their concentration in the pool. See Securities
Act Rule 190(a) and (b). See also Section III.A.6.a of the 2004 ABS Adopting Release.

69

that such a requirement could increase the disclosure costs of resecuritizations relative to
disclosure costs of ABS backed by other assets should an issuer choose to do a resecuritization of
RMBS, CMBS or Auto ABS in the future because sponsors may need to collect information
about underlying assets from additional sources. We have made some revisions to the proposal
to address some of those costs. To the extent that the pass-through of required asset level
disclosures imposes costs above that required for the original securitization, this could limit the
benefits of resecuritizations and potentially inhibit the issuance of resecuritizations.
We also believe the same benefits will accrue to investors in resecuritization ABS as to
investors in RMBS, CMBS, Auto ABS or debt security ABS. Similar to a direct investment in
an RMBS, CMBS, Auto ABS or debt security ABS, access to this information should provide
further transparency about the assets underlying the security or securities underlying the
resecuritization ABS. This additional information should allow investors to analyze the
collateral supporting the security being resecuritized, the cash flows derived from each asset
underlying the security being resecuritized, and the risk of each asset underlying the security
being resecuritized.
We acknowledge commenters’ concerns about other asset classes, which we think
warrant further consideration. For instance, we continue to consider commenters’ concerns
about how asset-level disclosures should apply where there is lack of uniformity amongst the
types of collateral or terms of the underlying contracts, 166 there is a large volume of assets in a

166

See letter from ELFA I.

70

pool, 167 and there are unique features to the ABS structure. 168 For those asset classes where we
are deferring action, we will continue to consider the best approach for providing more
information about underlying assets to investors, including possibly requiring asset-level data in
the future.
We also believe that, for most investors, the usefulness of asset-level data is generally
limited unless the asset-level data requirements, which include the following components, are
standardized: the definitions of each data point, the format for providing the asset-level data
(e.g., XML), and the scope of the information required, such as what data is required about each
obligor, the related collateral, and the cash flows related to each asset. We believe that
standardizing the asset-level disclosures facilitates the ability to compare and analyze the
underlying asset-level data of a particular asset pool as well as compare that pool to other recent
ABS offerings involving similar assets. 169 Over time, asset-level information about past ABS
offerings, including asset-level information about the performance of those offerings, will be
available to further facilitate the ability for issuers to assess expected performance of a new
offering based on the performance of past offerings involving similar assets.

See Statement of Former Federal Reserve Governor Randall S. Kroszner at the Federal Reserve System
Conference on Housing and Mortgage Markets, Washington, DC, Dec. 4, 2008 (stating that a necessary
condition for the potential of private-label MBS to be realized going forward is for comprehensive and
standardized loan-level data covering the entire pool of loans backing MBS be made available and easily
accessible so that the underlying credit quality can be rigorously analyzed by market participants).

71

The asset-level data required will, in general, include information about the credit quality
of the obligor, the collateral related to each asset, the cash flows related to a particular asset, such
as the terms, expected payment amounts, indices and whether and how payment terms change
over time and the performance of each asset over the life of a security. This information should
allow investors to better understand, analyze, and track the performance of ABS. We believe the
final requirements we are adopting for RMBS, CMBS, Auto ABS, debt security ABS and
resecuritizations will implement the requirements of Section 7(c) for these asset classes. 170
Some commenters expressed concern that the proposed data points require more information
than necessary for investor due diligence and could increase re-identification risk. 171 As
discussed in further detail below, we have modified the proposed data set for RMBS and Auto
ABS in response to these concerns. We believe these modifications will help to reduce reidentification risk without materially affecting investors’ ability to evaluate ABS. We believe
that the disclosure requirements that we are adopting will provide investors with information
they need to independently perform due diligence and make informed investment decisions.
As noted above, we believe the usefulness of the asset-level information is further
increased by our formatting requirements. We believe providing standardized data definitions
and requiring the data to be in a machine-readable format will provide investors the ability to

Section 7(c) and the requirements applicable to RMBS, CMBS, debt security ABS and resecuritizations.

Securities Act and the requirements applicable to Auto ABS.

download the data into software tools that can promptly analyze the asset pool. While some
investors may need to obtain the software or other tools needed to analyze the data, we believe
such costs would be offset by a reduction or elimination of the costs investors would incur to
convert non-machine-readable data into a format that makes analyzing it easier. As a result, this
should reduce the time investors need to analyze the offering. We also believe requiring the data
to be in a machine-readable format addresses concerns that investors will be overwhelmed by the
granularity of the data, because investors can quickly extract the data most relevant to their
analysis. Section 7(c) also requires that we set standards for the format of the data provided by
issuers of an asset-backed security, which shall, to the extent feasible, facilitate the comparison
of such data across securities in similar types of asset classes.
The requirements of standardized asset-level information in a machine-readable format
coupled with, as we discuss in Section V.B.1.a Rule 424(h) and Rule 430D, more time to
consider transaction-specific information provided through the new preliminary prospectus and
three-day offering period rules that we are adopting 172 are aimed at addressing concerns,
highlighted by the recent financial crisis, that investors and other participants in the securitization
market may not have had the necessary time and information to be able to understand and
analyze the risk underlying those securities and may not have valued those securities properly or
accurately. 173 Taken together, standardized asset-level information in a machine-readable format
and more time to consider the information should enable investors to analyze offerings more

effectively and efficiently to better understand and gauge the risk underlying the securities. This,
in turn should lead to better pricing, a reduced need to rely on credit ratings and a greater ability
of investors to match their risk and return preferences with ABS issuances having the same risk
and return profile. These benefits should improve allocative efficiency and facilitate capital
formation.
Providing investors access to such information should reduce their cost of information
gathering because they will not need to purchase the data from intermediaries or otherwise gather
the information. Furthermore, requiring that a single entity, the issuer, provide the information
rather than requiring each investor to collect it will reduce duplicative information-gathering
efforts. Also, data accuracy may increase because issuers are incentivized to confirm the
accuracy of the required asset-level disclosures provided in public filings.
Finally, we note that the public availability of standardized machine-readable data may
encourage new entities to enter the ABS credit-analysis industry previously dominated by the top
three largest NRSROs. This could increase competition in that industry and provide those
investors who prefer not to analyze ABS themselves with more options when purchasing creditrisk assessments and reports from third parties. In addition, since asset-level information in
standardized and machine-readable format will now be available, investors will have the ability
to better assess the rating performance of NRSROs and other credit-analysis firms.
While we expect that the asset-level disclosure requirements we are adopting will
generate the benefits described above, we also recognize that they will impose costs upon the
issuers required to provide asset-level disclosures and on other market participants. We received
only a few quantitative estimates of the potential costs to comply with the proposed asset-level
74

disclosure requirements. 174 As discussed above, however, some commenters did express general
concerns about the costs and burdens that would be imposed in order to comply with the
requirements. After considering comments received, we acknowledge that, taken together, the
asset-level disclosure requirements may result in the costs detailed immediately below. 175
The asset-level disclosures, as commenters noted, will result in costs related to revising
existing information systems to capture, store and report the data as required. These costs may
be incurred by several parties along the securitization chain, including loan originators who pass
the information to sponsors and ABS issuers who file the information with the Commission. As
we describe later in the release, there could be significant start-up costs 176 to sponsors to comply
with the asset level disclosures, but ongoing costs to sponsors likely will be significantly less
than the initial costs. We recognize that our estimates may not reflect the actual costs sponsors
will incur, particularly to the extent that there are differences in system implementation costs
relative to our estimates. We also recognize that there are likely to be significant differences
across sponsors in their current internal data collection practices and that implementation costs
will depend on how the new requirements differ from the methods sponsors and ABS issuers

174

See, e.g., letter from VABSS IV (stating that several Auto ABS sponsors estimated the costs and employee
hours necessary to reprogram systems and business procedures to capture, track, and report all of the
proposed data points for auto loans to be approximately $2 million, and that the estimated number of
employee hours needed to provide the required disclosures was approximately 12,000). See also letter
from ELFA I (suggesting that one computer systems vendor estimated that the cost to implement a
computer system to monitor and produce the required asset-level information for equipment ABS would be
approximately $250,000 in direct programming costs plus the additional staff time devoted to preparing
such reports and posting them).

Costs related to concerns about re-identification risk are detailed separately in Section III.A.3 Asset-Level
Data and Individual Privacy Concerns.

currently use to maintain and transmit data. Additionally, we recognize that these costs will
differ by asset class, depending on whether sponsors and ABS issuers within an asset class have
a history of collecting and providing the asset-level information to investors. Further, in the last
four years (2010-2013) only 296 registered RMBS, CMBS, Auto ABS, debt security ABS and
resecuritization transactions took place. This limited issuance activity may discourage issuers
and other market participants from investing in the new systems necessary to provide asset-level
disclosures required by the final rules. As a result, several commenters stated that some entities
may choose to exit the securitization market or not re-enter the market, which could decrease the
availability of credit to consumers and increase the cost of available credit. 177 Furthermore, as
we discussed earlier in this release, some sponsors may choose to issue through unregistered
offerings where no asset-level disclosures are required. 178
We also note that sponsors and ABS issuers may pass the costs they incur to comply with
the requirements on to investors in the form of lower promised returns and/or originators may
pass their costs on to borrowers in the form of higher interest rates or fees. We note, however,
that some of these costs may be offset by a reduction in other expenses. For example, investors

177

See letters from ABAASA I (suggesting that if the costs of the disclosure, plus the competitive impact on
business models and the potential legal risks outweigh the advantages of securitization, issuers may choose
to leave the market or pass along increased costs to investors and borrowers, thereby reducing the amount
of credit or increasing the cost of credit), BoA I (stating that the uncertain costs and burdens associated
with building the infrastructure to capture the data needs to be “rationalized” given the fact that the nonagency securitization markets are not currently robust), and SIFMA I (expressed views of dealers and
sponsors only) (suggesting the proposed asset-level requirements would most likely prevent some
securitizers, in particular smaller originators, from accessing capital through the securitization markets
because they may not be able to incur the costs of overhauling their current systems and practices, and that
without these smaller originators the value of portfolio assets would likely be reduced due to lower
liquidity). See also letter from SIFMA III-dealers and sponsors.

178

See Section II.D Potential Market Participants’ Responses.

76

who previously paid data aggregators for access to relevant information may no longer be
required to purchase this data and, to the extent that they do, lower data collection costs on the
part of the data aggregators may flow through to investors. Many of the data gathering costs that
previously were borne by several data aggregators and/or investors would be performed by the
sponsor, eliminating the potential duplication of effort. Thus, the net effect of the new rules
could be a reduction in the aggregate data collection costs imposed on the entire market through
more efficient dissemination of relevant information. As a result, in the aggregate, the increase
of the costs to investors in the form of lower returns may be offset by the reduction of the costs
that are no longer paid to third-party data providers.
The 2010 ABS Proposing Release noted that the proposed standard definitions for assetlevel information for RMBS and CMBS were similar to, and in part based on, other standards
that have been developed by the industry, such as those developed under the American
Securitization Forum’s (ASF) Project on Residential Securitization Transparency and Reporting
(“Project RESTART”) or those developed by CRE Finance Council (CREFC). We continue to
acknowledge that to the extent that there are differences between standards for asset-level
information, additional costs would be imposed on issuers and servicers to reconcile differences
between standards. Further, servicers may incur some costs in monitoring their compliance with
servicing criteria and requirements under the servicing agreement given that periodic reports will
now include asset-level information. As we discuss in more depth below in the discussions
about the requirements applicable to each asset type, we have attempted to reduce burden and
cost concerns by further aligning the disclosure requirements with industry standards where
feasible. Further, as discussed below, we are providing for an extended implementation
77

timeframe, which we also believe will reduce the burden of implementing the requirements. 179
We discuss in greater detail below in Section III.A.2 Specific Asset-Level Data Points in
Schedule AL the comments received with respect to RMBS, CMBS, Auto ABS, debt security
ABS and resecuritizations and the changes to the final requirements to address these comments.
To further minimize implementation costs, we also removed the “General” category.
We incorporated the data points proposed under this category into each of the asset class-specific
requirements in order to tailor the requirements for each asset class. 180 We believe removing the
General category and tailoring the disclosure requirements to each asset class minimizes
implementation costs because issuers will not need to respond to generic disclosure requirements
that may not be applicable to the particular asset class or that may not align with how the
particular asset class captures and stores data.
We also understand the asset-level data requirements may also affect other market
participants. For instance, some investors may have used the services of data providers to obtain
the type of data that will now be mandatory under the requirements we are adopting. As a result,
these data providers may experience reduced demand for their data aggregation business as
investors may no longer seek such services since these requirements may provide them access to

179

See Section IX.B Transition Period for Asset-Level Disclosure Requirements.

180

Under the proposal, asset pools containing only residential mortgages would need to provide, as applicable,
the asset-level disclosures for residential mortgages and also the general item requirements applicable to all
ABS. Under the new rules, if, for example, the asset pool contains residential mortgages, then issuers only
need to provide the asset-level disclosures applicable to residential mortgages. As noted above, proposed
data points in the general category remain outstanding for asset classes other than the ones we are adopting
today.

78

similar data. We believe, however, that this concern is mitigated as these entities will also be
able to access the publicly available data. As a result, these data providers may not need to
gather this asset-level data from other sources, thereby reducing their costs to obtain the data.
Further, third-party data providers have developed products to analyze and model the asset-level
data. Since the asset-level data will be standardized it may increase the utility of their current
products or allow them to develop new products, thus increasing demand for their data analysis
business.
We note that commenters raised other concerns regarding the asset-level reporting
requirements beyond the cost to implement the requirements. One concern, as noted above, is
that the proposed asset-level data may result in the release of an originator’s proprietary data. 181
A commenter noted that if originators determine that asset-level disclosures reveal their
proprietary business model to competitors they may refrain from securitizing assets. 182 We note,
however, that one commenter believed that the proprietary concerns were unfounded. 183 While
we acknowledge competitive concerns still may exist, we believe that information we are
requiring about the underlying assets, including information about the obligors, will provide
investors and potential investors with information they need to perform due diligence and make

181

See, e.g., letters from ABA I, AmeriCredit, ABAASA I, ASF II (expressed views of issuers only), AFSA I,
BoA I, FSR, J.P. Morgan I, SIFMA I, and VABSS I (noting that for Auto ABS a competitor could take data
on values such as credit score, LTV, and payment-to-income and combine it with other information (e.g.,
make, model, interest rate, loan maturity) to ascertain proprietary scoring models, build their own models
or greatly improve the performance of their existing models).

informed investment decisions and therefore should be disclosed. We also note that some of the
asset-level data that we are requiring to be disclosed are available to the public, for a fee, through
third-party data providers. 184
Another concern that some commenters raised was the potential for securities law
liability for inaccuracies in data points that require so-called “soft data.” 185 The commenters
suggested that soft data includes data that may originate from representations provided by an
obligor at origination or may represent a subjective judgment of a third party, such as property
valuations of an appraiser. We note commenters’ concerns about the potential cost to verify data
of this type and whether such data can be verified objectively. We are not, however, persuaded
by commenters’ suggestions that we address these concerns by providing issuers with the
discretion to include or exclude soft data from their disclosures. As noted below, we believe the
discretion to determine what data would be included or excluded from their disclosures would
reduce the comparability of asset pools. Further, we note that much of the required soft data
includes data that is commonly part of the universe of data that originators use to make a credit
decision, and we believe that investors should have access to similar data for each loan in order
to evaluate the creditworthiness of the assets that they are dependent upon for payment of the
securities. We note that some soft data, as defined by commenters, has been included in poollevel information provided in prior registered offerings and thus is already subject to potential
securities law liability. In some instances the data will provide investors a baseline to compare

184

See footnote 107 and accompanying text.

185

See letter from ABA I.

80

how certain characteristics of the asset have changed over time. Finally, an investor’s analysis
can take into account the age of such disclosures.
In addition to concerns about the accuracy of data points requiring soft data, some
commenters expressed concern about potential liability cost for errors or inaccuracies in the
responses provided to other data points. Assessing materiality for purposes of securities law
liability for an error or inaccuracy in an individual data point would depend on a traditional
analysis of the particular facts and circumstances. 186 We agree with commenters that suggested
that issuers should be able to provide narrative analysis of data in order to make their disclosure
not misleading. Such additional explanatory disclosure can and should be added to the
prospectus or the Form 10-D as may be necessary to make the asset-level disclosures, in the light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. 187 Also, issuers that wish to

186

Whether any particular statement or omission is material will depend on the particular facts and
circumstances. Information is material if “there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder
would consider it important” in making an investment decision. The question of materiality is an objective
one involving the significance of an omitted or misrepresented fact to a reasonable investor. See TSC
Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 448-49 (1976) (stating that to fulfill the materiality
requirement, there must be a substantial likelihood that the fact “would have been viewed by the reasonable
investor as having significantly altered the ‘total mix’ of information made available”); see also Basic v.
Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 231-32 (1988).
Courts have analyzed materiality under Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and
Securities Act Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) in a similar fashion. See, e.g., In re Donald J. Trump Casino Sec.
Litig., 7 F.3d 357, 368 n.10 (3d Cir. 1993) (noting that while there are substantial differences in the
elements that a plaintiff must establish under these provisions, they all have a materiality requirement and
this element is analyzed the same under all of the provisions). See also Securities Act Sections 11, 12(a)(2)
and 17(a), Securities Act Rule 408 [17 CFR 230.408]; Securities Act Sections 11 [15 U.S.C. 77k(a)],
12(a)(2) [15 U.S.C. 77l] and 17(a) [15 U.S.C. 17(a))]; Exchange Act Section 10(b) [15 U.S.C. 78j(b));
Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 [17 CFR 240.10b-5]; and Exchange Act Rule 12b-20 [17 CFR 240.12b-20].

provide other explanatory disclosure about the asset-level disclosures can provide such
disclosures in a separate exhibit. 188
We considered several possible alternatives to the new asset-level requirements we are
adopting. Some alternatives we considered to address various concerns, including reidentification risk, included: requiring more pool-level data in lieu of asset-level data, grouped
account data in lieu of asset-level data, allowing a “provide-or-explain” type regime, only
defining the type of information to be provided and allowing the registrant or other market
participants to define the asset-level information or the Web site approach. 189
We are concerned that these alternatives would be of limited benefit to investors, since
they will not go far enough in providing them with information best suited to assessing the risk
and return tradeoff presented by RMBS, CMBS, Auto ABS, debt security ABS and
resecuritizations and to independently perform due diligence. Pool-level and grouped account
data does not provide investors with the opportunity to develop the same level of understanding,
because when loans or assets are aggregated into groups of information, certain characteristics of
individual assets are lost. For example, investors may know how many loans fall in a particular
loan-to-value range but may not know whether most loans are at the top, middle or bottom of

188

New Item 601(b)(103) Asset Related Documents of Regulation S-K is an exhibit that allows for
explanatory disclosure regarding the asset-level data file(s) filed pursuant to Item 601(b)(102) Asset Data
File. Item 601(b)(103) is required to be incorporated by reference into the prospectus. See Section III.B.5
New Form ABS-EE.

See Section III.A.3 Asset-Level Data and Individual Privacy Concerns.

82

that range. 190 This cross-sectional distribution of loans within a given loan-to-value range may
have important implications for the pool’s expected losses. A grouped account data approach
groups loans based on certain loan characteristics, which does not allow investors to analyze the
asset pool based on the loan characteristics the investors deem most important to their analysis.
As a commenter noted, however, asset-level data provides investors the opportunity to analyze a
broad set of loan characteristics and to assess risks based on the characteristics investors believe
are most predictive of expected losses. 191 With standardized asset-level data in a machine
readable format provided at issuance and over the life of a security, the data can be run through a
risk model at issuance and over the life of a security to assess the risk profile of the transaction at
issuance and any changes to the risk profile of the asset pool over time.
As noted above, we also considered the alternative suggested by some commenters that
we require asset-level disclosure generally but allow an issuer or an industry group to define the
disclosures. We also considered a provide-or-explain type regime that would permit an issuer to
omit any asset-level data point and provide an explanation as to why the data was not
disclosed. 192 We believe such approaches may limit the value of such disclosures. As noted
above, the usefulness of asset-level data is generally limited unless the individual data points are

190

See letter from A. Schwartz (noting that “[f]rom a statistical perspective, disclosing asset-level data to
investors is materially superior to providing them with statistical summaries of the asset pool, because it
conveys more information”).

191

See letter from Prudential II.

192

See letters from BoA I, Citi, and SIFMA I (expressed views of dealers and sponsors only). Some
commenters also suggested that issuers should have the flexibility to modify the disclosures to address
privacy concerns. See, e.g., letters from ABA III and Securities Industry and Financial Markets
Association and the Financial Services Roundtable dated Apr. 28, 2014 responding to the 2014 Re-Opening
Release (“SIFMA/FSR II-dealers and sponsors”).

83

standardized in terms of the definitions, the scope of information to be disclosed, and the format
of the data points. A provide-or-explain regime may result in differing levels of disclosure
provided about similar asset pools, as some may provide the required asset-level disclosures and
others may exclude certain data points and only provide an explanation of why the information
was excluded. This would inhibit the comparability of disclosures across ABS. Similarly,
setting general asset-level disclosure requirements and allowing the issuer to define the data to be
included and how the information is presented may result in differing levels of disclosure or
different presentations of the data. This may limit the ability to compare across asset pools
within the same asset class, which may reduce the usefulness of the data. Standardizing the
information facilitates the ability to analyze the underlying asset-level data of a particular asset
pool and the ability to compare the assets in one pool to assets in other pools. 193 As we note
elsewhere in this release, we believe standardized disclosure requirements and making the
disclosures easily accessible may facilitate stronger independent evaluations of ABS by market
participants.
In addition to considering the alternatives we discussed above, we also considered
adopting industry developed asset-level disclosure standards already in existence for RMBS and
CMBS. We discuss in Section III.A.2.b.1 Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities and Section

193

See letters from MetLife I (stating that the Commission should require standardized disclosure templates
with the relevant fields for each ABS sector with the key benefit of standard disclosure being a significantly
enhanced ability for investors to compare and contrast different ABS transactions in connection with their
investment decisions and ongoing portfolio management) and Prudential I (stating that if two sponsors
within the same asset class can provide information on different standards, it will be impossible for
investors to efficiently compare asset‐level files).

84

III.A.2.b.2 Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities our consideration of adopting industry
developed asset-level disclosure standards for these asset types.
Finally, as mentioned above, the final rules include several changes from the proposal.
The changes are aimed at simplifying the requirements, addressing cost concerns and
conforming our requirements, to the extent feasible, to other pre-existing asset-level disclosure
templates. The discussions below address, for each asset type, the economic effects of the
specific requirements, such as when the data is required and the types of disclosures required for
each asset type. We also discuss the likely costs and benefits of the new rules and their effect on
efficiency, competition and capital formation.
2.

Specific Asset-Level Data Points in Schedule AL

This section is divided into several parts. Each part discusses the specific requirements
we are adopting today for RMBS, CMBS, Auto ABS, debt security ABS and resecuritizations
and highlights, for each asset class, the significant changes from the proposal.
a)
Disclosure Requirements for All Asset Classes and Economic
Analysis of These Requirements
In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we proposed, between Schedule L and Schedule LD, 74 general data points. We believed the proposed general item requirements captured basic
characteristics of assets that would be useful to investors in ABS across asset types. As
discussed below in Section III.B.2 The Scope of New Schedule AL, we have condensed the
information previously proposed to be provided in either Schedule L or Schedule L-D into a
single schedule, titled Schedule AL. Schedule AL enumerates all of the asset-level disclosures to
be provided, if applicable, about the assets in the pool at securitization and on an ongoing basis.
85

We received a substantial number of comments directed at making technical changes to
the data points and in some cases requesting we delete or add certain data points or that we
change a data point to accommodate the characteristics of specified assets types. 194 Many
commenters sought changes to the format of the information, 195 the range of possible responses
for a particular data point, or the data point’s title or definition in order to increase the usefulness
of the information required, to address cost concerns or to align the data point with industry
standards. 196
To address comments that we revise data points to accommodate the characteristics of
certain assets types, we integrated the proposed Item 1 General Requirements into the assetspecific requirements. This change permitted us to tailor the data points to each particular asset
type and allowed us to further incorporate applicable industry standards. The data points we
discuss below are incorporated into the rules for RMBS, CMBS, Auto ABS, debt security ABS
and resecuritizations. In incorporating the proposed General Requirements into the requirements

194

See, e.g., letters from ASF I, ASF II, BoA I, CREFC I, Mass. Atty. Gen., MBA I, Mortgage Bankers
Association dated Nov. 22, 2010 submitted in response to the 2010 ABS Proposing Release (“MBA II”),
MetLife I, MISMO, SIFMA I, VABSS I, VABSS IV, Wells Fargo I and SFIG I.

195

For example, proposed Item 1(a)(15) of Schedule L, “Primary Servicer” provided that the format of the
response should be a “text” entry. Under this format the names of the servicers could be entered or some
other identifier of services, such as the MERS organization identification number. One commenter
suggested that the format of the response be a number entry and that we require the MERS “Mortgage
Identification Number” or “MIN.” The MIN is an 18-digit number used to track a mortgage loan
throughout its life, from origination to securitization to pay-off or foreclosure. We did not adopt this
suggested change because there may be instances where a servicing organization may not have a MERS
number. See letter from ASF I.

196

For example, SIFMA I stated that the title of Item 1(a)(12) of Schedule L “Amortization Type” does not
describe the two options, fixed or adjustable. They recommended changing the title to “Interest rate type.”
We revised the data point title to “Original interest rate type.” SFIG I recommended that we add
explanatory language for interest-only and balloon loans to the definition of proposed Item 1(a)(9) Original
amortization term of Schedule L. See new Item 1(c)(5) of Schedule AL.

86

for each asset type, we are also making changes to the data points, based in large part on
comments received, that we believe improve or clarify the disclosure, mitigate cost concerns
and/or implement industry standards when we believe doing so would not materially diminish
the value of the disclosures to investors.
Asset Number
We proposed that issuers provide a unique asset number for each asset that is applicable
only to that asset and identify the source of the asset number. 197 We did not propose requiring
that issuers use a specific naming or numbering convention. We asked for comment, however,
about whether we should require or permit one type of asset number that is applicable to all asset
types. 198 In response, several commenters urged that we recognize a specific type of asset
numbering system currently in use within the industry for each asset type. 199 A few commenters
were against a uniform number system that would apply across asset classes. 200 A few
commenters, however, cautioned against requiring an asset number because privacy issues may
arise if the asset number is associated with an individual. 201

197

See proposed Items 1(a)(1) and 1(a)(2) of Schedule L. If an issuer uses its own unique numbering system
to track the asset throughout its life, disclosure of that number would satisfy this proposed item
requirement.

We are adopting, as proposed, that issuers provide for each asset in the pool a unique
asset number applicable only to that asset and the source of the number. 202 We believe the use of
an asset number is necessary and to the benefit of market participants, because it will allow them
to follow the performance of an asset from securitization through ongoing periodic reporting.
We remind issuers and underwriters that they should be mindful of the sensitive nature of the
asset number and ensure that appropriate measures are taken to prevent the number from being
associated with a particular person. While some commenters requested we adopt a specific type
of identifier, we believe that identifiers for each asset may be generated in many ways and
currently there is no single uniform asset identifier. These data points, as adopted, provide
flexibility to issuers to use any numbering system, including those numbering systems that
commenters recommended, and we believe this minimizes compliance costs. We are also
adopting a data point, as proposed, that requires the identification of the source of the asset
number. We recognize, however, that by not standardizing the numbering system, the usefulness
of the data will be limited to the extent that investors intend to combine it with other data already
incorporating a particular numbering system.
Underwriting Indicator
We proposed a data point that would disclose whether the loan or asset was an exception
to defined or standardized underwriting criteria. The response to this data point was mixed. One
commenter suggested that we correlate this data point with the then proposed Item 1111(a)(3) of

202

Under this requirement each asset number should only be used to reference a single asset within the pool.
If an asset in the pool is removed and replaced with another asset, the asset added to the pool should be
assigned a unique asset number applicable to only that asset.

88

Regulation AB that would have required disclosure on the underwriting of assets that deviate
from the underwriting criteria disclosed in the prospectus. 203 Another commenter suggested the
data point be omitted because the time and resources to provide the disclosures were not
necessary or desired. 204 This commenter also noted that if we adopt the disclosure, then we
should more precisely define what is considered defined and/or standardized underwriting
criteria to avoid confusion. 205 An Auto ABS commenter stated that the exception disclosure
required by Item 1111(a)(8) is sufficient and therefore this data point should be eliminated, but if
this data point is adopted, the Commission should instruct registrants to omit it if no exceptions
to the underwriting guidelines are reported in the prospectus. 206 Another commenter stated
underwriting standards often contain certain elements of discretionary authority for an
underwriter to vary from the stated criteria and an exercise of this discretion does not constitute
an exception. 207 This commenter also noted specific concerns about the application of this data

203

See letter from ASF I. In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release we proposed to amend Item 1111(a)(3) of
Regulation AB. At the time of the proposal, we proposed to require a description of the solicitation creditgranting or underwriting criteria used to originate or purchase the pool assets, including any changes in
such criteria and the extent to which such policies and criteria are or could be overridden. We proposed to
revise the requirement to also require data to accompany this disclosure on the amount and characteristics
of those assets that did not meet the disclosed standards. Further, if disclosure was provided regarding
compensating or other factors, if any, that were used to determine that those assets should be included in
the pool despite not having met the disclosed underwriting standards, then a description of those factors and
data on the amount of assets in the pool that are represented as meeting those factors and the amount of
assets that do not meet those factors would also be required. We discuss below that the proposed
amendments to Item 1111(a)(3) were incorporated into Item 1111(a)(8) of Regulation AB.

point to CMBS. The commenter stated that underwriting criteria for commercial mortgage loans
are generally not clearly prescribed and the judgment of the originator is commonly used rather
than an objective test based on established mathematical or financial models. Therefore, we
should only require disclosure of exceptions to underwriting criteria in cases where such criteria
are well defined, are fundamental to the credit analysis and are consistently applied. 208
In contrast, one commenter requested additional disclosure because some market
participants use “exception” to refer to loans that are unacceptable under the underwriting
guidelines (i.e. they do not comply with the underwriting guidelines and do not meet the
“compensating factor” standard set out in the guidelines to otherwise allow the approval of such
loans) and at other times market participants use the term “exception” to refer to loans that are
acceptable under the underwriting guidelines because they demonstrated sufficient compensating
factors. The commenter suggested we require disclosure on an asset-level basis of exceptions
both with and without the presence of sufficient compensating factors, the compensating factors
relied upon and the specific underwriting exception. 209 Another commenter noted that this data
point is not provided in asset-level disclosures for offerings of CMBS based on market practice

because more specific disclosure may lead to the disclosure of proprietary underwriting standards, which
may make the securitization markets unattractive and may also lead to less specific underwriting
standards).

and this data point should only be required if underwriting criteria become defined or
standardized for commercial or multi-family mortgages. 210
The proposed amendments to Item 1111(a)(3) were incorporated into Item 1111(a)(8) of
Regulation AB which was added to Item 1111 of Regulation AB in early 2011. 211 Item
1111(a)(8) requires issuers, in part, to disclose how the assets in the pool deviate from the
disclosed underwriting criteria. Rule 193 implements Section 945 of the Dodd-Frank Act by
requiring that any issuer registering the offer and sale of an ABS perform a review of the assets
underlying the ABS. 212 This review provides a basis for the Item 1111(a)(8) disclosure
discussed above. Under Rule 193, such review, at a minimum, must be designed and effected to
provide reasonable assurance that the disclosure regarding the pool assets in the prospectus is
accurate in all material respects. The release adopting Item 1111(a)(8) noted that where
originators may approve loans at a variety of levels, and the loans underwritten at an
incrementally higher level of approval may be evaluated based on judgmental underwriting
decisions, the criteria for the first level of underwriting should be disclosed. In addition, Item
1111(a)(8) requires disclosure of the loans that are included in the pool despite not meeting the
criteria for this first level of underwriting criteria.

91

In light of comments received and the subsequent adoption of Item 1111(a)(8), we are
adopting this data point with modifications. 213 As we noted when adopting the changes to Item
1111(a)(8), originators may approve loans at a variety of levels, and the loans underwritten at an
incrementally higher level of approval are evaluated based on judgmental underwriting
decisions. Therefore, we believe it is appropriate to base the data point on the standards of Item
1111(a)(8) and, in particular, on whether the asset met the disclosed underwriting criteria or
benchmark used to originate the asset. We revised this data point to state: “indicate whether the
loan or asset met the criteria for the first level of solicitation, credit-granting or underwriting
criteria used to originate the pool asset.” Since originators may approve loans at a variety of
levels, and the loans underwritten at an incrementally higher level of approval may be evaluated
based on judgmental underwriting decisions, the data point, as defined, will capture whether the
loan or asset met the criteria for the first level of underwriting. We believe aligning this data
point to Item 1111(a)(8) responds to comments, including the concerns raised by a commenter
with respect to CMBS, and minimizes confusion because the data point does not rely on what
constitutes an exception to a defined and/or standardized set of underwriting criteria and instead
focuses on whether the loan or asset met the disclosed underwriting criteria. For the same
reasons, we also believe it addresses concerns that underwriting standards often contain certain
elements of discretionary authority for an underwriter to vary from the stated criteria without
being considered an exception or that the disclosure may release proprietary underwriting

213

standards. 214 We are not persuaded that disclosures, on an asset-level basis, of exceptions both
with and without the presence of sufficient compensating factors, the compensating factors relied
upon and the specific underwriting exception, are necessary. We believe such disclosure is
unnecessary because this data point, as adopted, captures whether an asset met the first
applicable level of underwriting criteria.
We acknowledge a commenter’s position, which was provided prior to the adoption of
Rule 193, that a substantial expenditure of time and resources would be required to enable
issuers to provide the proposed disclosures. We anticipate that in order to provide the new
disclosure, an issuer could rely, in part, on the review that is already required in order for an
issuer to comply with Rule 193. Since issuers can rely, in part, on the review that is required
under Rule 193, issuers should incur less cost to provide this disclosure than if Rule 193 had not
been implemented. We acknowledge that the information gained through a Rule 193 review
may not provide all of the information needed to provide the disclosures.
Although issuers will incur potential costs to provide this disclosure, investors should
benefit from the insight these disclosures will provide about the originator’s underwriting of the
pool assets and the originator’s ongoing underwriting practices. For instance, the disclosures
should provide investors the ability to identify the particular assets in the pool that did not meet
the disclosed underwriting standards. Investors can then analyze whether these assets alter the
risk profile of the asset pool and monitor the performance of these particular assets. In addition,

214

See footnote 207.

93

we believe this information will allow investors to compare, over time, the performance of assets
that met the disclosed underwriting criteria against those assets that did not meet the disclosed
underwriting criteria used to originate the assets. This should allow investors to better evaluate
an originator’s underwriting practices.
Information about Repurchases
We proposed a data point to capture whether an asset had been repurchased from the
pool. 215 If the asset had been repurchased, then the registrant would have to indicate through
additional data points whether a notice of repurchase had been received, 216 the date the asset was
repurchased, 217 the name of the repurchaser, 218 and the reason for the repurchase. 219
One commenter suggested we clarify that the repurchase notice data point is intended to
track whether a repurchase request has been made before the repurchase has been completed and
add an option to indicate whether a repurchase request was made but the parties later agreed that
a repurchase was not required. 220 Two commenters requested we delete the repurchase notice
data point. 221

See letters from ASF I (requesting that we not adopt the repurchase notice data point because RMBS
transactions do not typically require notices in connection with repurchases) and VABSS IV (noting that
repurchase notices are rarely delivered in Auto ABS).

94

The dealer and sponsor members of one commenter suggested we delete the data point
identifying the name of the repurchaser because transaction documents will contain the name of
the person obligated to make repurchases based on breaches of representations and warranties. 222
The investor members of the same commenter, however, suggested we retain the data point
because multiple parties could be responsible for the repurchase of individual assets. 223
We are adopting this group of data points with revisions in response to comments to
align the data points with other disclosures about asset repurchases now required pursuant to the
Dodd-Frank Act. As one commenter noted, Rule 15Ga-1 was adopted subsequent to the 2010
ABS Proposing Release. 224 Unlike the aggregated disclosures under Rule 15Ga-1, these data
points provide transparency about fulfilled and unfulfilled demands for repurchase or
replacement on an individual asset-level basis for investors in a particular transaction. We
believe these data points provide investors with a more complete picture regarding the number of
assets subject to a repurchase demand, including whether repurchases occur only after the receipt

See letter from SIFMA I (dealer and sponsors).

223

See letter from SIFMA I (investors).

224

See letter from VABSS IV (asserting that a repurchase data point should not be adopted because
“securitizers have been required to disclose repurchase demands pursuant to Rule 15Ga-1 of the Securities
Exchange Act since February 14, 2012). But see letter from J. Calva (stating that investors need loan-level
data in order to verify the accuracy of disclosures made under Rule 15Ga-1). Current Exchange Act Rule
15Ga-1 requires that any securitizer of an Exchange Act ABS provide tabular disclosure of fulfilled and
unfulfilled demand requests aggregated across all of the securitizer’s ABS that fall within the Exchange Act
definition of ABS, whether or not these ABS are Securities Act registered transactions. See the Rule 15Ga1 Adopting Release. With the passage of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (Pub. L. No. 112-103,
126 Stat. 306 (2012)) (the “JOBS Act”) the Exchange Act definition of ABS was redesignated from section
3(a)(77) to section 3(a)(79). As a result of these statutory changes, we are adopting with this release
technical amendments throughout the CFR, including in Rule 15Ga-1, to reflect this redesignation.

95

of a repurchase demand and the potential effects a repurchase may have on the cash flows
generated by pool assets.
To address concerns about the costs to capture and report such data and to make the
disclosure most useful and effective, we are aligning the data points to the type of demands that
must be reported pursuant to Rule 15Ga-1. We believe this should minimize confusion, make
the disclosures consistent with Rule 15Ga-1 disclosures, and help minimize costs because
sponsors will already be required to capture such data to fulfill the disclosure requirements of
Rule 15Ga-1. In particular, we are revising the titles and definitions of this group of data points
in order to align them with the Rule 15Ga-1 disclosure requirements. 225 We expect that the
information on the asset level should feed the aggregated disclosures already required pursuant
to Rule 15Ga-1. 226
We are also adding a data point to capture the status of an asset that is subject to a
demand to repurchase or replace for breach of representations and warranties. 227 A commenter
suggested that we should include an option to indicate assets subject to a repurchase or
replacement demand, but where the relevant parties later agreed the repurchase or replacement

225

For example, new Item 1(i) Asset subject to demand of Schedule AL requires disclosure of whether during
the reporting period the loan was the subject of a demand to repurchase or replace for breach of
representations and warranties, including investor demands upon a trustee. New Item 1(i)(3) Demand
resolution date of Schedule AL requires disclosure of the date the loan repurchase or replacement demand
was resolved, rather than, as proposed, the date the notice was resolved. See also Items 2(g) and 2(g)(3),
3(h) and 3(h)(3), 4(h) and 4(h)(3), and 5(f) and (5)(f)(3) of Schedule AL.

226

For instance, Rule 15Ga-1 requires disclosure of all demands; it is not limited to only those demands made
pursuant to a transaction agreement. In cases where the underlying contracts do not require a repurchase
notice to be made or where an investor makes a demand upon a trustee, consistent with Rule 15Ga-1,
disclosure is required. See the Rule 15Ga-1 Adopting Release at 4498.

227

See new Items 1(i)(1), 2(g)(1), 3(h)(1), 4(h)(1) and 5(f)(1) of Schedule AL.

was not required. 228 To address this concern, we based the coded responses for this data point on
the requirements of Rule 15Ga-1. To this end, the data point captures whether the asset is
pending repurchase or replacement (within the cure period); whether the asset was repurchased
or replaced during the reporting period; 229 and whether the demand is in dispute, has been
rejected or withdrawn. Finally, while not a requirement under Rule 15Ga-1, we are also adding
“98=Other” to the list of coded responses. We believe adding “98=Other” accounts for
dispositions of repurchase requests that may not fall into a category listed in the coded responses.
Two commenters suggested that we include a new data point to require issuers to provide
the amount paid to repurchase the loan or lease from an Auto ABS transaction. 230 One of these
commenters recommended that this new item replace the proposed repurchase indicator data
point 231 because in Auto ABS there is not a lengthy period of time between an event requiring a
repurchase and the actual repurchase as there may be in RMBS. 232 This commenter believed the
repurchase amount would give timely indication that the loan has been repurchased. We believe
that investors across asset classes would benefit from this data point and, therefore, we have
added a repurchase amount data point to the final requirements for each asset class that is
required to provide asset-level disclosures. The proposed repurchase indicator data point has
been subsumed into another data point we are adopting, based on a comment received, titled

If this response is provided it would indicate the asset is no longer in the pool.

“zero balance code.” 233 The zero balance code requires the selection, from a coded list, of the
reason that the loan’s balance was reduced to zero. One option is to select, “repurchased or
replaced,” which if selected would indicate the loan balance was reduced to zero because the
loan was repurchased from the pool. In effect, this data point provides the same information as
the repurchase indicator data point would have provided.
We also are adopting data points that capture the name of the repurchaser 234 and the
reason for the repurchase or replacement. 235 Although the transaction documents will contain
the identity of the party that is obligated to make repurchases based on breaches of
representations and warranties, multiple parties could provide representations and warranties for
a pool of assets and the party responsible for the repurchase of individual assets may differ. 236
We believe this data point will clarify that responsibility.
Reporting Period Beginning and End Dates
We proposed that the asset-level disclosures in a preliminary prospectus be provided,
unless the data point specified otherwise, as of a recent practicable date, which we defined as the

236

See letter from SIFMA I. The dealer and sponsor members represented by this commenter suggested that
we not adopt this data point because the transaction agreements would contain the identity of the party that
is obligated to make repurchases based on breaches of representations and warranties, but the investor
members represented by the same commenter suggested that we adopt this data point because multiple
parties could provide representations and warranties for a pool of assets and the party responsible for the
repurchase of an individual asset may differ.

98

“measurement date.” 237 We proposed that asset-level disclosures in a final prospectus be as of
the “cut-off” date for the securitization, which would be the date specified in the instruments
governing the transaction. This is the date on and after which collections on the pool assets
accrue for the benefit of the asset-backed security holders. On an ongoing basis, the asset-level
disclosures would be as of the end of the reporting period the Form 10-D covered.
A commenter believed that the proposed measurement dates were appropriate 238 and
some commenters pointed out that the measurement date and cut-off date could be the same
day. 239 We also received comments suggesting that some data points in proposed Schedule L
were seeking data as of a date that was different than when the information was normally
captured. For instance, some commenters noted that certain data points seek information as of
the measurement date, but that the information is usually obtained during the underwriting
process or at origination. 240 One of these commenters requested that we revise certain data
points to clarify that the information was collected during the underwriting process or at
origination. 241 Another commenter believed that the disclosure of data based on measurement

237

For example, proposed Item 1(a)(10) Original interest rate of Schedule L would require “the rate of interest
at the time of origination of the asset.”

238

See letter from Prudential I.

239

See letters from ABA I (stating that for RMBS the measurement date used for the preliminary prospectus
will be the same date as the cut-off date used for the final prospectus), MBA I (noting consistency with
standard CMBS industry practice as well as CMBS investor expectations), and SIFMA I.

240

See letters from BoA I (noting that some disclosure items in proposed Schedule L relate to information
obtained from borrowers and is verified to the extent provided by an originator’s underwriting policies and
procedures for the underwriting process) and Wells Fargo I (noting that some data is collected and possibly
captured on an origination system).

241

See letter from Wells Fargo I.

99

dates and cut-off dates should be consistent with current industry practice regarding the
frequency with which issuers can generate pool data. 242
After considering comments received, we are adopting data points that require the
disclosure of reporting period beginning and end dates in lieu of our proposal to require the
measurement date and cut-off date. 243 We believe the date the asset-level information is
provided in the prospectus should align with how information is normally captured and how it
will be reported under the ongoing reporting requirements that will arise after issuance.
Therefore, for a preliminary or final prospectus, the Schedule AL data is required to be provided
as of the end of the most recent reporting period, unless otherwise specified in Schedule AL. 244
For periodic reports on Form 10-D, the Schedule AL data is required to be provided as of the end
of the reporting period covered by the Form 10-D, unless otherwise specified in Schedule AL.
We recognize that this approach may reduce benefits to investors to the extent that some
of the information disclosed may be stale. We believe, however, that this change should serve to
address concerns that the proposal would require data to be captured at times different than when
it is normally captured and thus result in undue issuer costs. To further address those concerns,
we also revised some data points to clarify the “as of” date of the data required. If the data

242

See letter from ABA I (suggesting that it would be burdensome or impossible to provide intra-month
updates because of system limitations that would prevent more frequent data collection and that data is only
comparable if consistently collected at the same point in time).

243

See e.g., new Items 1(b)(1) and 1(b)(2), 2(b)(1) and 2(b)(2), 3(b)(1) and 3(b)(2), 4(b)(1) and 4(b)(2), and
5(b)(1) and 5(b)(2) of Schedule AL.

Information should be provided through the close of business on the last day of the reporting period and not

required is typically captured at a time other than the end of a reporting period, such as at
origination, we revised the data point to clarify the “as of” date of the data required. 245 When
making these changes, we either clarified the title, definition or both. These changes also help
clarify whether we expect the response to a particular data point to remain static or be updated as
new information becomes available. For instance, some data points request “original” or
“initial” data or data as of “origination.” These data points require disclosure of data about the
underlying loan at origination before any modifications. 246 The responses to these data points
will be static and we do not expect updates to these responses over the life of the loan. The
responses to these data points help to establish a baseline of the characteristics of each loan and
will help investors monitor changes in the characteristics of an asset over the life of the loan.
Therefore, unless the data point specifies a different “as of” date (e.g., asking for data created at
origination or at some other time), the data should be as of the end of the reporting period.
Format of the Responses
We proposed that responses to the asset-level disclosure requirements be a date, number,
text, or coded response. Consistent with the proposal, the final requirements we are adopting
require responses as a date, a number, text, or a coded response. We received a number of
comments that sought changes to the format of the information to be collected, the range of

245

See, e.g., new Items 1(c)(6) Original interest rate; 1(c)(29)(xxi) HELOC draw period; 1(c)(30)(iii)
Prepayment penalty total term; 1(c)(31)(ii) Initial negative amortization recast period; 1(c)(31)(viii) Initial
minimum payment reset period; and 1(d)(2) Occupancy status of Schedule AL.

246

If a loan has been modified either prior to securitization or after securitization, responses to data points
titled “original” or that are requiring data as of origination or underwriting should consist of data about the
original loan prior to any loan modification.

101

possible responses, or the data point’s title or definition. 247 As noted elsewhere, we considered
each of these comments and are making changes to mitigate cost and burden concerns and to
implement industry standards when we believe doing so would not materially diminish the value
of the disclosures to investors.
In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we also noted that situations may arise where an
appropriate code for disclosure may not be currently available in the technical specifications. To
accommodate those situations, the proposals provided a coded response for “not applicable,”
“unknown” or “other” and many of the data points we are adopting include these potential
responses. We noted in the proposing release that a response of “not applicable,” “unknown” or
“other” would not be appropriate responses to a significant number of data points and that
registrants should be mindful of their responsibilities to provide all of the disclosures required in
the prospectus and other reports. 248 One commenter believed this language called into question
the availability of Rule 409 under the Securities Act. 249 This commenter and another commenter
requested that we clarify the circumstances under which issuers may rely on Rule 409 to omit
responses to asset-level data points in a registered offering. 250 The rules we are adopting do not

For instance, a commenter suggested that for numbers, the format should indicate whether the number
should be displayed as an integer or as a decimal; for dates, the date field should specify whether the date
should be displayed as a month-year (MM/YYYY) or month-day-year (MM/DD/YYYY); and for data
points requiring a “Yes” or “No,” the response should be coded as “1=Yes, 0=No” rather than “1=Yes,
2=No.” See letter from ASF I.

requirements of Rule 409 and, in particular, that if any required information is unknown and not
reasonably available to the issuer, the issuer is to include a statement either showing that
unreasonable effort or expense would be involved or indicating the absence of any affiliation
with the person who has the information and stating the result of a request made to such person
for the information. Also, in situations where an issuer selects “not applicable,” “unknown,” or
“other,” we encourage issuers to provide additional explanatory disclosure in an “Asset Related
Document” 251 describing why such a response was appropriate along with any other relevant
detail. 252

For example, Item 1(c)(29)(i) Original ARM Index of Schedule AL requires the issuer to “specify the code
that describes the type and source of index to be used to determine the interest rate at each adjustment” and
one possible response is “98=Other.” If the issuer selects “Other” for this data point we encourage the
issuer to provide detail about the index used to calculate the adjustable rate. The issuer could file the
disclosure in an Asset Related Document filed as an exhibit to Form ABS-EE.

Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities

The proposal for RMBS included a total of 362 total data points between the 74 proposed
general item requirements and the 288 data points specific to RMBS in proposed Schedules L
and L-D. Based on the changes described below, the final requirements for RMBS, which are
set forth in Item 1 of Schedule AL, include 270 data points. As noted in the 2010 ABS
Proposing Release, we took into consideration standards that have been developed for the
collection and/or presentation of asset-level data about residential mortgages. For instance, ASF
had published an investor disclosure and reporting package for residential mortgage-backed
securities. The package is part of the group’s Project RESTART. This disclosure and reporting
package includes standardized definitions for loan or asset-level information and a format for the
presentation of the data to investors. 253 We also noted that another organization, the Mortgage
Industry Standard Maintenance Organization (“MISMO”), has been developing a data dictionary
of standardized definitions of mortgage related terms and an XML format for presenting such
data. 254 We also considered the data that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac receive from sellers of

MISMO is a not-for-profit subsidiary of the Mortgage Bankers Association. The MISMO data dictionary
is available at http://www.mismo.org/Specifications/ResidentialSpecifications.htm. MISMO standards are

mortgage loans. In addition, we considered the data that the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision receive from banks. 255
As stated in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, in developing the proposal, the staff
surveyed the definitions used for data collected by the organizations mentioned above, as well as
other industry sources. The scope of the proposed requirements was based mainly on
information required to be provided to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for each loan sold to them
or contained in the disclosure and reporting package for residential mortgage-backed securities
developed by ASF’s Project RESTART. We did not, however, include every requirement
included in these packages. The presentation of the asset-level information was based, in part,
on how information was presented under Project RESTART because that reporting template was
designed specifically for reporting asset-level data about RMBS transactions to investors.
In response to the proposal, issuers, trade associations, investors and others generally
supported the Commission’s effort to increase transparency in the RMBS market. 256
Commenters differed, however, on the approach to requiring standardized asset-level data.
Some commenters, mainly investors, expressed their support for the proposed data points. One
investor group stated the granularity of the proposed data points was necessary because the

used to exchange standardized information about mortgages among mortgage lenders, investors in real
estate and mortgages, servicers, industry vendors, borrowers and other parties.

information is critical. 257 They noted that, unlike a corporate security, investors in structured
finance can only look to the assets in the pool for their return and possibly to external credit
enhancement if provided. Another investor stated that the proposal will enhance the ability of
investors to evaluate the ongoing credit quality of mortgage loan pools and increase market
efficiency. 258 This investor also noted that the disclosures will provide new transparency into
loan servicing operations. Another commenter believed that granular asset-level data is essential
to restoring investor confidence in the RMBS markets and a critical component in encouraging
greater analysis by investors of RMBS transactions and reducing reliance on credit ratings. 259
In addition to the concerns commenters raised with asset-level disclosure requirements
that applied across asset classes, some commenters expressed concerns with certain proposed
RMBS requirements. For instance, commenters were concerned with the granularity of some
proposed data points, 260 with the potential for certain disclosure to compromise individual

See letter from CMBP (suggesting that the following data points proposed in Schedule L fell into the
category of requiring excessive detail and, without explaining why, suggesting they would not be useful to
investors: Items 2(a)(18)(xv) ARM round indicator; 2(a)(18)(xvi) ARM round percentage; 2(b)(6) Original

we believe they provide valuable information to investors with respect to property valuations and ARM
loans. See new Items 1(c)(29)(xiv) ARM round indicator; 1(c)(29)(xvi) ARM round percentage; 1(d)(5)

privacy, 261 and whether some of the disclosures were necessary or material to an investment
decision. 262 Several commenters suggested we follow the MISMO data standards 263 and two
commenters suggested we incorporate more of the reporting package developed under Project
RESTART into the final requirements. 264
After considering the comments received, we are adopting, as proposed, asset-level
disclosures specific to RMBS, with some modification to individual data points, and the addition
and deletion of some data points from the group of proposed data points, as described in more
detail below. Under the final rules, issuers are required to disclose the information described in
Item 1 of Schedule AL for each mortgage in the pool, as applicable. 265 These requirements
include information about the property, mortgage, obligor’s creditworthiness, original and
current mortgage terms, 266 and loan performance information. 267

261

See, e.g., letters from ASF I, CU, and WPF I. See also Section III.A.3 Asset-Level Data and Individual
Privacy Concerns.

262

See, e.g., letters from Citi (stating that many data points had “not been weighed for materiality or shown to
affect the performance of the securities or the pricing of securities”), MBA I (suggesting that we limit the
amount of ongoing information to only those items that are critical to investors) and SIFMA/FSR I-dealers
and sponsors (requesting clarity on whether any of the asset-level data may be considered “material” under
the securities laws and whether disclosure of asset-level data as proposed complies with privacy laws).

263

See, e.g., letters from eSign, MBA I, MERS, and MISMO.

264

See letters from ASF I and Wells Fargo I.

265

Our reference to “as applicable” means that if a particular data point enumerated in the requirements does
not apply to the assets underlying the security, then a response to that data point is not required. For
example, if the asset pool of residential mortgages consists only of fixed-rate mortgages, responses to all of
the data points related to adjustable rate mortgages need not be included in the data file.

266

This includes, but is not limited to, information about loans with adjustable-rates, interest only, balloon
payment and negative amortization features.

267

This includes, but is not limited to, information about payments scheduled and received, loan modifications
and other loss mitigation activities.

107

We believe that the asset-level requirements we are adopting for RMBS will benefit
investors and other market participants by providing them with a broader picture of the
composition, characteristics and performance of pool assets, which we believe is critical to an
investor’s ability to make an informed investment decision about the securities. Further, while
the requirements are granular, we believe the scope of the disclosures is consistent with the
information that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac require for each loan sold to them or that would
likely be collected by participants in Project RESTART. 268 We believe the disclosures will
facilitate investor due diligence regarding RMBS, allow investors to better understand, analyze
and track the performance of RMBS, and will, in turn, allow for better pricing, reduce the need
to rely on credit ratings and increase market efficiency.
The format of the final asset-level requirements remains based, at least in part, on
how information was presented under Project RESTART. In developing the final
requirements, we considered, however, the different formats currently available for the
presentation of asset-level data about residential mortgages. For instance, we note that since
the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have begun receiving assetlevel data prepared in accordance with MISMO data standards for each loan they

268

We are not adopting certain proposed requirements that are not required by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or
would not likely be collected by participants in Project RESTART because some of the information is too
granular and some of the same activity is captured by other data points. For example, proposed Items
2(b)(19)(i) through 2(b)(19)(xiii) related to manufactured housing and proposed Items 1(l)(2)(i) through
1(l)(2)(ii) related to pledged prepayment penalties are being omitted from the final requirements.

108

purchase. 269 As a result, we understand that a number of market participants, including
mortgage originators and servicers, likely capture, store and communicate data in a MISMO
format. Therefore, we considered whether the asset-level disclosures should be provided
following the MISMO format. 270
We are not persuaded, however, that our reporting requirements should follow the
MISMO format. We believe that the format for the presentation of the asset-level data we are
adopting is more investor-friendly, standardizes how the information is to be provided to
investors and is easier to review. Also, the reporting package developed under ASF’s Project
RESTART was designed with the involvement of RMBS investors and issuers, which we believe
provides some indication that issuers and investors support the disclosure and reporting of assetlevel data about RMBS transactions based on that format. Furthermore, we note that since the
Project RESTART standards were released, the few registered offerings of RMBS that have
occurred have provided data based on the standards set under Project RESTART as part of their
offering materials. We also believe this provides some indication that issuers and investors
support this disclosure format. We also note that investors did not submit comment letters

269

https://www.fanniemae.com/singlefamily/uniform-loan-delivery-dataset-uldd. See also Freddie Mac
Product Delivery requirements available at
http://www.freddiemac.com/singlefamily/secmktg/uniform_delivery.html.

270

In considering this alternative, we noted that MISMO had developed a data dictionary of standardized
definitions of mortgage related terms and an XML format for presenting such data. We also recognized
that the MISMO package does not define what data should be provided in any particular circumstance, but
instead is a dictionary of defined loan or asset-level terms that could be used in the development of a
reporting standard. We also recognized that the definitions used in MISMO’s data dictionary are defined
for a general purpose and are not structured for a particular purpose, such as investor reporting.

109

suggesting asset-level data for RMBS be presented in a MISMO format. Finally, we also
considered that asset-level information being released by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac does not
appear to be presented in a MISMO format, although we note that the disclosures are likely
compiled from asset-level information submitted to them that is in a MISMO format. 271
While some data points we are adopting have minor differences to comparable data
definitions contained in MISMO’s data dictionary, we believe that most data points we are
adopting are consistent with the information included in the MISMO data dictionary. 272 We
believe that systems could be programmed, albeit at some cost, to combine data provided in
response to multiple MISMO data definitions to one of our required data points. 273 Therefore,

271

Currently, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provide on their Web sites a portion of the information they
receive about the loans they purchase. At this time, Fannie Mae publicly discloses approximately 50 items
of asset-level disclosure at issuance and on a monthly basis for their newly-issued single-family MBS. See
Fannie Mae’s Uniform Loan Delivery Dataset available at
https://www.fanniemae.com/singlefamily/uniform-loan-delivery-dataset-uldd. Also, Freddie Mac currently
publicly discloses approximately 85 items of asset-level disclosure at issuance and on a monthly basis for
all newly issued fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage participation certificate securities. See Freddie
Mac’s Loan-Level Delivery Dataset available at
http://www.freddiemac.com/singlefamily/sell/uniform_delivery.html.

272

See footnote 254. See also letter from MISMO (indicating that for RMBS the data points proposed in Item
1 General Requirements of Schedule L approximately 80% of the proposed data requested is a direct match
to the MISMO standards, with 14% a close match and 6% with no match and that other tables applicable to
RMBS had a similar pattern).

273

For instance, we note that in many cases there is a direct match between a proposed data point and the
MISMO data definition. Further, in many instances multiple fields in the MISMO data dictionary
could be combined to respond to a data point. An example will best illustrate the differences between
the asset-level requirements adopted today and how information would be reported under a MISMO
format. For instance, we are adopting Item 1(c)(30)(iii) Prepayment penalty total term, which
requires the total number of months after the origination of the loan that the prepayment penalty may
be in effect. This single data point defines the information required (prepayment penalty period), how
to report the information (in months) and the time frame the information represents (from
origination). In contrast, we believe under MISMO, this data point would be provided through the
responses to several MISMO data definitions. One MISMO data definition defines the form of count,
such as the number of periods the prepayment penalty applies. A second MISMO data definition
would define what constitutes a period (e.g., day, week, month, and year). A third MISMO data

110

we believe that data originating in the MISMO data format could be compiled to comply with the
new rules for reporting to RMBS investors so the costs of implementing the requirements may be
limited to the extent that some MISMO data definitions overlap with data points we require.
We understand, however, that requiring data points that deviate from how issuers capture
and store data may raise costs for both issuers and investors because issuers will need to create
new systems or adjust their current systems to provide the data to satisfy our rules. In addition,
investors will need to adjust their existing tools to read and analyze the newly required data. To
further minimize the need to revise systems to provide the required data, we are revising data
points to better align with MISMO data definitions. If a proposed data point and a MISMO data
definition require the same or similar data and aligning to the MISMO data definition would not
affect the value of the information or deviate from how information is reported under the
requirements, we revised the proposed data point to better align with the MISMO data
definition. 274 We believe these changes will help to minimize any burden or costs that may arise
from the reporting of similar information under different standards.
We also acknowledge that some disclosures we are requiring are not part of the MISMO
data dictionary or provided to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Many of these disclosures relate to
the ongoing performance of pool assets. We are requiring these disclosures so that an investor

definition indicates, for a group of responses, whether the information was as of closing, the current
reporting period, at modification or at some other time frame. This approach allows the entity
reporting the information to define prepayment penalty period by day, week, month or year.

the MISMO standards).

may conduct his or her own evaluation of the risk and return profile of the pool assets at issuance
and throughout the life of the investment.
We also considered the alternative of requiring asset-level data generally and allowing
the industry to develop the reporting requirement. While issuers in recent RMBS offerings have
been providing asset-level disclosure in line with the disclosure templates developed by Project
RESTART, providing such data to investors in this format is not mandatory. As noted above, we
believe that, unless asset-level disclosures are standardized across all issuers, the benefits of
asset-level data is generally limited. We believe that, without requiring and standardizing the
asset-level requirements, issuers may choose to not provide asset-level data to investors, provide
it inconsistently, or provide it under differing standards. These alternatives would limit the
ability for investors and market participants to cost-effectively compare and analyze offerings of
RMBS.
Finally, we also received many comments directed at individual data points, many of
which were seeking changes to the format of the information, the range of possible responses for
a particular data point, or the data point’s title or definition. Other commenters made
suggestions on how we could make the data points better align with an industry standard. We
also received comments suggesting that certain data points should not be required if the data is
derivable from other required data points. 275 We considered each of these comments, and we

275

See letters from ASF I and Wells Fargo I.

112

made changes that we believe improve or clarify the disclosure, 276 mitigate cost and burden
concerns and/or implement industry standards when doing so would not materially diminish the
value of the disclosures to investors.
In addition to revising the data points to align with industry standards or to address
comments received, 277 we omitted some data points that were proposed for other reasons, such as
to address concerns about disclosure of sensitive information or reduce repetition. As discussed
below, certain proposed data points would have required disclosure of sensitive information and
could have increased the re-identification risk. 278 While the changes we are making should
reduce the risk of re-identification and the related privacy concerns, we do not believe that the
changes will limit investors’ ability to conduct due diligence and make informed investment
decisions.
As noted below, proposed Schedules L and L-D contained identical or substantially
identical data points, so by aggregating the schedules we are able to omit one of the identical or

276

For example, we proposed a data point that would require issuers to indicate the percentage of mortgage
insurance coverage obtained. In response to comments, we revised the data point to confirm that the
percentage disclosed should represent the total percentage of the original loan balance that is covered by
insurance (e.g., 40% for an insurance policy that covers payment default only from 60% of the loan balance
to 100% of the balance). See new Item 1(f)(2) of Schedule AL.

277

As noted elsewhere, we made revisions to the title, definition or required response of some data points, in
part, based on comments received. As noted in Section III.A.2.a) Disclosure Requirements for All Asset
Classes and Economic Analysis of These Requirements, these changes include changes to the definition or
title to clarify when the data should be captured. Other changes include, based on comments received,
technical changes to clarify how the information should be reported. For instance, data points capturing
“Date” were changed to “YYYY/MM” and data points requiring a “%” were changed to “number.” We
also made revisions to make the terminology used throughout the template consistent. For example, in
some instances, certain data points used the term “note rate” and others used “interest rate.” For
consistency, we use “interest rate” throughout.

See Section III.A.3 Asset-Level Data and Individual Privacy Concerns.

113

nearly identical data points. 279 We also proposed data points that would have required
information about ARM loans that were modified during a reporting period. This information
would have included pre-modification and post-modification characteristics of the ARM loans.
We are not adopting the pre-modification data points since investors will have access to premodification information through other asset-level data. 280 We also aggregated several data
points into either one data point or fewer data points based on comments received. 281 We are
omitting some proposed data points in favor of other data points that we are adding to the
requirements to address comments received. For instance, as discussed further below, we
replaced some data points that capture advances with data points that disclose different
categories of advances and how those advances were reimbursed. 282 We are also omitting, based
on comments received, data points that relate to the Home Affordable Modification Program, a
temporary government program, over concerns about the value of these data points over other

279

See Section III.B.2 The Scope of New Schedule AL.

280

The following proposed data points were omitted from Schedule AL: Items 2(e)(4) Pre-modification
interest (note) rate; 2(e)(7) Pre-modification P&I payment; 2(e)(10) Pre-modification initial interest rate
decrease; 2(e)(12) Pre-modification subsequent interest rate increase; 2(e)(14) Pre-modification payment
cap; 2(e)(17) Pre-modification maturity date: 2(e)(19) Pre-modification interest reset period (if changed);
2(e)(21) Pre-modification next interest rate change date; and 2(e)(26) Pre-modification interest only term.

281

For instance, a data point was added to the final requirements to capture why a loan balance was reduced to
zero. See new Item 1(32)(g)(ii) of Schedule AL. This data point includes a coded list of reasons why the
loan balance was reduced to zero, such as the loan was liquidated, repurchased, or paid off. As a result, the
following proposed data points contained in Schedule L-D were omitted from the final requirements: Items
1(i) Repurchase indicator; 1(l)(1) Paid-in-full indicator;1(j) Liquidated indicator; 1(k) Charge-off indicator;
2(h) Deed-in-lieu date; and 2(l)(7) Actual REO sale closing date.

modification data points and about adopting data points for a temporary government program. 283
We also are not adopting a proposed data point that commenters suggested would provide
limited value to investors. 284
Some commenters, however, suggested we expand the asset-level disclosures to include
more data points than proposed. 285 For instance, commenters suggested adding data points that
would correlate to information captured in ASF’s Project RESTART disclosure and reporting
template, 286 that would capture information about government sponsored loan modification
programs, 287 and debt-to-income (“DTI”) ratios or property valuations. 288 Another commenter
suggested that we add data points that increase the granularity of certain obligor-related data. 289
A commenter also suggested adding data points that captured more information about the
characteristics of modified loans. 290 We added those data points to the extent we believe the data

283

See proposed Items 2(e)(47) through 2(e)(47)(x) of Schedule L-D.

284

We proposed a data point that would have required issuers to provide the date on which the original LTV
ratio was calculated. See proposed Item 2(b)(17) of Schedule L. Some commenters suggested we not
adopt this data point as this date is immaterial because the date on which the value used in the calculation
was determined is more important. See letters from ASF I and SIFMA I. We are not adopting this data
point as we agree with commenters that this date is not necessary given that the date on which the value
used in the calculation was determined is required to be provided.

285

See, e.g., letters from ASF I, CU, MSCI, Wells Fargo I and SFIG I.

286

See letters from ASF I and Wells Fargo I. For example, ASF I suggested that, like in Project RESTART,
we include a 4506-T indicator data point, a paid-in-full amount data point and master servicer, special
servicer and subservicer data points. Because these data points are consistent with our other requirements
and capture information that should be readily available to issuers, we have added them. See new Items
1(e)(8), 1(g)(30), 1(h)(3), 1(h)(4) and 1(h)(5) of Schedule AL.

point improves or clarifies the proposed requirements or aids an investor’s ability to make an
informed investment decision, monitor loan performance for ongoing investment decisions, or
understand loss mitigation efforts without significantly increasing re-identification risk. 291 We
also took into consideration whether issuers have ready access to the information and whether
requiring the information in the format requested would place an undue burden on issuers or
market participants. The final requirements do not include every data point that commenters
recommended we add because we are concerned they could impose an undue burden and we are
not persuaded that the data would aide an investor’s ability to analyze or price the security or
monitor its ongoing performance. We believe that, to the extent issuers want to provide
additional asset-level disclosures in order to capture the unique attributes of a particular pool,
issuers can provide the additional asset-level disclosures in an Asset Related Document. 292
We discuss below the significant comments we received about individual data points
along with the revisions we have made in response to those comments.
Information about Payment Status and Payment History
The proposal included a group of data points that would require disclosure of information
about the status of required payments. These data points would capture, both at the time of the
offering and on an ongoing basis, current delinquency status, 293 the number of days a payment is

291

See Section III.A.3 Asset-Level Data and Individual Privacy Concerns.

116

past due, 294 and current payment status. 295 In addition, on an ongoing basis, a data point would
capture the payment history over the past twelve months. 296
One commenter suggested that we add, revise or delete data points in this group in order
to align with servicing practices or to increase transparency. 297 In lieu of the proposed data
points capturing current delinquency status, current payment status and the number of days a
payment is past due, we are adopting, based on comments received, the following data points:
most recent 12-month pay history, 298 number of payments past due 299 and paid through date. 300
We discuss below the group of data points we are adopting. Taken together, we believe this
group of data points should provide insight into the payment performance of each pool asset and
allow investors to track delinquencies.
Paid Through Date
The proposed data point titled “Number of days payment is past due” would have
required disclosure, at the time of the offering, of the number of days between the scheduled
payment date and the cut-off date if the obligor did not make the full scheduled payment. The
proposed ongoing disclosure requirements included a similar data point, but required the number
of days between the scheduled payment date and the reporting period end date, instead of the

117

cut-off date. A commenter indicated the final requirements should omit the proposed data point
because servicers currently track delinquencies in 30-day intervals, measured on a monthly basis,
rather than number of days past due at any given date, including the reporting date, and because
the cost to capture the proposed information is not justifiable. 301 As an alternative, the
commenter suggested the number of days past due could be derived from the interest paid
through date reported in proposed Item 2(a)(14) of Schedule L and the measurement date.
We are not adopting, as a commenter suggested, the data point titled “Number of days
payment is past due” because the proposed data point may have required data that differs from
how data is captured. 302 We believe an alternative approach may provide investors similar
information with lower costs to issuers. We believe investors can derive information about the
number of days payment is past due from the date through which the loan is paid. Therefore, to
address the commenter’s concern and provide information in each report to derive the number of
days a payment is past due, we are adopting a data point titled “Paid through date” which
requires disclosure of the date the loan’s scheduled principal and interest is paid through as of the
end of the reporting period. 303 For each reporting period the response to this data point will
disclose, regardless of when the last payment was made, the date the loan is paid through. The

301

See letter from ASF I.

302

We do not agree, however, with the alternative the commenter suggested, that the number of days a
payment is past due could be derived from the interest paid through date reported in proposed Item 2(a)(14)
of Schedule L and the measurement date, because the interest paid through date is calculated on the
payment due for that period. Therefore, in future periods where a payment is missed, the response to this
data point would not provide the paid through date since no payment was made.

303

See new Item 1(g)(28) of Schedule AL.

118

response to this data point will also indicate when a loan is paid several months in advance. We
believe this approach addresses the commenter’s cost concerns because the required information
should be readily available. 304
Most Recent 12-Month Pay History
The proposed data point titled “Current delinquency status” would have required that
issuers disclose the number of days the obligor is delinquent at the time of the offering 305 and on
an ongoing basis. 306 One commenter suggested that for RMBS we replace this data point with a
data point contained in the Project RESTART disclosure package that required a string
indicating the payment status per month over the most recent 12 months. 307 The commenter
stated this string, with the addition of foreclosure and REO disclosures, would provide
considerably more useful information than the proposed data point and would subsume the
proposed data point instead of requiring the number of days an obligor is past due. We are
persuaded that a payment history data point indicating the payment status per month over the
most recent 12 months would provide more useful information than the number of days an
obligor is past due. In addition, we believe, as a commenter suggested, that the payment history

See letter from ASF I (suggesting the adoption of field 97 of the ASF RMBS Disclosure Package – Most

Delinquency Status of Schedule L. They did not provide a similar comment with respect to proposed Item
1(f)(12) of Schedule L-D. We believe under the one schedule format that we are adopting the payment
history string subsumes the data captured by this data point. Therefore, we are not adopting the proposed
Current delinquency status data point.

119

data point subsumes the proposed data point. Therefore, we are adopting a payment history data
point and omitting the proposed current payment status data point. 308 Because this information
should be readily available to issuers for the entire history of the loan, we believe any additional
costs incurred from providing the disclosures in the format requested, to the extent that such
format differs from how such information is collected and stored, will be limited.
Number of Payments Past Due
We also proposed a data point titled “Current payment status” that would capture the
number of payments the obligor is past due. 309 We are revising the title to “Number of payments
past due” to more accurately convey the information the data point requires. 310 A commenter
requested we omit the proposed data point because it would be redundant with the proposed the
“Current delinquency status” data point, which would have captured the number of days the
obligor is delinquent. 311 There are many ways to present the status of payments, and the data
point we are adopting will require disclosure of the number of payments an obligor is behind at
any point in time. Therefore, we are not adopting the “Current delinquency status” data point
which should eliminate any potential redundancy.

308

See new Item 1(g)(33) of Schedule AL. This data point requires an issuer to provide a string that indicates
the payment status per month listed from oldest to most recent. The possible responses based on field 97 of
ASF’s RMBS Disclosure Package are: 0=Current; 1=30-59 days delinquent; 2=60-89 days delinquent;
3=90-119 days delinquent; 4=120+ days delinquent; 5=Foreclosure; 6=REO; 7=Loan did not exist in
period; 99=Unknown. The value furthest to the left in the string would be the most recent month and the
value furthest to the right would be the 12th month. For example, for a loan that was current in the most
recent month, 30-59 days delinquent from months two to five and current from months six to twelve the
string would be as follows: 011110000000.

Information about Junior Liens and Senior Liens
We proposed data points that would require disclosure, at the time of the offering, about
the junior liens and senior liens that existed at origination. For loans with subordinate liens at
origination, the combined balances of all subordinate loans would be required. 312 For junior
loans being securitized, the combined balances of all senior mortgages at the time the junior loan
was originated would be required. 313 Where the associated most senior lien is a hybrid, the
hybrid period of the most senior lien would be required. 314 Where the associated most senior
lien features negative amortization, the negative amortization limit of the senior mortgage as a
percentage of the senior lien’s original unpaid principal balance would be required. 315 We did
not propose a data point to capture the effort an originator or sponsor made to discover if the
same property secures other loans, but we asked if this type of disclosure should be required. 316
Comments on this group of data points varied. A few commenters requested that the data
points capturing junior lien balances include an “if known” or similar qualifier to address
concerns that originators may not always have knowledge of, or access to, balance information
on loans not originated by them. 317 A few commenters also suggested that the combined senior

loan and combined junior loan balances, if known, be captured on an ongoing basis. 318 Two
commenters supported a data point capturing what effort an originator or sponsor made to
discover if the same property secures other loans. 319 One of these commenters noted, however,
that there may be difficulties providing this disclosure because the existence of a debt obligation
may not be discovered before the required asset-level disclosures are provided. 320 The other
commenter noted that the disclosure should be required because the failure to account for an
additional loan will result in an inaccurately reported combined LTV ratio and, therefore,
investors would want to know if the verification was made. 321
We are adopting the group of data points described above, but with revisions to address
comments received. 322 In response to comments that expressed concern that originators may not
always have knowledge of, or access to, balance information on loans not originated by them, we
revised this group of data points to require that the information be provided if the information
was obtained or available to them. Regardless of whether the loan being securitized was
originated by parties affiliated or unaffiliated to the issuer, we expect, however, that an issuer
would make efforts to discern whether junior loans were originated concurrently to or

immediately following the origination of the loan being securitized and the balances of those
loans. We believe the review required under existing Rule 193 of the Securities Act, which
requires a review of the pool assets underlying the asset-backed security may address concerns
about verification. The review required under Rule 193 must be designed and effected to
provide reasonable assurance that the disclosure regarding the pool assets in the prospectus,
which includes the asset-level disclosures, is accurate in all material respects. We believe a Rule
193 review would necessarily include consideration of whether the disclosures about junior or
senior liens are accurate in all material respects. We are not adopting a separate data point that
would require disclosure of the effort an originator or sponsor made to discover if the same
property secures other loans. 323 This data would be difficult to capture in a standardized way,
and we are uncertain, at this time, whether this information is best captured within these
particular asset-level requirements.
We believe investors will benefit from ongoing disclosure about the aggregate balances
of all known senior and junior lien(s) and, therefore, we are revising the data points to capture
the most recent senior lien(s) and junior lien(s) balances. 324 We understand, however, that
obtaining updated balances on an ongoing basis may involve some burden and cost, particularly
if the junior liens are originated by parties unaffiliated with the issuer. Therefore, to address

burden concerns, these data points do not require that issuers obtain updated information each
month. Instead, the definitions of these data points indicate that a response is required if the
most recent junior or senior mortgage balances are obtained or available. 325
Information about the Property
We proposed a group of data points that would capture information related to the
property, such as the property type, occupancy status, geographic locations and valuations. 326
Taken together, these data points would provide insight into the physical asset underlying the
mortgage. The response to this group of data points varied with some commenters suggesting
the group of data points was too granular 327 and others suggesting we expand the information
captured about valuations. 328 We discuss below the significant comments we received about this
group of data points and the revisions we have made to data points within this group.
Property Location
We proposed to require that the location of the property by Metropolitan Statistical Area,
Micropolitan Statistical Area or Metropolitan Division (collectively, “MSA”) be provided in lieu
of zip code due to privacy concerns arising from providing the property’s zip code. 329 The

325

For example, if the asset in an RMBS is a senior lien, and subsequent to the securitization, a junior lien is
originated by an affiliate of the depositor, the information about the junior lien would be available to the
issuer and should be reported to the investors in the RMBS in an ongoing report.

MSAs are geographic areas designated by a 5-digit number defined by the U.S. Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) for use by Federal statistical agencies in collecting, tabulating and publishing Federal
Statistics. A Metropolitan Statistical Area contains a core urban area of at least 10,000 (but less than

124

response to this approach varied. On the one hand, we received some comments suggesting we
not require zip code because it would make the ability to identify an obligor within a loan pool
easier. 330 On the other hand, some commenters indicated that 5-digit zip codes or 3-digit zip
codes should be provided instead of MSA because zip codes provide more information about the
property. 331 For instance, one commenter was concerned that disclosing only the MSA would
result in less information than is currently available. 332 As another commenter noted, the zip
code provides information such as whether the property is in a flood plain or earthquake zone. 333
One commenter indicated that using MSA rather than zip codes would restrict the information
available to investors and, as such, issuers expect to receive substantially lower pricing for new
RMBS offerings resulting in substantially higher costs for consumers of residential mortgage
loans. 334 Another commenter echoed this concern. 335 Another commenter suggested that the

economic integration (as measured by commuting to work) with the urban core. The OMB also further
subdivides and designates New England City and Town Areas. The OMB may also combine two or more
of the above designations and identify it as a Combined Statistical Area.

“County Code,” which is a federal information processing standard code, is an appropriate
alternative to other geographic location identifiers. 336
As discussed below in response to the 2014 Re-Opening Release, several commenters
stressed the importance of geography in assessing re-identification risk and recommended
requiring issuers to identify assets by a broader geographic area to reduce the ability to reidentify. 337 One commenter recommended that, instead of requiring MSA as proposed, we
require geography by 2-digit zip code. 338 Based on the reasons discussed in Section III.A.3
Asset-Level Data and Individual Privacy Concerns, we are requiring disclosure of the 2-digit zip
code, which will allow investors to assess market risk associated with a particular geographic
location without resulting in unnecessary re-identification risk.
Property Valuations
We proposed a group of data points that would capture information about original
property valuations. 339 The comments we received on this group of data points varied with some
commenters seeking more granularity and others seeking less granularity. Commenters seeking
more granularity suggested expanding this group of data points to require data about recent
property sales, more detail about the characteristics of the property, such as the gross living area,

room count, and construction style, 340 and the disclosure of appraiser credentials and prior
complaints against them. 341 A commenter also recommended including valuations captured as
part of a “valuation diligence” process, including recalculated loan-to-value ratios and combined
loan-to-value ratios based on these valuations. 342 Another commenter said there is no uniformity
in how values are determined because the proposal would allow issuers to select from a long
menu of valuation methods, approaches and sources for establishing property values. 343 This
flexibility would allow issuers to pick-and-choose which valuation method best serves their
purposes, and the proposed rule would not establish any qualification requirements or standards
of care and/or competency for valuations performed in connection with mortgage-backed
securities.
One commenter stated that the data captured about property valuations was too granular
and not relevant to an investor. 344 With respect to the data point capturing the valuation date, a
commenter suggested the purpose of disclosing the valuation date is to ensure that the loan-tovalue ratio used in the underwriting process was current enough to not overstate the collateral

value of the mortgaged property, particularly during periods of declining home prices. 345 The
commenter stated that the precise date of the valuation may be difficult for some originators to
track. As an alternative, the commenter suggested that we permit issuers to either provide the
valuation date or represent in the relevant transaction agreement that the valuation was
conducted not more than a specified number of days prior to the original closing of the loan.
According to the commenter, such a representation would ensure that the issuer or originator is
allocated the risk of stale valuation. Further, to address any concern about the effectiveness of a
representation in lieu of disclosure, the commenter’s suggested alternative would only apply in a
transaction in which the transaction agreements provide for a robust third-party mechanism for
evaluating and resolving breaches of representations.
As discussed in Section III.A.3 Asset-Level Data and Individual Privacy Concerns below,
we are concerned that providing data about original property valuations may increase reidentification risk; therefore, we are not adopting any of the proposed data points related to
original property valuations. In particular, we are concerned that data about original property
valuations could provide a close approximation of sales price, and thus raise the same reidentification concern as sales price. Although we are not adopting the proposed data points
related to original property valuations, we are adopting other data points, such as Original loan
amount and Original loan-to-value, which will provide investors with key information that they
need to perform due diligence and make an informed investment decision.

345

See letter from ASF I.

128

We also proposed data points requiring disclosure about the most recent property value, if
an additional property valuation was obtained after the original appraised property value. 346 One
commenter indicated that these data points appeared to relate only to valuations obtained by the
originator. 347 The commenter suggested that we require any sponsor who obtains an alternative
property valuation as part of due diligence to disclose that value to the extent it is the most recent
property value. The commenter also suggested that we consider disclosure of the lowest
alternative property value in the last six months (in addition to the most recent property value) to
prevent the sponsor from evading the requirements by getting alternate values only when the
most recent value is lower than the sponsor would like. Another commenter also suggested that
the “Most recent property value” data point should only require property values obtained by the
securitization sponsor, although the investor members of this commenter recommended that this
include affiliates of the securitization sponsor. 348
We are adopting these data points, as proposed, with revisions to address comments
received. 349 In particular, we revised the definitions to require disclosure of any valuation
obtained by or for any transaction party or their affiliates. 350 This revision addresses comments
that these data points appear to relate to valuations obtained only by the originator. The

The final rules also require disclosure of the date on which the most recent property value was reported.

reference to “obtained by or for any transaction party or its affiliates” contained in each
definition should be construed broadly and should include, but not be limited to, valuations
obtained as part of any due diligence conducted by credit rating agencies, underwriters or other
parties to the transaction. We also made conforming changes to the titles and definitions “Most
recent AVM model name” and “Most recent AVM confidence score” because these disclosures
are providing information about the most recent property value.
We also considered, as a commenter suggested, adopting data points to capture the lowest
alternative property valuation obtained in the last six months by, in addition to the originator, the
sponsor or its affiliates. We did not adopt these data points because we are not persuaded, at this
time, that the potential benefits investors may receive from such information would justify the
potential costs and burdens that may be associated with providing the data. If, however,
alternative property valuations are obtained that reflect substantially lower valuations, an issuer
should consider whether these valuations need to be disclosed or whether additional narrative
disclosure is necessary so that the disclosure about property valuations is not misleading. 351
Originators, sponsors or other transaction parties are not required to obtain updated valuations in
order to respond to the data points capturing information about recent valuations. Instead, this
requirement is meant to capture valuations conducted subsequent to the original valuation for
whatever reason, such as updated valuations obtained in the normal course of their business or
because other facts or circumstances required an updated valuation.

351

See footnote 186 and accompanying text.

Information about the Obligor(s)
We proposed a group of asset-level data points that would provide data about an obligor’s
credit quality. 352 This group of data points was intended to capture information about the
obligor(s) income, debt, employment, credit score and DTI ratio. In light of privacy concerns,
the proposal included ranges, or categories of coded responses, instead of requiring disclosure of
an exact credit score, income or debt amount in order to prevent the identification of specific
information about an individual. We discuss below the significant comments we received about
this group of data points and the revisions we have made in response to those comments.
Use of Coded Ranges, Updated Information and Information about Co-obligors
The comments we received on this group of data points varied. As discussed below,
several commenters noted that some data points related to obligors may cause individual privacy
concerns if linked to the obligor even if that information, like obligor credit score, was provided
in ranges. 353 On the other hand, some commenters generally opposed coded ranges because they
believe exact credit scores are necessary to evaluate risk, appropriately price the securities or
verify issuer disclosures. 354
With respect to whether updated obligor information should be required, one commenter

believed that servicers should provide updated borrower information whenever such information
is obtained by the servicer. 355 Other commenters, without providing a reason, also suggested
updated credit score information should be provided. 356 Another commenter, however,
suggested that updated credit scores are obtained infrequently, if at all, and the benefit investors
may receive from updated monthly credit scores across all securitized loans would not justify the
costs to provide such disclosures. 357 The commenter recommended requiring this information
only if the servicer obtains the information. We also received a few comments suggesting that
we eliminate the co-obligor categories for various reasons, 358 and received a comment
suggesting that we provide obligor information for up to four different obligors. 359
We are eliminating certain data about obligor income based on comments received and in
light of the recent adoption by the CFPB of the ability-to-repay requirements under the Truth in
Lending Act or Regulation Z, which includes minimum standards for creditors to consider in
making an ability-to-pay determination when underwriting a mortgage loan. 360 We note that all

data cannot be aggregated (e.g., DTI) the most conservative value should be used) and CMBP (suggesting

originators will need to adhere to these requirements and, therefore, it is appropriate to align our
disclosure requirements with how originators will be required to assess the obligor’s income
when considering their ability to repay a loan while not requiring the disclosure of a significant
amount of potentially sensitive obligor information that could increase re-identification risk. 361
To achieve this, we omitted the data points capturing obligor and co-obligor wage income, 362
obligor and co-obligor other income, 363 all obligor wage income, 364 all obligor total income, 365
and monthly debt. 366 A commenter suggested that we require monthly income used to calculate
the DTI ratio. 367 However, as discussed below in Section III.A.3 Asset-Level Data and
Individual Privacy Concerns, to help reduce re-identification risk, we are not adopting a number
of data points that disclose potentially sensitive obligor information, such as debt or income.
We are also adopting data points capturing the obligor credit score, modified from the
proposal. 368 The proposal would have required issuers to indicate the credit score type and
score. If the score used was FICO, issuers would have been required to indicate the code that

in Lending Act (Regulation Z) (July 24, 2013) [78 FR 44686].
361

Accordingly, we are not requiring that obligor information such as credit score, credit score type, income
verification, employment verification, asset verification and length of employment be provided for more
than one obligor.

represented a range of FICO credit scores within which the score fell. The rules we are adopting
require disclosure of the exact credit score used to evaluate the obligor during the origination
process. 369 We are persuaded by commenters that exact credit scores are necessary to evaluate
risk and to appropriately price securities. 370 We also added, in response to comments received,
data points that capture the most recent credit score, credit score type and credit score date. 371
We are persuaded that updated scores should be provided, if obtained, since such information
will provide investors with a picture of the obligor’s ongoing ability to repay the loan. These

If another type of credit score was used, an exact score would have been required.

See letters from ASF I (requesting exact credit score be required because it has historically been provided
on a loan-level basis and stating that investor members were concerned that moving from disclosing precise
scores to score ranges “would represent a significant step backwards in loan-level transparency”), ASF II
(noting that actual FICO score has been provided for some time in the RMBS industry and that loan-level
investors “believe that it would be extremely useful in the auto space as well”) Capital One I (stating that
current FICO scores would be very useful for an investor’s credit analysis), Interactive (stating that
providing FICO score ranges would reduce precision by assuming that all loans within a certain band will
behave the same), MetLife I (requesting specific FICO score for each loan), Prudential I (stating that ranges
of FICO scores or grouped data disclosure are not sufficient to appreciate the linkages between collateral
characteristics), Prudential III (discussing the importance of certain data points, such as credit score, to an
investor’s credit risk analysis and asserting that predictive risk factors, such as FICO score must be
evaluated in conjunction with other factors, as the combination of individual loan characteristics and
economic environment can add or diminish the risk of a given loan), Vanguard (stating that providing
investors with specific data, such as FICO scores, that is updated periodically should foster independent
analysis in the ABS market and improve pricing), and Wells Fargo I (expressing its concern that by
providing investors with ranges of credit scores, issuers would receive substantially lower pricing for new
offerings, which would lead to substantially higher costs for consumers). In addition, Ginnie Mae, Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac all disclose exact credit scores. We understand that certain asset-level information
about an obligor, including credit score, may be considered a “consumer report” subject to regulation under
FCRA. As discussed below, the CFPB has provided guidance to the Commission stating that FCRA will
not apply to asset-level disclosures where the Commission determines that disclosure of certain asset-level
information is “necessary for investors to independently perform due diligence,” in accordance with the
mandate of Securities Act Section 7(c). For a discussion of the importance of credit scores to predicting
delinquency, see Section III.A.3 below.

information. Instead, this requirement is meant to capture credit scores obtained, for whatever
reason, after the original score was obtained.
Length of Employment
We proposed data points requiring information about the length of time the obligor and
co-obligor have been employed. 372 We received a comment that this level of detail about the
obligor’s length of employment is unnecessary. 373 As an alternative, the commenter stated that it
would be sufficient to know if the obligor has been employed by his or her current employer for
24 months or less or more than 24 months because this is the standard demarcation in industry
underwriting standards. In line with the commenter’s suggestion, we revised the data point to
require the issuer to indicate whether the obligor has been employed by his or her current
employer for greater than 24 months as of the origination date. We believe this approach will
mitigate the burden on issuers, but still provide investors with valuable information about the
obligor’s length of employment.
Months Bankruptcy and Months Foreclosure
We proposed a data point that would require disclosure of the number of months since
any obligor was discharged from bankruptcy. 374 We also proposed a data point that would
require disclosure, if the obligor has directly or indirectly been obligated on any loan that

372

373

374

See proposed Item 2(c)(24) of Schedule L.

135

resulted in foreclosure, of the number of months since the foreclosure date. 375 We received a
comment suggesting this information may be difficult or costly for many lenders to capture, and
that a suitable substitute would consist of a representation designed to ensure that the obligor has
not recently been discharged from bankruptcy and a representation designed to ensure that the
obligor has not recently been obligated on a loan that resulted in a foreclosure sale. 376 The
commenter suggested requiring representations in the relevant transaction agreements, in lieu of
the disclosure of the number of months since the obligor was discharged from bankruptcy or the
number of months since the foreclosure date, to the effect that at least a specified number of
years have passed since any obligor was discharged from bankruptcy or was a direct or indirect
obligor on a loan that resulted in a foreclosure sale.
Another commenter stated, with respect to the data point capturing the number of months
since an obligor has directly or indirectly been obligated on any loan that resulted in foreclosure,
that its dealer and sponsor members believe that this data point should be limited to direct
obligations, whereas its investor members believed that guaranteed or co-signed obligations
should be included. 377 Both groups agreed that this disclosure should be limited to obligations
on residential property that resulted in foreclosure within the last seven years (so that such
foreclosure would appear on a credit report).
In response to privacy concerns, we are not adopting either proposed data point. Section

III.A.3 Asset-Level Data and Individual Privacy Concerns below provides a discussion of these
and other related data points that we are not adopting due to the potential re-identification risk.
As noted below, if an obligor had experienced a past bankruptcy or foreclosure, we would expect
that those events would have been considered in generating a credit score. Because we are
requiring disclosure of an exact credit score, investors will receive information they need about
past payment behavior to perform due diligence.
Debt-to-Income
We proposed data points that would require at the time of securitization disclosure about
the total DTI ratio used by the originator to qualify the loan. 378 In addition, at the time of
securitization and on an ongoing basis the front-end and back-end DTI 379 ratios would be
required for any modified loans. 380
One commenter suggested DTI ratio disclosure provided at origination include both
front-end and back-end DTI ratios. 381 The commenter also suggested we require the DTI ratio

378

See proposed Item 2(c)(16) of Schedule L.

379

The front-end DTI is calculated by dividing the obligor’s total monthly housing expense by the obligor’s
total monthly income. The back-end DTI is calculated by dividing the obligor’s total monthly debt
expense, which includes expenses such as mortgage payments, car loan payments, child support and
alimony payments, credit card payments, student loans payments and condominium fees, by the obligor’s
total monthly income.

380

See proposed Items 2(a)(21)(iv)-(v) of Schedule L and Items 2(e)(23) and 2(e)(25) of Schedule L-D.

381

137

for an ARM loan to be recalculated using the fully indexed interest rate and that we require
disclosure of any subsequent calculations. 382
The data points we are adopting today require, as proposed and consistent with the
comment received, front-end and back-end DTI ratios calculated during the loan origination
process and at the time of any loan modification. 383 We believe both front-end and back-end
DTI ratios provide important data about the total debt load of the obligor, which provides insight
into the obligor’s ability to repay the loan. We are not adopting, as one commenter
recommended, data points capturing information about the DTI ratio recalculated using the fully
indexed interest rate. We believe the DTI figures provided in response to this data point will be
adequate for investors to use, in part, to assess a borrower’s ability to repay. We also note that
our approach is generally consistent with Regulation Z, which requires all loans covered by
Regulation Z to consider DTI ratios calculated using the fully indexed interest rate.
Information about Servicer Advances
Servicer Advances
We made various changes to the group of data points capturing information about
servicer advances. The proposal included information about the servicer’s responsibility, if any,
to advance principal or interest on a delinquent loan, the method of those advances, the

382

Id. (also requesting other updated information be provided, for instance, any values that have been
corrected as a result of due diligence process, such as monthly income and DTI, as well as any postmodification DTI ratios).

383

See new Items 1(e)(9) Originator front-end DTI, 1(e)(10) Originator back-end DTI, 1(m)(12) Modification
front-end DTI, and 1(m)(13) Modification back-end DTI of Schedule AL.

138

outstanding cumulative balance advanced and how those advances were subsequently
reimbursed. The requirements we are adopting today include the information proposed and
described above, but also include the addition and deletion of some data points capturing
advances to address comments received. We discuss immediately below the various changes to
the group of data points capturing information about servicer advances.
Advancing Method
The final rule includes a data point suggested by a commenter titled “Advancing
method.” 384 The data point includes a coded list that indicates the servicer’s responsibility for
advancing principal or interest on delinquent loans. We believe that the response to this data
point will help investors understand the servicer’s responsibility with respect to advances for
each particular loan and the pool as a whole.
Advances: Principal, Interest, Taxes and Insurance, and Corporate
We proposed a general disclosure data point that would require, if amounts were
advanced by the servicer during the reporting period, the disclosure of the amount advanced. 385
One commenter 386 suggested that for RMBS, we split this information into three categories that
would capture principal and interest advances, 387 tax and insurance advances, 388 and corporate

384

See new Item 1(g)(5) Advancing method of Schedule AL. See letter from ASF I.

Id. (noting that principal and interest advances consist of due but unpaid principal and/or interest on the
loan for the period, as required by the methodology specified in the transaction agreements).

388

Id. (stating that tax and insurance advances consist of due but unpaid escrow amounts for payment of
property taxes and insurance payments with respect to the mortgaged property).

139

advances because these categories of information are more useful. 389 In addition, the investor
membership of another commenter requested disclosure about the servicer’s methodologies
regarding advances of interest and principal on delinquent loans, the reimbursement of those
advances, 390 and, for modified loans, disclosure about non-capitalized and capitalized
advances. 391 The commenter also suggested aggregating the data points capturing, for liquidated
loans, the various advances the servicer had made to cover expenses incurred due to concerns
that the information was too granular and the information is immaterial to investors. 392
In light of these comments, we have split the final data points into the following four
categories: principal advances, interest advances, taxes and insurance advances, and corporate
advances. While one commenter recommended aggregating the principal advances and interest
advances into one data point, the final rule includes data points capturing interest and principal
advances separately since that is consistent with how other information that relates to principal
and interest is captured in Schedule AL.
We agree with commenters that requiring disclosures about advances made by the
servicer, the outstanding cumulative balance advanced and how those advances were

389

Id. (defining corporate advances as consisting of property inspection and preservation expenses with
respect to defaulted loans).

390

See letter from SIFMA I (suggesting that we amend current pool-level disclosure requirements so that more
disclosure is provided about a servicer’s methodologies for advancement of principal and interest and the
reimbursement of advances).

391

Id. (referring to the disclosures required under proposed Items 2(e)(45) Reimbursable modification escrow
and corporate advances (capitalized) and 2(e)(46) Reimbursable modification servicing fee advances
(capitalized) of Schedule L-D).

392

See proposed Items 2(m)(1)(iv) through 2(m)(1)(xii) of Schedule L-D.

140

subsequently reimbursed or addressed will provide investors insight into the payment status of a
particular asset within the pool and the potential losses that may pass on to the trust. Therefore,
in order to capture how these advances were reimbursed, the final rule includes additional data
points that capture for these same categories of advances, the cumulative outstanding advanced
amount or, if these advances were subsequently reimbursed, how they were reimbursed or
resolved, such as through the obligor becoming current on payments, or being reimbursed at the
time the loan was liquidated. Since this information is likely readily available to issuers, we
believe the cost to provide this data should be low.
We have omitted from the final requirements, as a commenter recommended, proposed
data points that would have required the disclosure of the amount of various expenses advanced
and reimbursed, such as property inspection expenses, insurance premiums, attorney fees and
property taxes paid for liquidated loans. Since the asset-level reporting requirements do not
require that advances be reported in this fashion at each reporting period, we are uncertain at this
time whether this level of granularity about outstanding advances at loan liquidation would be
beneficial to investors. In general, we believe these expenses are captured by other data points
that detail reimbursements at loan liquidation for advances of taxes and insurance and corporate
expenses. 393

393

See new Items 1(t)(1)(iii) Servicer advanced amounts reimbursed – principal; 1(t)(1)(iv) Servicer advanced
amounts reimbursed – interest; 1(t)(1)(v) Servicer advanced amount reimbursed – taxes and insurance; and
1(t)(1)(vi) Servicer advanced amount reimbursed – corporate of Schedule AL.

141

Information about Modified Loans
We proposed a group of data points that would capture information about modified loans.
The responses to this group of data points would provide data about whether a loan has been
modified, the modification terms and the loan characteristics that were modified. We received
comments suggesting we add 394 or delete 395 data points from this group of data points, and
comments suggesting we revise certain data points within this group. 396 A commenter suggested
adding a requirement for data that details the number of modification requests that are granted
and denied and the average time that elapses between a borrower’s request for a loan
modification and a determination of that application. 397 The commenter also requested
disclosure of the number and percentage of modified loans which have re-defaulted.
We are adopting most of this group of proposed data points, 398 as well as additional data
points, mainly based on comments received to provide further transparency around
modifications, including any change in loan characteristics or other loan features. 399 For
instance, the final requirements include, in addition to the proposed data points, data points that

398

We are not adopting certain items related to a modification that would be captured elsewhere in the
requirements, such as information on servicer advances. See, e.g., proposed Items 2(e)(44) through
2(e)(46) of Schedule L-D.

capture information about step provisions, 400 the actual and scheduled ending balances of the
total debt owed, 401 the date a trial modification was violated, 402 and the interest rate and
amortization type after modification. 403 For loans that remain an adjustable rate mortgage after a
modification, additional data points capture information, such as the index look-back, the postmodification initial interest rate, the maximum amount a rate can increase or decrease and
information about negative amortization caps. 404 We did not add, as a commenter suggested,
requirements about the number of modification requests received, the average time that elapses
between a borrower’s request for a loan modification and when a determination is made, or the
number and percentage of modified loans which have re-defaulted. 405 We are not persuaded
these disclosures would provide a clear benefit to investors, especially in light of the costs issuers

include some data points beyond those proposed or those that commenters suggested be added. These
additional data points were added to make the required disclosure about modified ARM loans consistent
with the required disclosure about original ARM loans. See new Items 1(m)(21)(ii) Post-modification

would incur to provide such information.
Most Recent Loan Modification Event Type
We also proposed a data point as part of the ongoing disclosure requirements that would
require the issuer to specify, if the loan has been modified, the code that describes the type of
action that has modified the loan terms. 406 The proposed codes were: 1=capitalization-fees or
interest have been capitalized into the unpaid principal balance; 2=change of payment frequency;
3=construction to permanent; and 4=other. One commenter requested we delete this data point
because the coded list only describes a subset of possible loan modifications and the type of
modification can be determined based on a comparison of pre-modification and postmodification characteristics. 407 Another commenter recommended we expand the coded list to
add forgiveness of principal, rate reductions, maturity extensions and forgiveness of interest to
the list of possible responses. 408
We are adopting this data point because we believe this disclosure will allow investors to
focus on what terms may have changed due to a modification, which should allow investors to
quickly assess whether changes in the terms of an asset will affect future cash flows or the risk
profile of the asset pool. 409 We added, as a commenter recommended, additional codes to the

409

See new Item 1(m)(1) Most recent loan modification event type of Schedule AL.

144

coded list. 410 We also note that a loan may go through several loan modifications. Therefore,
we revised the data point to clarify that information about the most recent loan modification is
required each time the disclosure is filed. 411
Effective Date of the Most Recent Loan Modification
We proposed a data point titled “Loan modification effective date,” which is the date on
which the most recent modification of the loan has gone into effect. A commenter suggested
omitting this data point from the RMBS requirements because loan modifications are effective
on the mortgage loan’s next due date after entry. 412 While we acknowledge that may be current
practice, we are adopting this data point as we are mindful that other practices regarding loan
modifications may develop. Further, since responses to this data point will be provided on an
ongoing basis after a loan is modified, we believe this date will provide a clear indication about
the length of time that has passed since the loan was last modified. We are adopting this data
point with a revision to clarify that only information about the most recent loan modification is
required because, as noted above, a loan may go through several modifications. 413

410

The coded list was revised to also include the following possible responses: 4=forgiveness of principal,
5=rate reductions, 6=maturity extensions and 7=forgiveness of interest. If, however, the type of action that
has modified the loan terms is not identified in the list of possible responses, the issuer should select the
code “other” and we encourage the issuer to provide explanatory language in an Asset Related Document.
See Section III.B.4 Asset Related Documents for a discussion on providing additional explanatory
disclosure about the asset-level disclosures.

411

Because asset-level data will be provided monthly, investors will be able to track previous loan
modifications.

Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities

Between Schedule L and Schedule L-D, we proposed 108 data points that relate
specifically to CMBS. The data points we proposed to require in Schedule L and Schedule L-D
were primarily based on the data template included in the CREFC Investor Reporting Package
(“CREFC IRP”), current Regulation AB requirements, and staff review of current disclosure.
We did not propose, however, to include every piece of information exactly as specified in the
CREFC IRP for two reasons. First, some of the disclosures required by the CREFC IRP would
have already been captured by proposed data points in the Item 1 General Requirements, and we
believed that those data points would apply to all types of ABS. Second, we did not believe the
level of detail in the CREFC IRP was necessary for investor analysis because we believed that
the most important data for CMBS is data that relates to the loan term and the property.
The response to the proposal indicated a general preference for CREFC IRP in lieu of the
proposed requirements. 414 The preference applied to both information in the prospectus and

414

See, e.g., letters from ABA I (suggesting that we conform Schedule L data points to IRP standards and the
Schedules L and L-D standards should be a “guideline” and that the “traditional standards of materiality”
should be the overriding factor in determining the appropriateness of the disclosure in the offering
document), BoA I (suggesting that we require asset-level disclosure generally, but allow the industry to set
the requirements for disclosure in the prospectus because requiring a separate Schedule L would be
repetitive of the relevant information already provided in CREFC’s Annex A), CREFC I (suggesting that
we conform proposed Schedule L asset-level data disclosure to the then-current “Annex A” data points
formulated by the CREFC “Annex A” Committee and/or consider that the Schedule L filing requirement be
satisfied if the issuer files a Schedule L with the data points identical to the then-current form of “Annex A”
adopted by CREFC), CREFC III, MBA I (suggesting that to the extent we believe more standardized
terminology and a defined core of shared data points for Schedule L would be benefit investors, that we
adopt the core disclosures in the current industry Annex A schedules and leverage the definitions already
provided in CREFC’s IRP), MBA IV, and Wells Fargo I (suggesting that proposed Schedule L asset-level
data disclosure conform to the then-current “Annex A” data points contained in CREFC’s IRP).

ongoing reporting. 415 For asset-level reporting at the time of securitization, commenters seemed
to favor initial reporting schedules commonly attached by issuers to the prospectus (typically
referred to as Annex A) that frequently contain asset-level data based on the specific types of
commercial mortgages in the transaction. Some of these commenters suggested that the
proposed requirements would duplicate the data provided in the Annex A schedules provided
with the prospectus 416 and the existence of duplicative data may confuse investors. 417 One
commenter, who supported requiring Annex A in lieu of the proposed Schedule L disclosures,
suggested that Schedule L does not reflect the practices that CMBS market participants have
developed to provide “CMBS investors with clear, timely and useful disclosure specifically
tailored for use by those investors.” 418 Finally, one investor believed it is reasonable to require
the disclosures because much of the same information is currently provided in Annex A of the
offering documents. 419 The investor suggested, however, that additional disclosure items to
improve current industry disclosure practices, such as requiring disclosure of actual versus
underwritten property performance metrics, including disclosure of the same performance
metrics for the preceding three years, complete tenant information versus top three tenant

information, rent rolls, full indebtedness information for each property and standardized tenant
and borrower information.
For ongoing reporting, commenters indicated a preference for previously established
industry standards in lieu of the proposal for several reasons. 420 For instance, one commenter
was concerned that requiring data points unrelated to CMBS, such as those found in the general
requirements, would cause undue programming burdens without a material benefit to
investors. 421 Another commenter stated that “IRP guidelines identify which data points are
restricted (i.e., only available to certain users), while the SEC data filings to be contained in
Schedule L-D would be public information.” 422 The commenter then stated that publicly
disclosing certain sensitive information could put the underlying properties at a competitive
disadvantage, which could negatively influence the securities. Other commenters also believed
that proprietary information should be considered sensitive information, and therefore CMBS
issuers should not be required to publicly disclose such information on EDGAR. 423 Commenters
also noted that based on current requirements, investors would receive CREFC IRP disclosures

420

See letters from CREFC I (suggesting that we tailor Schedule L-D to take into consideration the data
already captured by the IRP), CREFC III, CoStar, MBA I, MBA IV, MetLife I, and Wells Fargo I
(suggesting that all of the data captured by Schedule L-D is either captured by the IRP or is not applicable
to CMBS with the exception of only two data points, which they indicated would be added to what is
captured by the IRP).

421

See letter from CREFC I.

422

See letter from Wells Fargo I.

423

See letters from CREFC III (stating that “the CRE Finance Council’s member constituencies, including
investment-grade investors, believe that most – if not all – of the information on Schedule L and Schedule
L-D should be considered sensitive, and therefore should continue to be hosted on the issuer’s (or trustee’s
or third-party’s) website”), MBA IV, and SFIG II.

148

15 days prior to the required filing date of the Schedule L-D disclosure. 424 One of these
commenters also stated that CMBS transactions often involve multiple loans with different
financial reporting dates, and the information has to be reviewed by the appropriate parties, and
therefore, any particular reporting date may not reflect information for the current reporting
period. 425 One investor suggested, in lieu of adopting our ongoing disclosure proposal, that we
require disclosure of complete rent rolls at least once per year, the alternatives evaluated with
respect to modifications, all terms related to a modification or assumption and that we require the
format of the industry reporting standard to be in XML. 426
After considering the comments we received, we are adopting a requirement that issuers
of CMBS provide the disclosures contained under Item 2 of Schedule AL. We believe that
investors and market participants should have access to information to assess the credit quality of
the assets underlying a securitization transaction at inception and over the life of a security.
While we recognize the current market practice is to include provisions in CMBS transactions
that provide investors with asset-level data for each pool asset, we note that this market practice
is not a mandatory requirement and is subject to change. As such, we believe the asset-level
disclosure requirements that we are adopting will require a minimum level of standardized assetlevel disclosures in the prospectus and over the life of a security regardless of market practices.
We acknowledge commenters’ concerns that requiring asset-level disclosures that deviate from

149

the data template in the CREFC IRP may raise costs for both issuers and investors because users
are accustomed to working with the CREFC IRP data templates. We also understand that
investors are involved in the ongoing development of the CREFC IRP. For these reasons, we
made efforts to align our requirements, as much as possible, with pre-established industry codes,
titles and definitions to allow for the comparability of future offerings with past offerings and to
minimize the burden and cost of reporting similar information in different formats.
The requirements that we are adopting contain several revisions from the proposal aimed
at aligning our standards with the CREFC IRP. We reconsidered and are not adopting some data
points that do not correspond to the CREFC IRP or are typically disclosed in Annex A because
they are no longer necessary due to other changes we made, such as aggregating Schedules L and
L-D, or because we are adding data points based on the CREFC IRP to capture the same or
similar information. 427 Some data points that we are adopting, however, do not correspond
exactly to data captured by the CREFC IRP, but we believe the responses to these data points
will improve or clarify the requirements, or aid an investor’s ability to make an investment
decision. 428 We are also adding some data points that correspond to data captured by the

CREFC IRP based on comments received, because the responses to these data points clarify
other data points or they add more granularity to the data captured by other data points. 429 In
total, the proposal for CMBS included a total of 182 data points between the proposed general
item requirements of Schedules L and L-D and the data points specific to CMBS in proposed
Schedules L and L-D. Based on the changes described above, the final requirements include 152
data points.
Finally, we are adjusting the codes, titles, and definitions of many of the data points to
make them largely comparable to the data definitions set in the CREFC IRP. 430 We believe that
through these changes and by making the asset-level data requirements for CMBS largely align
with the CREFC IRP many of the disclosures provided under the CREFC IRP can be used to
provide the required disclosures. As a result, we believe we have mitigated, to a great extent,

cost and burden concerns expressed by commenters and the concern that CMBS investors will
not be able to compare the data with the data from past deals.
We also considered concerns raised by commenters as well as alternatives to the final
rules. For instance, one commenter suggested that the proposed ongoing reporting requirement
would add no value to investors since the industry standard is to make ongoing asset-level
disclosures available earlier than when the proposal would require them. 431 We are not
persuaded by this comment. We believe that many transaction agreements, while they provide
investors with access to asset-level disclosures on an ongoing basis, they do not guarantee that
these disclosures will remain available or continue. We believe that requiring asset-level
disclosures, which to a large extent aligns with how data is currently provided to investors, to be
filed on EDGAR will preserve the information and result in greater transparency in the CMBS
market.
We also considered the concerns raised by some commenters about requiring disclosure
of proprietary information due to the sensitive nature of the entire data set. 432 While we
acknowledge this concern, we believe that information about the underlying properties, including
information about the borrowers, will provide CMBS investors and potential investors with
information they need to perform due diligence and make informed investment decisions and

data points that should be revised or eliminated to help address potential competitive harm.

152

therefore should be disclosed. We also note that some of the asset-level data that we are
adopting is available to the public, for a fee, through third-party data providers. 433
We considered, as an alternative to the final rules, that issuers provide standardized assetlevel disclosures based solely on an industry standard, such as the CREFC IRP. We are not
persuaded that this alternative is appropriate because as market practices evolve the consistency
of the data provided by each transaction may differ since there is no mandatory requirement that
all transactions provide the same type of data. Therefore, we believe adopting a standardized set
of asset-level disclosures helps ensure that investors and other market participants will always
have access to a minimum set of asset-level disclosures, both at the time of the offering and on
an ongoing basis. While we have tailored the asset-level disclosure requirements for each asset
class, we also understand from comments received that certain commercial mortgages in a pool
may have unique features and that the standardized set of requirements may not capture all of the
unique attributes of a particular asset or pool due to the various types of commercial
properties. 434 Although we are not adopting all of the data points in the CREFC IRP, CMBS
issuers may provide those data points as additional asset-level disclosures in an Asset Related
Document, as appropriate. 435
With respect to ongoing reporting, we are not adopting a commenter’s suggestion that
disclosures about alternatives evaluated related to a modification or disclosure of all terms

related to a modification or assumption be provided. We believe this information would be
difficult to capture in a standardized way, and we are uncertain, at this time, whether this
information is best captured within these particular asset-level requirements. We are adopting as
proposed, with revisions to address comments received, expanded disclosures about tenants. We
discuss the comments received on tenant disclosures below. We are also requiring that assetlevel disclosures be provided in XML. We discuss the requirement that asset-level disclosures
be provided in XML in Section III.B.3 XML and the Asset Data File.
Tenant Disclosures
We proposed data points about the three largest tenants (based on square feet), including
square feet leased by the tenant and lease expiration dates of the tenant. Several commenters
suggested that we expand the scope of these disclosures. 436 For instance, one commenter, an
investor, suggested the initial reporting requirements include a requirement to capture rent roll
information (i.e., detailed schedules of lease payments for each tenant over time) and additional
tenant and operating performance information, full indebtedness information and a way to
identify borrowers and tenants. 437 This commenter also suggested that we require full rent rolls

436

See letters from CMBS.com I, CoStar, MetLife I, and Realpoint LLC dated Aug. 2, 2010 submitted in
response to the 2010 ABS Proposing Release (“Realpoint”).

437

See letter from MetLife I (suggesting that we also require: (1) a minimum 3-year history of operating
performance for each underwriting performance metric such as NOI, NCF, etc.; (2) complete tenant
information versus providing information on just the top three tenants; (3) rent rolls for every property
detailing lease terms for every tenant; (4) full indebtedness information for each property and terms for any
other debt that is serviced with the cash flows from the property regardless of the ranking of such other debt
in relation to the securitized debt and the conditions under which borrowers are permitted under the
transactions documents to place additional debt on the same property in the future; and (5) a practical way
to quickly identify borrowers and tenants, perhaps through a standardized convention to allow investors to

for every property in a transaction at least once per year. Other commenters also supported
requiring full rent roll and tenant information. 438
We are adopting as proposed data points about the three largest tenants (based on square
feet), including square feet leased by the tenant and lease expiration dates of the tenant. 439 While
some commenters requested several changes to the tenant disclosures for CMBS, the consensus
among commenters was that rent roll information for each property supporting the mortgages
underlying the CMBS was needed. We are not adopting a requirement within the asset-level
requirements to require rent roll information at this time because it is not clear how to
standardize detailed schedules of lease payments for each tenant over time on an asset-level
basis, and we did not receive comment suggesting how this could be done.

Realpoint (suggesting that we require similar information).
438

See letters from CoStar (suggesting that we require disclosures of the full rent roll rather than just the
largest three tenants and that these disclosures should include: (1) tenant name (unless a residential
property); (2) tenant business line; (3) lease start date; (4) lease amount including any concessions or
associated expenses such as tenant improvements; (5) expense sharing arrangements; (6) co-tenancy
clauses; and (7) lease renewal options), CMBS.com I, and Realpoint (suggesting that we require disclosure
of either the entire rent roll, or at least the largest tenants and all other tenants with lease expiration dates
that occur within five years of the cut-off date, and that these disclosures should include: (1) base rent; (2)
pass-through expense reimbursements (taxes, insurance, repairs, maintenance, utilities and other operating
expenses); and (3) capital improvement reimbursements because these disclosures would permit them to
conduct testing of gross rents, net operating income, net cash flow, debt service coverage ratio and other
financial metrics).

Valuations
Proposed Schedule L and Schedule L-D both included data points aimed at capturing
valuation information on the properties underlying the commercial mortgages. 440 The valuation
data points contained in Schedule L would provide disclosure of the most recent property
valuation as of the measurement date in the prospectus. The valuation data points contained in
Schedule L-D would require the most recent property valuation available as of the reporting
period that the Schedule L-D covered. One commenter suggested that the final rule should
capture data on periodic updating and monitoring of commercial real estate assets because
periodic (annual) appraisal and evaluation “updates” of commercial real estate are commonly
performed. 441
We are adopting, with some revisions, data points that capture the most recent appraisals
or valuations available at the time of the securitization and on an ongoing basis. 442 While the
information required by these data points is substantially similar to information captured by the
CREFC IRP, the data points that we are adopting specifically require, in line with revisions made
to RMBS property valuation data points, disclosure of any valuation “obtained by or for any
transaction party or its affiliates.” The reference to “obtained by or for any transaction party or
its affiliates” contained in each definition should be construed broadly to include, but not be
limited to, valuations obtained as part of any due diligence conducted by credit rating agencies,

underwriters or others parties to the transaction. We are also adopting data points that identify
the source of the property valuation and the date of the valuation. 443 These data points do not
require that originators, sponsors or transaction parties obtain updated valuations. Instead, this
requirement is meant to capture valuations conducted subsequent to the original valuation for
whatever reason, such as updated valuations obtained in the normal course of their business or
because other circumstances require an updated valuation. We believe providing investors
updated valuation information will allow them to understand changes in the value of collateral
that is meant to protect against losses. Furthermore, since we are requiring issuers to disclose the
information only if it is already available to them, we believe that the disclosures will not be
unduly burdensome.

Automobile Loan or Lease ABS

Between Schedule L and Schedule L-D, we proposed 110 data points that relate to ABS
backed by auto loans and 116 data points that relate to ABS backed by auto leases. These
proposed data points were comprised of a combination of data points, some of which were
proposed to apply to all asset types and others which were proposed to apply only to auto loans
or auto leases. The proposed data points were derived from the aggregate pool-level disclosure
that has been commonly provided in Auto ABS prospectuses. The proposal also included data
points related to obligor and co-obligor income, assets, employment and credit scores.

443

See Items 2(d)(15) Valuation source at securitization, 2(d)(16) Valuation date at securitization, 2(d)(18)
Most recent valuation date, and 2(d)(19) Most recent valuation source of Schedule AL.

157

For Auto ABS, support for the proposal varied between issuers and investors. Many
investors supported the asset-level model with certain modifications from the proposal. 444
Investor commenters stated that “the provision of loan-level data will strengthen the Auto ABS
market and make it more resilient over the long term.” 445 We note, however, that even the
investors that support asset-level disclosure have suggested various modifications and limitations
to address issues such as privacy and competitive concerns. One investor commenter
acknowledged that the incremental benefit of some proposed fields may be difficult to justify as
compared to the costs of providing such information. 446 In light of standard industry practices
and issuer concerns about costs and the disclosure of proprietary information, investor
commenters recommended adopting fewer data points than were originally proposed. 447
Issuers typically commented that asset-level reporting was not necessary for Auto ABS
because they claimed that the Auto ABS market continues to be robust and active despite no
material changes to disclosure practices. 448 One group of issuers also raised concerns that assetlevel data requirements would push certain investors 449 and issuers 450 out of the Auto ABS

ABS) and Capital One II (noting that they invest in more senior tranches of Auto ABS and recommending

market. They were also concerned that the auto industry could be affected if Auto ABS sponsors
have to pass increased costs to automobile purchasers because Auto ABS sponsors are unable to
access more cost-effective financing through the Auto ABS market. 451 These issuer commenters
noted that several Auto ABS sponsors estimated the costs and employee hours necessary to
reprogram systems and business procedures to capture, track and report all of the items for auto
loans currently set forth in the proposal. The average cost estimated by those sponsors was
approximately $2 million, and the average number of employee hours was approximately
12,000. 452 This group of issuer commenters also argued that Congress never intended to require
asset-level data for Auto ABS by pointing to a Senate report published three months prior to the
adoption of the Dodd-Frank Act. 453 One trade association commented that such requirements
were not necessary for Auto ABS because “most investors have been able to adequately

they would be at an informational and analytic disadvantage to other investors or because they believe they
have a potential risk of liability to their own investors for not being able to utilize all the available data in
their analysis”).
450

See letter from VABSS IV (stating that they “believe that loan-level disclosure requirements could act as a
barrier to entry for smaller finance companies that may not have the necessary systems, personnel or
resources to capture, track and report loan-level data, thus discouraging the entry of new issuers into the
Auto ABS market…[and] that these sponsors that are unable to access the Auto ABS markets due to
concerns about loan-level disclosure could be placed at a competitive disadvantage to banks and more
highly-rated sponsors that are able to either comply with loan-level disclosure or access other less
burdensome sources of funding (e.g., bank deposits)”).

See letter from VABSS III (quoting a portion of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs’
discussion of Section 942 of the Dodd-Frank Act in Senate Report No. 111-176: “The Committee does not
expect that disclosure of data about individual borrowers would be required in cases such as securitizations
of credit card or automobile loans or leases, where asset pools typically include many thousands of credit
agreements, where individual loan data would not be useful to investors, and where disclosure might raise
privacy concerns”).

159

underwrite auto loan transactions – including during the economic downturn – on the basis of
current disclosure, due to the conservative nature of the structure, the deleveraging and
granularity of the underlying assets, and their understanding of the issuer’s servicing
capabilities.” 454 One group of issuer commenters noted possible re-identification risks. 455 These
same commenters also expressed concern about the potential release of proprietary
information. 456
Issuer commenters generally noted that, if any data reporting was to be required,
alternative models such as grouped account data, more robust pool-level reporting or some
combination of the two would be sufficient. 457

Several commenters argued that alternatives

such as grouped account data or expanded pool stratification would provide additional
meaningful information to investors while at the same time addressing individual privacy
concerns and proprietary concerns. 458 One group of issuer commenters suggested we consider
conditioning the provision of asset-level reporting to compliance with potential risk retention

publicly available could harm them in the marketplace).

data is in many ways more difficult, as it required more time and resources to gather the loan-level data and

rules. 459 These commenters also stated that certain data points are often the same for all assets in
an Auto ABS. 460 They suggested that, if we adopt asset-level reporting for Auto ABS such data
points should not be required if (1) the responses would be identical for each asset in the pool 461
and (2) adequate pool-level disclosure is given in the prospectus. In response to the 2014 ReOpening Release, some commenters expressed opposition to asset-level requirements for Auto
ABS. 462
As we developed the standards we are adopting today, we took into consideration how
the proposed data points relate to how information is collected, tracked and reported in the Auto
ABS marketplace, as well as how auto loans and leases differ from RMBS and CMBS, and how
those differences impact the type of information available for collection and the utility of such
information to investors. We also considered potential impacts on the automobile industry if
Auto ABS sponsors pass down higher financing costs to consumers. After considering the

See letter from VABSS IV (suggesting that we consider “an outright exemption from all loan-level data
requirements for any Auto ABS sponsor that satisfies the final risk retention requirements adopted by the
Commission” or, at the very least, “an exemption for Auto ABS sponsors who retain a horizontal or firstloss position as required by the final risk retention requirements given the direct alignment of interests of
sponsors, servicers and investors in Auto ABS and the absorption of all possible losses on these structures
by the horizontal ‘slice’ retained by the sponsor”).

460

See letter from VABSS IV.

461

These commenters also suggested that a response to a data point may be omitted if no more than 1% of the
securitized pool would have a different response. See letter from VABSS IV.

462

See, e.g., letters from AFSA II (opposing requirements for Auto ABS for several reasons including its
belief that the Auto ABS market is liquid, many proposed data points would not apply to Auto ABS and for
proprietary concerns), Capital One II (opposing requirements for Auto ABS by suggesting that asset-level
data is not necessary for investor due diligence, and also noting that the benefits for Auto ABS do not
outweigh the costs), SFIG II (noting auto loan ABS has not traditionally included asset-level disclosures),
and Wells Fargo III (suggesting that asset-level data for Auto ABS would provide little to no incremental
value to investors).

161

comments received, we are adopting, as proposed, with some modification to individual data
points and some reduction in the amount of data required to be provided, asset-level disclosures
specific to Auto ABS. We did consider, as an alternative, whether asset-level reporting should
be required in Auto ABS at all. We considered the legislative history of Section 942 of the
Dodd-Frank Act, which was cited by commenters. 463 We also considered whether an alternative
reporting model, such as grouped account data, pool stratifications or some combination of the
two, would provide adequate information to investors. In the end, we concluded that none of
these alternatives provide the benefits that we believe investors should receive. We agreed with
investors that “[g]rouped data is preset, which prohibits a customizable analysis of pool
information by an investor and presupposes that critical credit metrics and indicators do not
change over time…[while] the transparency afforded by loan-level data will allow all investors
to evaluate, in any market and on an independent basis, whether the pools and structures are
robust and the ratings assigned are appropriate.” 464 We also do not agree that Auto ABS
sponsors should be exempt from providing asset-level data if that sponsor has retained a certain
amount of risk. As stated in Section II.A Economic Motivations, while we expect risk retention
rules will result in better underwriting practices, we believe that more is needed to fully restore
incentive alignment and credit screening in the securitization market. If sponsors are exempt

463

We note that we first proposed asset-level disclosure requirements for Auto ABS prior to the enactment of
the Dodd-Frank Act. While we believe the asset-level disclosure requirements being adopted today are
consistent with the mandate in Section 7(c) of the Securities Act, as added by Section 942 of the DoddFrank Act, we do not view that mandate as limiting our long standing authority to prescribe disclosure
standards, as necessary and appropriate, for purposes of federal securities laws.

464

See letter from ASF II (expressed views of loan-level investors only).

162

from asset-level disclosure based on compliance with risk retention requirements, investors and
market participants would have fewer Auto ABS pools available for asset-level
comparisons. Finally, we are not making any data points optional on the basis that such data
point may be the same across an Auto ABS pool. While we understand that commenters
intended to consolidate repetitive data points, we believe that the asset-level presentation of data
in a standardized format is an important tool to investors who want to make asset-to-asset
comparisons across different Auto ABS pools. If responses to certain data points are omitted, an
investor wanting to make pool-to-pool comparisons would first have to locate the omitted
information in one or more prospectuses and then recreate portions of the asset-level data files
before accurate comparisons could be made.
We believe that the requirements we are adopting for Auto ABS will provide a better
picture of the composition and characteristics of the pool assets, which is critical to an investor’s
ability to make an informed investment decision about the securities. We have considered
commenters’ concerns that Auto ABS is, in many ways, different from RMBS and CMBS,
including that Auto ABS generally fared better during the recent financial crisis. We do not
believe, however, that the grouped account data model proposed by commenters would provide
information in sufficient detail for investors to compare and evaluate various Auto ABS pools
and structures. With asset-level data, users would not have to rely on pre-determined groupings

163

of information, and instead would be able to compare and evaluate the underlying assets using
the individual pieces of information they consider to be material. 465
While we are requiring that Auto ABS issuers provide asset-level data, we have
significantly reduced the scope of the asset-level data required from the amount proposed. In
doing so, we considered an estimate provided by several Auto ABS sponsors that, if we only
adopted the data points proposed in their comment letter, 466 the average costs and employee
hours necessary to reprogram systems and otherwise comply with the asset-level disclosures
would be approximately $750,000 and 3,500, respectively. 467 In line with this suggestion, we
have attempted to reduce burden and cost concerns by reducing the scope of the asset-level data
required to align with the smaller scope of information that commenters, including investors,
believed should be required for Auto ABS. While the final rules do not exactly mirror the scope
of information the group of Auto ABS sponsors suggested be required, we believe that the
significantly smaller scope of information we are requiring, coupled with revisions to align the
data points with current industry standards should lead to substantially lower costs versus what
was originally proposed. These substantially lower costs should also reduce any potential impact
on the automobile industry. We also believe that the smaller scope of information and the

465

Id. See also letter from Prudential I.

466

See letter from VABSS IV. For ABS backed by auto loans, these commenters proposed that 29 data points
should be adopted unconditionally (i.e., for each asset regardless of the response or the structure of the
transaction) and 28 data points be adopted conditionally (i.e., they may be omitted if certain conditions are
met, such as homogenous responses). For ABS backed by auto leases, these commenters proposed that 30
data points should be adopted unconditionally and 26 data points be adopted conditionally.

467

The estimate of $750,000 and 3,500 hours is in contrast to this commenter’s estimate of $2 million and
12,000 hours for all of the Auto ABS data points as originally proposed.

164

revisions we made to the data points still provide investors with sufficient information to
evaluate the security. Under the final requirements we are adopting, issuers are required to
disclose the information described in Item 3, with respect to auto loans, and Item 4, with respect
to auto leases, of Schedule AL for each auto loan or lease in the pool, as applicable. As noted
above, we proposed 110 data points that relate to ABS backed by auto loans and 116 data points
that relate to ABS backed by auto leases. In addition to the data points that were eliminated
when Schedules L and L-D were condensed, 468 40 of the proposed data points for auto loans are
not being adopted and 57 of the proposed data points for auto leases are not being adopted. We
are adopting 12 new data points for auto loans and 15 new data points for auto leases. 469
Accordingly, the final rules will require issuers to provide 72 data points for ABS backed by auto
loans and 66 data points for ABS backed by auto leases. Fewer data points should reduce the
cost of providing asset-level data for Auto ABS issuers and also should help to address
individual privacy concerns. 470 We also believe that this reduction in scope should help address
competitive concerns that were raised by issuers. While we acknowledge that some competitive
concerns may still exist, we believe that the information we are requiring about the underlying
assets will provide Auto ABS investors and potential investors with information they need to
perform due diligence and make informed investment decisions and therefore should be

468

When the Schedules L and L-D were condensed (as discussed in Section III.B.2 The Scope of New
Schedule AL), we eliminated 10 repetitive data points for ABS backed by auto loans and 8 repetitive data
points for ABS backed by auto leases.

disclosed. We also note that some of the asset-level data that we are adopting is available to the
public, for a fee, through third-party data providers. 471
We are not adopting a significant number of data points where we agreed with
commenters that the data point was not applicable to Auto ABS or where we are concerned that
the benefits investors may receive from the disclosures may not justify the potential costs and
burdens to issuers to provide the disclosures. 472 Solely with respect to ABS backed by auto
leases, we are also not adopting several data points that were part of the general schedule of data
points proposed for all asset classes because the information required to be provided in the items
is not something that is relevant for auto leases (for example, items that require issuers to provide
interest, principal or amortization information would not be relevant because auto leases do not
have amortization, interest, interest rates or principal balances). 473

471

See letter from VABSS II (stating that there are relatively inexpensive databases containing car owner
information linked to vehicle make, model, year, and more). New and used vehicle values can also be
obtained for free via publicly available sources. See, e.g., www.kbb.com.

472

For all Auto ABS, these include the following Schedule L data points: Item 1(a)(3) Asset group number;
Item 1(a)(9) Original amortization term; Item 1(b)(6) Number of days payment is past due; Item 1(b)(7)
Current payment status; Items 4(b)(1) and 5(b)(1) Geographic location of dealer; Items 4(c)(13) and
5(c)(13) – Length of employment: obligor; and Items 4(c)(11) and 5(c)(11) Obligor asset verification. And
the following Schedule L-D data points: Item 1(c) Asset group number; Item 1(f)(8) Current scheduled
asset balance; Item 1(f)(13) – Number of days payment is past due; Item 1(f)(14) Current payment status;
Item 1(f)(15) Pay history; Item 1(f)(16) Next due date; Item 1(g)(5) Cumulative outstanding advance
amount; Item 1(g)(7) Stop principal and interest advance date; Item 1(j) Liquidated indicator; Item 1(k)
Charge-off indicator; Item 1(k)(2) Charged-off interest amount; Item 1(l)(1) Paid-in-full indicator; Item
1(l)(2)(i) Pledged prepayment penalty paid; Item 1(l)(2)(ii) Pledged prepayment penalty waived; and Item
1(l)(2)(iii) Reason for not collecting pledge prepayment penalty.

473

For ABS backed by auto leases, these include the following additional Schedule L data points: Item
1(a)(11) Interest type; Item 1(a)(12) Amortization type; Item 1(a)(13) Original interest only term; and Item
1(b)(3) Current interest rate. And the following Schedule L-D data points: Item 1(f)(2) Actual interest
paid; Item 1(f)(3) Actual principal paid; Item 1(f)(4) Actual other amounts paid; Item 1(f)(17) Next interest
rate; and Item 1(k)(1) Charged-off principal.

166

As with RMBS and CMBS, we believe that, unless the individual data points are
standardized across all issuers of Auto ABS, the utility of asset-level data is generally limited.
While commenters have pointed out several areas where there is a difference between how we
have proposed that data be presented and how information is generally collected in Auto ABS, 474
we are unaware of any publicly available investor reporting data standards for Auto ABS. We
also received many comments directed at individual data points, many of which were seeking
changes to the format of the information, the range of possible responses for a particular data
point, or the data point’s title or definition. Some commenters also made suggestions on how we
could make the data point better align with common business practices. Accordingly, we
considered each of these comments, and we made changes that we believe improve or clarify the
disclosure, mitigate cost concerns, and/or implement industry standards when doing so would not
materially diminish the value of the disclosures to investors. We discuss below the significant
comments we received about individual data points along with the revisions we have made in
response to those comments.
Information About the Obligors
We proposed a group of asset-level data points that would provide data about an obligor’s
credit quality. 475 This group of data points was intended to capture information about the
obligor(s) income, debt, employment, credit score and assets. In light of privacy concerns, the
proposal proposed ranges, or categories of coded responses instead of requiring disclosure of an

exact credit score, income or amount of assets in order to prevent the identification of specific
information about an individual. We discuss below the significant comments we received about
this group of data points and the revisions we have made in response to those comments.
Obligor Income and Payment-to-Income Ratio
We proposed ten obligor income data points (five for auto loans and five for auto leases)
that would require issuers to provide responses to various data points that relate to the obligor’s
income. 476 Several commenters suggested that these proposed obligor income data points be
replaced with a new payment-to-income ratio data point, where the issuer would specify the code
indicating the scheduled monthly payment amount as a percentage of the total monthly income
of all obligors at the origination date while providing its methodology for determining monthly
income in the prospectus. 477 We agree that the new payment-to-income ratio data point provides
investors with sufficient information about the obligor’s income, and accordingly, we are not
adopting any of the ten proposed obligor income data points and instead are adopting the new
payment-to-income ratio data point proposed by commenters. 478

Obligor Income and Employment Verification
We proposed data points that would require issuers to indicate the codes describing the
extent to which the obligor’s income and employment have been verified. 479 One group of issuer
commenters stated that it is standard industry practice for obligors to self-report income and
employment on the credit application and this information is only verified for the riskiest
customers, but then went on to say that Auto ABS sponsors do not systematically capture this
information in their origination files, and if they do, they do not keep it for more than 90 days. 480
We cannot reconcile these two comments. If most income and employment information is selfreported on the credit application, then that information should be captured in the loan file.
Furthermore, if it is standard industry practice to not verify the self-reported information except
for the riskiest customers, we assume that such verification is part of the loan or lease approval
process that goes to the creditworthiness of the obligor or lessee. These same commenters also
argued that obligor income and employment verification data points would only provide
marginal additional value if other data points, such as obligor FICO score, payment-to-income
ratio and LTV ratio, were provided. Investor commenters stated that obligor income and

169

employment verification data points would provide valuable information. 481 Accordingly, we
are adopting these data points substantially as proposed. 482
Co-Obligor Items
We proposed a total of eighteen co-obligor data points (nine for auto loans and nine for
auto leases) that would require issuers to provide information about co-obligors such as credit
score data 483 and data about income, employment and assets used for qualification purposes. 484
Several commenters suggested that all eighteen of the proposed co-obligor data points be deleted
as they are not particularly relevant to the analysis of Auto ABS 485 and that providing all of these
co-obligor data points is not warranted given the additional time and expense associated with
gathering the information. 486 These commenters suggested that the proposed co-obligor data
points be replaced with a data point that would indicate whether the loan or lease has a coobligor. 487 A group of commenters representing Auto ABS investors commented that it is
sufficient to note the presence of a co-obligor, which would indicate that the primary obligor was

not creditworthy enough to sustain the loan or lease on its own. 488 We agree, and we are not
adopting any of the eighteen proposed co-obligor data points and instead are adopting only the
co-obligor (or co-lessee, as applicable) present indicator data point suggested by commenters. 489
Information About Terms of the Loan or Lease and Payment Activity
We proposed a group of data points that would capture information related to the terms of
the loan or lease and payment activity, such as original and current loan or lease terms, interest
rates, prepayments, interest paid-through dates and servicer advances. Taken together, the
responses to these data points would provide insight into how the loan or lease has performed
versus how it was intended to perform when originated. Commenters’ response to this group of
data points varied, with some commenters suggesting that some data points in this group were
unnecessary or redundant and others advising that these data points provide valuable information
about the loan or lease. We discuss below the significant comments we received about this
group of data points and the revisions we have made to data points within this group.
Original and Current Terms and Initial Grace Periods
We proposed data points that would require issuers to indicate original and current loan
terms in months. 490 One group of issuer commenters noted that, for marketing reasons, auto
loans and leases are occasionally offered with first payment dates that are deferred for up to 90

days, during which time interest or financing fees accrue but no payments are due. 491 These
commenters proposed that these items should be reported to reflect the number of scheduled
payments due or remaining (converting non-monthly pay loans to monthly pay) to clearly
indicate the payments on the loan in order to avoid odd month terms. 492 We believe it is
important for investors to be provided the actual number of months in the term, even if such
number includes a grace period where no payments are being made. We agree with commenters,
however, that any grace period should be accounted for. Therefore, in addition to adopting the
original and current term data points (with minor revisions for timing clarifications, as detailed in
other sections of this release), we are also adopting a new initial grace period data point, which
requires the issuer to indicate the number of months during which interest accrues but no
payments are due from the obligor (or, for auto leases, the number of months during the term of
the lease for which financing fees are calculated but no payments are due from the lessee). 493 If
there is no initial grace period for an auto loan or lease, the response to this new data point would
be zero.
Original Interest Rate
We proposed a data point that would require issuers to provide the rate of interest at the
time of origination. 494 One group of issuer commenters believed that this item is generally not

readily available or easily trackable by Auto ABS sponsors because it is industry practice to
track only the current interest rate on auto loans. 495 Although we understand that there may be
some costs to the sponsor or issuer associated with tracking the original interest rate, we believe
it is important for investors to be able to compare the current interest rate to the original interest
rate and we note that any costs associated with tracking the original interest rate would be onetime costs, as the response to this data point would be static. Therefore, we are adopting the
original interest rate data point for ABS backed by auto loans substantially as proposed, with
minor clarifying modifications as described elsewhere in this release. 496 Because auto leases do
not have interest rates in the same manner as auto loans, we are not adopting this data point for
ABS backed by auto leases.
Scheduled Payments and Actual Amounts Collected
We proposed data points that would require issuers to provide the principal and interest
payments that were scheduled to be collected for the reporting period 497 and provide any
unscheduled principal or interest adjustments during the reporting period. 498 We also proposed
data points that would require issuers to indicate actual amounts collected during the reporting
period. 499 As suggested by commenters, we are not adopting data points that separate interest

and principal payment streams for ABS backed by auto leases. 500 Instead, for ABS backed by
auto leases, we are adopting one data point that will capture the payment amount that was
scheduled to be collected for the reporting period and another requiring issuers to provide the
total of any other amounts collected during the reporting period. 501 With respect to ABS backed
by auto loans, a group of issuer commenters stated that the scheduled payment data points are
not relevant because auto loans are simple interest loans which have no scheduled principal or
interest payment amounts and are not subject to principal or interest adjustments. 502 These same
commenters stated that data points relating to actual amounts collected should only be required
to be disclosed if a transaction is structured with separate interest and principal waterfalls or
separate allocations of other amounts paid to the investors. 503 One investor commenter asked
that both the scheduled payment and actual amounts collected data points be included for ABS
backed by auto loans. 504 We believe that the scheduled interest amount, scheduled principal
amount and other principal adjustments data points provide valuable information about payments
that are expected to be received, and we are adopting these data points as proposed. The
scheduled interest amount and scheduled principal amount data points will require the issuer to
provide the amount of interest and principal, respectively, that were due to be paid during the
reporting period, which will show quantitatively how far in advance a loan was paid or how far

behind the obligor is in making payments. 505 The other principal adjustments data point would
show the amount of any adjustments that are made to the principal balance of the loan, including
but not limited to prepayments. 506 We agree with the issuer commenters that the other interest
adjustment data point is unnecessary as interest adjustments would be reflected between
responses to the original interest rate data point and the current interest rate data point.
Accordingly, we are not adopting the other interest adjustment data point. We also believe that
the actual payments collected data points provide relevant information about how each asset is
performing, regardless of whether the transaction is structured with separate principal and
interest waterfalls or a single waterfall. Furthermore, only requiring that responses to these data
points be provided for transactions that have separate principal and interest waterfalls runs
counter to the goal of facilitating investors’ ability to compare the underlying asset-level data of
a particular asset pool with other pools. Therefore, we are adopting each of these proposed data
points for ABS backed by auto loans.
Prepayment and Interest Paid Through Date
One commenter suggested we add a new “voluntary prepayment” data point. 507 We
agree that an asset-level prepayment data point will provide valuable information to investors
about how prepayments will alter the timing of expected cash flows. Accordingly, we have
slightly modified this commenter’s suggestion for clarification purposes and to better coordinate

506

175

with other asset-level requirements. For ABS backed by auto loans, we are adopting an interest
paid through date data point that requires issuers to provide the date through which interest is
paid with the current payment, which is the effective date from which interest will be calculated
for the application of the next payment. 508 For ABS backed by auto leases, we are adopting a
similar data point which requires issuers to provide the date through which scheduled payments
have been made, which is the effective date from which amounts due will be calculated for the
application of the next payment. 509
Servicer Advanced Amount
We proposed a data point that would require issuers to specify the amount advanced by
the servicer during the reporting period (if any such amounts were advanced). 510 One group of
issuer commenters stated that this information was already provided under the proposed current
delinquency status data point. 511 We do not agree that the responses to these two data points
provide the same information, as servicing advances can be made if payment on a loan or lease is
less than 30 days late (depending on when payments to investors are due in relation to the due
date of the loan or lease payment). The current delinquency status data point only provides
information to investors after the loan or lease becomes more than 30 days delinquent.
Therefore, we are adopting the servicer advanced amount data point as proposed. 512

176

Modifications and Extensions
We proposed a data point that would require issuers to indicate whether an asset was
modified from its original terms during the reporting period. 513 A group of investor commenters
suggested that this data point be replaced with a new modification type data point. 514 As
suggested by commenters, the modification type data point would require issuers to indicate the
code that describes the reason for the modification and would only be required if the asset was
modified. 515 A group of issuer commenters suggested that the modification indicator data point
be replaced with a new payment extension data point. 516 The payment extension data point
would require issuers to indicate the number of months the loan was extended during the
reporting period and would only be required if the loan or lease was extended beyond its original
terms during the applicable reporting period. 517 Investor commenters also suggested that we
replace the proposed lease term extension indicator data point 518 with a lease extension data
point that would require the issuer to indicate whether the lease has been extended and would
capture any incremental lease payments to the trust. 519 We agree with the commenters that these

See letter from VABSS IV. This commenter opposed including the modification type data point suggested
by loan-level investors, stating that “[o]ther than payment extensions and term extensions, there simply are
not a material number of credit-related modifications to auto loans [and leases] where the auto loan [or
lease] is not required to be repurchased by the servicer and therefore remains in the Auto ABS transaction.”

177

new and modified items are both useful and applicable to Auto ABS. We believe that it is
important to include the proposed modification indicator data point so that investors can easily
confirm whether the loan was modified during the reporting period. We also believe that the
suggested modification type data point provides valuable information to investors based on the
concerns that were raised by issuer commenters. If, in fact, modifications other than payment
and term extensions are rare and usually lead to a repurchase, investors should be alerted to loans
or leases that have these rare modifications. Accordingly, we are adopting the proposed
modification indicator data point for all Auto ABS, as well as the modification type data point
and the payment extension data point for ABS backed by auto loans and the lease extension data
point for ABS backed by auto leases (rather than adopting the lease term extension indicator data
point as proposed). 520
Lease-Specific Data Points
We proposed several data points that only apply to ABS backed by auto leases that relate
to information such as residual values, termination, wear and tear, mileage, sale proceeds, and
extensions. 521 Commenters also pointed out several proposed data points in the general item
requirements that were not applicable to ABS backed by auto leases. For instance, a group of
issuer commenters noted that the securitization value, which is widely used in the lease
securitization industry, is the correct valuation of the size of the lease. 522 The same group of

178

commenters also suggested that the proposed original asset amount data point 523 be revised to an
acquisition cost data point that requires the issuer to provide the original acquisition cost of the
lease. 524 We agree with both comments, so we are adopting the securitization value and
securitization value discount rate data points, 525 rather than the asset balance data points, 526 and
are adopting the acquisition cost data point 527 rather than the proposed original asset amount data
point.
With respect to the residual value of the lease, we proposed several data points that
require the issuer to provide the base and updated residual values of the vehicle and provide the
source of such residual values. 528 Both issuer and investor commenters agreed that the base
residual value data point should be adopted (although one group of issuer commenters suggested
that the data point be amended to capture “the securitized residual value of the leased vehicle, as
determined by the sponsor and described in the prospectus”). 529 Investor commenters also stated
that it is important for the issuer to disclose how the base residual value is calculated. 530 One
group of issuer commenters stated that neither the updated residual value nor the source of the
updated residual value data points should be adopted because the Auto ABS structure for leases

is set up based on an original residual value that does not change, that it is enhanced to withstand
residual losses and any gains just benefit investors while the costs and burdens to provide this
information would be high. 531 While investor commenters did not specifically comment on
either the updated residual value or the source of the updated residual value data points, they did
request that we adopt a contractual residual value data point, as it would be valuable in
determining the likelihood that the lessee will purchase the vehicle at the end of the lease or turn
it back in. 532 Issuer commenters noted that the contractual residual value data point suggested by
investor commenters is not as relevant as the base residual value or securitization residual
value. 533 We agree with investors that the base residual value data point, the source of the base
residual value data point and the contractual residual value data point each provide different and
valuable information about a lease. Therefore, we are adopting the base residual value and
source of base residual value data points as proposed as well as the new contractual residual
value data point as suggested by investor commenters. 534 We are not adopting the proposed
updated residual value data point or the source of updated residual value data point as these data
points do not provide enough additional beneficial information to investors to justify the
additional costs that would be imposed upon issuers.

Debt Security ABS

We proposed that issuers of debt security ABS provide responses to the general data
points enumerated in Item 1 of Schedule L and the nine data points specific to debt security
ABS. 535 The comment we received on the proposal suggested that we require the disclosure of
the CUSIP number, ISIN number, or other industry standard identifier of the debt security. 536
As noted above, under the final rule we are integrating the general item requirements into
the requirements for each asset type. Therefore, under the final rule, issuers of debt security
ABS are only required to provide the asset-level disclosures required under new Item 5 Debt
Securities. After integrating the proposed general data points, the final requirements for debt
security ABS have been reduced from 83 possible proposed data points to 60 data points.
Also, in response to comments received, we have revised the asset number data point to
require a standard industry identifier assigned to the security be provided for each security, if
such number is available. Public access to the responses to these data points and to the responses
to other data points that require disclosure of the SEC file number and Central Index Key
(“CIK”) number for the debt security will provide investors, including secondary market

535

The asset-level requirements for debt security ABS were proposed under the title “corporate debt.” ABS
backed by corporate debt securities are typically issued in smaller denominations than the underlying
security and the ABS are typically registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act for trading on an
exchange. Additionally, a pool and servicing agreement may also permit a servicer or trustee to invest cash
collection in corporate debt instruments which may be securities under the Securities Act. An asset pool of
an issuing entity includes all other instruments provided as credit enhancement or which support the
underlying assets of the pool. If those instruments are securities under the Securities Act, the offering must
be registered or exempt from registration if the instruments are included in the asset pool as provided in
Securities Act Rule 190, regardless of their concentration in the pool. See Securities Act Rule 190(a) and
(b). See also Section III.A.6.a of the 2004 ABS Adopting Release.

536

See letter from SIFMA I.

181

investors, access to more information about each debt security in the pool. As proposed, the
final rules will require that issuers provide more standardized information to investors about the
debt securities underlying the ABS. The disclosures we are adopting today require the title of
the underlying security, origination date, the minimum denomination of the underlying security,
the currency of the underlying security, the trustee, whether the security is callable, the
frequency of payments that will be made on the security and whether an underlying security or
agreement is interest bearing along with other basic characteristics of the debt securities. At a
minimum, these asset-level disclosures will provide investors with the basic characteristics of the
underlying debt securities in a standardized format.
Public availability of all of the asset-level information we are requiring to be disclosed
regarding debt security ABS should reduce the burden on investors, including secondary market
investors, to obtain this information, which should reduce investors’ costs of conducting their
own independent analysis and, thereby, reduce their need to rely on credit ratings. In addition,
we believe that having an issuer collect and report asset-level information will improve
efficiency, since a single entity, as opposed to multiple investors, will incur the information
gathering costs.
We recognize that although investors will benefit from receiving these asset-level
disclosures, issuers will face an increase in information gathering and reporting costs, including
costs related to system re-programming and technological investment. We recognize that the
costs registrants may face will depend on the extent to which the information required to be
disclosed is already available to issuers or will have to be newly collected, as well as the extent
to which the information is already being disclosed to investors in some transactions. Although
182

we are unable to estimate the magnitude of these costs with any precision, we believe the costs
registrants will incur to provide the data should be nominal since the data that is required should
already be readily available to registrants, especially since the asset-level disclosures required
primarily relate to the performance of the security and the basic characteristics of the security,
such as the title of the security, payment frequency, or whether it is callable. A description of
each data point required for debt security ABS is provided in Item 5 of Schedule AL.
(5)

Resecuritizations

In a resecuritization, the asset pool is comprised of one or more ABS. We proposed that
issuers of a resecuritization provide, at the time of the offering and on an ongoing basis, assetlevel data for each ABS in the pool and for each asset underlying each ABS in the pool. Under
the proposal, resecuritizations would provide the same data as required for debt security ABS for
each ABS in the asset pool. In addition, issuers would provide asset-level data for the assets
underlying each ABS in the asset pool in accordance with the asset-level disclosure applicable to
that particular asset class.
We received several comments that expressed concern about the proposal. Some
commenters expressed concern over the cost and burden to provide the asset-level disclosures for
the assets underlying the securities in comparison to what they believed to be a limited benefit. 537

537

See, e.g., letters from MBA I (stating that asset-level data about the underlying ABS would not be useful
because only certain classes of an ABS are resecuritized, and the loans backing a particular class are
typically supported by the underlying loan pool and do not correlate to specific classes of ABS) and Wells
Fargo I (suggesting that the asset-level data required for a resecuritization would be of little benefit to
investors in cases where a resecuritization involved a mixture of bonds because investors would have to
understand the payment structure of each underlying ABS and the effort involved in doing this would likely

183

One of these commenters was concerned about securities law liability for the asset-level
disclosures of the assets underlying the securities. 538 Other commenters were concerned that
asset-level data may not be available for the assets underlying an ABS that was originated prior
to the compliance date of the rule. 539 Finally, to address some of these concerns, some
commenters suggested exemptions from the asset-level disclosure requirements for some
resecuritizations. 540
After considering the comments received, we are adopting the proposal with revisions.
For each registered resecuritization, issuers must provide, at the time of the offering and on an
ongoing basis for each ABS in the asset pool, the same disclosures that are required for debt
security ABS. Therefore, information about the security, such as the title of the security,
payment frequency, whether it is callable, the name of the trustee and the underlying SEC file

be prohibitive for most investors in such cases). See also SIFMA I (expressing concerns about the cost to
provide the information without providing their own cost estimate).
538

See letter from Wells Fargo I (suggesting that with respect to the proposed ongoing disclosure requirements
that subjecting the issuer, underwriter or any other resecuritization transaction party to securities law
liability for such information is not appropriate because (i) such information has already been filed, subject
to securities law liability, with respect to the underlying transactions, and (ii) there is no practical way for
the resecuritization parties to do the due diligence with respect to the underlying filings that would need to
be done to accept securities law liability for them).

539

See, e.g., letters from ABA I, ASF I, BoA I, J.P. Morgan I, MBA I (with respect to RMBS), and SIFMA I.
See also letter from Citi (indicating that issuers will often be unable to meet the disclosure requirements
because they generally do not have access to the underlying asset-level files).

540

See letters from SIFMA I (suggesting an exemption from the proposed asset-level disclosures requirements
for (1) resecuritizations with “seasoned” pool assets or (2) resecuritizations where the underlying securities
fall below some percentage of the asset pool (e.g., 10 percent as supported by the dealers and sponsor
members or “a substantially lower percentage” as supported by the investor members)) and Wells Fargo I
(suggesting an exemption from the proposed asset-level disclosures requirements for “all bonds that are resecuritized that are from transactions which closed prior to the effective date of Regulation AB” because a
failure to do so “would eliminate the availability of re-securitizations as an important tool for investors to
prudently restructure or de-risk legacy positions” and it “could impair the value of such positions due to the
resultant illiquidity”).

number and CIK number is required. 541 If a resecuritization consists of securities where we have
adopted asset-level disclosure requirements (i.e., RMBS, CMBS, or Auto ABS), then a second
tier of asset-level information is required. The second tier of asset-level disclosure is about the
assets (such as each mortgage, loan or lease) underlying the ABS being resecuritized. For
instance, in an offering where the asset pool includes RMBS, then the data points in Item 5 of
Schedule AL would be required for every RMBS security in the asset pool, as well as the data
points in Item 1 for each loan underlying each RMBS security. Accordingly, if asset-level
disclosures are not required for a particular asset type, then an issuer is only required to provide
the debt security ABS disclosures for each ABS in the underlying asset pool.
We are adopting an exemption from the new requirement to provide asset-level
disclosure about the underlying ABS if the underlying ABS was issued prior to the compliance
date for the asset-level disclosure requirements. We noted concerns about the cost to provide the
disclosures, whether the information would be available, securities law liability for information
provided by third parties and the other concerns raised by commenters. We acknowledge that
investors will not have access to asset-level data for the resecuritized ABS for some period of
time. We do not believe that providing this exemption would negatively affect investors because
the resecuritization will still be subject to existing disclosure requirements, including pool-level
disclosure requirements and the exemption will be limited over time by the underlying ABS
becoming subject to the asset-level disclosure requirements. We also note that there have been

541

See Section III.A.2.b)(4) Debt Security ABS.

185

no registered resecuritization offerings in the last few years. Further, as noted above, existing
Securities Act Rule 190 requires that all information about the underlying ABS be disclosed in
accordance with our registration rules and forms. 542 Therefore, if the underlying ABS was
issued prior to the compliance date for the asset-level disclosure requirements, investors in a
resecuritization will receive updated and current information about pool data, static pool, risk
factors, performance information, how the underlying securities were acquired, and whether and
when the underlying securities experienced any trigger events or rating downgrades.
The final requirement to provide asset-level data in the prospectus and in periodic reports
will require that issuers provide more information to investors about resecuritizations than
previously required. The asset-level disclosures about the ABS in the asset pool will provide
investors, at a minimum, with the basic characteristics of a resecuritization. Further, by requiring
disclosure of the SEC file number and CIK number for ABS being resecuritized, it will be easier
for investors to locate more information about each resecuritized ABS. Public access to such
information, including, when applicable, access to information about the assets underlying the
ABS being resecuritized, should reduce investors’ burden to obtain this information, and reduce
their need to rely on credit ratings because investors will have access to the information in order
to conduct their own independent analysis. In turn, this will allow for a more effective and
efficient analysis of the offering and should help foster more efficient capital formation.

542

See Securities Act Rule 190. See also Section III.A.6.a of the 2004 ABS Adopting Release.

186

We do not agree with a commenter’s view that there is a limited correlation between loan
performance and bond performance and, as a result, there is little benefit from investors
receiving asset-level data about the assets underlying the ABS being resecuritized. Specifically,
the commenter believed that the asset-level data about the underlying ABS would not be useful
because only certain classes of an ABS are resecuritized, and the loans backing a particular class
are typically supported by the entire underlying loan pool, and therefore do not correlate to any
specific classes of ABS. We disagree and believe that to determine the performance of any
particular resecuritization, an understanding of each loan in the underlying loan pool is necessary
in order to analyze how the underlying loans impact the cash flows to the resecuritization.
In addition, with respect to the availability of information, Section 942(a) of the DoddFrank Act eliminated the automatic suspension of the duty to file under Section 15(d) of the
Exchange Act for ABS issuers and granted the Commission the authority to issue rules providing
for the suspension or termination of such duty. 543 As a result, ABS issuers with Exchange Act
Section 15(d) reporting obligations will be required to report asset-level information, thereby
easing concerns that the asset-level information for residential mortgages, commercial
mortgages, auto loans, auto leases, or debt securities underlying the ABS in the resecuritization
would not be available on an ongoing basis.
With respect to the cost and burden to provide the disclosures and concerns about
securities law liability for information obtained from third parties, we believe the existing ability

543

See Suspension of the Duty to File Reports for Classes of Asset-Backed Securities Under Section 15(d) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Release No. 34-65148 (Aug. 17, 2011) [76 FR 52549].

187

to reference third party information, in part, addresses these concerns. As is the case today,
issuers may satisfy their disclosure requirements by referencing third-party reports if certain
conditions are met. 544 New Forms SF-1 and SF-3 require that the asset-level information be filed
on Form ABS-EE and incorporated into the prospectus. 545 Similarly, revised Form 10-D
requires incorporation by reference to Form ABS-EE. 546 If the underlying ABS is of a thirdparty, we will permit issuers to reference the third-party’s filings of asset-level data provided that
they otherwise meet the existing third-party referencing conditions. Consequently, reports of all
third parties, not only those that are significant obligors, may be referenced. Because issuers are
not incorporating third-party filings by reference, but instead merely referencing these filings, we
believe we have addressed concerns about issuers’ filing burdens and securities law liability for
asset-level information filed by third parties.
While some commenters raised concerns about the cost to implement such requirements,
commenters did not provide any quantitative cost estimates to comply with this requirement.
Implementation of this requirement, even if a registrant can reference third-party filings, will
require system re-programming and technological investment. In addition, registrants will incur
a nominal cost to provide data about the securities being resecuritized. In general, the data about

544

See Item 1100(c)(2) of Regulation AB [17 CFR 229.1100(c)(2)]. In many instances, the issuer of the ABS
being resecuritized would be considered a significant obligor as defined in Item 1101(k) of Regulation AB.
If so, issuers may reference information about the significant obligors located in third-party reports as set
forth in Item 1100(c)(2).

545

See Section III.B.5 New Form ABS-EE, General Instruction IV and Item 10 of Form SF-1 and General
Instruction IV and Item 10 of Form SF-3.

546

See Item 1A of Form 10-D.

188

the securities, which track the debt security ABS requirements, should include data already
readily available to issuers, especially since the requirements primarily include basic
characteristics of the security, such as the title of the security, payment frequency, and whether it
is callable. Registrants will incur a nominal cost to provide this data in the format requested. If
asset-level data is required for the assets underlying the securities being resecuritized, registrants
will, to the extent they cannot otherwise incorporate by reference or reference third-party filings,
incur costs to obtain the data required about the assets underlying the securities being
resecuritized or to convert data available to them into the required format. These costs were
discussed earlier in the release in the context of complying with asset-level disclosure for RMBS,
CMBS and Auto ABS. We believe such costs are appropriate because investors should receive
information about the securities that will allow them to conduct their own independent analysis.
In addition to the items noted above that mitigate cost concerns, we also believe the extended
timeframe for compliance of 24 months lowers the overall burden placed on registrants and
market participants and should provide ample time for registrants and market participants to
assess the availability of the asset-level information required for resecuritizations and to put the
information in the format required.

Asset-Level Data and Individual Privacy Concerns
a)

Proposed Rule

As we noted in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release and the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing
Release and as the staff noted in the 2014 Staff Memorandum, we are sensitive to the possibility
that certain asset-level disclosures may raise concerns about the underlying obligor’s personal
privacy. In particular, we noted that asset-level data points requiring disclosures about the
189

geographic location of the obligor or the collateralized property, credit scores, income and debt
may raise privacy concerns. We also noted, however, that information about credit scores,
employment status and income would permit investors to perform better risk and return analysis
of the underlying assets and therefore of the ABS.
In light of privacy concerns, we did not propose to require issuers to disclose an obligor’s
name, address or other identifying information, such as the zip code of the property. 547 We also
proposed ranges, or categories of coded responses, instead of requiring disclosure of an exact
credit score 548 or income or debt amounts in order to prevent the identification of specific
information about an individual. 549
The 2014 Staff Memorandum summarized the comments received related to potential
privacy concerns and outlined an approach to address these concerns that would require issuers
to make asset-level information available to investors and potential investors through an issuersponsored Web site rather than having issuers file on EDGAR and make all of the information,
including potentially sensitive information, publicly available. Under the Web site approach,
issuers could take steps to address potential privacy concerns associated with asset-level
disclosures, including through restricting Web site access to potentially sensitive information.

547

We proposed to require the broader geographic delineations of MSAs in lieu of the narrower geographic
delineation of zip codes.

548

For asset-level data points that require disclosure of obligor credit scores, we proposed coded responses
that represent ranges of credit scores (e.g., 500-549, 550-599, etc.). The ranges were based on the ranges
that some issuers used in pool-level disclosure.

549

For monthly income and debt ranges, we developed the ranges based on a review of statistical reporting by
other governmental agencies (e.g., $1,000-$1,499, $1500-$1,999, etc.). See the 2010 ABS Proposing
Release at 23357.

190

The Web site approach also would require issuers to file a copy of the information disclosed on a
Web site with the Commission in a non-public filing to preserve the information and to enable
the Commission to have a record of all asset-level information provided to investors. The
prospectus would need to disclose the Web site address for the information, and the issuer would
have to incorporate the Web site information by reference into the prospectus. In addition,
issuers would be required to file asset-level information that does not raise potential privacy
concerns on EDGAR in order to provide the public with access to some asset-level information.
b)

Comments on Proposed Rule

In response to the 2010 ABS Proposal, several commenters noted that the asset-level
requirements would raise privacy concerns. 550 These commenters suggested that, while the
proposed asset-level disclosures would not include direct identifiers, if the responses to certain
asset-level data requirements are combined with other publicly available sources of information
about consumers it could permit the identity of obligors in ABS pools to be uncovered or “reidentified.” 551 A number of commenters noted that, if an obligor was identified through this

550

See, e.g., letters from ABA I, CU, MBA I (suggesting that the use of Metropolitan Statistical Areas or
Divisions in lieu of zip code would not mask the location of particular properties), VABSS I, and WPF I
(also suggesting that the proposed asset-level disclosures would not mask the location of particular
properties and additionally that they may provide information useful in the re-identification process). In
general, these commenters were concerned that it may be possible to identify an individual obligor by
matching asset-level data about the underlying property or asset with data available through other public or
private sources about assets and their owners.

551

See, e.g., letter from WPF I (suggesting that attempts to mask the location of particular properties and the
identity of borrowers are not workable because there is too much information about mortgages available
that would allow the location of a particular property to be found).

191

process, then the obligor’s personal financial status could be determined. 552 The commenters
noted that if obligors are re-identified, then information about an obligor’s credit score, monthly
income and monthly debt would be available to the general public through the EDGAR filing.
Commenters also noted that if personal information was linked to an individual through the
asset-level disclosures this may conflict with 553 or undermine 554 the consumer privacy
protections provided by federal and foreign laws restricting the release of individual information
and increase the potential for identity theft and fraud. 555
Most commenters did not support the use of coded ranges, noting it would not address
privacy concerns 556 and would not further the Commission’s objective of improving disclosure
for ABS investors. Two commenters noted that using coded ranges would not mitigate privacy

553

See, e.g., letters from ABA I (stating that the asset-level disclosures would potentially result in release to
the public of detailed non-public personal financial information (as defined in Title V of the Gramm-LeachBliley Act (“GLBA”)) as well as consumer report information (as defined in FCRA), CDIA (suggesting
that certain data may fall under the protections of FCRA, GLBA, or both), Epicurus, TYI (suggesting that if
the disclosures could be used to identify a borrower in a European-based ABS, this may violate European
privacy laws), and WPF I.

554

See letter from WPF I (suggesting that if data that may fall under the scope of FCRA is posted on EDGAR
and subsequently linked to an individual, the data may become public and, therefore, the transfer of this
information to others may contravene FCRA restrictions).

555

See letters from CDIA, VABSS II, and WPF I (suggesting that the cost of identity theft would not only fall
on borrowers, but also on asset holders and, therefore, investors would demand higher returns to protect
against those losses).

556

But see letters from CDIA (noting that the proposed ranges or categories may provide some privacy
protection) and ASF II (expressed views of loan-level investors only) (suggesting the use of range-based
reporting for certain credit sensitive fields may also provide a solution to privacy concerns).

192

concerns because the ranges are so narrowly defined they would identify the actual score or
dollar amount of income. 557 Other commenters believed that the use of ranges for disclosures,
such as credit scores and income, or requiring a broader geographic identifier for the property,
such as MSAs, would greatly reduce the utility of the information. 558 Commenters also noted
that disclosure of data that relates to the credit risk of the obligor, such as an obligor’s exact
credit score, income, or employment history, would strengthen investors’ risk analysis of ABS
involving consumer assets. 559 Commenters also suggested that exact income and credit scores
are necessary to appropriately price the securities 560 and verify issuer disclosures. 561
We received few suggestions for alternative approaches to balancing individual privacy
concerns and the needs of investors to have access to detailed financial information about
obligors. Commenters suggested we work with other federal agencies to evaluate whether the
proposed asset-level information was in fact anonymized 562 and to assess whether the required

be a step back in terms of transparency), Interactive (noting that asset-level granularity is essential for

ranges of FICO score bands are not sufficient to appreciate the linkages between collateral characteristics),
and Wells Fargo I (expressing concern that restricting information available to investors could result in
substantially lower pricing for new residential mortgage backed securities offerings). See also SIFMA I

asset-level disclosures would subject issuers to liability under the federal privacy laws. 563 Many
commenters that supported grouped-account disclosures rather than asset-level disclosures
indicated that grouped disclosures also could address privacy concerns with asset-level
disclosures. 564 Other commenters suggested addressing privacy concerns by changing the
disclosure format, such as by requiring that disclosure be presented in ratios rather than dollar
amounts, 565 requiring a default propensity percentage in lieu of a credit score, 566 or only
requiring narrative disclosure. 567
We also received suggestions that we should restrict access to or impose conditions on
the use of sensitive data. For instance, a commenter suggested that we establish a central
“registration system” where access to sensitive data is only made to persons who have
independently established their identities as investors, rating agencies, data providers, investment
banks or other categories of users while forbidding others to use the data or include the data in
commercially distributed databases. 568 Another commenter suggested that the Commission
consider restricting access to registered users who acknowledge the potentially sensitive nature

of the data and agree to maintain its confidentiality. 569 This commenter suggested that requiring
users to identify themselves and accept appropriate terms of use would provide a deterrent to
those who might attempt to abuse personal financial data and permit identification of such users
should any abuse occur. Another commenter suggested establishing rules applicable to the
posting, use and dissemination of potentially sensitive data disclosed on EDGAR, including
penalties for violation of the rules. 570
In light of the comments received raising individual privacy concerns and the
requirements of new Section 7(c) of the Securities Act, we requested additional comment on
privacy generally in the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release. 571 We received limited additional
feedback on how to address the potential privacy issues surrounding the proposed asset-level
disclosures. Commenters again stated that the asset-level requirements, as proposed, would raise
privacy concerns. 572 One commenter suggested that the Commission could address privacy
concerns by not requiring the disclosure of social security numbers, only requiring MSA

569

See letter from CDIA.

570

See letter from Epicurus.

571

For instance, we asked how asset-level data could be required, both initially and on an ongoing basis, to
implement Section 7(c) effectively, while also addressing privacy concerns. We asked which particular
data elements could be revised or eliminated for each particular asset class in a manner that would address
privacy concerns, while still enabling an investor to independently perform due diligence. We also
requested comment on whether it would be appropriate to require issuers to provide an obligor’s credit
score and income on a grouped basis in a format similar to the proposal for credit cards in the 2010 ABS
Proposing Release.

572

See, e.g., letter from Mortgage Bankers Association dated Oct. 4, 2011 submitted in response to the 2011
ABS Re-Proposing Release (“MBA III”) (reiterating that several of the data points proposed could allow
someone to identify the obligor and that “the income and credit score ranges do not mitigate privacy issues
because the suggested ranges are so narrowly defined that they virtually identify the actual score or dollar
amount of income”).

195

information about the property instead of a property’s full address, and replacing borrower name
with an ID number. 573 Other commenters stated or reiterated that for some asset classes a
grouped-account or pool-level disclosure format may mitigate privacy concerns. 574 One
commenter repeated the suggestions that it provided in previous comment letters that the
Commission could establish and manage (or have a third-party manage) a central “registration
system” that could provide restricted access. 575
On February 25, 2014, we re-opened the comment period to permit interested persons to
comment on the Web site approach described in the 2014 Staff Memorandum. Only a few
commenters indicated support for the Web site approach. 576 Most commenters generally

See letter from MetLife II.

574

See letters from Sallie Mae, Inc. (SLM Corporation) dated Oct. 4, 2011 submitted in response to the 2011
ABS Re-Proposing Release (“Sallie Mae II”) (suggesting that “data presented on a grouped basis should
address all privacy concerns”), VABSS III (again suggesting that a grouped data approach minimizes, but
does not eliminate, privacy concerns), and VABSS IV (stating that they believe a grouped data approach is
the best way to provide additional information to investors while addressing obligor privacy and
competitive concerns).

575

See letters from VABSS III (suggesting that it would not be an “overwhelming process to establish and
maintain a restricted-access system” and that Section 7(c) does not require that data that raises privacy
concerns be made publicly available) and VABSS IV.

576

See letters from AFR (noting the advantages of the Web site approach include the disclosure of more
granular data and the ability to restrict the data to those who agree to accept legal liability for privacy
violations), CII (stating, however, that the restrictions placed on accessing the Web site should not be any
more restrictive than user accounts and confidentiality agreements and that issuers should provide, instead
of coded ranges, specific credit scores, income, and debt), A. Schwartz (stating that the Web site approach
places the liability for errors in the asset-level data on issuers and preserves the privacy interests of
borrowers), and World Privacy Forum dated Apr. 18, 2014 submitted in response to the 2014 Re-Opening
Release (“WPF II”) (suggesting, however, that the Commission rather than issuers be responsible for
maintaining the data).

196

opposed the Web site approach as a means to address privacy concerns, 577 and some commenters
also noted that the Web site approach creates or shifts legal and reputational risks to issuers. 578
Commenters expressed concern about whether the Web site approach could result in issuer
liability under applicable privacy laws. 579 Several commenters were specifically concerned that
the Web site approach might create a risk that the issuer could be considered a “consumer
reporting agency” under the FCRA and thus subject to its rules and regulations. 580 One
commenter noted that the FCRA would not be relevant most of the time because the type of
information contemplated by the Web site approach would be beyond the reach of the FCRA
while also noting that privacy laws do not protect most consumer data, including the proposed
asset-level data, regardless of how it may be disseminated. 581 A number of commenters
requested that the Commission obtain an authoritative interpretation or some other form of

subject to restrictions under state laws), SIFMA/FSR I-dealers and sponsors, and Wells Fargo III. See also

guidance from the CFPB to clarify issuer liability under the privacy laws when an issuer
provides asset-level data before moving forward. 582 A few commenters suggested that under the
Web site approach data could still be widely distributed, 583 and two commenters stated that
taking steps to reduce the ability to re-identify a person would be more appropriate than limiting
access to sensitive data. 584 Some other general concerns about the Web site approach included:
the costs and burdens of the Web site approach; 585 the possibility of data breaches and the
impacts from data breaches; 586 potential negative market impacts; 587 and the possibility that

information incident to the transfer of an asset in a securitization and stating that while it strongly believed
that an issuer would not become a consumer reporting agency under FCRA by disclosing asset-level
information, the CFPB needs to provide a rule or authoritative interpretation that the data posted in
accordance with the Web site approach would not be a consumer report and that the issuer would not
become a consumer reporting agency). See also letter from CCMR (requesting that the Commission, CFPB
and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) provide assurance that misuse of disclosures made under the Web

acknowledging that similar risks exist in the Rule 144A market).

198

inconsistencies in technical standards between Web sites may make the Web sites difficult to
use. 588
Some commenters disagreed with the description in the 2014 Staff Memorandum of how
issuer Web sites were being used at the time the 2014 Staff Memorandum was released. 589 For
instance, one commenter noted that while Web sites were being used at that time to provide
information to investors, the information is not the same as what the Commission had proposed
to require and does not raise the same privacy concerns. 590 Another commenter noted that
current disclosure of asset-level information through Web sites is available only to a limited
number of known institutional investors. 591
Several commenters stated that additional information was necessary to fully assess the
potential implications of the Web site approach. For instance, commenters requested clarity on
the scope of asset-level disclosures that the Commission is considering adopting, what data
would be disclosed on EDGAR and on the Web site, what type of restrictions on access would be
reasonable and what information is “necessary” for investor due diligence. 592 Another

Proposals remain under consideration), SIFMA/FSR I-dealers and sponsors (requesting clarity on whether
any of the asset-level data may be considered “material” under the securities laws and whether disclosure
of asset-level data as proposed complies with privacy laws), and Wells Fargo III (requesting clarification of
which data points would require specific values in order to evaluate privacy issues).

commenter sought information about whether the Commission is still considering asset-level
disclosures for certain non-RMBS asset classes. 593 Five commenters urged the Commission to
re-open the 2010 ABS Proposal and the 2011 ABS Re-Proposal, in general, to permit further
consideration of the concerns surrounding asset-level disclosures. 594
A number of commenters responded to the 2014 Re-Opening Release by commenting
generally on privacy concerns. Several commenters reiterated the re-identification concerns that
were raised in response to the 2010 ABS Proposing Release and the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing
Release. 595 Commenters again suggested that obligors may suffer harm if personal data is used
to re-identify them. 596 Several commenters noted that the asset-level requirements, as proposed
in 2010, contain a variety of highly sensitive personal information that consumers would not
expect to be available to the general public, such as information about debt, income,
bankruptcies, foreclosures, job losses, and even whether the consumer has experienced marital
difficulties. 597 One commenter raised particular concern with disclosure of actual income as

such data is highly desirable to the consumer data industry but hard to obtain. 598 One commenter
requested that the Commission provide assurance that the data required to be filed on EDGAR
could not be reasonably linked to an individual consumer. 599 Some commenters expressed
concern that the proposed requirements could result in the disclosure of “Personally Identifiable
Information” or “PII,” which could result in legal liability or reputational damage. 600 In
addition, a few commenters identified various laws that may apply to the asset-level disclosures,
including non-privacy related laws. 601 Another commenter noted, however, that the availability
of potentially sensitive obligor data is not new to the market. 602 Another commenter believed
criminal actors would prefer to obtain access to other databases containing information more
conducive to identity theft, such as social security numbers and date of birth, neither of which
would be required by the Commission. 603

See letter from AFR. Despite its belief that the Web site approach would not create a new target for
criminal actors, AFR recommended that the Commission not adopt such an approach because: (i) issuers
could inappropriately discriminate in providing access to the restricted Web site; (ii) there is a potential that
not all issuers would have the technical capacity to implement appropriate privacy controls; and (iii) if the
design of the data is left to issuers, standardization of the data format would not be possible, making it more
difficult to use.

201

Many commenters expressed particular concern with the disclosure of a property’s
geographic location because it, along with other data points, can be used with other public
databases to match a property with a specific borrower. 604 Commenters’ recommendations to
revise the geographic data point varied. One commenter recommended that the Commission
limit disclosure of the zip code to only the first two digits. 605 Another commenter, without
providing a specific recommendation, believed that any geographic data point must be
sufficiently broad to ensure that there is no risk of re-identification. 606 One commenter reiterated
its support for aggregation of geographic location. 607 In contrast, another commenter noted its
opposition to the 2010 ABS Proposal to require only MSA because it would compromise the
utility of the data for investors. 608
Several commenters suggested various alternatives and modifications to the Web site
approach. Three commenters suggested aggregating the asset-level data. 609 These commenters,

however, did not specify what they meant by “aggregated.” 610 Another commenter suggested
development of a system that permits investors to conduct analysis and produce models without
providing access to asset-level information. 611 One commenter said the requirements should
mirror the disclosures that the GSEs make with respect to RMBS and that issuers should have the
discretion not to disclose sensitive information. 612 Others suggested that issuers should have the
flexibility to modify the disclosures and decide the method of delivery to address privacy
concerns. 613 Another commenter agreed that the better approach would be to modify the
disclosure requirements such that the data increases transparency while still respecting the
privacy of borrowers’ information, but did not specify how those disclosures should be made
available to investors. 614 Several commenters suggested that we adopt mechanisms or controls
to restrict access to asset-level information filed with the Commission to investors and potential
investors. 615

610

For example, they did not specify whether they were referring to pool-level data, grouped-account data
similar to the disclosures proposed for credit card ABS in the 2010 ABS Proposal, less granular loan-level
information or some other form of data aggregation.

the flexibility to determine the method of delivery of the disclosure) and SIFMA/FSR II-dealers and
sponsors (suggesting that issuers be allowed to withhold, aggregate, or otherwise modify the asset level
disclosures in order to comply with legal and regulatory obligations, reduce re-identification risk or

house the asset-level data because such an approach would simplify enforcement of access
policies, ensure consistent data formats and lower incentives to exclude certain users. 616
Similarly, another commenter suggested that issuers disclose all asset-level data to a consumer
reporting agency administered repository, along with a unique identification number for each
asset, which would allow investors to access all the asset-level data for these assets. 617 Another
commenter also suggested that credit bureaus, instead of issuers, should provide credit related
information. 618 One commenter outlined revisions to the Web site approach that it believed are
necessary if such an approach is adopted, including a data chain of custody, privacy and security
rules and public disclosure of each issuer’s privacy and security policies. 619

should have the option to use third party agents (which may be a consumer reporting agency or a central

approach still raises privacy law concerns and concerns about who pays for the third-party service).

After considering the comments received related to privacy concerns and on the Web site
approach, and our obligations under Section 7(c) of the Securities Act, 620 we are adopting new
rules to require that issuers file asset-level disclosures on EDGAR both at the time of the offering
and on an ongoing basis in periodic reports. We are revising the required disclosures contained
in the proposal to address the risk of parties being able to re-identify obligors and the associated
privacy concerns. Specifically, as discussed below, we are modifying or omitting certain assetlevel disclosures relating to RMBS and Auto ABS to reduce both the amount of potentially
sensitive data about the underlying obligors and the potential risk that the obligors could be reidentified. In addition, in response to commenters’ suggestions, we have sought and obtained
guidance from the CFPB on the application of the FCRA to the required disclosures. As
discussed below, the CFPB has issued a letter 621 to the Commission stating that the FCRA will
not apply to asset-level disclosures where the Commission determines that disclosure of certain
asset-level information is “necessary for investors to independently perform due diligence,” in
accordance with Section 7(c). We believe these steps implement the statutory mandate of
Section 7(c) and will provide investors with the asset-level information they need while reducing
concerns about potential re-identification risk associated with disclosing consumers’ personal
and financial information.

620

As noted above, Section 7(c) of the Securities Act requires that we adopt rules to require ABS issuers to
disclose asset-level information if the data is necessary for investors to independently perform due
diligence.

621

See letter from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau dated August 26, 2014.

205

While we have considered the Web site approach described in the 2014 Staff
Memorandum, as discussed below, we are not adopting this approach due to concerns about the
practical difficulties and unintended consequences of limiting access to only investors and
potential investors. 622 Commenters also indicated that the Web site approach could negatively
affect the ability of investors and the broader ABS market to have adequate access to the data. 623
We continue to believe that the disclosure of data that relates to the credit risk of the
obligor, such as an obligor’s credit score, income, or employment history, would strengthen
investors’ risk analysis of ABS involving consumer assets. 624 We believe these disclosures,
combined with other asset-level disclosures, such as the terms and performance of the underlying
loan and information about the property, will enable investors to conduct their own due diligence
for ABS involving consumer assets, and thus facilitate capital formation in the ABS market.
Consequently, it is critically important that the manner in which such information is
disseminated enables all investors to receive access to the required asset-level disclosures. The
ability of other market participants, such as analysts and academics, to access this information

622

See, e.g., letters from ABA III (noting concern that without guidance as to who is a potential investor
issuers may apply their own bias filters to public offerings, such as limiting public offerings to only
institutional investors), AFR (expressing concern that if issuers are given the ability to limit access to assetlevel data they may use this ability to discriminate between investors by, for example, giving investors with
more market power preferential access to the data), CCMR, MBA IV, and SFIG II.

623

See, e.g., letters from ABA III, Moody’s II, and R&R.

data about obligors, such as exact income and credit scores).

206

may also benefit the market by encouraging a broader range of commentary and analysis with
respect to ABS. 625
Although we did not propose to require that an obligor’s name, address, or other
identifying information be disclosed, we are sensitive to the possibility that an obligor in an asset
pool could be identified (now or in the future) due to the availability of the required disclosures
(coupled with the XML requirement), the amount of data about obligors that is publicly available
through other sources, and information about real estate transactions and other types of
transactions that is available or that may become available in the future. In the event the obligor
was re-identified, the information that would have been required by the proposal, even in ranges,
might reveal information about the obligor’s financial condition.
This issue is especially pronounced for securitizations backed by residential mortgages,
as an obligor could potentially be re-identified using a combination of asset-level disclosures and
real estate transaction data that is routinely disclosed by certain local governments. 626
Commenters noted that property address, sales price, and closing date are typically disclosed by
local governments and could be used to link the asset-level disclosures to an individual. 627 If a

625

See letters from ABA III, Moody’s I, Moody’s II, M. Joffe, and R&R.

626

These issues potentially exist but are less pronounced for Auto ABS. We are not aware of any public
databases of auto loan and lease records made available by local governments. It is possible that these
types of databases could be available from other sources for a fee. After the time of purchase, an obligor
may move and register the automobile in a different state. In contrast, the property that is collateral for a
mortgage is connected to a permanent address and therefore could be matched more easily with publicly
available information from land records.

207

specific mortgage is re-identified, sensitive financial data about an obligor (e.g., credit score,
DTI, and payment history) could potentially be connected to the obligor.
In light of this concern, we are revising the proposed data set for RMBS as follows. 628
First, we are modifying the required geographic identifier from MSA, as proposed, to a 2-digit
zip code. 629 Several commenters emphasized the importance of geography in assessing the reidentification risk for RMBS asset-level disclosure. 630 We believe that, because publicly
available information like property records is typically sorted and searchable by geography,
requiring issuers to identify assets by a broader geographic area should decrease the ability to reidentify individual obligors. In considering how to broaden the geographic area, we considered
both the specific recommendations of commenters as well as current disclosure practices,
including those of the GSEs and Ginnie Mae. 631 As noted above, one commenter specifically
recommended that we require disclosure of either a 2-digit or 3-digit zip code. 632 There are
currently less than 99 distinct 2-digit zip codes and approximately 900 distinct 3-digit zip

628

Although the changes discussed relate to RMBS data points ,we also indicate, where relevant,
corresponding changes we have made to the data points for Auto ABS that address privacy concerns.

629

See new Item 1(d)(1) of Schedule AL. For Auto ABS, at the suggestion of commenters, we are modifying
the geographic identifier of the obligor to state. See new Items 3(e)(7) and 4(e)(7). See also letters from
ASF II (expressed views of loan-level investors only) and VABSS IV. We are not adopting proposed data
points that would have disclosed the geographic location of the dealership. See proposed Items 4(b)(1) and
5(b)(1) of Schedule L.

codes. 633 By contrast, our proposal would have required disclosure of MSA, which represents
approximately 960 unique geographic areas. We understand that Ginnie Mae currently discloses
state (60 distinct areas, including Washington, D.C. and U.S. territories and associated states). 634
Depending on the data set, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac disclose MSA, 3-digit zip code or
state. 635 After considering the various alternatives, we are adopting a 2-digit zip code. In
reaching this conclusion, we considered that a 3-digit zip code would not significantly reduce the
re-identification risk relative to the proposal’s use of MSA and that use of state may be too broad
of an area to be useful to RMBS investors. 636
To further reduce the risk of re-identification, we are also omitting several data points
that, while potentially useful to investors, could increase the ability to identify underlying
obligors. Specifically, we are omitting the unique broker identifier data point 637 as well as the

See proposed Item 2(a)(11) of Schedule L. For RMBS, we are adopting a data point that indicates whether
or not a broker originated or was involved in the origination of the loan as well as a data point that discloses
the National Mortgage License System registration number for the company that originated the loan. These
data points will allow investors to compare loans by particular originators and across originators. Investors
will also be able to compare loans where a broker was used. Together, these data points will provide
investors with information they need to perform due diligence and make informed investment decisions.

sales price, 638 origination date, and first payment date 639 data points. In addition, we are omitting
some information about an obligor’s bankruptcy and foreclosure history, 640 although, if an
obligor had experienced a past bankruptcy or foreclosure, we would expect that those events
would have been considered in generating a credit score. As noted above, the final rules require
disclosure of an exact credit score.
Another step that we are taking to address commenters’ concerns about re-identification
risk is to omit the proposed income and debt data points. While we believe that income and debt

See new Items 1(c)(24) and 1(c)(26) of Schedule AL. These data points were not proposed and are not
relevant for Auto ABS.
638

See proposed Item 2(b)(3) of Schedule L. We are also omitting the original property valuation data points
because we believe they could provide a close approximation of sales price, and thus could have raised the
same re-identification concern as sales price. See also proposed Items 2(b)(5), 2(b)(6), 2(b)(7), 2(b)(8), and
2(b)(9) of Schedule L. For RMBS, we believe that certain other data points we are adopting, such as
Original loan amount and Original loan-to-value, will provide investors with information they need to
perform due diligence and make informed investment decisions. See new Items 1(c)(3) and 1(d)(11) of
Schedule AL. For Auto ABS, we are adopting data points that capture the vehicle value, as these values
are already made publicly available from sources such as the Kelly Blue Book. See new Items 3(d)(7),
3(d)(8), 4(d)(6) and 4(d)(7) of Schedule AL.

639

See proposed Items 1(a)(5) and 1(a)(14)of Schedule L. See also letters from ABA III, Lewtan, MBA I, and
SFIG II. We believe that certain other data points we are adopting, such as Original loan maturity date,
Original amortization term and Remaining term to maturity, will provide investors with information they
need to perform due diligence and make informed investment decisions. See new Items 1(c)(4), 1(c)(5)
and 1(g)(2) of Schedule AL. Because the same publicly available property records are not available for
auto loans and leases, we are adopting data points that capture the month and year of origination and the
original first payment date for Auto ABS. See new Items 3(c)(2), 3(c)(10), 4(c)(2), and 4(c)(10) of
Schedule AL.

640

See proposed Items 2(c)(24) and 2(c)(25) of Schedule L and proposed Items 2(c)(1), 2(c)(2), 2(c)(3),

2(k)(12), 2(k)(13), and 2(m)(3) of Schedule L-D. While commenters did not specifically note that these
data points would pose re-identification risk, we received letters about the sensitivity of the data. See, e.g.,
letters from Deutsche Bank, MBA IV, and SIFMA/FSR I-dealers and sponsors. RMBS issuers will,
however, be required to provide information about an asset in the pool that is subject to a foreclosure, or if
the reason for non-payment by an obligor is due to bankruptcy. See new Items 1(g)(33), 1(r)(1), 1(r)(2),
1(r)(3), 1(r)(4), 1(r)(5), 1(v)(1) and 1(v)(2) of Schedule AL. These data points were not proposed and are
not relevant for Auto ABS.

information would strengthen an investor’s risk analysis of ABS involving consumer assets, 641
we are not requiring them based on concerns about the sensitive nature of this information and
increased re-identification risk posed by this information. 642 As discussed in Section
III.A.2.b)(1) Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities, however, we are requiring DTI ratios. 643
These are key calculations used to assess an obligor’s ability to repay the loan that, we believe,
will permit investors to perform due diligence in the absence of specific debt and income data
points.
We also are revising 644 or removing 645 certain other proposed data points to further
mitigate re-identification risk concerns since the responses to these items will be made available
to the public through EDGAR. 646 We do not believe these proposed requirements necessarily
would have increased re-identification risk alone, but we have concluded that these data points, if

Investor members of one commenter noted that this information is useful for verifying DTI calculations.

See letters from VABSS IV, Wells Fargo III, and WPF II.

643

See Section III.A.2.b)(3) Automobile Loan or Lease ABS above for a discussion of the payment-to-income
ratio data points that are being adopted in lieu of proposed data points that would have collected obligor or
lessee income information. There were no data points proposed for Auto ABS that would have collected
obligor or lessee debt information.

644

See, e.g., proposed Item 2(l)(13) Eviction start date of Schedule L-D (revised to new Item 1(s)(8) Eviction
indicator of Schedule AL). Similar data points were not proposed for Auto ABS.

645

See, e.g., proposed Items 2(c)(13) Liquid/cash reserves, 2(c)(14) Number of mortgages properties, 2(c)(18)
Percentage of down payment from obligor own funds, 2(c)(20) Self-employment flag; 2(c)(21) Current
other monthly payment, 2(d)(6) Mortgage insurance certificate number, 2(a)(1) Non-pay reason, and
2(l)(14) Eviction end date of Schedule L-D. Similar data points were not proposed for Auto ABS.

646

These changes involved modifying the possible responses, such as removing certain responses from the
coded list of possible responses. For example, in new Item 1(c)(1) Original loan purpose of Schedule AL,
which was proposed as Item 2(a)(1) of Schedule L, we are removing certain possible responses from the
enumerated list of codes due to privacy concerns.

211

adopted as proposed, could disclose sensitive obligor data without providing additional
information necessary for investor due diligence.
Finally, in response to commenters’ suggestions, we have obtained guidance from the
CFPB on the application of the FCRA to the proposed disclosure requirements. 647 In a letter
issued to the Commission dated August 26, 2014, the CFPB stated that the FCRA will not apply
to asset-level disclosures that exclude direct identifiers where the Commission determines that
disclosure of such information is “necessary for investors to independently perform due
diligence.” 648 Specifically, the CFPB letter confirms that (i) issuers and the Commission would
not become consumer reporting agencies by obtaining and disseminating asset level information,
and (ii) no violation of Section 604(f) of the FCRA 649 would occur if issuers or the Commission
obtain or disseminate any information that is a consumer report (such as a credit score), in each
case if the Commission determines that disclosure of the information is necessary for investors to
independently perform due diligence and that the information should be filed with the
Commission and disclosed on EDGAR to best fulfill a Congressional mandate. As noted above,
we have revised or eliminated certain asset-level data points that implicate consumer privacy
concerns where we determined that doing so would not compromise investors’ ability to perform

647

Commenters also raised concerns about the applicability of other federal and state privacy laws and
analogous foreign laws. We do not believe the final rules are likely to implicate these other laws for a
variety of reasons, including that they do not require disclosure of direct identifiers (PII) and because
certain of these laws provide an exemption for the disclosure of information in order to comply with
federal, state or local laws and other applicable legal requirements. More generally, we believe the changes
we are adopting to help address privacy concerns should help to mitigate concerns about the applicability
of other privacy laws.

due diligence on the underlying assets. We believe the asset-level data points that we are
requiring about underlying obligors for ABS involving consumers assets are necessary for
investors to perform due diligence, as required by Section 7(c). After taking these steps and after
careful consideration of alternative means of disseminating such information, we have
determined that having the information filed with the Commission and disclosed on EDGAR is
the most effective means of ensuring that investors have access to asset-level data.
As discussed above, we have taken significant steps to reduce the re-identification risk
associated with providing certain asset-level data while adhering to the statutory mandate in
Section 7(c) to require disclosure of such information to the extent necessary for investors to
independently perform due diligence. We do recognize, however, that the final rules do not
completely eliminate the risk of obligor re-identification 650 and there may be costs associated
with providing certain sensitive information required by the final rules. These costs may include
costs to issuers of consulting with privacy experts to understand the impact of providing these
disclosures. We also recognize that some issuers and investors may move to unregistered

650

In this regard we note that there is continuing debate about the ability to fully anonymize or “de-identify” a
data set and whether it is possible to have any confidence that re-identification risk can be totally mitigated.

offerings, which may affect capital formation. 651 Alternatively, the increased costs may be
passed on to the underlying obligors in the form of a higher cost to borrowers (e.g., interest rates
or fees).
Re-identification risk can also increase the cost of capital due to obligor preferences. If
an obligor is particularly sensitive to the possibility of re-identification, the obligor may prefer to
transact with originators that offer additional methods for preserving anonymity, which could
increase that obligor’s cost of or access to capital. For example, if a loan agreement gives an
obligor the ability to opt out of disclosure, thereby prohibiting the ability to securitize the loan
where asset-level information would be disclosed, originators may pass costs on to the obligor.
Originators could also bear some increased costs if, as a result of being unable to securitize the
loan or sell it to the GSEs, the originator would hold the asset on its balance sheet, thus limiting
its ability to redeploy capital to more productive or efficient uses. In addition, the risk of reidentification could limit an obligor’s access to capital if the obligor is unable to obtain
assurances, even at a higher cost, that his or her loan would not be securitized in a way that gives
rise to a potential risk of re-identification. Ultimately, an obligor’s sensitivity to re-identification
risk could lead to a reduction in the number of loans available for securitization. This could, in
turn, lead to a reduction in liquidity of ABS markets and a corresponding increase in cost of

may provide for more customized data delivery where an issuer has more direct control, the issues
surrounding FCRA exposure are the same as if the securitization were made through a registered offering).

capital even for those loans that are otherwise securitized through registered offerings. 652 In
general, for these reasons, we believe that reducing the likelihood of obligor re-identification will
reduce the impact of these potential costs of asset-level disclosure for the ABS market.
As discussed above, in considering how to modify the proposed disclosures to reduce the
risk of re-identification, we considered the specific recommendations of commenters and current
disclosure practices. Although we received various suggestions for reducing re-identification
risk, commenters did not provide any data or analysis that quantified the likelihood of reidentification based on the proposed disclosures or their suggested approaches to addressing reidentification risk. Some commenters indicated that using less precise geographic identifiers
would reduce the risk that an obligor could be re-identified. 653 Using less precise data points for
sales price and origination date would also reduce the risk of re-identification.
To help confirm the effect of requiring less precise information, we performed an
analysis of various modifications to the required data points. In particular, we have estimated the
likelihood of isolating a unique mortgage in a sample pool of mortgage loans by considering
different levels and combinations of precision for the geographic location of the property, sales
price, and origination date. Our analysis examined mortgages collected from mortgage loan
servicer providers and reported in the MBSData, LLC, dataset, which includes asset-level data
for most of the mortgages securitized in the private-label RMBS market during the period from

on to consumers, including an increase in financing costs and a decrease in credit availability).

2000 to 2012. 654 Categorizing loans according to their uniqueness is the first step someone could
take to re-identify an obligor. Each of the 19.3 million mortgages reported during this period
were sorted according to uniqueness of three loan characteristics – geographic location, sales
price, and origination date – which could potentially link the mortgage to another publicly
available dataset that contains obligors’ identities. 655 We assume that loans that have unique
values for these three variables, when compared to all other loans in the MBSData dataset, have
an elevated potential for obligor re-identification. We note, however, that our analysis is not an
actual measure of re-identification risk. Importantly, in order to actually re-identify an obligor, a
unique mortgage must also be matched with publicly available data sources, such as from local
government real estate transaction ledgers and tax records that contain information on property
addresses, sales prices, and origination dates. 656 We have not attempted to quantify the
likelihood that a unique mortgage, once isolated, can be matched with publicly available data

654

Loan-level data is available on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Web sites; however, we did not incorporate
this data into our analysis because we believe that historically the characteristics of loans purchased and
securitized by GSEs have been somewhat different from the characteristics of loans securitized through
private-label RMBS. We do not expect that incorporating the GSE data would significantly reduce the
likelihood of finding records with unique characteristics among properties bought with mortgages
securitized through private-label RMBS.

655

Because the required asset-level disclosures do not include sales price, in our analysis, we have imputed it
from the reported loan amount and LTV ratio and rounded to the nearest $100. Although the origination
date is not required to be disclosed, it can be approximated in many cases using other required data points,
such as Original loan maturity date, Original amortization term and Remaining term to maturity. See new
Items 1(c)(4), 1(c)(5) and 1(g)(2).

656

We have not analyzed re-identification techniques using commercially available datasets (e.g., datasets
from consumer reporting agencies) because even though using such data may be more effective in reidentification, providers of such datasets usually charge a fee and impose restrictions on their usage, such
as, access controls and user identity verification.

216

sources. Instead, we have focused our analysis on this first step of the re-identification process,
which is to isolate a unique mortgage.
To provide a basis for comparison, we first considered the likelihood of identifying a
unique loan using a 5-digit zip code for the property location, the exact sales price and the exact
origination date. Approximately 76% of the 19.3 million loans analyzed are unique when these
three characteristics are compared across all mortgages in the database. That is, these loans
could be distinguished from all other loans with respect to geography, imputed sales price, and
origination date, and they were originated in states for which there is no prohibition on public
disclosure of the property sales price. 657
We next considered the likelihood of identifying a unique loan using the required
disclosures in the final rules. As discussed above, we are modifying the required geographic
identifier from MSA, as proposed, to a 2-digit zip code and are requiring securitizers to report
only the original amortization term, and remaining term to maturity, from which year and month
of origination can be approximated, but not the precise origination or sales date. 658 Based on the
historical data and the same method described above of determining uniqueness, we estimate that
by requiring 2-digit zip code, imputed sales price, and the month and year of origination, less
than 20% of mortgages in the sample pool could be unique in their characteristics. This is also

657

Some states (or counties within states) consider the property sales value to be private and confidential
information and therefore do not release these numbers publicly. These states include: Alaska, Idaho,
Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas,
Utah and Wyoming. The analysis does not account for non-disclosure counties that lie within a state that
allows for disclosure.

658

As discussed below, this change should not materially impact an investor’s ability to price RMBS tranches,
but will significantly lower the probability that a mortgage is unique in its characteristics.

217

significantly lower than the almost 30% likelihood of isolating a unique loan determined based
on the required disclosure items in the 2010 ABS Proposal. 659
These estimates, however, do not fully reflect the difficulty of actually re-identifying an
underlying obligor. 660 As noted above, the loan would have to be matched to a record in the
relevant public database of real estate transactions. As noted, some counties within states do not
release property sale values. Even in those jurisdictions that do make property sale information
publicly available, matching the loans to a particular property record might be challenging to do
because the jurisdiction providing the information might not offer access in a way that would
make the information easily accessible or in convenient format. For example, knowing the 5digit zip code of the unique property would not necessarily be helpful in a jurisdiction that
requires a street name in order to search and view records. Hence, in some cases it may be too
burdensome to find the matching loan even if that information is publicly available, particularly
if such search is part of a large scale matching effort (i.e., for commercial purposes). We also
note that public property databases contain, in addition to property transactions with mortgages
securitized through private-label RMBS, property transactions without using borrowed funds,
property transactions with mortgages that are never securitized, or property transactions with

659

As noted above, the proposal would have required a geographic identifier of MSA, exact sales price and the
month and year of origination.

660

This technique is based on historical data and may not necessarily reflect future re-identification
likelihoods. Also, in the future, securitizers that are conscious of privacy implications may avoid
securitizing loans that have high risk of being identified (i.e., loans that are unique in their characteristics).

218

mortgages that are securitized through GSEs. The addition of these other transactions only
compounds the burden of matching a particular loan with a particular property record.
Although the approach that we are adopting does not eliminate the possibility of obligor
re-identification, we believe it strikes the appropriate balance between privacy and transparency.
Some obligors may still be particularly sensitive to the possibility of re-identification and may
seek originators that offer additional methods of preserving their anonymity. We do not,
however, anticipate that this will have an adverse effect on the functioning of the private-label
RMBS market or the cost of capital to the originators of mortgages and their obligors because of
the relatively low likelihood of re-identification associated with the revised data points.
Moreover, as noted above, asset-level information has been provided by issuers and third-party
data providers for private-label RMBS (although not standardized), as well as by the GSEs and
Ginnie Mae, 661 and this availability has not led to market disruption or adverse effects on cost of
capital for obligors. We believe that there will be significant benefits to RMBS investors by
having access to obligor-specific financial information in their evaluation of the potential default
risk of the securitized assets, thus improving their ability to price registered RMBS tranches.
This information also will allow investors to better understand, analyze and track the
performance of RMBS, and, in turn, will allow for more accurate ongoing pricing and increase
market efficiency. 662

661

See Section III.A.1 Background and Economic Baseline for the Asset-Level Disclosure Requirement.

662

This would also apply to other asset classes where obligor-specific financial information may be disclosed,
such as Auto ABS.

219

We acknowledge that further modification of certain data points could further reduce the
risk of obligor re-identification. For example, several commenters emphasized the importance of
geographic location in potentially re-identifying an underlying obligor. 663 Based on our analysis,
eliminating a geographic identifier reduces the likelihood of isolating a unique mortgage in the
sample pool to less than 2%. We considered whether further modification to certain data points
will reduce transparency of critical data points for ABS investors. As we discuss below, we
believe that a geographic location identifier is critical to pricing RMBS and is therefore
necessary for investors to perform due diligence.
To confirm our view, and the views of commenters, 664 that certain data points are critical
for ABS investment decisions, we analyzed the potential pricing impact of various data points on
RMBS transactions. Our analysis indicates that, for RMBS, certain characteristics and loan term
features, such as geographic location, are key determinants of expected performance of
underlying mortgage loans as measured by the historical rate of serious delinquency (“SDQ”). 665
We used a model to predict the presence or absence of SDQ within a historical dataset of privatelabel securitized loans. 666 We found that, by a wide margin, the following four data points make

664

See, e.g., letters from ABA III (recommending that the Commission consider using 2-digit zip code), ASF I
(supporting exact credit score), and Mass. Atty. Gen. (noting that the DTI ratio and LTV are important
metrics in an investor’s assessment of risk of loss).

665

SDQ is defined as a loan having ever been 90 days late, foreclosed, or real estate owned.

666

We used a binomial logistic predictive model that is also referred to as a logit regression. Binomial logistic
regression deals with situations in which the observed outcome for a dependent variable can have only two
possible types (for purposes of this analysis – presence or absence of a serious delinquency). Logistic
regression is used to predict the odds of being a case based on the value of the independent variables (i.e.,

220

the largest contribution to explaining SDQ: 667 the year of origination, the LTV ratio, the
geographic location of the property as measured by 2-digit zip code, and the obligor’s credit
score (FICO score was reported in the dataset). Our analysis shows that the year of origination
provides the greatest contribution to the measure of how well these factors explain the likelihood
of serious delinquency. 668 LTV, geographic location of the property and FICO score provide the
next greatest contribution to explaining the likelihood of serious delinquency and have a similar
magnitude in overall contribution. 669 Eliminating any of these three variables from the final
disclosure requirements significantly and negatively affects the predictive ability of the model.

the predictors). We estimate the regression model with commonly used predictive factors identified by the
industry and the academic literature, such as combined LTV ratio, credit score, and DTI ratio and analyze
the effects of various loan characteristics observable at origination on the ability of a researcher to forecast
serious delinquency. For more details and references, see footnote 82, the White-Bauguess Study, Section
V. Logit Regression Analysis (for the description of the model) and Appendix B (for variable definitions
and references to studies supporting the variables choice). The analysis is based on a sample of 2,456,548
mortgages from 2000-2009 included in the MBSData dataset that have complete information for all
variables of interest, in particular, DTI information.
667

The model uses a goodness-of-fit measure (pseudo-R2) to describe how well an SDQ can be modeled with
given predictive variables. Higher R2 represents higher predictive ability of a model in forecasting SDQ of
mortgages. We consequently eliminate each individual factor from predictive regression and record its
impact on the reduction in the goodness-of-fit measure. Higher reduction represents higher contribution of
a factor to predictive ability of the full model. The R2 that we find here is in line with R2 found in academic
studies that perform similar analyses. See id.

668

We believe this primarily is due to the fact that the year of loan origination served as a proxy for
unobservable factors like the quality of underwriting standards during the years immediately preceding the
financial crisis when serious delinquency rate was higher, and a large portion of the loans in the sample
were originated during that time. The importance of the origination year is smaller for sub-samples that do
not include loans originated in 2006-2007.

669

Origination year contributed 5% to the goodness-of-fit measure. LTV, 2-digit zip code, and the obligor’s
credit score contributed about 1.5% each. All other 12 data points we considered made a comparatively
smaller contribution to the predictive ability of the model (1.5% combined), but are still important in
predicting SDQ. These 12 data points include: interest rate on the loan, DTI, indicators whether a loan had
full documentation, had prepayment penalty provisions, was interest-only, had a balloon payment, had
negative amortization, was a first lien, was long term, had a teaser rate, had private mortgage insurance,
and whether the property was owner-occupied.

221

On the other hand, in the instances we studied, providing a geographic location that represents a
smaller area or the exact origination date only marginally improves the model’s predictive
ability, 670 but it could significantly increase the possibility of obligor re-identification.
Another approach we considered, although not specifically suggested by commenters,
was an approach that rounds the loan amount, other loan balance-related data points, and
monthly performance data points to further hinder potential obligor re-identification. 671 The
rounding of loan amount would result in an imputed sales price that may be sufficiently different
from the true sales price so as to lessen the possibility of a match to other publicly accessible real
estate datasets. Rounding the loan balance to the nearest $1,000 results in the reduction of the
likelihood of isolating a unique mortgage in the MBSData dataset to 11%. It would, however,
come at a loss of precision in the cash flow variables that we believe is necessary for
investors. 672 As noted above, such precision is key to investors’ ability to analyze and track the
performance of various parties involved in RMBS transactions.

670

The analysis indicated that the goodness-of-fit of the complete model (i.e., the model that includes all
predictive variables considered in this study) would increase from 15.5% to 15.7% if an MSA is used
instead of a 2-digit zip code, and to 16.0% if a 3-digit zip code is used instead of a 2-digit zip code.

671

To be effective in reducing the probability of isolating a loan that is unique with respect to location,
imputed sales price, and origination date, rounding loan amount (and other loan balance related variables
like most recent appraised value, sales price, paid-in-full amount, etc.) to the nearest $1,000 ($10,000) must
be accompanied by rounding monthly payment performance related variables approximately to the nearest
$10 ($100).

672

See letter from Prudential III (noting that loan-level data (e.g., current asset balance, next interest rate,
current delinquency status, remaining term to maturity) will allow investors to better estimate the timing of
the principal and interest cash flows of the collateral pool, which will in turn allow investors to better
estimate the cash flow of the securitization and be more confident in their risk/reward consideration of the
security).

222

We considered several alternative approaches to disseminating asset-level data as
potential means to address privacy concerns, including the Web site approach. 673 Most
commenters were generally opposed to the Web site approach as the appropriate means to
address privacy concerns. 674 For example, commenters raised concerns about the difficulty in
determining who would be a potential investor and thus should have access to asset-level data; 675
the liability for failing to disclose all material information to investors in the event a potential
investor was denied access to asset-level data; 676 the need for guidance on what controls are
necessary to address privacy; 677 and access to the data by other market participants. 678 Given
these concerns and our belief that it is critically important that investors receive access to assetlevel information, we are not adopting the Web site approach. We believe the final asset-level
requirements, which have been modified from the proposal to address privacy concerns, provide

to screen parties, conduct reviews of these parties’ data protection controls, and obtain appropriate

would be faced with the burden of determining how to control the spread of the information once a
credentialed entity accesses the Web site), SIFMA/FSR I-dealers and sponsors (noting that issuers would
generally not be equipped to verify any prospective user’s identity or credentials or be able to enforce
compliance with the terms of access), SFIG II (noting that investors do not want the liability risk that may
be imposed with the access restrictions), and Wells Fargo III.

investors with information they need to perform due diligence and make informed investment
decisions, and therefore, we are requiring the asset-level information to be filed on EDGAR
where it will be readily available to and accessible by investors. For similar reasons, we do not
think it would be appropriate to restrict access to such information on EDGAR.
Commenters suggested a central repository or “aggregated data warehouse” to house the
asset-level data because such an approach would simplify enforcement of access policies, ensure
consistent data formats and lower incentives to exclude certain users. 679 Similarly, another
commenter suggested that issuers disclose all asset-level data to a consumer reporting agency
administered repository, along with a unique identification number for each asset, which would
allow investors to access all the asset-level data for these assets. 680 Another commenter also
suggested that credit bureaus, instead of issuers, should provide credit-related information. 681
While these suggestions have the potential to address privacy concerns, as noted by one
commenter, they are not currently in use, would require further development, and would depend

Requirements under Section 7(c) of the Securities Act

As we note elsewhere, subsequent to the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, Congress adopted
the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 942(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act added Section 7(c) to the Securities
Act which requires the Commission to adopt regulations requiring an issuer of ABS to disclose,
for each tranche or class of security, information regarding the assets backing that security. It
specifies, in part, that in adopting regulations, the Commission shall require issuers of assetbacked securities, at a minimum, to disclose asset-level or loan-level data, if such data are
necessary for investors to independently perform due diligence including – data having unique
identifiers relating to loan brokers or originators; the nature and extent of the compensation of
the broker or originator of the assets backing the security; and the amount of risk retention by the
originator and the securitizer of such assets. 683
In the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release, we requested comment as to whether our 2010
ABS Proposals implemented Section 7(c) effectively and whether any changes or additions to
the proposals would better implement Section 7(c). We discuss below the comments we
received in response to the requests for comment regarding the requirements of Section 7(c).

Section 7(c)(2)(B) – Data Necessary for Investor Due Diligence

Section 7(c)(2)(B) states, in part, that we require issuers of asset-backed securities, at a
minimum, to disclose asset-level or loan-level data, if such data are necessary to independently
perform due diligence. We requested comment in the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release whether
the 2010 ABS Proposal implements Section 7(c) effectively. In response, two investors
supported requiring asset-level disclosures for all asset types, except for credit cards. 684 The
investor membership of one trade association suggested that the disclosure of relevant asset-level
data is necessary for well-functioning markets 685 and another commenter suggested that the 2010
ABS proposals would successfully implement Section 7(c) of the Securities Act. 686 Two other
commenters, however, questioned whether borrower data proposed in the 2010 ABS proposals
was “necessary” for investors to perform their own due-diligence. 687 These commenters,
however, did not specifically identify the asset-level disclosures that are necessary for investors
to independently perform due diligence.
We are adopting asset-level requirements for RMBS, CMBS, Auto ABS, debt security
ABS, and resecuritizations. We prioritized these asset classes for various reasons that we discuss
above. 688 Our decision to adopt these requirements is based on our belief that investors should

independently perform due diligence. We continue to consider the appropriate disclosures for
other asset classes. We believe the data points we are adopting fulfill, for those asset types, the
Section 7(c) requirement that we adopt asset-level disclosures that are necessary for investors to
independently perform due diligence. To the extent issuers believe additional data is needed, we
encourage them to provide such additional disclosures in an Asset Related Document. 689
b)
Section 7(c)(2)(B)(i) – Unique Identifiers Relating to Loan
Brokers and Originators
Section 7(c)(2)(B)(i) requires the Commission to require disclosure of asset-level or loanlevel data, including, but not limited to, data having unique identifiers relating to loan brokers or
originators if such data are necessary for investors to independently perform due diligence. In
the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we proposed to require issuers to provide the originator’s
name for all asset types and, if the asset is a residential mortgage, the MERS number 690 for the
originator, if available. We also proposed requiring RMBS issuers to provide the National
Mortgage License System registration number required by the Secure and Fair Enforcement for
Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, otherwise known as the NMLS number, for the loan
originators and company that originated the loan. 691

689

See Section III.B.4 Asset Related Documents for further discussion on how to provide such additional
disclosures.

690

MERS has developed a unique numbering system and reporting packages to capture and report data at
different times during the life of the underlying residential or commercial loan.

691

The NMLS numbers for the originator and the company refer to the individual and company taking the loan
application, which would include loan brokers and the company that the broker works for. We noted in the

227

In the 2011 ABS Re-proposing Release, we stated our belief that the proposal to require
NMLS numbers would implement the requirements of Section 7(c) with respect to mortgages by
requiring a numerical identifier for a loan broker. 692 We requested comment on whether unique
identifiers for loan brokers and/or originators were necessary to permit investors to
independently perform due diligence for asset classes other than RMBS or CMBS and, if so,
whether there is a unique system of identifiers for brokers and originators for other asset
classes. 693 We did not receive any comments suggesting this requirement would not satisfy the
requirements of Section 7(c), although one commenter opposed requiring an NMLS identifier
(for RMBS) because disclosure should focus on the collateral and its performance and an NMLS
identifier does not provide investors with information they can use to value the assets. 694
For RMBS, we are adopting the requirement that issuers provide for ABS backed by
residential mortgages the NMLS number of the loan originator company. As noted above, we
are not adopting the requirement that issuers provide a unique broker identifier, (i.e., the NMLS
number of the specific loan originator) because we are concerned this disclosure may increase reidentification risk. 695 Even though we are not requiring disclosure of the NMLS loan originator
number, we believe disclosure of the NMLS number of the loan originator company satisfies

2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release that we were unaware of any other unique identifying systems used for
the purpose of identifying brokers or originators of other asset types, across all asset types or within an
asset type.

Section 7(c)(2)(B)(i) regarding the asset-level disclosure of unique identifiers for loan brokers or

originated by particular loan originator companies and determine whether there is any correlation
to the performance of the loan. This should facilitate independent investor due diligence with
respect to the loan pools underlying RMBS.
We are unaware of unique identifiers for loan originators and, if applicable, brokers
within the commercial mortgage, auto loan and lease, and debt security markets. We note the
ongoing development of certain identifiers, but we are uncertain, at this time, especially due to
the lack of response to our request for comment, whether a unique identifier for loan originators
for these asset classes is necessary for investor due diligence. Therefore, at this time, we are not
adopting unique identifiers for loan originators or brokers within the CMBS, Auto ABS or debt
security markets.
c)
Section 7(c)(2)(B)(ii) – Broker Compensations and Section
7(c)(2)(B)(iii) – Risk Retention by Originator and the Securitizer of
the Assets
In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we did not propose requiring asset-level disclosures
of broker compensation or risk retention held by loan originators or securitizers. Section 942(b)
of the Dodd-Frank Act, however, amended Section 7(c) of the Securities Act to require
disclosure on an asset-level or loan-level basis with respect to the nature and extent of the
compensation of the broker or originator of the assets backing the security and the amount of risk
retention by the originator and the sponsor of such assets if these disclosures are necessary for
investor due diligence. In the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release, we requested comment on
whether these disclosures were necessary for investor due diligence.
229

We received few comments on these portions of Section 7(c) in response to our requests
for comments. One commenter stated that disclosure of broker compensation was appropriate to
require because it “is necessary for evaluating how the compensation structure associated with an
asset – including possible conflicts of interest – might affect its quality.” 696 The same
commenter believed that asset-level or loan-level disclosure of risk retention held by an
originator or sponsor “would undoubtedly be of value to investors as they perform due diligence
and assess the quality of the offering.” 697 This commenter stated that we must require asset-level
risk retention disclosure because of the “many forms of risk retention that have been proposed in
accordance with Section 941(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, including vertical, horizontal, and other
configurations” and because “[e]ach of those forms of risk retention presents a different risk
profile, depending on the specific underlying assets that are subject to the risk retention.” 698
A CMBS issuer and a trade association did not believe that broker compensation
disclosure in the prospectus would be useful to investors in performing due diligence on the
assets in the pool. 699 The CMBS issuer stated that the general due diligence focus for CMBS
was whether the income-producing potential of the underlying commercial property was
sufficient to service the debt that it secures and broker compensation does not assist that

analysis. 700 Another trade association stated that it did not support disclosure of asset-level risk
retention disclosures because its “members do not believe this would add any value in the CMBS
industry.” 701
We did not receive any comments from investors suggesting that disclosure of broker
compensation is necessary for their due diligence. While the disclosure of broker compensation
on an asset-level basis may provide some value to investors in assessing possible conflicts of
interest, we are not persuaded at this time that such information is necessary for investors to
independently conduct due diligence.
With respect to asset-level risk retention, we are not persuaded at this time that additional
requirements relating to risk retention, on an asset-level basis, are needed for investors to
independently conduct due diligence. A sponsor, however, will be required to provide
information, on an aggregate basis, about its retained interest in a securitization transaction. As
explained below, we are adopting amendments to Items 1104, 1108, and 1110 of Regulation AB
that will require disclosure regarding the sponsor’s, a servicer’s, or a 20% originator’s interest
retained in the transaction, including the amount and nature of that interest. 702 The disclosure
would be required for both shelf and other offerings. We note the recent re-proposal of the credit
risk retention rules, issued jointly by the Commission and other agencies, implementing Section

appropriate. The asset-level requirements we are adopting should provide investors with
transparency about the quality of the assets in a securitization.

Asset-Level Filing Requirements
1.

The Timing of the Asset-Level Disclosure Requirements

This section, Section III.B.1, is divided into two parts covering when asset-level
information must be provided. Section III.B.1.a discusses when asset-level disclosures are
required at the time of the offering. Section III.B.1.b discusses the frequency with which the
asset-level disclosures are required on an ongoing basis. Section III.B.2 discusses the scope of
asset-level data required at the time of the offering and on an ongoing basis.
a)

Timing of Offering Disclosures
(1)

Proposed Rule

In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we proposed to require asset-level information of
asset pool characteristics at the following times during the offering process:
•

At the time the preliminary prospectus is filed.

•

At the time the final prospectus is filed.

•

With an Item 6.05 Form 8-K if the requirements of Item 6.05 were triggered. 704

703

See the 2013 Risk Retention Re-Proposing Release.

704

Under the existing Item 6.05 requirement, if any material pool characteristic of the actual asset pool at the
time of issuance of the securities differs by five percent or more (other than as a result of the pool assets
converting to cash in accordance with their terms) from the description of the asset pool in the prospectus

232

(2)

Comments on Proposed Rule

Only one commenter responded to our proposal that the asset-level disclosures be
required at the time of the offering. This commenter stated the proposal seemed to cover the
period of offering sufficiently. 705
(3)

Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Final Rule

Under the final rule, as proposed, those issuers that are required to provide asset-level
data must provide all of the required asset-level disclosures in a preliminary prospectus and the
final prospectus. Requiring that asset-level disclosures be filed by the same time a preliminary
prospectus is filed will provide investors more time to analyze the asset-level data in advance of
an investment decision. We acknowledge that every time asset-level disclosures are filed issuers
likely will incur filings costs and costs to verify the data. We believe the costs incurred to
provide this information are justified in order to provide investors access to relevant data about
the assets underlying the particular ABS offering in advance of their investment decision. In
addition, we believe providing investors time to analyze the asset-level data may result in better
pricing and therefore may improve allocative efficiency and facilitate capital formation.
Compliance costs are minimized, to some extent, because if there has been no change to the

filed for the offering pursuant to Securities Act Rule 424, the issuer must provide certain disclosures
regarding the actual asset pool, such as that required by Items 1111 and 1112 of Regulation AB. Under a
proposed revision to Item 6.05 of Form 8-K, we proposed that a new Schedule L be filed if assets are added
to the pool during the reporting period, either through prefunding periods, revolving periods or substitution,
and the triggers of Item 6.05 are met. See footnote 235 of the 2010 ABS Proposing Release.
705

See letter from MBA I (stating that if the Commission requires a Schedule L for CMBS, then they do not
recommend the inclusion of Schedule L data at other times as the proposal seems to cover the period of
offering sufficiently).

233

asset-level information provided with the preliminary prospectus, then under current
requirements, this information can be incorporated by reference into the final prospectus. This
eliminates the costs associated with re-filing the information.
Under the proposal, an issuer would have been required to provide updated asset-level
disclosures about the pool composition, including characteristics of new assets added to the pool,
if an Item 6.05 Form 8-K was triggered. 706 Under the final rules, asset-level information about
the actual pool composition is required with each Form 10-D. Therefore, we do not believe that
issuers should also incur the cost to provide asset-level information if an Item 6.05 is triggered.
b)

Timing of Periodic Disclosures
(1)

Proposed Rule

We also proposed in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release to require ongoing asset-level
disclosures. Under the proposal, asset-level disclosures would be required at the time of each
Form 10-D, which under current requirements is within 15 days after each required distribution
date on the ABS.
(2)

Comments on Proposed Rule

With respect to when and how frequently the ongoing asset-level disclosures should be
provided, comments varied. One commenter recommended that the required disclosures be
provided on the distribution date rather than 15 days thereafter. 707 Some commenters noted that

706

See footnote 235 of the 2010 ABS Proposing Release.

707

See letter from MetLife I.

234

industry standards for CMBS make ongoing disclosures available earlier than when the proposal
would require them. 708
With respect to how frequently the ongoing asset-level disclosures should be provided,
comments varied. For instance, a few commenters suggested we require disclosure on the day of
an “observable event,” or promptly thereafter. 709 Alternatively, one commenter suggested
requiring less asset-level data each month or allowing issuers to provide the data annually or
quarterly. 710 Other commenters stated that the asset-level disclosures should not be required on a
daily basis or on a timeframe that occurs less than monthly. 711 Relatedly, one commenter stated
that the final rule should include an instruction clarifying that the ongoing asset-level
information reported for any particular reporting period may be reporting information from a
prior reporting period due to delays that can occur between the time when asset-level information
is received and such information is ready to be reported. 712

disclosures available 15 days earlier than what the proposal would require).

(and the amount thereof) by the obligor on such loan or receivable; 2) failure by the obligor to make

modification with respect to such loan or receivable; or 4) the billing and collecting party becomes aware
that such obligor has become subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding).

See letter from AFSA I (suggesting that monthly reports are cumbersome and the data does not change that

updates because of system limitations that would prevent more frequent data collection and that data is only
comparable if consistently collected at the same point in time) and Wells Fargo I (suggesting that, for
RMBS and CMBS, requiring ongoing disclosures on a daily basis or less than monthly is inappropriate
because the marginal benefit to investors would not justify the costs).

(3)

Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Final Rule

The final rule requires, as proposed, that issuers provide the asset-level disclosures at the
time of each Form 10-D. As discussed, however, in Section III.B.2 the scope of information
required with each Form 10-D has changed to also include the same set of data points that were
required in the prospectus. We are not persuaded by commenters’ suggestions that the ongoing
asset-level disclosures be provided quarterly, annually or monthly, because reporting at these
times may be outside the time when such disclosures are normally collected. The requirement to
file a Form 10-D is tied to the distribution date on the ABS, as specified in the governing
documents for the securities. In effect, tying the asset-level disclosures to each Form 10-D filing
aligns the frequency of the disclosures to the payment cycle (when data about the collections and
distributions is captured) which should minimize the burdens and costs to issuers of collecting
such information. For investors, receiving asset-level data tied to the payment cycle should
allow them to conduct their own valuation and risk analysis of each asset in the pool at periods
close in time to when the data is captured and other distribution information is already being
reported. This should allow investors to understand, on an ongoing basis for the life of the
investment, how the performance of any particular asset is affecting pool performance.
We also believe that only requiring asset-level disclosures on a quarterly or monthly basis
may not provide investors with timely access to data about the performance of pool assets
because it ties the reporting of asset-level disclosures to a timeframe that may be outside the

servicer, and normalized before it is provided to the filer, which can result in substantial delays between the
time information is received and is reported on Form 10-D).

236

payment cycle when the data is normally captured, which may increase costs or inhibit investors’
ability to make timely and informed ongoing investment decisions. For instance, if asset-level
reporting was required monthly, but the payment cycle occurred every six months, then requiring
a filing on a monthly basis may unnecessarily increase costs without a corresponding benefit. If
reporting was required on a quarterly basis, but the payment cycle was monthly, then in instances
where the performance of pool assets deteriorates or the pool assets change, investors would not
receive timely updates about such events. This may impact their ability to spot developing
trends, thus limiting their ability to make informed ongoing investment decisions with respect to
the ABS.
We are also not persuaded that we should require reporting any time an “observable
event” occurs with respect to a single asset because we do not believe that the benefits to
investors of such a requirement would justify the costs to issuers of capturing and reporting data
in a timeframe that falls outside when data is typically captured and reported. Reporting on an
observable event basis could result in the issuer constantly updating the data. As noted above,
we believe providing investors access to timely and relevant asset-level disclosures and
minimizing costs to issuers is best achieved by requiring asset-level disclosures be provided with
each Form 10-D, which means the disclosures will be provided in a timeframe that is in line with
the payment cycle and when the data is typically captured.
The final rule also requires that the asset-level disclosures be provided for each asset that
is in the pool at any point in time during the reporting period. Therefore, if a substitution
occurred during the reporting period, then asset-level disclosures are required for both the loan
added and the loan removed during the reporting period in which the change occurred.
237

Providing investors with disclosure about assets that are added and removed will allow investors
to understand the actual composition of the asset pool over the life of a security. This will
benefit investors by allowing them to assess on an ongoing basis the current risk of the collateral
pool and to compare the characteristics of the assets involved in a substitution. We recognize
that this benefit to investors will result in increased reporting costs to sponsors and ABS issuers.
A commenter suggested the final rule include an instruction clarifying that the
information reported for any particular reporting period may be information from a prior
reporting period due to delays that can occur between the time when asset-level information is
received and such information is ready to be reported. 713 We are not persuaded that this is a
significant problem for issuers; therefore the final rule does not include such an instruction. The
transaction agreements specify a distribution date to investors that is generally sometime after
the end of a reporting period so that the amounts of a distribution may be calculated so that
reports may be prepared. Consistent with current requirements, the Form 10-D is required to be
filed 15 days after each required distribution date on the ABS and accordingly, because the assetlevel disclosures are included in the Form 10-D disclosure requirements, they are due at the same
time. Based on current market practice, the amount of time between the end of a reporting
period and filing of a Form 10-D may be four weeks or more. Therefore, we believe aligning the
timing of filing the asset-level disclosure with current Form 10-D reporting requirements will not

713

See letter from Wells Fargo I.

238

be costly and will provide a sufficient period of time for the appropriate parties to review the
information before filing.
2.

The Scope of New Schedule AL

Section III.B.1 discussed when asset-level disclosures are required at the time of offering
and on an ongoing basis. This section discusses the scope of those required asset-level
disclosures required at the time of the offering and on an ongoing basis.
a)

Proposed Rule
(1)

Offering Disclosures

As noted above, in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we proposed to add the prospectus
disclosure requirements in new Item 1111(h) and new Schedule L to Regulation AB. We also
proposed data points related to each asset. Proposed Schedule L focused, in general, on
providing investors asset-level data about the credit quality of the obligor, the collateral related
to each asset and the cash flows related to a particular asset, such as the terms, expected payment
amounts, indices and whether and how payment terms change over time. Schedule L contained
some data points capturing some loan performance data. 714 As noted above, proposed Schedule
L would have been provided at the time of the preliminary prospectus. We also proposed that an
updated Schedule L be provided with the final prospectus. 715 Finally, we proposed that, if
issuers are required to report changes to the pool under Item 6.05 of Form 8-K, then an updated

714

See, e.g., proposed Items 1(b)(5) and 1(b)(6) of Schedule L.

715

See proposed Item 1125 of Regulation AB and the 2010 ABS Proposing Release at 23356.

239

Schedule L would be required. 716 We also requested comment on whether Schedule L data
should be required at any other time. 717
Under our proposed revisions to Item 6.05 of Form 8-K, we proposed that a new
Schedule L be filed if any material pool characteristic of the actual asset pool at the time of
issuance of the asset-backed securities differs by 1% or more from the description of the asset
pool in the prospectus. 718 Based on comments received, it seemed that it may not be clear that an
Item 6.05 Form 8-K would be required when prefunding or revolving assets increased or
changed the pool by 1% or more, although that was the intent of the proposal. Therefore, in the
2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release, we requested additional comment about whether we should
clarify that a new Schedule L would be required with an Item 6.05 Form 8-K when assets are
added to the pool after the issuance of the securities either through prefunding periods, revolving
periods or substitution and the triggers in Item 6.05 are met. 719 The Schedule L provided with an
Item 6.05 Form 8-K would provide investors with the current pool composition including data

716

In footnote 235 of the 2010 ABS Proposing Release we stated that if a new asset is added to the pool during
the reporting period, an issuer would be required to provide the asset-level information for each additional
asset pursuant to proposed revisions to both Item 1111 of Regulation AB and Item 6.05 of Form 8-K. See
the 2010 ABS Proposing Release at 23356.

717

See the 2010 ABS Proposing Release at 23356.

718

See the 2010 ABS Proposing Release at 23392. As proposed, if any material pool characteristic of the
actual asset pool at the time of issuance of the asset-backed securities differs by 1% or more than the
description of the asset pool in the prospectus filed for the offering pursuant to Securities Act Rule 424, an
issuer would be required to file an Item 6.05 Form 8-K and provide the disclosures required under Item
1111 and Item 1112 of Regulation AB. Under proposed Item 1111(h) of Regulation AB issuers would be
required to provide a Schedule L. In addition, the item, as proposed to be revised, also would require a
description of the changes that were made to the asset pool, including the number of assets substituted or
added to the asset pool.

719

See the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release at 47970.

240

related to the cash flows related to a particular asset, data that allows for better prepayment
analysis or credit analysis and data about the property. We also requested comment on whether
the updated Schedule L should include all assets in the pool and whether the Schedule L should
be an exhibit to a Form 8-K or to a Form 10-D. 720
(2)

Periodic Disclosures

In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we also proposed ongoing disclosure requirements
in Item 1121(d) and Schedule L-D. Proposed Schedule L-D would require, in general,
disclosures corresponding to payments received during the payment cycle, as well as amounts
past due and the servicer’s efforts during the payment cycle to collect past due amounts.
Proposed Item 1121(d) and Schedule L-D disclosure would be provided at the time of each Form
10-D. We also requested comment in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release about whether Schedule
L-D data should be provided at other times. 721
b)

Comments on Proposed Rule

We received limited response to the request for comment on whether Schedule L and
Schedule L-D data should be provided at any other time. Commenters generally indicated that
the disclosures enumerated in Schedule L and Schedule L-D may be appropriate at other times
than proposed. For instance, one investor stated that the same disclosures for all ABS sectors

720

Id.

721

See the 2010 ABS Proposing Release at 23368.

241

(other than CMBS) should be required for offering documents and ongoing reports. 722 The
investor recognized that certain data will be static, while other data will change from month to
month. Another investor stated that for transactions involving a prefunding period or revolving
period, a new Schedule L should be filed monthly when new collateral is added. 723
In response to the questions asked in the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release about
clarifying that a new Schedule L would be required with an Item 6.05 Form 8-K, an investor
reiterated its earlier position that issuers should file a Schedule L at issuance and each month
new assets are added to the collateral pool. 724 The investor added that this would allow investors
to evaluate the changing nature of the risk layering introduced by the new assets and it would
allow investors to confirm that the quality of the newly added collateral meets the expected
origination practices of the issuer. 725
One commenter noted that current rules require that updated information about the
characteristics of the collateral in the pool be provided with the Form 10-D, rather than in a Form
8-K. 726 The commenter, however, also believed requiring an updated Schedule L for assets

722

See letter from MetLife I (suggesting that the same disclosure be required for offering documents and
ongoing reports, but that for CMBS the loan originator and the loan servicer are not affiliated and therefore,
the same requirement may be impractical for CMBS).

723

See letter from Prudential I (opposing additions to the collateral pool after the filing of the final prospectus
except for substitutions for defaulted assets after closing).

724

See letter from Prudential II.

725

See letter from Prudential II (also suggesting that the newly originated collateral should also appear on
Schedule L-D, “so investors can efficiently assess how the new assets influence the risk profile of the
overall collateral pool”).

726

See letter from VABSS II (noting that existing Item 1121(b) of Regulation AB requires disclosure for
changes in pool composition during revolving periods and prefunding periods, and Item 1121(b) states that
the information is to be provided in distribution reports on Form 10-D, rather than in a Form 8-K).

242

added after the measurement date for revolving asset master trusts is inappropriate because the
asset composition of these trusts changes on a daily basis during its revolving period and,
therefore, an issuer would be filing both a Schedule L and Schedule L-D each month. 727 Another
commenter suggested that a new Schedule L should not be required when assets are added to the
pool after issuance, either through prefunding periods, revolving periods or substitution unless
the triggers under Item 6.05 of Form 8-K are met. If the 5% threshold under Item 6.05 was met,
then the commenter asserted filing the Schedule L with the Form 10-D would be more
efficient. 728
c)

Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Final Rule

After considering the comments received, we are adopting a rule, based on a
commenter’s suggestion that the same asset-level disclosures be provided, if applicable, at the
time of the offering and on an ongoing basis. Therefore, we have condensed information
previously proposed to be provided in either Schedule L or Schedule L-D into a single schedule,
titled Schedule AL. Schedule AL in new Item 1125 of Regulation AB enumerates all of the
asset-level disclosures to be provided, if applicable, about the assets in the pool at securitization
and on an ongoing basis. The asset-level disclosures apply to each asset in the pool during the
reporting period covered by Schedule AL. 729

727

See letter from VABSS III.

728

See letter from Sallie Mae II.

729

See Item 1111(h)(7) of Regulation AB [17 CFR 229.1111].

243

We believe aggregating Schedule L and Schedule L-D into one unified schedule
simplifies the new rules to the benefit of both issuers and investors. For investors, we believe a
unified schedule will make it easier to understand the actual pool composition and the
performance of the asset pool both at issuance and on an ongoing basis. We recognize that, in
certain circumstances, the pool composition may continue to change even after the final
prospectus is filed. As a result, the asset-level information provided with the final prospectus
may not reflect the pool composition at closing. 730 On an ongoing basis, the composition of the
asset pool may change due to prefunding or revolving periods, or substitution. Under the
proposal, if the assets in the pool changed after the filing of the final prospectus, then investors
would have only received updated disclosures about the characteristics of the current asset pool,
if an Item 6.05 of Form 8-K was triggered. Some assets could be added or removed from the
pool without investors receiving updated disclosures about the changes to the composition and
characteristics of the asset pool. As a result, the assets identified in the most recent Schedule LD would not exactly match the assets identified in the last Schedule L that was filed.
Requiring that the asset-level information provided with the Form 10-D include
information about the characteristics of each asset will make it easier to understand the actual
pool composition at any point in time and, in particular, when the asset composition has changed

730

The requirement to file Schedule AL data with the final prospectus does not impact the analysis regarding
the timing and adequacy of information conveyed to the investor at the time the investment decision is
made. Under Securities Act Rule 159, information conveyed after the time of the contract of sale (e.g., a
final prospectus) is not taken into account in evaluating the adequacy of information conveyed to the
investor at the time the investment decision was made. Therefore, registrants should be mindful of their
obligations under Securities Act Rule 159.

244

through additions, substitutions or removal of assets. 731 This requirement will also make it easier
to compare the characteristics of the current asset pool with the pool characteristics for a prior
period or date. As a result, we believe investors will be able to better assess any potential risk
layering introduced by changes to the composition of the asset pool and confirm that the quality
of the newly added collateral meets expected origination practices.
Another benefit is that investors at the time of the offering will receive a more complete
picture of any seasoned assets in the ABS pool, including the current performance of these
assets. As we noted in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, proposed Schedule L-D focused on
whether an obligor is making payments as scheduled, the efforts by the servicer to collect
amounts past due, and the losses that may pass on to investors. 732 We believe these disclosures,
if made at the time of the offering, will also assist an investor in its investment analysis,
especially with respect to asset pools involving seasoned assets.
We recognize that the one schedule format may benefit issuers, but it may also result in
some increased compliance costs. We believe that it may be easier to revise, amend and file one
schedule than two separate schedules. Also, as discussed above, because we are not adopting the
proposed requirement that an updated Schedule L be provided if an Item 6.05 is triggered,

731

For instance, if a loan was added to an RMBS pool during a reporting period, the next Schedule AL that is
filed will include all relevant disclosures about the asset, including all disclosures that would have been
included if the loan was part of the pool at the time of securitization and all required ongoing asset-level
disclosures about the asset. The final rules include a data point that captures whether an asset was added to
the pool during the reporting period.

732

See the 2010 ABS Proposing Release at 23367.

245

issuers will not need to bear the burden or cost of assessing whether an updated Schedule L is
required if the requirements of Item 6.05 were triggered. 733
We also recognize that aggregating the data points proposed in Schedules L and L-D into
one schedule may increase the number of data points that an issuer will need to respond to at the
time of the offering and on an ongoing basis. We do not believe that this change increases the
data issuers must collect about the assets beyond what was proposed as the unified schedule
primarily consists of information proposed to be provided under Schedule L and Schedule L-D.
Under the rule we are adopting, the issuer will be required, at the time of the offering, to provide
all the information relating to the underwriting of the asset (e.g., terms of the asset, obligor
characteristics determined at origination) and any applicable performance related information for
the most recent reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the issuer will be required to provide the
relevant ongoing performance information for the most recent reporting period and the
underwriting information previously provided about the asset. Issuers may incur some increased
filing costs compared to what they would have incurred under the proposal because they will be
verifying and filing more data at each filing. Although we cannot quantify the increase in filing

733

The current disclosures required under existing Item 6.05 of Form 8-K are still required if the triggers of
Item 6.05 are met. Item 6.05 is not limited to the reporting of differences in material pool characteristics
that result only from changes in the pool composition and, in fact, it excludes only changes that occur as a
result of the pool assets converting into cash in accordance with their terms. For example, absent a change
in pool composition, if payment activity after the cut-off date would result in a change to the delinquency
or payment statistics that were presented in the prospectus by more than 5% after the cut-off date, but prior
to closing, then disclosure would be required under Item 6.05.

246

costs that issuers may incur, our qualitative assessment is that the increase will not be significant
over what was proposed. 734
We considered, as an alternative, requiring information to be provided only about assets
added to the pool during a reporting period. We believe asset-level information is most useful
when it reflects all the assets actually in the pool. Therefore, we believe that current investors
and potential secondary market investors should have access through the current Form 10-D to
the asset-level information reflecting the assets in the pool at that time. Otherwise those parties
may have to piece together various tables of information to construct the current pool. Piecing
together various tables may lead to confusion and errors and, as a result, market participants may
base their analysis on data that does not provide an accurate picture of the asset pool. Further,
investors rather than issuers would bear the cost of piecing together the disclosures and having
each investor doing so would create duplicative costs.
One investor commenter who supported the same asset-level disclosure in offering
documents and in ongoing reports for most asset classes did not support this format for

734

By aggregating the schedules we are able to omit any duplicate data points found on both schedules. For
instance, the following data points were in proposed Schedule L-D and were omitted from Schedule AL
since they were similar or identical to other data points: Items 1(a) Asset number type; 1(b) Asset number;
1(c) Asset group number; 1(f)(7) Current asset balance; 1(f)(12) Current delinquency status; 1(f)(13)
Number of days payment is past due; 1(f)(14) Current payment status; 1(f)(15) Pay history; 1(f)(18)
Remaining term to maturity; 1(g)(6) Servicing advance methodology; 2(b)(2) Next interest rate change
date; 2(b)(5) Option ARM indicator; 2(e)(1) Modification effective payment date; 2(e)(3) Total capitalized
amount; 2(e)(29) Forgiven principal amount (cumulative); and 2(e)(30) Forgiven interest amount
(cumulative). The following data points were in proposed Schedule L and were omitted from Schedule AL
since they were similar or identical to other data points: Items 1(a)(15) Primary servicer; 2(a)(21)(iv)
Updated DTI (front-end) and 2(a)(21)(iv) Updated DTI (back-end).

247

CMBS. 735 For CMBS, this commenter stated the loan originator and the loan servicer are not
affiliated and, therefore, unifying items in Schedule L and Schedule L-D may be impractical for
the CMBS sector. We considered this concern, but we believe the information is available to
issuers, albeit perhaps at some cost. Thus, Schedule AL enumerates for issuances of CMBS all
of the asset-level disclosures to be provided, if applicable, about the assets in the pool at
securitization and on an ongoing basis.
In the end, we believe this approach is reasonable despite the increased compliance costs,
because this approach provides investors with access, both at the time of the offering and on an
ongoing basis, to more data about the characteristics and performance of the pool assets. As a
result, investors can evaluate the characteristics of the pool with the benefit of a more complete
picture of the pool assets’ characteristics and performance.

XML and the Asset Data File
a)

Proposed Rule

In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we proposed requiring that asset-level information
be provided in XML. We believed that requiring the asset-level data file in XML, a machinereadable language, would allow users to download the data directly into spreadsheets and
databases, analyze it using commercial off-the-shelf software, or use it within their own models
in other software formats.

Comments on Proposed Rule

In response to the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, several commenters supported the use of
XML to report loan-level data 736 and some commenters noted that the residential mortgage
industry already uses XML to transmit data about loans. 737 For CMBS, some commenters
suggested not requiring XML at this time. 738 A few commenters suggested that we not adopt the
XML requirement for RMBS, but instead require the information in comma separated values
(“CSV”). 739 Other commenters also suggested the use of another standard, such as XBRL. 740
As we note above, subsequent to the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, Congress adopted the
Dodd-Frank Act. Section 942(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act added Section 7(c) to the Securities
Act, which requires the Commission to set standards for the format of the data provided by
issuers of an asset-backed security, which shall, to the extent feasible, facilitate the comparison

2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release as to whether the proposed XML format was an adequate
standard for the format of data that facilitated the comparison. We did not receive any comments
suggesting that requiring that asset-level data be provided in XML did not, as it relates to data
standardization, implement Section 7(c) effectively.
Instead, comments on the 2011 Re-Proposing Release reiterated concerns raised in prior
comment letters. For instance, some commenters reiterated their belief that XML should not be
required for CMBS at this time 741 and one of these commenters said requiring XML should be
tied to investor demand. 742 These commenters were concerned with the cost to implement the
standard, 743 the cost of providing the data in duplicate formats, 744 data quality risks, 745 and the
time needed to implement the standard. 746 On the other hand, one commenter believed that the
current format of CMBS reports (CSV, Excel and even PDF) “greatly limits the transparency of
CMBS.” 747

Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Final Rule

After considering the comments received, we are adopting the proposed XML
requirement. We believe requiring asset-level information in a standardized machine-readable
format should lower the cost for investors of collecting data about ABS offerings and should
allow data to be analyzed by investors and other end-users more quickly than if the data was
provided in a non-machine readable format. For instance, if the asset-level data is made
available to investors in a format that is not machine-readable, it would require the manual keyentry of the data into a format that allows statistical analysis and aggregation. Thus, investors
seeking to gain a broad understanding of ABS offerings would either need to spend considerable
time manually collecting the data and manually entering the data into a format that allows for
analysis, thus increasing the time needed to analyze the data, or incur the cost of subscribing to a
financial service provider that specializes in this data aggregation and comparison process.
Further, manual entering of data can lead to errors, thereby reducing data accuracy and
usefulness. Requiring companies to report asset-level data in a standardized machine-readable
format, such as XML, should lower both the time and expense for each investor to access this
data. Since asset-level disclosures will be tagged and can be immediately downloaded into a
larger, more comprehensive database that may include data about other ABS offerings, investors
will not need to manually enter the data or subscribe to a third-party data aggregator. With more
information readily available in a usable format, investors may be able to better distinguish the
merits of various investment choices, thereby allowing investors to better match their risk and
return preferences with ABS issuances having the same risk and return profile. Thus, we expect
that this reduction in the costs of accessing, collecting and analyzing information about the value
251

of ABS will lead to better allocation of capital. We believe that the requirements we are
adopting to require standardized asset-level disclosures in XML fulfill, for the asset types subject
to these requirements, the requirement under the Dodd-Frank Act that we set a standard for the
format of data that facilitates comparison across securities in similar types of assets.
We understand that some commenters expressed concerns regarding the burden and cost
to implement the standard. We recognize that requiring asset-level disclosures in XML will
result in substantial initial set-up costs to filers. 748 In a further attempt to mitigate costs to
issuers, as we discuss below in Section IX.B, we are requiring that issuers comply with the assetlevel disclosures no later than [insert date 60 days plus two years after publication in the Federal
Register], which we believe reduces the burden of implementation by providing time for market
participants to reprogram their systems. With respect to the costs of implementation, we believe
that the costs are justified because we believe investors need the asset-level disclosures in a
standardized machine-readable format that makes the data transparent and comparable. We

748

We estimate the direct costs of converting data from internal formats to rule-compliant XML format the
following way: We assume that a sponsor would work with all asset types and would need to convert the
total of 680 distinct data columns, with 80% of them having direct mapping from internal data types (i.e.,
no additional conversion or modification would be necessary) and 20% being coded (i.e., column value be
a combination or modification of existing data values) and requiring 3 times the effort for direct columns.
One simple column would require 6 hours of work, with a total of 5,712 hours. The deployment
(documentation, internal “roll out” with the first filing, etc.) would add another 10% to the costs, leading to
the total 6,283 hours, or 3.5 full-time equivalents (Senior Database Administrator, Senior Business Analyst
and one and a half Junior Business Analysts). Using salary data from SIFMA’s Management &
Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013, modified by Commission staff to account for a
1,800-hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits and
overhead, we estimate the initial costs would be about $1,445,000 per sponsor. The hardware cost
increment would be de minimis and the maintenance in subsequent periods would be only 5% of build cost.
For some sponsors that specialize on a limited number of asset types the costs could be significantly lower
because they would need to transform fewer data points from their internal format to the rule-compliant
XML format. After necessary adjustments have been made, we expect that the ongoing costs for providing
the data in XML will be minimal.

252

continue to believe that having the asset-level data in a standardized machine-readable format
will enable investors to use commercial off-the-shelf software for analysis of underlying assetlevel data, which will allow them to aggregate, compare and analyze the information.
We also considered, as several commenters suggested, alternative formats to XML, such
as PDF, CSV and XBRL. We do not believe PDF format is a suitable alternative because it is
not a convenient medium for tabular structured data and it is not designed to convey machinereadable data. As explained above, the ability of investors to easily utilize the asset-level data
required of issuers is crucial to its usefulness. We believe that the CSV format is not suitable
either, since any given dataset reported will require more than a single set of uniformly
structured rows and CSV format will not support the disclosure of such datasets easily. Finally,
while XBRL allows issuers to capture the rich complexity of financial information presented in
accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, we do not believe that it is
appropriate for the asset-level disclosure requirements we are adopting. 749 The Asset Data File
will present relatively simpler characteristics of the underlying loan, obligor, underwriting
criteria, and collateral, among other items, that is better suited for XML. Further, the data
extensions available in XBRL are not appropriate for this dataset where comparability of data is
critical and the nature of the repetitive data lends itself to an XML format. In addition, the XML
schema can be easily updated. 750

749

XBRL was derived from the XML standard. See Interactive Data to Improve Financial Reporting
Adopting, Release No. 34-59324 (Jan. 30, 2009) [74 FR 6776].

750

A schema is a set of custom tags and attributes that defines the tagging structure for an XML document.
Extension data is not permitted in the asset-level data file because we believe it would defeat the purpose of

253

4.

Asset Related Documents
a)

Proposed Rule

We understand that a situation may arise where an issuer would need to disclose other
asset-level data not already defined in Schedule AL. To address this situation, we proposed to
include a limited number of “blank” data tags in our XML schema to provide issuers with the
ability to present additional asset-level data not required under the proposal. 751 We also
proposed an “Asset Related Document” that would allow registrants to disclose the definitions or
formulas of any additional asset-level data or provide further explanatory disclosure regarding
the Asset Data File. 752
b)

Comments on Proposed Rule

We received some comments, which were mixed, on the blank tag proposal, but we did
not receive any comments regarding the use of an Asset Related Document. With regard to the
blank tag proposal, one commenter suggested that as long as the information in the blank data
tag is clearly described, neither the number of blank data tags nor the information would add
complexity to the requirements. 753 One commenter, however, did not see the benefit of the
proposed blank tags because new data points can be added as business and reporting needs

standardizing data elements. Extension data allows issuers to add their own data elements to our defined
data elements.

evolve. 754 Another commenter did not believe a blank tag was appropriate or consistent with
“good XML syntax.” 755
c)

Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Final Rule

We continue to believe, given the possible variety of assets and structures for
securitization and that business and reporting needs may evolve faster than changes can be made
to the asset-level requirements, issuers should have the flexibility to provide asset-level data in
addition to what is required by Schedule AL. For instance, we note that some commenters
suggested we adopt data points that we had not proposed. 756 While we are adopting some of the
data points commenters suggested, we are not adopting all the additional data points
recommended for various reasons that we describe above. We encourage issuers to provide any
additional asset-level data that may be appropriate. We believe the flexibility to provide
additional data in a machine-readable format will provide benefits to investors and issuers at no
significant cost.
Under the final requirements, issuers can provide additional asset-level disclosures in an
Asset Related Document and such Asset Related Document(s) must then disclose the tags,
definitions, and formulas for each additional asset-level disclosure. 757 As we stated in the 2004
ABS Adopting Release and 2010 ABS Proposing Release, issuers and underwriters should be

255

mindful of any privacy, consumer protection or other regulatory requirements when providing
additional loan-level information, especially given that the information would be publicly filed
on EDGAR. 758 Finally, issuers may also provide other explanatory disclosure regarding the
asset-level data in an Asset Related Document. 759 As with any information that is part of the
prospectus or ongoing reports, all Asset Related Documents must be filed concurrently with the
Schedule AL it supplements. We are not adopting the blank tag proposal as we are persuaded by
comments that the blank tags are not appropriate, may provide limited benefits and may not be
consistent with “good XML syntax.”

New Form ABS-EE
a)

Proposed Rule

We proposed that the new Asset Data File be filed as an exhibit to certain filings.
Therefore, we proposed changes to Item 601 of Regulation S-K, Rule 11 and 101 of Regulation
S-T, and Form 8-K to accommodate the filing of Asset Data Files. We proposed to define the
XML file required by Schedules L and L-D as an Asset Data File in Rule 11 to Regulation S-T
and proposed corresponding changes to Rule 101 of Regulation S-T mandating electronic
submission. For asset-level disclosures required at the time of the offering, we proposed,
regardless of whether the issuer was registering the offering on Form SF-1 or SF-3, that the
Asset Data File be filed as an exhibit to the appropriate Form 8-K (in the case of an offering)

758

See Section III.C.1.c. of the 2004 ABS Adopting Release and Section III.A.(b)(i) of the 2010 ABS
Proposing Release.

759

See Item 1111(h)(4) of Regulation AB.

256

under proposed Item 6.06 of Form 8-K. Proposed Item 6.06 would have required that issuers file
the Asset Data File as an exhibit to a Form 8-K on the same date a preliminary or final
prospectus is filed or an Item 6.05 of Form 8-K is filed. The proposed requirement would have
also required that any Asset Related Document be filed at the same time the Asset Data File is
filed on EDGAR.
For ongoing reporting of asset-level disclosure, we proposed to require the Asset Data
File and any Asset Related Document be filed with the appropriate Form 10-D. As noted above,
we also proposed an additional exhibit, an Asset Related Document, for registrants to disclose
the definitions or formulas of any additional asset-level data or to provide further explanatory
disclosure regarding the Asset Data File.
b)

Comments on Proposed Rule

We did not receive any comments with respect to the requirement of filing the Asset Data
Files or Asset Related Documents with the Form 8-K (in the case of an offering) or with the
Form 10-D (in the case of a periodic distribution report).
c)

Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Final Rule

We are adopting new Form ABS-EE to facilitate the filing of the new Asset Data Files 760
and Asset Related Documents. 761 The Asset Data Files and the Asset Related Documents are
required to be filed as exhibits to new Form ABS-EE. 762

760

See new Item 601(b)(102) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.601(b)(102)].

761

See new Item 601(b)(103) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.601(b)(103)].

762

See Item 1111(h)(3) of Regulation AB [17 CFR 229.1111(h)(3)].

257

We had proposed that the Asset Data Files and Asset Related Documents be filed with
the Form 8-K because, in the case of a shelf offering, a Form 8-K is typically used to file other
documents related to a registration statement. We had proposed filing the documents with Form
10-D to keep periodic disclosures on the same form. We believe, however, that requiring the
information on a single Form ABS-EE will facilitate the filing of the Asset Data Files and Asset
Related Documents because EDGAR programming for XML files can be specifically tailored for
these types of documents, therefore simplifying filing obligations for issuers. Form ABS-EE
will benefit investors by making it easier for users to run queries on EDGAR to locate these
documents for download.
The fact that the disclosures are filed as exhibits does not impact the fact that the data
contained in the Asset Data Files and the Asset Related Documents are disclosures that are part
of a prospectus or a periodic report, as applicable. 763 As noted earlier, they are required to be
incorporated by reference into the prospectus or the Form 10-D, as applicable. Accordingly,
there is no change to the timing and frequency requirements for filing information to meet our
offering and periodic disclosure rules and the corresponding Form ABS-EE, with the proper
attachments, must be on file and be incorporated by reference into those filings by the time those
filings are made or are required to be made.

763

Forms SF-1, SF-3, and 10-D each include an instruction requiring that any disclosures provided pursuant to
Item 1111(h) of Regulation AB [17 CFR 229.1111(h)] filed as exhibits to Form ABS-EE in accordance
with Items 601(b)(102) or 601(b)(103) [17 CFR 229.601(b)(102) and (b)(103)].

Temporary Hardship Exemption
a)

Proposed Rule

We proposed to revise Rule 201 of Regulation S-T to include a self-executing temporary
hardship exemption for filing the Asset Data File. 764 We also proposed to exclude Asset Data
Files from the continuing hardship exemption under Rule 202 of Regulation S-T. Rule 202
generally allows an issuer to apply for a continuing hardship if it cannot file all or part of a filing
without undue burden or expense. Under the proposed temporary hardship exemption, if the
registrant experiences unanticipated technical difficulties preventing the timely preparation and
submission of an Asset Data File, a registrant would still be considered timely if: the Asset Data
File(s) containing the asset-level data is posted on a Web site on the same day it was due to be
filed on EDGAR; an Asset Data File is filed on EDGAR that contains the Web site address, a
legend is provided in the Asset Data File filed on EDGAR claiming the hardship exemption; and
the Asset Data File(s) are filed on EDGAR within six business days.
b)

Comments on Proposed Rule

We did not receive any comments regarding our proposed self-executing temporary
hardship exemption. We also did not receive any comments on the proposal to exclude Asset
Data Files from the continuing hardship exemption under Rule 202 of Regulation S-T.

764

[17 CFR 232.201]. Rule 201 of Regulation S-T generally provides for a temporary hardship exemption
from the electronic submission of information, without staff or Commission action, when a filer
experiences unanticipated technical difficulties that prevent timely preparation and submission of an
electronic filing. The temporary hardship exemption permits the filer to initially submit the information in
paper format but requires the filer to submit a confirming electronic copy of the information within six
business days of filing the information in paper format.

259

c)

Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Final Rule

We are adopting, as proposed, a temporary hardship exemption. Under the requirement,
if an issuer experiences unanticipated technical difficulties preventing the timely preparation and
submission of an Asset Data File required to be filed on EDGAR, it may still be considered
timely. For the Asset Data File, an issuer will still be considered timely if: the Asset Data File is
posted on a Web site accessible to the public on the same day it was due to be filed on EDGAR;
a Form ABS-EE is filed that identifies the Web site address where the file can be located; a
legend is provided claiming the hardship exemption; and the Asset Data File is filed on EDGAR
within six business days. 765 We believe that the hardship exemption will benefit both issuers and
investors, because it will allow issuers to maintain compliance with our rules while providing
investors with access to the information required to be disclosed without further delay.
We are also excluding the Asset Data File, as proposed, from the continuing hardship
exemption under Rule 202 of Regulation S-T. We continue to believe that a continuing hardship
exemption is not appropriate with respect to the Asset Data File because the Asset Data File is an
integral part of the prospectus and periodic reports. We also believe that for ABS issuers the
information in machine-readable format is generally already collected and stored on a servicer’s
systems. Therefore, we do not believe it would be appropriate for issuers to receive a continuing
hardship exemption for the Asset Data File. We believe all investors will benefit from receiving

765

See Rule 201(d) and (e) of Regulation S-T [17 CFR 232.201].

260

the disclosures specified in Schedule AL in a format that will allow them to effectively utilize the
information.

Foreign ABS

We requested comment on whether there are other privacy issues that arise for issuers of
ABS backed by foreign assets. 766 The responses we received indicated concerns regarding
foreign privacy laws, 767 as well as concerns related to variations in the characteristics of
consumer receivables originated in different jurisdictions, 768 the inconsistencies between our
proposal and other countries’ disclosure and reporting standards, 769 and certain terms or
structures used in the proposed rule that lack a direct European equivalent. 770 As an alternative
to our proposal, some commenters requested that the disclosure standards for transactions
involving assets located outside the United States be based on local requirements. 771 In response

766

See Section III.A(b)(i) of the 2010 ABS Proposing Release. We asked: (1) Are there other privacy issues
that arise for issuers of ABS backed by foreign assets? (2) How do the privacy laws of foreign jurisdictions
differ from U.S. privacy laws? (3) If the privacy laws of foreign jurisdictions are more restrictive regarding
the disclosure of information how should we accommodate issuers of ABS backed by foreign assets? (4) Is
there substitute information that could be provided to investors?

to the 2014 Re-Opening Release, a few commenters raised cost and burden concerns about
foreign ABS issuers’ compliance with overlapping regulatory regimes. 772 A few commenters
suggested flexible requirements for foreign ABS issuers to account for differences in the
applicability and availability of information or a substitute compliance regime to account for
differences between jurisdictions, including differences between the privacy laws of foreign
jurisdictions. 773
We have reviewed the requirements we are adopting against the requirements adopted by
the European Central Bank 774 and the Bank of England. 775 We note several similarities and
differences between our requirements and theirs, and we believe that perfect agreement between
the Commission’s requirements and the requirements of all foreign jurisdictions may not be
achievable. We believe U.S. investors may expect data in a certain format and/or a certain level
of disclosure that is not required under the requirements of other jurisdictions, some of which
require the information for supervisory purposes and not specifically for the benefit of

available outside of a U.S. context) and AFME (suggesting a similar regime, but stating that if compliance
with local requirements was not appropriate, then a “provide-or-explain” regime would be a helpful
alternative).

investors. 776 In addition, the underlying assets, the form of issuance, parties to the structures,
terms and definitions and the structures themselves vary across jurisdictions. We also note that
the privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, resulting in disclosure requirements of one jurisdiction
that may conflict with the privacy laws in another jurisdiction.
We are not persuaded, however, that the Commission should implement a regime that
would recognize the asset-level data requirements developed by foreign authorities, for example
the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, that are tailored to assets originated outside
of the U.S. or a “provide-or-explain” type regime that would permit selective disclosure based
upon foreign laws. We continue to believe, as for U.S. originated assets, the usefulness of assetlevel data is generally limited unless the data is standardized. We believe adopting another
disclosure regime for foreign asset ABS would reduce standardization and, thereby, the
comparability of ABS backed by assets originated outside of the U.S. and ABS backed by assets
originated within the U.S. Further, a provide-or-explain regime lowers the comparability of ABS
pools comprised of assets originated outside the U.S. against each other as the scope of
disclosures provided by each issuer for each ABS may differ depending on the privacy laws of

costs for foreign market participants may arise; however, we believe U.S. investors should
receive the same data about ABS backed by assets originated outside the U.S. as ABS backed by
assets originated within the U.S. This approach is consistent with our approach for corporate
issuers, under which foreign private issuers generally provide comparable information to U.S.
issuers.

Identification of the Originator
a)

Proposed Rule

In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we noted that Item 1110(a) of Regulation AB, prior
to the adoption of today’s amendments, required identification of originators apart from the
sponsor or its affiliates only if the originator has originated, or expects to originate, 10% or more
of the pool assets. We noted that in situations where many of the pool assets have been
purchased from originators other than the sponsor and each of these originators originated less
than 10% of the pool assets that the requirement requires very little, if any, information about the
originators. Therefore, we proposed to amend the item to require that an originator originating
less than 10% of the pool assets would be required to be identified if the cumulative amount of
originated assets by parties other than the sponsor or its affiliates comprises more than 10% of
the total pool assets.

264

b)

Comments on Proposed Rule

Comments on the proposal were focused on the scope of the requirement. Commenters
argued that the rule should require disclosure identifying the originator of each asset without
exception. 777 Another commenter recommended that the requirement be modified to include a
low threshold (e.g., 2% of the original pool assets) under which identification of the nonaffiliated originators would not be required. 778 In contrast, one commenter believed that the
proposal was excessive with the costs outweighing the benefits and recommended keeping the
current requirement and supplementing it with disclosure of “additional originators to the extent
necessary so that information about the originators of at least 85% of the pool assets has been
included in the prospectus.” 779 Another commenter stated that disclosure of only third parties
who originated more than 10% of the pool and all originators who provided 5% or more of the
pool by dollar value would be more valuable to investors. 780
c)

Final Rule

After considering the comments received, we are adopting the amendment to Item
1110(a) of Regulation AB, as proposed, with a slight modification to clarify the change that we
are making to the existing requirement. Under the final rule that we are adopting, if the

be identified).

cumulative amount of originated assets by parties, other than the sponsor or its affiliates,
comprises more than 10% of the total pool assets, then those originator(s) originating less than
10% of the pool assets will also be required to be identified in the prospectus. We continue to
believe that where the sponsor securitizes assets of a group of originators that are not affiliated
with the sponsor, more disclosure regarding the originators of the assets is needed. We believe
investors will benefit from these disclosures because they will be better able to assess pools
comprising assets from these originators. We acknowledge that the revised rule will likely result
in more originators having to be identified in the prospectus than is currently required; however,
we do not think that it will result in significant costs to issuers since the information is readily
available and the disclosure is limited only to identification of the originator. In addition, while
we note that some commenters requested that we impose an additional minimum threshold
before issuers would be required to identify unaffiliated originators, 781 we do not believe that
such a distinction would be appropriate for the same reasons.
2.
Financial Information Regarding a Party Obligated to Repurchase
Assets
a)

Proposed Rule

In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we noted that in the events arising out of the
financial crisis, the financial condition of the party obligated to repurchase assets pursuant to the
transaction agreement governing an asset securitization became increasingly important as to

781

See letters from BoA I, CFA I, and VABSS I.

266

whether repayments on asset-backed securities would be made. 782 We proposed to require
disclosure of the financial condition of certain parties required to repurchase assets when there is
a breach, pursuant to the transaction agreements, of a representation and warranty related to pool
assets. Under the proposal, information regarding the financial condition of a 20% originator
would be required if there is a material risk that the financial condition could have a material
impact on the origination of the originator’s assets in the pool or on its ability to comply with
provisions relating to the repurchase obligations for those assets. Information about the
sponsor’s financial condition similarly would be required to the extent that there is a material
risk that the financial condition could have a material impact on its ability to comply with the
provisions relating to the repurchase obligations for those assets or otherwise materially impact
the pool.
b)

Comments on Proposed Rule

The response to the proposal was mixed with some commenters supporting the
proposal, 783 some commenters opposing the proposal, 784 and other commenters who did not

782

See the 2010 ABS Proposing Release at 23382. In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we also proposed to
amend Item 1104 and Item 1110 of Regulation AB to require disclosure of the amount, if material, of
publicly securitized assets originated or sold by the sponsor or an identified originator that were the subject
of a demand to repurchase or replace any of the assets for breach of the representations and warranties
concerning the pool assets in the last three years pursuant to the transaction agreements. This proposal and
the comments on this proposal were considered in connection with the rules implementing Section 943 of
the Dodd-Frank Act. See the Section 943 Adopting Release. Therefore, the proposal and related
comments are not addressed in this release.

783

See letters from ASF I (supporting the proposal, but suggesting that we revise the standard for when such
disclosure is required to mirror the requirement regarding financial information of certain servicers

financial condition would have an effect on origination of the pool assets or on its ability to comply with
any repurchase obligations in a manner that could have a material impact on pool performance or

concern, raised by some commenters who opposed the proposal, was that investors may perceive
the disclosure and the existence of representations and warranties as suggesting that the obligated
parties are providing credit or liquidity support to the transaction. 786 Some commenters stated
that the disclosure requirement may act as a barrier to entry for participation in the securitization
markets, may potentially be misleading because it would likely be provided long before
repurchase demands would be made, and in most instances disclosure would be required because

proposal will vary depending, in part, on whether the financial information must be audited and urging the
Commission to weigh the cost of requiring audited financials against such benefit). See also letters from

Ernst & Young dated Aug. 2, 2010 submitted in response to the 2010 ABS Proposing Release (“E&Y”)
(requesting other revisions). These commenters contended that the proposed amendments to Item 1104 and
Item 1110(b) would require a subjective evaluation of the materiality of the risk and recommended, instead,
to expand the scope of the definition of significant obligor in Item 1112 (i.e., to incorporate the obligated
party that is required to repurchase assets for breach of a warranty or representation) or to expand the scope
of Item 1114, the requirement relating to disclosure of significant credit enhancements, to include
repurchase and replacement obligations – thereby providing an objective standard for determining when
and how the requisite financial disclosure should be provided. Under this standard, the required financial
information would be (1) the selected financial data specified by Item 301 of Regulation S-K when the
obligation exceeds 10% of the asset pool, and (2) audited financial statements that comply with Regulation
S-X when the obligation exceeds 20% of the asset pool.

an obligated party’s financial condition would likely always impact a party’s ability to perform
its repurchase-related obligations. 787
c)

Final Rule

After considering the comments received, we are adopting the amendments to Item 1104
and Item 1110, with some modification. We have revised the amendments so that the standard
for when disclosure of financial information is required mirrors the existing standard for
disclosures required about certain servicers. 788 Under the revised rules, the standard focuses on
whether the sponsor or 20% originator’s financial condition would have an effect on its ability to
comply with any repurchase obligations in a manner that could have a material impact on pool
performance or performance of the asset-backed securities.
We are adopting these amendments because we believe an investor’s ABS investment
decision includes consideration of obligations from certain parties to repurchase assets if there is
a breach of the representations and warranties relating to those assets and the capacity of those
parties to repurchase those assets. As evident from the crisis, the mere existence of a repurchase
provision provides investors with little comfort as to the ability of the party obligated to

See letters from CREFC I and MBA I. See also letter from CMBP (recommending instead to require
sponsors to certify that: all the originators that have sold assets to the pool backing the ABS meet the
sponsor’s standards of creditworthiness, the sponsor’s standards are customary and commercially
reasonable, and based on the sponsor’s assessment that each originator has the financial means to discharge
their obligations under the representations and warranties regarding the pool assets).

788

See Item 1108(b)(4) of Regulation AB (requiring information regarding the servicer’s financial condition to
the extent that there is a material risk that the effect on one or more aspects of servicing resulting from such
financial condition could have a material impact on pool performance or performance of the asset-backed
securities).

269

repurchase assets for a breach of a representation or warranty. 789 The expanded disclosure that
we are requiring will provide investors insight into the capacity of the obligated parties to
repurchase assets. We acknowledge that the financial condition of these parties may change
between the time of the transaction, when the disclosure is provided, and when a repurchase is
required. We believe that investors will nonetheless benefit from the required information
because it will allow investors to assess, at the time of their investment decision, whether the
representations and warranties provided regarding the pool assets are made by entities financially
capable of fulfilling their obligations.
We also note the concerns that some of these parties are private companies who may
choose to exit the securitization market rather than provide financial disclosures. While we
acknowledge this possibility, we believe that this information is material for investors in order to
make an informed investment decision. Furthermore, we believe this concern is minimized, to
some extent, because the requirement does not necessarily require financial statements, but only
information about their financial condition similar to the type of disclosure required under
current rules regarding financial information of certain servicers, some of which may be private
companies. Where disclosure is required, the type and extent of information regarding certain
originators’ and sponsors’ financial condition would depend upon the particular facts. We note

789

See Transparency in Accounting: Proposed Changes to Accounting for Off-Balance Sheet Entities Before
the Subcomm. on Sec., Ins., & Inv. of the S. Comm. on Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs, 110th Cong. 3
(2008) (statement of Joseph Mason, Professor at Louisiana State University) (stating that “‘representations
and warranties’ have become a mechanism for subsidizing pool performance, so that no asset- or mortgagebacked security investor experiences losses – until the seller, itself, fails and is no longer able to support the
pool”).

270

that sponsors will typically conduct due diligence regarding the pool assets when purchasing
assets to include in the ABS pool, including assessing the financial condition of originators that
are obligated to repurchase or replace any asset for breach of a representation and warranty
pursuant to the transaction agreements. We believe that when the trigger for disclosure of the
financial information of sponsors and 20% originators is met, as outlined in the rule, investors
should have the same information. We are mindful, however, of the costs that originators and
sponsors would incur if we required audited financial information, especially for those
originators and sponsors that have not previously been subject to an audit; therefore, we are not
requiring that financial information included be audited.
3.

Economic Interest in the Transaction
a)

Proposed Rule

In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we noted that existing Item 1103(a)(3)(i) of
Regulation AB required disclosure of the classes of securities offered by the prospectus and any
class of securities issued in the same transaction or residual or equity interests in the transaction
that are not being offered by the prospectus. 790 We also noted our belief that information
regarding the sponsor’s, a servicer’s, or a 20% originator’s continuing interest in the pool assets
is important to an ABS investor and, therefore, we proposed to revise Items 1104, 1108, and
1110 to require disclosure regarding the sponsor’s, a servicer’s, or a 20% originator’s interest

790

17 CFR 229.1103(a)(3)(i).

271

retained in the transaction, including the amount and nature of that interest. 791 The disclosure
would be required for both shelf and other offerings. 792
b)

Comments on Proposed Rule

Several commenters supported the proposed rule but recommended certain revisions. 793
Some of these commenters suggested that the required disclosures include the effect of
hedging. 794 For instance, one commenter stated that the rule should state that the disclosure
should be net of hedging, 795 and the other commenter recommended requiring the sponsor to
disclose “any hedge (security specific or portfolio) that was entered into by the sponsor or, to the
extent it has actual knowledge of such a hedge, an affiliate in an effort to offset any risk retention
position held by the sponsor or an affiliate.” 796
Another commenter requested that we limit the retention disclosure requirements “to
those required in any risk retention construct that may be included in the final rules.” 797 The
commenter acknowledged that it “is difficult for investors to ascertain how many securities

791

For example, if the originator has retained a portion of each tranche of the securitization, then disclosure
regarding each amount retained for each tranche would be required.

792

We also proposed that if the offering was being registered on Form SF-1, the issuer would be required to
provide clear disclosure that the sponsor is not required by law to retain any interest in the securities and
may sell any interest initially retained at any time.

793

See letters from ABA I (supporting this requirement in lieu of the proposed risk retention shelf eligibility
requirement because this disclosure will ensure that investors are fully aware of the alignment of interests
in each offering), ASF I (expressed views of investors only) (believing that if the sponsor of the
securitization retains exposure to the risks of the assets, the sponsor will likely have greater incentives to
include higher quality assets), Mass. Atty. Gen., and Prudential I.

cleared the market and how many were taken down by the issuer or sponsor,” but that disclosure
of any retention held above a required amount would be impractical and misleading because
accurate information about retention interests may not be known until closing, which is after
investors make their investment decision, and the retention interests often change during the
period between the time of sale and closing.
c)

Final Rule

After considering the comments received, we are adopting the proposed revisions to
Items 1104, 1108, and 1110 with some modifications. 798 As noted below, the requirements that
we are adopting for shelf eligibility do not contain a requirement for risk retention in light of the
risk retention proposals currently being considered by regulators under the Dodd-Frank Act. 799
Because commenters noted that disclosure about a sponsor’s, a servicer’s, or a 20% originator’s
continuing interest in the pool assets is an important factor that investors consider when
analyzing the alignment of interests among various parties in the securitization chain, we are
adopting this rule. 800 We are also persuaded by commenters that this disclosure should describe
the effect of hedging because a hedge could effectively reduce the actual exposure that the party

798

For purposes of describing any interest that the sponsor, servicer, or 20% originator, retained in the
transaction, such disclosure must also include any interest held by an affiliate of such entity, except as
described below for certain hedges entered into by affiliates, disclosure is required to the extent
known. We have made conforming changes to the final rule to clarify the treatment of affiliates. As
discussed later in Section VIII.A.3 Changes in Sponsor’s Interest in the Securities, we are also adopting a
requirement that any material change in the sponsor’s interest in the securities must be disclosed on Form
10-D.

799

See the 2011 Risk Retention Proposing Release and the 2013 Risk Retention Re-Proposing Release.

800

See also footnote 1320 (describing one commenter’s views on the importance of requiring disclosure of any
material change in the sponsor’s interest in the transaction).

273

may face from its continuing interest in the pool assets. 801 We do not believe that providing
disclosure of the interests retained by the sponsor, servicer, or 20% originator net of hedging
alone, as suggested by one commenter, provides investors with sufficient insight into the hedging
activities used by these entities to minimize exposure to their interests. Therefore, we are
adopting the rule that each of these parties disclose their continuing interest in the pool assets,
including the amount and nature of that interest, and disclose any hedge (security specific or
portfolio) materially related to the credit risk of the securities that was entered into by these
parties or, if known, by any affiliate of these parties to offset any risk position held. 802 We
believe this approach provides investors with appropriate information about these entities’
continuing interest in the pool assets and how these parties may be managing those exposures.
We also acknowledge the concerns that the exact amount retained by these parties may
not be known until closing and that these retention interests may and do often change during the
period between the time of sale and closing. 803 To address these concerns, the parties will only
need to describe in the preliminary prospectus the amount and nature of the interest that they
intend to retain. The parties must, however, also disclose in the preliminary prospectus the
amount and nature of risk retention that they have retained in order to comply with law (for

801

We also note that Section 15G of the Exchange Act, as added by Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act,
requires that the risk retention rules, to be finalized by regulators, must prohibit a securitizer from directly
or indirectly hedging the credit risk required to be retained under the rules.

802

Because we believe that a security-specific hedge is more likely to be material to investors, we anticipate
that issuers will need to provide more detailed disclosure about such hedge in order for investors to
understand the impact such hedge may have on the ABS.

803

See letter from CREFC I.

274

example, to comply with the final risk retention rules once they are adopted). 804 In order to
clarify the requirement, we have included an instruction specifying that the amount and nature of
the interest or asset retained in compliance with law must be separately stated in the preliminary
prospectus. 805 For purposes of the final prospectus, the parties must also disclose the actual
amount and nature of the interest to be retained.
4.
Economic Analysis Related to the Rules Regarding Transaction
Parties
The rules discussed in this section seek to provide ABS investors with greater
information about the transaction parties to a securitization, thereby allowing them to make more
informed investment decisions. First, investors will now be able to identify a potentially larger
number of the originators of pool assets, which will improve their ability to compare the loan
performance across originators and assess the relative stringency of these originators’
underwriting standards as well as their historical performance. Second, at the time of an ABS
offering, investors will now be able to better assess the ability of parties obligated to repurchase
assets to actually fulfill those obligations. This will allow investors to more accurately assess the
representations and warranties in the transaction agreements, since the enforceability of these
depends on the ability of the obligated party to repurchase breached assets. Third, investors will
now have information about the sponsor’s, servicer’s, or a 20% originator’s interest retained in
the transaction net of hedging. Investors have indicated that this information will be beneficial to

804

See the 2013 Risk Retention Re-Proposing Release.

805

See letter from CREFC I (noting that the nature and amount of retained interests held to fulfill risk
retention requirements could be disclosed in the prospectus).

275

them because the information will allow them to consider the incentives of the various parties
involved in the securitization chain.
The costs of the revised rule will be borne primarily by issuers, who will be required to
provide additional disclosure about the transaction parties to a securitization. The magnitude of
the costs will depend on the extent to which issuers already gather the required information. For
instance, on the one hand, issuers likely already obtain the identities of originators; therefore,
providing that information should not impose significant additional costs. On the other hand,
issuers may need to gather some additional information from third parties regarding the financial
condition of an originator who originated 20% or more of the pool assets and is obligated to
repurchase assets under the transaction agreements. As a result, issuers may incur costs to gather
the financial data and then prepare and provide the required disclosure. However, we believe
that the revised rule strikes the appropriate balance between the benefit of providing investors
with useful information about the originators and the burden of requiring the identification of all
originators, regardless of the amount they contributed to the pool.
Some commenters were concerned that disclosing the financial condition of a party
obligated to repurchase assets may impose an indirect cost on investors, if investors misinterpret
this disclosure and the existence of representations and warranties as the obligated parties
providing credit or liquidity support to the transaction. In light of our other rules on disclosure of
credit and liquidity support, we believe investors will see a clear distinction between the
representations and warranties and any credit or liquidity support provided. Similarly, some
commenters were concerned that the disclosure may be misleading to investors because the
financial condition of the party may have changed between the time of the transaction when the
276

disclosure was provided and the repurchase demand. We believe that investors will still benefit
from the required information since it will allow investors to assess at the time of making their
investment decision whether the entities that provided representations and warranties regarding
the pool assets are, at least as an initial matter, financially capable of fulfilling their obligations.
B.

Prospectus Summary
1.

Proposed Rule

In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we noted that a prospectus summary should briefly
highlight the material terms of the transaction, including an overview of the material
characteristics of the asset pool. We also noted our belief that the prospectus summaries
provided in ABS prospectuses may not adequately highlight the material characteristics,
including material risks, particular to the ABS being offered. Instead, these prospectus
summaries often summarize types of information that are common to all securitizations of a
particular asset class. 806 Accordingly, we proposed a new instruction to clarify the prospectus
summary disclosure requirements. 807 Specifically, the proposed instruction noted that the
prospectus summary disclosure may include, among other things, statistical information of: the
types of underwriting or origination programs, exceptions to underwriting or origination criteria,
and, if applicable, modifications made to the pool assets after origination.

Comments on Proposed Rule

Comments on the proposal were mixed. 808 One commenter, who was supportive of the
proposal, stated that the instruction would help “highlight potential risks relating to the
underwriting of the underlying pool assets.” 809 Another commenter, who opposed the proposed
instruction, requested an exception for CMBS transactions stating that each commercial
mortgage is unique and, as a result, the proposed disclosures would not enhance an investor’s
understanding of the risks and characteristics of a particular CMBS loan pool. 810 One
commenter stated that the instruction runs counter to the Commission’s plain English rules
because it requires the repeating of disclosure in different sections of the document without
enhancing the quality of the information. 811 This commenter also contended that the proposed
instruction seems to encourage reliance on a summary of information that should be considered
in the fuller context of the narrative in the body of the prospectus. The commenter suggested
that we reconsider the proposal or, in the alternative, require only a cross-reference in the
summary to the location of this information in the body of the prospectus. 812

3.

Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Final Rule

After considering comments received, we are adopting the proposed instruction with
revisions. From our experience, the prospectus summaries often summarize types of information
that are common to all securitizations of a particular asset class rather than the material
characteristics of the particular ABS, such as statistics regarding whether the loans in the asset
pool were originated under various underwriting or origination programs, whether loans were
underwritten as exceptions to the underwriting or originations programs, or whether the loans in
the pool have been modified. 813 We believe that investors would benefit from a prospectus
summary that summarizes the disclosures in the prospectus regarding this type of information
because presenting this information in a summarized format may aid investors’ understanding of
material characteristics. In that regard, we also believe that the final instruction is less
prescriptive than one commenter suggested since it does not require specific disclosure but rather
indicates the types of information that may be summarized. We acknowledge that the prospectus
summary should be brief and should not contain, and is not required to contain, all of the detailed
information in the prospectus and, therefore, issuers should not simply repeat the disclosure
found elsewhere in the prospectus in the prospectus summary. We also acknowledge that more
fulsome narrative disclosures discussing these summary statistics may provide greater context

813

For example, the prospectus summary should include summarized information about the disclosure
required as part of the issuer review performed under Securities Act Rule 193. In particular, Item 1111 of
Regulation AB requires an ABS issuer to disclose the nature of its review of the assets and the findings and
conclusions of the issuer’s review of the assets, which includes its conclusion that the review was designed
and effected to provide reasonable assurance that the disclosure in the prospectus regarding the assets is
accurate in all material respects.

279

about these disclosures; therefore, we added as part of the final instruction a requirement to
include a cross-reference in the prospectus summary to the location of corresponding disclosure
in the body of the prospectus.
The costs associated with this disclosure should be minimal as the issuer should already
have this information, or be able to easily generate the information, in light of the more detailed
disclosure required by other item requirements in Regulation AB. Furthermore, this is not a new
requirement, but rather a clarification of our position on what should be provided in the
prospectus summary. Finally, if this disclosure is not appropriate for a particular asset class, then
existing Item 1103(a) addresses this concern by indicating that the disclosure is only required
where applicable. 814

Modification of Underlying Assets
1.

Proposed Rule and Comments on Proposed Rule

In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we proposed to replace Item 1108(c)(6) of
Regulation AB with a more detailed and specific disclosure requirement in Item 1111. 815 Item
1108(c)(6) requires disclosure to the extent material of any ability of the servicer to waive or
modify any terms, fees, penalties, or payments on the assets and the effect of exercising such

814

See Item 1103(a) of Regulation AB [17 CFR 229.1103(a)] (stating in providing the information required by
Item 503(a) of Regulation S-K, provide the following information in the prospectus summary, as
applicable).

815

17 CFR 229.1111. In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we proposed to amend Item 1111 to require
disclosure regarding deviations to disclosed underwriting standards. The proposal would have also
required disclosure of the steps taken by the originator to verify information received during the
underwriting process. These proposals and the comments on the proposals were later considered and acted
upon in connection with the rules implementing Section 945 of the Dodd-Frank Act. See Issuer Review of
Assets in Offerings of Asset-Backed Securities, Release No. 33-9176 (Jan. 20, 2011).

ability, if material, on the potential cash flows from the assets. The proposed requirement in
Item 1111 would require a description of the provisions in the transaction agreements governing
modification of the assets and disclosure regarding how modifications may affect cash flows
from the assets or to the securities. We received only one comment on the proposal, which
supported the proposed amendments. 816
2.

Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Final Rule

We are adopting the final rule, as proposed. We continue to believe that the ability of the
servicer to modify any terms, fees, and penalties and the effect of this ability on potential cash
flows remains an important factor to investors. We believe that more granular data about this
ability will enable investors to better assess the possibility of a potential change in the cash
flows, which should, in turn, promote more efficient allocation of capital. To the extent issuers
will be providing more detail than they previously provided, issuers’ costs to provide the
required disclosure will likely increase.
D.

Disclosure of Fraud Representations

We also proposed to revise Item 1111(e) to require disclosure of whether a representation
was included among the representations and warranties that no fraud has taken place in
connection with the origination of the assets on the part of the originator or any party involved in
the origination of the assets. In proposing this requirement, we believed that it was important
that any fraud representation be highlighted to investors.

816

See letter from MBA I.

281

Several commenters were opposed to the proposed requirement. 817 One commenter
noted that both its investor and issuer members agreed that the absence of fraud in the origination
is an element of several representations and warranties concerning the pool assets, such as the
representation and warranty stating that the pool assets were originated in compliance with the
requirements of law and applicable underwriting standards, and that the pool assets are legal,
valid, and binding payment obligations of the related obligors. 818 This commenter further noted
that singling out a fraud representation in the disclosure was unnecessary and duplicative in light
of our other proposal that would require issuers to provide disclosure on representations and
warranties. Another commenter stated that the proposed requirement did not pass a reasonable
cost-benefit test and, without clarifying why, stated that the disclosure would not benefit
investors. 819 This commenter suggested that we not adopt the proposed requirement and instead
require a restatement or identification of the specific fraud representation, if any, included in the
transaction “rather than including a binary response to whether or not there is a fraud
representation.” 820
After considering the comments we received, we are not adopting the proposed revisions
to Item 1111(e). As one commenter noted, the absence of fraud may be an element of several

representations and warranties concerning the pool assets and therefore is already adequately
disclosed under the current requirements of Item 1111(e).
E.

Static Pool Disclosure
1.

Disclosure Required
a)

Proposed Rule

In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we noted that since the adoption of Regulation AB
we have observed that static pool information provided by asset-backed issuers may vary greatly
within the same asset class. Variations exist not only with the type or category of information
disclosed but also with the manner in which it is disclosed. As a result, static pool information
between different sponsors has not necessarily been comparable, which reduces its value to
investors.
To address this problem, we proposed revisions to Item 1105 of Regulation AB 821 to
increase the clarity, transparency, and comparability of static pool information. Some of the
proposed rules would apply to all issuers, and other proposed rules would apply only to
amortizing asset pools and not to revolving asset master trusts. For all issuers, we proposed the
following five requirements. 822 First, we proposed to require appropriate introductory and
explanatory information to introduce the characteristics. Second, we proposed to require that
issuers describe the methodology used in determining or calculating the characteristics and
describe any terms or abbreviations used. Third, we proposed to require a description of how the

821

17 CFR 229.1105.

822

See the 2010 ABS Proposing Release at 23385.

283

assets in the static pool differ from the pool assets underlying the securities being offered.
Fourth, we proposed to require additional disclosure if an issuer does not include static pool
information or includes disclosure that is intended to serve as alternative static pool information.
Finally, we proposed to require graphical presentation of the static pool information, if doing so
would aid in understanding.
b)

Comments on Proposed Rule

Commenters were generally supportive of these proposed rules 823 and mostly requested
that the Commission clarify certain aspects. 824 Some commenters were supportive of the
proposal to provide narrative disclosure. 825 One commenter stated that the inclusion of
explanatory information introducing the characteristics of the static pool would increase the
clarity of the required static pool disclosure. 826 Other commenters requested greater clarification
about the narrative disclosure requirements. For instance, one commenter believed that it was
unclear whether “narrative disclosure” would permit presentation in tabular format. 827 Another
commenter expressed concern with the RMBS example provided in the 2010 ABS Proposing
Release and noted that one of the aspects we listed – the number of loans that were exceptions to

284

standardized underwriting – is qualitatively different and more granular and detailed than the
other aspects listed (i.e., number of assets and types of mortgages). 828
One commenter, supportive of the proposal to require a description of the methodology
used in determining or calculating the characteristics, urged the Commission to require that the
methodologies used by issuers be standardized to facilitate comparison of securities within the
same asset class. 829 This commenter also emphasized that key defined terms, such as
“delinquency” and “default” must be standardized.
Several commenters provided differing views on whether the proposal to require a
description of how the assets in the static pool differ from the pool assets underlying the
securities being offered was necessary or helpful to investors. One commenter indicated that this
disclosure is helpful in understanding “pool construction risk.” 830 Another commenter, however,
argued that it did not understand how this requirement adds anything to the proposed narrative
disclosure. 831

828

See letter from ASF I. See also the 2010 ABS Proposing Release at 23385. In the 2010 ABS Proposing
Release, we illustrated the narrative disclosure that would be required using RMBS as an example. We
noted that for a pool of RMBS the disclosure would include the number of assets, the types of mortgages,
and the number of loans that were exceptions to the standardized underwriting criteria.

829

See letter from AMI.

830

See letter from Prudential I (recommending that “[t]he prospectus should highlight the extent to which the
current collateral pool was originated with the same or differing underwriting criteria, loan terms, and/or
risk tolerances than the static pool data”).

831

See letter from VABSS I (stating its hope that the Commission is not suggesting that, for each offering,
registrants should include a description of how the securitized pool differs from each of the 3 to 25 static
pools, as the commenter believes that such disclosure would simply compare the disclosed metrics for each
pool and therefore would provide no incremental value to investors).

285

With respect to requiring an issuer to explain why it did not provide static pool
information or provided alternative information, one commenter interpreted this proposal as
capable of being satisfied through summary disclosure stating that either the data are not
available or that static pool disclosure is immaterial. 832
One commenter opposed requiring the graphical presentation of static pool information in
addition to the proposed narrative description. 833 This commenter asserted its belief that
graphical presentation is not market practice, has “highly questionable utility” and is possibly
misleading. This commenter supported, however, graphical presentation of delinquency, loss,
and prepayment information for amortizing pools.
c)

Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Final Rule

After considering the comments provided, we are adopting the requirements as
proposed. 834 First, we are amending Item 1105 to require narrative disclosure that provides
introductory and explanatory information to introduce the static pool information presented. We
continue to believe that a brief snapshot of the static pool information presented will benefit
investors by providing them with context in which to evaluate the information, especially for
those investors who lack sophisticated analytical tools. 835 We do not intend for the requirement
to cause issuers to repeat the underlying static pool disclosure in the narrative; rather we intend

832

See letter from BoA I (urging reconsideration of any standard that would require disclosure of a “detailed
analysis of materiality” and stating that “[a]n analysis of an issuer’s methodology for making materiality
determinations is not a proper subject of prospectus disclosure”).

833

See letter from BoA I.

834

See Item 1105 of Regulation AB [17 CFR 229.1105].

835

See the 2010 ABS Proposing Release at 23385.

286

for the requirement to serve as a clear and brief introduction of the static pool disclosure in order
to provide context to investors. We do believe, however, that the type of narrative disclosure
that we are requiring is best presented in paragraph format, and not in tabular format as one
commenter recommended, in order for the narrative description to clearly convey to investors the
differences in the assets being securitized in the deal and the assets comprising the static
pools. 836
To aid issuers in understanding what the narrative disclosure would typically include, and
as commenters noted, we provided an example in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, as we have
done in other releases, to illustrate the disclosure principle. 837 In our example, for a pool of
RMBS, the disclosure would typically include, among other things, the number of loans that
were exceptions to the standardized underwriting criteria. As noted above, one commenter
expressed concern and noted that the number of loans that were exceptions to the standardized
underwriting criteria was qualitatively different and granular than the other two characteristics in
the example and raised questions for issuers as how to apply the disclosure standard in a
principled way to distinguish among various credit characteristics of the pool. 838 We believe that
for RMBS, the number of exceptions to the standardized underwriting criteria is an important
credit characteristic for issuers to highlight in the narrative disclosure. Inclusion of a significant

836

See letter from VABSS I. Issuers can supplement the narrative disclosure that is required to be provided in
paragraph format with graphical presentation if doing so would aid in understanding.

837

See the 2010 ABS Proposing Release at 23385.

838

See letter from ASF I. We discuss amendments to Item 1111 requiring specific data about the amount and
characteristics of assets that deviate from the disclosed origination standards in Section III.A.2.a)
Disclosure Requirements for All Asset Classes and Economic Analysis of These Requirements.

287

number of mortgages that deviate from the underwriting standards could pose a risk to the
performance of the RMBS. We believe disclosure of the number of loans that were exceptions
to standardized underwriting criteria is likely to be important to highlight for other asset classes
as well. Issuers should highlight those characteristics that would be most important for investors
to be aware of before analyzing the actual static pool disclosure, which for some asset classes
can be extensive.
Second, we are adopting, as proposed, an amendment to require issuers to describe the
methodology used in determining or calculating the characteristics and also to describe any terms
or abbreviations used. 839 We believe that this requirement will provide clarity and transparency
to investors and assist them in determining whether the calculations or terms are comparable
across issuers. This will benefit investors because it will facilitate their ability to make better
informed investment decisions. One commenter urged the Commission to direct that the
methodologies and key terms used by issuers be converged and standardized over time so that
investors can compare securities within the same asset class. 840 Although we are not adopting
standardized methodologies and terms for static pool disclosure, the proposal we are adopting
requires asset-level disclosures for ABS backed by certain asset types. 841 As a result of the new
asset-level requirements, the data used to produce the static pool information for these asset
classes will be standardized.

839

See Item 1105 of Regulation AB [17 CFR 229.1105].

840

See letter from AMI.

841

See also Section III.A Asset-Level Disclosure Requirement.

288

Third, we are requiring a description of how the assets in the static pool differ from the
pool assets underlying the securities being offered. 842 We continue to believe that this
requirement benefits investors by providing them with context in which to evaluate the
information without sophisticated data analysis tools and, as one commenter noted, to evaluate
pool construction risk. If the pool in the offering is materially different from prior pools, then
the issuer should describe the difference so that investors can factor in that difference when
examining the static pool information. We agree with one commenter’s statement that “[t]he
prospectus should highlight the extent to which the current collateral pool was originated with
the same or differing underwriting criteria, loan terms and/or risk tolerances than the static pool
data.” 843 We also believe that in cases where the assets of the pool being securitized were
underwritten through different origination channels (e.g., loans originated directly through an
originator’s retail channel or through unaffiliated mortgage brokers) compared to prior
securitized pools, disclosure of the proportion of assets originated through each channel should
be provided. To address commenters’ concerns, we are clarifying that we are requiring “a clear
and concise description” of the material differences, if any, from the pool being securitized, but
not a detailed comparison. 844

842

See Item 1105 of Regulation AB [17 CFR 229.1105].

843

See letter from Prudential I.

844

See letter from VABSS I.

289

Fourth, as proposed, the final rule states that the static pool information should be
presented graphically if doing so would aid in understanding. 845 As with the other requirements
discussed above, we believe graphical presentations help investors to more easily evaluate
material information, without the use of sophisticated analytical tools. One commenter stated
that the graphical presentation has “highly questionable utility” and also may be misleading
under many circumstances. 846 We are requiring the issuer to provide a graphical illustration only
if it would be helpful; therefore, if an issuer believes that providing graphical presentation of the
static pool information would not be useful for understanding the data or misleading, then the
issuer would not be required to provide it. However, we generally believe that graphical
presentation of information can be beneficial to investors by helping them to quickly spot trends,
which may not be evident by looking at the numbers alone.
Finally, in addition to providing investors with a clear and brief introduction of the static
pool data, we are also requiring issuers to provide disclosure in cases where an issuer does not
include static pool information or includes disclosure that is intended to serve as alternative static
pool information. 847 It is not always apparent why one issuer does not provide static pool
information or provides alternative disclosure in lieu of such information, when other issuers
within the same asset class provide the information. Therefore, we are requiring that issuers
explain why they have not included static pool disclosure or why they have provided alternative

845

See Item 1105 of Regulation AB [17 CFR 229.1105].

846

See letter from BoA I.

847

See Item 1105 of Regulation AB [17 CFR 229.1105].

290

information. One commenter interpreted this requirement as capable of being satisfied through
summary disclosure, such as stating that the data is not available or not material. 848 While we
are not requiring that the issuer provide an extensive explanation, the issuer should provide some
explanation beyond a conclusory statement that the information is not available or not material.
If the information is not included because it is not material, an issuer should explain why the data
is immaterial, such as if the assets differ so significantly from the assets in the pool being
offered.
We believe that taken together the static pool disclosure requirements adopted will
benefit investors by providing them with more clearly explained and more consistently presented
information about static pools, thereby facilitating their understanding of how the performance of
the static pools may or may not be indicative of how the current pool may perform. This will
help investors make better informed investment decisions and lead to more efficient allocation of
capital. The requirements will be costly to issuers to the extent that they require reformatting
information such as in graphical format. We expect that these costs will be minimal because
issuers can use off-the-shelf software to create the graphs. Issuers will also incur costs for
analyzing prior pools as compared to the current offering, but these costs should not be
significant since they will have all the necessary information.

848

See letter from BoA I.

291

2.

Amortizing Asset Pools
a)

Proposed Rule

We proposed to add an instruction to Item 1105(a)(3)(ii) of Regulation AB to require the
static pool information related to delinquencies, losses, and prepayments be presented in
accordance with the existing guidelines outlined in Item 1100(b) 849 for amortizing asset pools.
Additionally, we proposed to amend Item 1105(a)(3)(iv) to require graphical presentation of
delinquency, losses, and prepayments for amortizing asset pools.
b)

Comments on Proposed Rule

Comments received on the proposed changes for amortizing asset pools were mixed.
With respect to requiring that delinquencies, losses, and prepayments be presented in accordance
with Item 1100(b), several commenters supported the proposal, 850 and several other commenters
opposed. 851 Those commenters opposing the requirement were most concerned about the onesize-fits-all approach to Item 1100(b)(1). They stated, for example, that reporting delinquencies,
losses, and prepayments in 30- or 31-day increments through charge-off would be for a longer
period of time than required under general principles of materiality. 852 In regard to the graphical

849

17 CFR 229.1100(b). Item 1100(b) requires that information be presented in a certain manner. For
example, it requires that information regarding delinquency be presented in 30-day increments through the
point that assets are written off or charged off as uncollectable.

850

See letters from BoA I and Realpoint.

851

See letters from ASF I and VABSS I.

852

Id. These commenters requested that the Commission tailor Item 1100(b) according to asset class. For
instance, ASF requested that the Commission modify Item 1100(b)(1) for RMBS and CMBS as follows:
present delinquency information in 30- or 31-day increments through the point that the loans are 179 or 180
days delinquent, followed by an additional 180-day increment (i.e., through the point that the loans are 359
or 360 days delinquent), and a final increment of 359 or 360 days or more. For ABS supported, directly or

292

presentation requirement, one commenter noted that graphical presentations provide immediate
recognition of changes in asset performance. 853 Commenters that opposed the requirement
argued that not all graphical presentations are useful or meaningful, especially for asset classes
with extensive data. 854
c)

Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Final Rule

We are adopting the proposed rules for amortizing asset pools with modification in
response to comments. We remain concerned that the inconsistent presentation of delinquencies,
losses, and prepayments across issuers within the same asset class has resulted in a lack of clarity
and comparability. 855 To address this concern, we are adding an instruction to Item
1105(a)(3)(ii) of Regulation AB to require for amortizing asset pools that the static pool
information related to delinquencies, losses, and prepayments be presented in accordance with
Item 1100(b) with respect to presenting such information in 30- or 31-day increments. In
response to commenters’ concerns with requiring such presentation through charge-off, the final
instruction requires that delinquencies, losses, and prepayments be presented in 30- or 31-day
increments through no less than 120 days. 856 We believe that this revised time period balances

indirectly, by motor vehicles, equipment and other similar physical assets with finite lives over which their
value depreciates, ASF and VABSS requested that Item 1100(b)(1) be modified so that delinquency
information is presented in 30- or 31-day increments through the point that the loans are 119 or 120 days
delinquent, followed by a final increment of 119 or 120 days or more.

amortizing asset pools).

293

commenters’ concerns with the cost and burden of having to track and report this information in
a more granular manner for a longer period of time while still providing investors with a more
comprehensive picture of the delinquencies, losses, and prepayments in a uniform manner across
asset classes. We also note that this revised time period is consistent with the new asset-level
data requirement for presentation of delinquencies and losses in RMBS. 857 While investors will
not receive as granular a presentation as proposed (through charge-off), investors investing in
asset classes required to provide asset-level disclosures will be receiving more detailed
information about the payment status of each individual asset, such as the paid through date. 858
We recognize that to the extent that issuers will now be required to present delinquencies and
losses for a longer period of time than previously provided in the distribution reports, such
issuers will incur some costs. We believe, however, the benefits gained from standardized and
comparable delinquency and loss disclosure justify the costs issuers may incur to provide the
information.
In addition to requiring that delinquencies, losses, and prepayments be presented in
accordance with Item 1100(b) through no less than 120 days, we are amending Item
1105(a)(3)(iv) to require the graphical presentation of this information for amortizing asset
pools. We acknowledge commenters’ concern that the substantial quantitative data associated

See new Item 1(g)(33) of Schedule AL.

858

See new Item 1(g)(28) of Schedule AL. See Section III.A.2.b Asset Specific Disclosure Requirements and
Economic Analysis of These Requirements. Due to the transition period for implementing the loan-level
requirements, there will be a period of time during which investors will not have access to this more
granular data about assets in prior securitized pools. See Section IX.B Transition Period for Asset-Level
Disclosure Requirements.

294

with some prior securitized pools could make graphical presentation of the data “unintelligible”
and that investors may prefer actual data over graphs because they cannot ascertain the data from
the graphs and they can take the tabular data and create their own graphs. 859 We believe,
however, that static pool data alone, depending on the volume and type of data, can be difficult
to analyze without the use of sophisticated analytical tools. Requiring graphical presentation of
this information will benefit investors by enabling them to analyze the information without such
tools. 860 In addition, graphical presentation of the information highlights possible data segments
that warrant further analysis and may therefore facilitate a more tailored and efficient in-depth
analysis. We also note that the inherent function of static pool information (i.e., analyzing trends
within a sponsor’s program by comparing originations at similar points in the assets’ lives) is
well-suited for graphical presentation as it allows for better detection of patterns that may not
necessarily be evident from overall portfolio numbers.
3.

Filing Static Pool Data
a)

Proposed Rule

We proposed to permit issuers to file their static pool information required under Item
1105 of Regulation AB on EDGAR in Portable Document Format (“PDF”) as an official filing in

859

See letter from VABSS I.

860

See letters from AMI, BoA I, and CFA I (noting that graphical representation of this information provides
investors with an immediate recognition of changes in asset performance in successive pools and thus an
indication of the underwriting standards of the issuers).

295

lieu of, as currently required, including the information directly in the prospectus (or
incorporating by reference) in ASCII or HTML format. 861
As is the case today, however, issuers can incorporate static pool information filed on a
Form 8-K or as an exhibit to a Form 8-K by reference into a prospectus. 862 We proposed that all
static pool disclosure, if filed on a Form 8-K, be filed under a new item number so that investors
could easily locate the information that is incorporated by reference into the prospectus. We also
proposed to create a new exhibit number to Item 601 of Regulation S-K for static pool
information filed as an exhibit to a Form 8-K or prospectus.
b)

Comments on Proposed Rule

Commenters were generally opposed to our PDF proposal, favoring data formats other
than PDF for static pool information. One commenter stated that PDF makes detailed analysis
“difficult” and “time-consuming.” 863 Another commenter preferred a format that is readily
importable to Excel or a comparable database program. 864 One commenter stated its belief that
EDGAR in its current form will not facilitate the usability of static pool information, such as

861

Rule 312 of Regulation S-T permitted issuers for ABS filed on or before June 30, 2012, to post their static
pool information on an Internet Web site under certain conditions in lieu of filing the static pool
information on EDGAR. We are not removing Rule 312 of Regulation S-T in connection with this
rulemaking since issuers that previously provided static pool information via a Web site are required to
retain all versions of the information provided through the Web site for a period of not less than five years.
Issuers are no longer able to use Rule 312 as a means to provide their static pool information. We are,
however, removing Item 512(l) of Regulation S-K, the undertaking previously required for providing static
pool information on a Web site under Rule 312 of Regulation S-T because this undertaking is no longer
applicable. We are also removing paragraph (d)(6)(iii) of Securities Rule 433 which had permitted issuers
to include a Web site address for static pool information in a free writing prospectus.

862

See the 2004 Adopting Release at 1541.

863

See letter from CFA I.

864

See letter from Prudential I.

296

allowing investors to download the data in a format that investors can use with their own
analytical tools and applications. 865 With respect to our proposal to house all static pool
information filed on Form 8-K under a new item number, commenters were supportive of the
proposal. 866
c)

Final Rule and the Economic Analysis of the Final Rule

Given commenters’ concerns regarding the usability of static pool information in PDF,
we are not adopting our proposal to permit issuers to file their static pool information in PDF as
an official filing. This decision benefits investors because they will continue to receive static
pool information in a more usable format compared to PDF. Issuers, however, will be precluded
from taking advantage of any cost savings that could be achieved by filing the static pool
information in PDF.
We are adopting the proposed rules to amend Form 8-K and Item 601 of Regulation S-K.
We believe that these amendments will benefit investors in searching and locating the static pool
information filed on EDGAR. Therefore, if the issuer wishes to incorporate static pool
information by reference to a Form 8-K filing rather than to include it in the prospectus, then an

865

See letter from ASF I. See also letter from American Securitization Forum regarding the filing of static
pool information dated May 4, 2012 submitted in response to the 2010 ABS Proposing Release (“ASF V”)
(noting that its investor members supported upgrading EDGAR to allow for a number of file types,
including PDF and Excel, but did not specify whether PDF would in fact facilitate the usability of the static
pool data).

866

See letters from MBA I and Prudential I. Prudential suggested requiring the issuer to include a link in the
prospectus to the relevant information in order to assist investors in locating the information. As is the case
today, filers may reference a previously submitted filing in the prospectus; however, filers are generally not
permitted to include external references. See EDGAR Manual (Volume II), Section 5, for additional
information and instruction about acceptable external references.

297

issuer must file it under new Item 6.06 of Form 8-K. If the issuer files the static pool
information as an exhibit to a Form 8-K to be incorporated into a prospectus, the issuer must file
the static pool information as Exhibit 106. Under the final rule, issuers will be required to
include a statement in the prospectus that the static pool information incorporated by reference is
deemed to be a part of the prospectus and also identify the Form 8-K on which the static pool
information was filed by including the CIK number, file number, exhibit number (if applicable)
and the date on which the static pool information was filed. Investors will benefit by being able
to more easily search and locate static pool information incorporated by reference into the
prospectus, and the only cost issuers are likely to incur is to update their information systems to
reflect the new Form 8-K item requirement and exhibit number, which we believe should be
minimal.
We also proposed that the information should be filed with the Form 8-K on the same
date that the preliminary prospectus is required to be filed. 867 We are adopting that proposal
with one clarification. Consistent with current practices under existing requirements, issuers
may incorporate by reference the same static pool information into the prospectus of one or more
offerings of the same asset class as long as the information meets the requirements of Item 1105
of Regulation AB, 868 which states that the most recent periodic increment for the static pool data

867

In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we proposed that “[t]he static pool disclosure must be filed as an
exhibit with this report by the time of effectiveness of a registration statement on Form SF-1, on the same
date of the filing of a form of prospectus, as required by Rule 424(h) (17 CFR 230.424(h)) and a final
prospectus meeting the requirements of section 10(a) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77j(a)) filed in
accordance with Rule 424(b) (17 CFR 230.424(b)).”

868

17 CFR 229.1105(a)(3)(ii).

298

must be of a date no later than 135 days after the first use of the prospectus. 869 The amended
requirement clarifies that issuers are required to provide information by the date that the
prospectus is required to be filed rather than on the same date the prospectus is filed (i.e.,
permitting incorporation of a previously-filed Form 8-K), and thereby allows issuers to continue
to have the flexibility to incorporate the static pool information by reference into prospectuses of
multiple deals.
F.

Other Disclosure Requirements That Rely on Credit Ratings

Items 1112 and 1114 of Regulation AB require the disclosure of certain financial
information regarding significant obligors of an asset pool and significant credit enhancement
providers relating to a class of asset-backed securities. An instruction to Item 1112(b) provides
that no financial information regarding a significant obligor is required if the obligations of the
significant obligor, as they relate to the pool assets, are backed by the full faith and credit of a
foreign government and the pool assets are securities that are rated investment grade by an
NRSRO. 870 Item 1114 of Regulation AB contains a similar instruction that relieves an issuer of
the obligation to provide financial information when the obligations of the credit enhancement

investment-grade rating. 871 We proposed to revise Item 1112 and Item 1114 to eliminate the
exceptions based on investment-grade ratings.
We received only one comment on this proposal, which supported the proposal. 872 We
are adopting the amendments to Items 1112 and 1114 as proposed. We continue to believe that
these changes are consistent with the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act,
which requires us to reduce regulatory reliance on credit ratings, and our revisions to eliminate
ratings from the shelf eligibility criteria for asset-backed issuers. We believe that this will allow
investors to directly consider the financial condition of significant obligors and credit
enhancement providers rather than rely solely on the implication of these parties’ credit ratings.
Because the information now required to be disclosed is likely available to the issuer, the
revisions to Item 1112 and Item 1114 will not impose substantial costs or burdens on an assetbacked issuer.

Securities Act Registration
A.

Background and Economic Discussion

Securities Act shelf registration provides important timing and flexibility benefits to
issuers. An issuer with an effective shelf registration statement can conduct delayed offerings

871

Instruction 3 to Item 1114 [17 CFR 229.1114]. Under both Items 1112 and 1114, to the extent that pool
assets are not investment-grade securities, information required by paragraph (5) of Schedule B of the
Securities Act may be provided in lieu of the required financial information. Paragraph 5 of Schedule B
requires disclosure of three years of the issuer’s receipts and expenditures classified by purpose in such
detail and form as the Commission prescribes.

“off the shelf” under Securities Act Rule 415 without staff action. 873 Asset-backed securities are
often registered on a Form S-3 registration statement and later offered “off the shelf” if, in
addition to meeting other specified criteria, 874 the securities are rated investment grade by an
NRSRO. We continue to recognize that ABS issuers have expressed the desire to use shelf

873

As discussed in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, contemporaneous with the enactment of the Secondary
Mortgage Market Enhancement Act of 1984 (SMMEA), which added the definition of “mortgage related
security” to the Exchange Act, we amended Securities Act Rule 415 to permit mortgage related securities
to be offered on a delayed basis, regardless of which form is utilized for registration of the offering (Pub. L.
No. 98-440, 98 Stat. 1689). SMMEA was enacted by Congress to increase the flow of funds to the housing
market by removing regulatory impediments to the creation and sale of private mortgage-backed securities.
An early version of the legislation contained a provision that specifically would have required the
Commission to create a permanent procedure for shelf registration of mortgage related securities. The
provision was removed from the final version of the legislation, however, as a result of the Commission’s
decision to adopt Rule 415, implementing a shelf registration procedure for mortgage related securities.
See H.R. Rep. No. 994, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 14, reprinted in 1984 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 2827.
See also Shelf Registration, Release No. 33-6499 (Nov. 17, 1983) [48 FR 52889] at footnote 30 (noting that
mortgage related securities were the subject of pending legislation). In 1992, in order to facilitate
registered offerings of asset-backed securities and eliminate differences in treatment under our registration
rules between mortgage related asset-backed securities (which could be registered on a delayed basis) and
other asset-backed securities of comparable character and quality (which could not), we expanded the
ability to use “shelf offerings” to other asset-backed securities. See Simplification of Registration
Procedures for Primary Securities Offerings, Release No. 33-6964 (Oct. 22, 1992) [57 FR 32461]. Under
the 1992 amendments, offerings of asset-backed securities rated investment grade by an NRSRO (typically
one of the four highest categories) could be shelf eligible and registered on Form S-3. The eligibility
requirement’s definition of “investment grade” was largely based on the definition in the existing eligibility
requirement for non-convertible corporate debt securities.

874

In addition to investment-grade rated securities, an ABS offering is shelf-eligible only if the following
conditions are met: delinquent assets must not constitute 20% or more, as measured by dollar volume, of
the asset pool as of the measurement date; and with respect to securities that are backed by leases other than
motor vehicle leases, the portion of the securitized pool balance attributable to the residual value of the
physical property underlying the leases, as determined in accordance with the transaction agreements for
the securities, does not constitute 20% or more, as measured by dollar volume, of the securitized pool
balance as of the measurement date. To the extent the depositor or any issuing entity previously
established, directly or indirectly, by the depositor or any affiliate of the depositor are or were at any time
during the twelve calendar months and any portion of a month immediately preceding the filing of the
registration statement on Form S-3 subject to the requirements of Section 12 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act
(15 U.S.C. 78l or 78o(d)) with respect to a class of asset-backed securities involving the same asset class,
such depositor and each such issuing entity must have filed all material required to be filed regarding such
asset-backed securities pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m, 78n or
78o(d)) for such period (or such shorter period that each such entity was required to file such materials).
Such material (except for certain enumerated items) must have been filed in a timely manner. We did not
propose changes to these other eligibility conditions.

301

registration to access the capital markets quickly. ABS issuers’ interest in shelf registration is
also evidenced by the lack of ABS issuers using Form S-1. 875
In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we proposed, among other things, new registration
procedures, registration forms and shelf eligibility requirements for asset-backed security issuers.
The 2010 ABS Proposals sought to address a number of concerns about the ABS offering
process and ABS disclosures that were subsequently addressed in the Dodd-Frank Act, while
others were not addressed by the Dodd-Frank Act. Two of the proposed shelf eligibility
requirements – risk retention 876 and continued Exchange Act reporting 877 – were addressed by

875

According to EDGAR, since 2008, no ABS issuer has filed a registration statement on Form S-1 that went
effective.

876

In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we proposed to require that sponsors of ABS transactions retain a
specified amount of each tranche of the securitization, net of hedging. Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act
added new Section 15G of the Exchange Act. Section 15G generally requires the Federal Reserve Board,
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Commission
and in the case of the securitization of any “residential mortgage asset,” together with the Department of
Housing and Urban Development and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, to jointly prescribe regulations
relating to risk retention. In March 2011, the agencies proposed rules to implement Section 15G of the
Exchange Act. In August 2013, the agencies re-proposed the rules. See the 2011 Risk Retention Proposing
Release and the 2013 Risk Retention Re-Proposing Release.

877

The Commission proposed in the 2010 ABS Proposals to require that an ABS issuer undertake to file
Exchange Act reports with the Commission on an ongoing basis as a condition to shelf eligibility. The
2010 ABS Proposals also proposed to require an issuer to confirm, among other things, whether Exchange
Act reports required pursuant to the undertaking were current as of the end of the quarter in order to be
eligible to use the effective registration statement for takedowns. Section 942(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act
eliminated the automatic suspension of the duty to file under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act for ABS
issuers, and granted authority to the Commission to issue rules providing for the suspension or termination
of such duty. In the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release, we stated that due to the amendment to Section
15(d), the proposed shelf eligibility requirement to undertake to file Exchange Act reports is no longer
necessary, including the quarterly evaluation by issuers of compliance with the undertaking. In August
2011, we adopted rules to provide for suspension of the reporting obligations for asset-backed securities
issuers when there are no asset-backed securities of the class sold in a registered transaction held by nonaffiliates of the depositor. See footnote 543.

302

provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. In July 2011, we re-proposed some of the 2010 ABS
Proposals in light of the changes made by the Dodd-Frank Act and comments we received.
The 2011 ABS Re-Proposals for ABS shelf registration eligibility were also part of
several rule revisions we are considering in connection with Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank
Act. Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act requires that we review any regulation issued by us
that requires the use of an assessment of the credit-worthiness of a security or money market
instrument and any references to or requirements in such regulations regarding credit ratings.
Once we have completed that review, the statute provides that we modify any regulations
identified in our review to remove any reference to or requirement of reliance on credit ratings
and to substitute in such regulations such standard of credit-worthiness as we determine to be
appropriate. In that connection, we take into account the context and purposes of the affected
rules.
B.

New Registration Procedures and Forms for ABS
1.

New Shelf Registration Procedures

Under existing rules, as with current offerings of other types of securities registered on
Form S-3 and Form F-3, the shelf registration statement for an offering of ABS will often be
effective weeks or months before a takedown is contemplated. The prospectus in an effective
registration statement must describe, among other things, the type or category of assets to be
securitized, the possible structural features of the transaction, and identification of the types or

303

categories of securities that may be offered. 878 Pursuant to existing Securities Act Rules 409 and
430B, 879 the prospectus in the registration statement may omit the specific terms of a takedown if
that information is unknown or not reasonably available to the issuer when the registration
statement is made effective. 880 For ABS offerings off the shelf, because assets for a pool
backing the securities will not be identified until the time of an offering, information regarding
the actual assets in the pool and the material terms of the transaction are typically only included
in a prospectus or prospectus supplement that is required to be filed with the Commission by the
second business day after first use. 881 This information includes information about the structure
of the cash flows, the pool, underwriting criteria for the assets and exceptions made to the
underwriting criteria, identification of the originators of the assets and other information that is
related to the identification of specific assets for the pool. We understand that the creation of an
asset pool to support securitized products is a dynamic and ongoing process in which changes
can take place up until pricing. As a result, the new rules we are adopting maintain the

878

The form of prospectus in an effective registration statement should also include disclosure about the risks
associated with changes in interest rates or prepayment levels as well as the various scenarios under which
payments on the ABS could be impaired.

879

17 CFR 230.409 and 17 CFR 230.430B.

880

The prospectus disclosure in the registration statement is often presented through a “base” or “core”
prospectus and a prospectus supplement. We are eliminating this type of presentation for ABS issuers. See
Section V.D.1 Presentation of Disclosure in Prospectuses.

881

An instruction to Rule 424(b) [17 CFR 230.424(b)] requires that a form of prospectus or prospectus
supplement relating to a delayed offering of mortgage-backed securities or an offering of asset-backed
securities be filed no later than the second business day following the date it is first used after effectiveness
in connection with a public offering or sales, or transmitted by a means reasonably calculated to result in
filing with the Commission by that date.

304

fundamental framework of shelf registration for delayed ABS offerings, but provide new
important protections for investors who choose to commit capital to the ABS transactions.
We also recognize that it is important for investor protection that, in addition to receiving
adequate information to make an investment decision, ABS investors also have adequate time to
analyze the information and the potential investment. For the most part, each ABS offering off
of a shelf registration statement involves securities backed by different assets, so that, in essence,
from an investor point of view, each offering requires a new investment analysis. Information
about the underlying assets is an important piece of information for analyzing the ability of those
assets to generate sufficient funds to make payments on the securities. Furthermore, some have
noted the lack of time to review transaction-specific information as hindering investors’ ability to
conduct adequate analysis of the securities. 882 We believe that a process for ABS offerings
where investors and underwriters have additional time to conduct their review of offerings will
result in improved investor protections and promote a more efficient asset-backed market, even if
issuers may not always be able to complete their offering as swiftly as they could in the past.

882

See, e.g., Section I.B. of CFA Institute Centre for Financial Market Integrity and Council of Institutional
Investors, U.S. Financial Regulatory Reform: The Investor’s Perspective, July 2009 (noting that
securitized products are sold before investors have access to a comprehensive and accurate prospectus,
noting that each ABS offering involves a new and unique security, and recommending that the Commission
adopt rules to improve the timeliness of disclosures to investors); Securitization of Assets: Problems &
Solutions Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Sec., Ins., & Inv. of the S. Comm. on Banking, Housing &
Urban Affairs, 111th Cong. 11 (2009) (statement of William W. Irving) (recommending that there be ample
time before a deal is priced for investors to review and analyze a full prospectus and not just a term sheet);
The State of Securitization Markets Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Sec., Ins., & Inv. of the S. Comm. on
Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs, 112th Cong. 9 (2011) (statement of Chris J. Katopis, Executive
Director of the Association of Mortgage Investors) (recommending that there be a “cooling off period”
when ABS are offered to provide investors with enough time to review and analyze prospectus information
prior to making investment decisions). See also footnote 885 listing those commenters supporting the
waiting period proposal.

305

Therefore, we are adopting rules designed to increase the amount of time that investors have to
review information about a particular shelf takedown, which we believe will allow for better
analysis of ABS in lieu of undue reliance on security ratings.
a)

Rule 424(h) and Rule 430D
(1)

Proposed Rule

In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we proposed to require that an ABS issuer using a
shelf registration statement on proposed Form SF-3 file a preliminary prospectus containing
transaction-specific information at least five business days in advance of the first sale of
securities in the offering. This requirement would allow investors additional time to analyze the
specific structure, assets and contractual rights of each transaction. We proposed this
requirement in response to investors’ concerns that ABS issuers were not providing them enough
time to review the transaction-specific information, which hindered their ability to conduct
adequate analysis of the securities. We noted in the 2011 ABS Re-Proposal that the five
business-day waiting period was also intended to reduce undue reliance on security ratings, thus
part of our efforts to remove the prior investment-grade ratings requirement. 883 We believed that
requiring such information to be filed at least five business days before the first sale of securities
in the offering balances the interest of ABS issuers in quick access to the capital markets and the
need of investors to have more time to consider transaction-specific information. In the 2010
ABS Proposing Release, we explained that we considered whether a longer minimum time

See the 2010 ABS Proposing Release at 23334, including footnote 80, and the 2011 ABS Re-Proposal at
47950, including footnote 19.

306

period than five business days would be more appropriate. 884 We had proposed five business
days because we believed that the companion proposals requiring the filing of standardized and
tagged asset-level information and a computer program could reduce the amount of time required
by investors to consider transaction specific information. The proposal also provided that a
material change from the information provided in the preliminary prospectus, other than offering
price, would require a new preliminary prospectus to be filed and therefore, a new five businessday waiting period.
(2)

Comments on Proposed Rule

Comments received on this proposal were mixed. Several commenters supported the
proposal that a preliminary prospectus be filed five business days in advance of the first sale. 885
Two commenters generally supported the proposed five business-day waiting period and also
provided additional feedback on other time periods. 886 One of the commenters recommended

884

Some have suggested that investors be provided with up to two weeks to analyze asset information. See,
e.g., Joshua Rosner, Securitization: Taming the Wild West, in ROOSEVELT INSTITUTE, MAKE MARKETS BE
MARKETS 73 (2010).

2010 ABS Proposing Release, ICI I, Jamie L. Larson dated Apr. 27, 2010 submitted in response to the 2010
ABS Proposing Release, MetLife I, MBA I, Prudential I, and Realpoint.
MBA also requested that issuers, particularly CMBS issuers, also have the ability to update without
restarting the five business-day period. See letter from MBA I (noting that while a five business-day
minimum waiting period prior to the first sale will occasionally impose an “unwelcome timing constraint,”
the minimum waiting period is unlikely to make shelf registration sufficiently less attractive if the rule
provides flexibility for issuers to provide updates with a shorter waiting period). Comments about the
waiting period for updates are addressed below.

886

provided with no less than a three-day period) and CFA II (reiterating their support for the proposed five
business-day waiting period).

that investors should have not less than three days to evaluate an ABS offering, 887 while the
other stated that two business days for repeat issuers may be sufficient. 888
Other commenters opposed the five business-day waiting period 889 and suggested shorter
alternatives such as two business days prior to the first sale, 890 one business day, 891 or no waiting
period. 892 One commenter suggested that the waiting period vary by asset class. 893 Another
commenter recommended a one business-day waiting period for a category of “well-known
seasoned asset-backed sponsors” that meet certain issuer classification (e.g., seasoned depositors
and sponsors with established securitization programs that have issued more than a threshold
aggregate amount and/or over a specified period of time), asset class classification (e.g., master
trusts where the asset pool does not change materially from transaction to transaction and a
specified dollar amount of transactions have been issued and supported by the pool), or
transaction structure (e.g., transactions by the same depositor or sponsor, where issuances

(recommending no mandatory minimum waiting period, but suggesting two business days if a minimum is
imposed), and Wells Fargo I.

891

See letter from ABA I (one business day is appropriate for widely-followed, well-known ABS issuers,
sponsors or asset classes or structures, similar to the well-known seasoned issuer concept).

892

See letter from VABSS I.

893

See letter from SIFMA I (suggesting a two business-day period for bank credit card or charge card
receivables; three business days for private-label credit card or charge card receivables, motor vehicle
loans/leases, student loans, or equipment loans or leases; and five business days for any other asset class,
including RMBS and CMBS).

308

involve waterfall structures that do not change materially from transaction to transaction). 894
Along the same lines, another commenter suggested that certain types of ABS offerings do not
warrant any mandatory waiting periods because of their frequency and nature (e.g., where a
sponsor, its parent or a subsidiary has completed at least one public offering within the preceding
two years of securities in the same asset class and where the cash flows and structure are
substantially similar to a prior public offering). 895 Several commenters argued that a five
business-day waiting period is more consistent with the time delays associated with an equity
initial public offering (“IPO”), and noted that the proposed rule could lead to the “perverse
result” that a well-known seasoned issuer can issue relatively risky forms of capital such as
equity or unsecured debt without any required waiting period, but secured debt, generally
regarded as less risky, would have a waiting period. 896
While we did not specifically request further comment on this topic in the 2011 ABS ReProposing Release, several commenters offered comment on the proposal. For the most part,
commenters reiterated their suggestions from their comment letters on the 2010 ABS Proposing
Release. Several commenters agreed that a preliminary prospectus should be provided to
investors in advance. 897 Some commenters noted concern if the proposed time period were to be

894

See letter from ABA I (noting that some programmatic issuers have issued hundreds of billions of dollars
of ABS over decades, using securitization programs that have consistent documentation from deal to deal,
and are well-known to their investor base which, as a result, needs less time to absorb transaction details).

shortened. 898 One commenter reiterated its suggestion for different filing requirements based on
asset class. 899 Another commenter suggested a one business-day waiting period for “widely
followed, programmatic ABS issuers” and a two business-day waiting period for all others. 900
As noted above, the proposal provided that a material change from the information
provided in a preliminary prospectus, other than offering price, would require a new preliminary
prospectus and therefore, a new five business-day waiting period. Some investor commenters
supported the proposal to require a new waiting period for any material changes. 901 However,
several commenters recommended changes to this aspect of the proposal.
Some commenters, believing the five business-day waiting period after material changes
was too long, suggested shorter periods. 902 Commenters recommending shorter periods
generally argued that in most cases a material change can be easily identified and reviewed and

898

See letters from Better Markets and ICI II (also suggesting a time period of no less than three business
days).

899

See letter from SIFMA III-dealers and sponsors (stating that “at least two business days before the date of
the first sale in the offering, in the case of ABS backed by bank credit card or charge card receivables; at
least three business days before the date of the first sale in the offering, in the case of ABS backed by
private-label credit card or charge card receivables, motor vehicle loans or leases, student loans, or
equipment loans or leases; and at least five business days before the date of the first sale in the offering, in
the case of ABS backed by any other asset class, including residential or commercial mortgage loans”).

could be overly rigid and unnecessarily long in some cases), AmeriCredit, AMI, BoA I, CNH I, CREFC I
(suggesting a waiting period up to five business days based upon the nature of the change and the length of
time that would be needed for the market to digest that change in accordance with past experience, and that
sponsors should be given the latitude to determine the appropriate length of review on a case-by-case basis
based on their “unique” understanding of the CMBS market and experience with the investor community),

will not take investors the same amount of time to consider as compared to the first review of the
entire preliminary prospectus. 903 Some investor commenters suggested that the waiting period
should be shortened because investors will have the opportunity to become familiar with the
transaction documents during the initial marketing period. 904 One commenter stated that a five
business-day waiting period unnecessarily exposes well-established sponsors to market and
execution risk without providing a meaningful benefit to investors and recommended both a
shorter waiting period and a requirement that material changes be disclosed in a supplement to
the preliminary prospectus to facilitate easy identification of such changes. 905
Some commenters suggested that no additional waiting period after material changes may
be necessary. 906 One investor commenter recommended a new filing and a new five businessday period only if a change to the transaction occurs that a reasonable investor would consider
material to an investment decision, such as: changes to more than 1% of the collateral pool,

903

See letters from BoA I and SIFMA I (expressed views of issuers and investors only). See also AmeriCredit
(suggesting an additional waiting period should apply only in cases where the material changes
significantly affect the asset pool, the cash flows or the transaction structure, otherwise no waiting period
should be required, such as when “upsizing” a transaction due to strong investor demand), CREFC I
(stating that a free writing prospectus that highlights a material change will expedite and improve the
review of changes by the investor community rather than requiring review of an entirely new 424(h) filing),
and MBA I (noting that investors in CMBS do not need five business days to understand all material
changes, and that CMBS issuers commonly issue “pre-pricing updates,” often no more than one or two
pages, to investors prior to pricing to convey any material changes since the preliminary prospectus and
also suggesting that the period be shortened to one day or have the rule focus more on the length of time
necessary for an investor to understand the change rather than the materiality of the change).

904

See letters from AMI and Prudential I.

905

See letter from ABA I.

906

See letters from ASF I (expressed views of issuers and investors only) and BoA I. These commenters
reasoned that existing Rule 159 provides adequate protections by promoting the delivery of updated
information in a manner that provides investors with an opportunity to evaluate the disclosure prior to
contract of sale.

311

including changes at the property, tenant or borrower level; any changes to the priority of
payment (i.e., waterfall); any changes of any service provider or party to the transaction; or any
changes to the terms in the documents related to the transaction, including changes to any
representations and warranties, covenants or indemnities originally contained in such
documents. 907
Commenters also requested that we provide additional clarity regarding the material
changes to the preliminary prospectus that would trigger a new five business-day waiting
period. 908 One of those commenters stated that changes in pool composition as a result of
ordinary events, such as payments of interest or principal, should not require additional
disclosure or a renewed waiting period unless such payments reflect another material change. 909
Several commenters recommended that the requirement should not focus so much on the
materiality of the change in terms of its economic impact or importance, but rather on the likely
extent of the effect of such a change on the disclosure itself and the need for more time to
review. 910
We also received comments on our proposal to permit omission of pricing information in
the required preliminary prospectus. One commenter recommended that we define what is
contemplated by the phrase “information dependent on pricing” and whether this would include

910

payment priority) that are important can nevertheless be easily described and quickly understood,
particularly if one has already received a preliminary prospectus).

only quantitative pricing terms, or whether it could also include other additional information that
is typically determined at pricing (e.g., selection of a swap counterparty, weighted average life
calculations, or, in the case of credit card master trusts, transaction size and minimum principal
receivables balance requirements). 911 Along the same lines, several commenters suggested an
accommodation for transactions involving derivative contracts. 912 Another commenter
suggested that the preliminary prospectus should have a section that specifically discusses any
aspect of the transaction that is “to be determined” at the time of the filing. 913
We did not receive comments on our proposed conforming revisions to the undertakings
that are required by Item 512 of Regulation S-K 914 in connection with a shelf registration
statement for ABS. We also did not receive comments on our proposed addition to Item 512 to
require an issuer to undertake to file the information required to be contained in a preliminary
prospectus.

Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Final Rule

asset-backed securities where information is omitted from an effective registration statement in

911

See letter from ABA I.

912

See letters from ASF I and BoA I (explaining that in these cases the preliminary prospectus could not

determined by the issuer until the time of pricing for the offered securities).

reliance on new Rule 430D, as discussed below, a form of prospectus meeting certain
requirements must be filed with the Commission in accordance with the new Rule 424(h)
preliminary prospectus at least three business days prior to the first sale of securities in the
offering. 915 After considering the various comments received on the initial five-business day
waiting period, we have shortened the waiting period as proposed from five business days to
three business days. We believe that three business days balances the benefit to investors of
providing additional time to conduct an analysis of the offering – a longstanding concern of ABS
investors 916 – and the concerns of issuers expressed in the comment letters. While the final rule
imposes a minimum three-day waiting period, issuers may provide additional time to potential
investors to consider the offering.
We recognize that the final rule will require issuers to provide information to investors
earlier in the process than was often provided for ABS issued before the crisis. During the
required waiting period, issuers may be exposed to the risk of changing market conditions
because they may have to hold the underlying assets on their balance sheets (inventory risk), and
the risk may have larger impact on small sponsors with smaller balance sheets. To assess the

915

Sale includes “contract of sale.” See footnote 391 and accompanying text of the Securities Offering
Reform Release. We are clarifying the final rule to note that the preliminary prospectus must be filed two
business days after first use but no later than three business days before first sale. See also letter from
SIFMA I (noting that the Commission should make clear that a preliminary prospectus must be filed not
later than the earlier of (i) the applicable number of business days before the date of the first sale, or (ii) or
the second business day after fist use).

916

See the 2004 ABS Adopting Release at 1527. Although the investment analysis does not have to be
completely done anew for master trust transactions since the asset pools do not necessarily change with
each takedown, we believe that the three business-day waiting period is still important for investors in such
transactions as investors are not only reviewing the assets but also any changes to the structure to ensure
that it will produce the expected cash flows, which can be intricate and complex for master trusts.

magnitude of this risk and the costs that it may impose on issuers, we analyzed time series
changes in the price of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Fixed Rate Asset Backed
Securities Index (R0A0). 917 Average index returns for the pre-crisis, crisis, and post-crisis
periods are presented in Table 1. To assess the cost of the three business-day waiting period that
we are adopting against the cost of reasonable alternatives, we calculated index returns over one,
three, five and ten days. Outside of the volatile 2008-2009 crisis period, the average change in
ABS market conditions as measured by index returns is below 1.5 basis points (bps) for all
horizons (1, 3, 5, and 10 days) with the standard deviation below 15bp for three-day returns.
These results suggest that the economic exposure of issuers to market conditions (opportunity
cost) is relatively small for all waiting period lengths in the range from 1 day to 10 days, but
increases with the horizon. Further, reducing the waiting period from 5 days to 3 days lowers the
riskiness of returns by more than 15% (the standard deviation drops from 17bps to 14bps). To
put these numbers in perspective, for a $100 million ABS issuance that is similar to the abovementioned R0A0 ABS index, a three business-day waiting period during the analyzed period
would result in an expected change of less than $10,000 and a 10% likelihood of a more than

The Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Fixed Rate Asset Backed Securities Index (the “Index”) tracks
the performance of U.S. dollar denominated investment-grade fixed rate asset-backed securities issued in
the U.S. domestic market. Qualifying securities must have an investment-grade rating (based on an
average of Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch ratings). In addition, qualifying securities must have the following:
(1) a fixed rate coupon (including callable fixed-to-floating rate securities); (2) at least one year remaining
term to final stated maturity; (3) at least one month to the last expected cash flow; (4) an original deal size
for the collateral group of at least $250 million; (5) a current outstanding deal size for the collateral group
greater than or equal to 10% of the original deal size; and (6) a minimum outstanding tranche size of $50
million for senior tranches and $10 million for mezzanine and subordinated tranches. Floating rate, inverse
floating rate, interest only, and principal only tranches of qualifying deals are excluded from the Index as
are all tranches of re-securitized and agency deals. Securities to be sold in reliance on Securities Act Rule
144A qualify for inclusion in the Index.

$230,000 increase or decrease in the value of the issuance. Additionally, exposure to several
sources of risk, for example, the three-day interest rate risk or credit spread risk, can be hedged
with forward contracts, further reducing potential exposure to losses due to a three-day delay in
offering. 918

As noted above, comments received on the waiting period were mixed on the appropriate
length of time for the initial waiting period before first sale with mostly investors supporting 919
an initial waiting period of five business days and issuers mostly opposing 920 such a requirement.
Commenters opposing five business days provided various suggested alternatives to the proposal
– ranging from two business days prior to first sale to no waiting period at all. 921 Some of these
commenters recommended that the length of the waiting period be determined based on asset

class or whether the issuer is a repeat issuer. 922 Because we believe that, regardless of the asset
class or whether the issuer is well-known, investors should have more time to conduct their
analysis before making an investment decision than was provided previously, we are not
adopting such distinctions based on asset class or type of issuer. We also believe that given the
complexity of ABS transactions that two-business days, and especially one-business day, would
not provide investors with enough time to conduct their due diligence. 923 As a result, we believe
that a minimum of three business days strikes the appropriate balance of providing investors with
more time to analyze the information related to the transaction while also minimizing issuers’
exposure to changing market conditions and giving them flexibility in timing of ABS issuance.
Finally, while we have observed that post-crisis ABS issuers have provided investors
with additional time, we are concerned that market practice could change in a heated market with
many issuers possibly reverting to the practice of providing investors with insufficient time and
causing investors to place undue reliance on ratings. Because of this concern and our belief that
investors should conduct their own due diligence rather than unduly rely on ratings, we are
mandating a waiting period of at least three-business days as part of our rules. 924 We are
persuaded by commenters that neither a new preliminary prospectus nor a restart of the waiting

922

See footnote 893.

923

Even though most ABS offerings are structured as shelf offerings, each takedown off a shelf registration
statement is more akin to an IPO given that each ABS offering consists of new assets and a new structure,
which requires investors to conduct their investment analysis anew to make an informed investment
decision.

924

See letter from ICI I (noting that although they support an initial five-business day waiting period, should
the Commission decide to reduce the waiting period, that investors should have not less than three business
days to evaluate an ABS shelf offering).

317

period is necessary for material changes because, in most cases, a material change can be easily
identified and reviewed and therefore may not take an investor as long to review compared to the
first review of the preliminary prospectus. 925 The final rule will require that the issuer disclose
any material changes in a supplement to the preliminary prospectus that must be filed with the
Commission at least 48 hours before the date and time of the first sale. 926 The supplement must
provide a description of how the information in the initial preliminary prospectus has changed so
that the changes are apparent to investors.
This revision will help to address cost and other concerns expressed by issuers and others
about the proposed amount of waiting time after a material change and the concerns about filing
an entirely new preliminary prospectus. It should reduce some commenters’ concerns regarding
exposure to market risk and unnecessary delay. We are concerned, however, that extensive
material changes, even after an initial waiting period for the preliminary prospectus, could be
difficult for investors to review in this shortened timeframe; therefore, we are requiring issuers to
clearly delineate in a prospectus supplement what material information has changed and how the
information has changed from the initial preliminary prospectus. We expect that the asset-level
disclosure requirements that we are adopting, which will provide investors with standardized
machine-readable data about the pool assets, will facilitate investors’ ability to update their

925

See, e.g., letters from ABA I, AmeriCredit, ASF I (issuers and investors), SIFMA I, VABSS I, and Wells
Fargo I.

926

The changes must be filed in a supplement in accordance with Rule 424(h)(2); provided that if the material
change relates to the assets within the pool also provide the information required by Item 1125. Whether a
change is material for purposes of the requirement will depend on the facts and circumstances. See TSC
Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 448-49 (1976). See also Basic v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224,
231 (1988).

318

investment analysis quickly. As a result, we do not believe that investors will need as much time
to review the supplement as they will need for their initial review of the preliminary prospectus.
(b)

New Rule 430D

Prior to the rules we are adopting, the framework for ABS shelf offerings, along with
shelf offerings for other securities, was outlined in Rule 430B of the Securities Act. Rule 430B
describes the type of information that primary shelf-eligible and automatic shelf issuers may
omit from a base prospectus in a Rule 415 offering and include instead in a prospectus
supplement, Exchange Act reports incorporated by reference, or a post-effective amendment, and
addresses both the treatment of prospectuses filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) and effective date
triggers for securities sold off the shelf registration statement. 927 As discussed above, we are
adopting new Rule 430D to provide the framework for shelf offerings of asset-backed securities
pursuant to revised Rule 415(a)(1)(vii) or (xii); therefore, ABS issuers eligible to conduct shelf
offerings are no longer eligible to use Rule 430B. By removing ABS shelf offerings from
existing Rule 430B and creating new Rule 430D, we are providing a shelf offering framework
that is appropriately tailored to ABS shelf offerings and that incorporates the new preliminary
prospectus requirement. 928
New Rule 430D requires that, with respect to each offering, all the information
previously omitted from the prospectus filed as part of an effective registration statement must be
filed at least three business days in advance of the first sale of securities in the offering in

927

See Section V.B.1.b of the Securities Offering Reform Release.

928

For offerings of ABS on Form SF-1, existing Securities Act Rule 430A would apply.

319

accordance with new Rule 424(h), except for the omission of information with respect to the
offering price, underwriting syndicate (including any material relationships between the
registrant and underwriters not named therein), underwriting discounts or commissions,
discounts or commissions to dealers, amount of proceeds or other matters dependent upon the
offering price to the extent such information is unknown or not reasonably available to the issuer
pursuant to Rule 409. The information required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(h) includes,
among other things, information about the specific asset pool that is backing the securities in the
takedown and the structure of the transaction. As summarized above, commenters requested that
we clarify what we mean by information with respect to the offering price. We note that new
Rule 430D largely conforms to existing Rule 430B but is tailored to ABS shelf offerings;
therefore, the type of information permitted to be omitted from a preliminary prospectus is the
same as the information that Rule 430B permitted to be omitted from the base prospectus in a
shelf offering prior to this rulemaking.
As we stated in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, so long as a form of prospectus has
been filed in accordance with Rule 430D, 929 asset-backed issuers can continue to utilize a free
writing prospectus or ABS informational and computational materials in accordance with
existing rules. 930 Because we believe that investors should have access to a comprehensive

929

Rule 430D(c) provides that a form of prospectus that omits information as provided in the rule will be a
permitted prospectus. Thus, after a registration statement is filed, offering participants can use a form of
prospectus that omits information in accordance with the rule.

930

ABS informational and computational materials, as defined in Item 1101 of Regulation AB [17 CFR
229.1101], may be used in accordance with Securities Act Rules 167 and 426 [17 CFR 230.167 and 17
CFR 230.426]. Materials that constitute a free writing prospectus, as defined in Securities Act Rule 405

320

prospectus that contains all of the required information, a free writing prospectus or ABS
informational and computational materials could not be used for the purpose of meeting the
requirements of new Rule 424(h). As proposed, the Rule 424(h) preliminary prospectus filing
will be deemed part of the registration statement on the earlier of the date such form of
prospectus is filed with the Commission or, if used earlier, the date of first use. 931 A final
prospectus for ABS shelf offerings should continue to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b).
Consistent with Rule 430B for shelf offerings of corporate issuers, under new Rule 430D, the
filing of the final prospectus under Rule 424(b) will trigger a new effective date for the
registration statement relating to the securities to which such form of prospectus relates for
purposes of liability.
To reflect the requirements under new Rule 424(h) and new Rule 430D, we are also
adopting, as proposed, conforming revisions to the undertakings that are required by Item 512 of
Regulation S-K 932 in connection with a shelf registration statement. For the most part, ABS
issuers will continue to provide the same undertakings that have been required of ABS issuers
conducting delayed shelf offerings. In light of adopting the new Rule 424(h) preliminary
prospectus, we are adopting conforming revisions to the undertakings relating to the
determination of liability under the Securities Act as to any purchaser in the offering. In
particular, the issuer must undertake that information that was omitted from an effective

[17 CFR 230.405] may be used in accordance with Securities Act Rules 164 and 433 [17 CFR 230.164 and
17 CFR 230.433].

This is consistent with the existing provisions for other preliminary prospectuses. See Rule 430B(e).

deemed part of and included in the registration statement on the earlier of the date the Rule
424(h) preliminary prospectus was filed with the Commission, or if used earlier, the date it was
first used after effectiveness. Also, in light of the new Rule 424(h) preliminary prospectus, under
our revisions to Item 512 of Regulation S-K, an issuer is required to undertake to file the
information required to be contained in a Rule 424(h) filing with respect to any offering of
securities.
2.

Forms SF-1 and SF-3
a)

Proposed Rule

In order to delineate between ABS filers and corporate filers and, more importantly, to
tailor requirements for ABS offerings, we proposed to add new registration forms that would be
used for any sales of a security that is an asset-backed security, as defined in Item 1101 of
Regulation AB. 933 New forms named Form SF-1 and Form SF-3 would require all the items
applicable to ABS offerings that are currently required in Form S-1 and Form S-3 as modified by
the proposals in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release and the 2011 ABS Re-Proposal. Under the
proposal, ABS offerings that qualify for shelf registration would be registered on proposed Form
SF-3, and all other ABS offerings would be registered on Form SF-1. 934

933

17 CFR 229.1101(c).

934

We also proposed to make conforming changes throughout our rules to refer to the new forms. See, e.g.,
proposed revisions to Securities Act Rules 167 and 190(b)(1) and the exhibit table in Item 601 of
Regulation S-K.

322

b)

Comments on Proposed Rule

Several commenters specifically supported adopting new Forms SF-1 and SF-3 and none
opposed. 935
c)

Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Final Rule

We are adopting new Forms SF-1 and SF-3 for ABS offerings, which are largely based
on existing Forms S-1 and S-3. ABS offerings that qualify for shelf registration will be
registered on Form SF-3, and all other ABS offerings will be registered on Form SF-1. These
new registration forms are tailored to ABS offerings and incorporate the offering and disclosure
changes that we are adopting. The new forms will help in providing organizational clarity to our
registration forms and their requirements. 936 In addition to providing organizational clarity to
our forms, the new forms will facilitate easy identification of registered ABS offerings. We
acknowledge, however, that ABS issuers may incur some costs in revising their information
systems to reflect the new forms, but we believe that such one-time costs will be justified by the
benefits of tailoring the registration system for ABS offerings. 937

935

See letters from ABA I and MBA I.

936

For example, prior to the adoption of these new registration forms for ABS, ABS form requirements were
included with some other form requirements that were not applicable to ABS offerings. New Form SF-1,
as proposed, does not include the instructions as to summary prospectuses. We also note that we are
adopting, as proposed, some disclosure requirements that were previously located in Form S-3 that are now
in Form SF-3, such as transaction requirements from Form S-3 relating to delinquent assets and residual
value for certain securities. See General Instruction I.B.1(e)-(f) of Form SF-3. We are also retaining the
existing registrant requirement in Form S-3 relating to delinquent filings of the depositor or an affiliate of
the depositor for purposes of new Form SF-3.

937

Economic analysis of the new disclosure requirements required by the new forms, such as asset-level data,
and the new shelf eligibility requirements are discussed in the sections describing those changes.

323

Shelf Eligibility for ABS Offerings

In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we proposed revisions to both the registrant and the
transaction shelf eligibility requirements for ABS issuers. 938 In particular, ABS issuers would no
longer establish shelf eligibility through an investment-grade credit rating. The proposals were
part of a broad ongoing effort to remove references to NRSRO credit ratings from our rules in
order to reduce the risk of undue ratings reliance and eliminate the appearance of an imprimatur
that such references may create. 939 In place of credit ratings, we had proposed to establish four
shelf eligibility criteria that would apply to mortgage-related securities and other asset-backed
securities alike. 940 Similar to the existing requirement that the securities must be investment
grade, the 2010 ABS Proposal for registrant and transaction requirements were designed to
provide that asset-backed securities that are eligible for delayed shelf registrations are shelf
appropriate. As noted above, the 2011 ABS Re-Proposal for registrant and transaction
requirements for shelf did not contain a requirement for risk retention or a requirement to include

938

See the 2010 ABS Proposing Release at 23338.

939

See the Security Ratings Release.

940

The four proposed shelf criteria from the 2010 ABS Proposing Release included: (1) A certification filed at
the time of each offering off of a shelf registration statement, or takedown, by the chief executive officer of
the depositor that the assets in the pool have characteristics that provide a reasonable basis to believe that
they will produce, taking into account internal credit enhancements, cash flows to service any payments on
the securities as described in the prospectus; (2) Retention by the sponsor of a specified amount of each
tranche of the securitization, net of the sponsor’s hedging (also known as “risk retention” or “skin-in-thegame”); (3) A provision in the pooling and servicing agreement that requires the party obligated to
repurchase the assets for breach of representations and warranties to periodically furnish an opinion of an
independent third party regarding whether the obligated party acted consistently with the terms of the
pooling and servicing agreement with respect to any loans that the trustee put back to the obligated party
for violation of representations and warranties and which were not repurchased; and (4) An undertaking by
the issuer to file Exchange Act reports so long as non-affiliates of the depositor hold any securities that
were sold in registered transactions backed by the same pool of assets. See the 2010 ABS Proposing
Release at 23338-48.

324

an undertaking to provide Exchange Act reports in light of the changes mandated by the DoddFrank Act. 941
We believe the new transaction and registrant shelf eligibility requirements being adopted
will continue to allow ABS issuers to access the market quickly by conducting delayed shelf
offerings (rather than registering each offering on Form SF-1), while imposing conditions that
we think are appropriate in light of the compressed timing and lack of staff review inherent in the
shelf offering process. These new shelf eligibility conditions should encourage ABS issuers to
design and prepare ABS offerings with greater oversight and care and, along with providing
investors stronger enforcement mechanisms in the transaction agreements, should incentivize
issuers to provide investors with accurate and complete information at the time of the offering.
We believe that such transactions are appropriate for public offerings off a shelf without prior
staff review.
a)

Shelf Eligibility – Transaction Requirements

The new transaction requirements for shelf offerings include:
•

A certification filed at the time of each offering from a shelf registration statement, or
takedown, by the chief executive officer of the depositor concerning the disclosure
contained in the prospectus and the structure of the securitization;

941

See footnotes 876 and 877.

325

•

A provision in the underlying transaction agreements requiring review of the assets
for compliance with the representations and warranties following a specific level of
defaults and security holder action;

•

A provision in the underlying transaction agreements requiring repurchase request
dispute resolution; and

•

A provision in the underlying transaction agreements to include in ongoing
distribution reports on Form 10-D a request by an investor to communicate with other
investors.

In both the 2010 ABS Proposing Release and the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release, we did not
propose to change the other current ABS shelf offering transaction requirements related to the
amount of delinquent assets in the asset pool and the residual values of leases. 942 Therefore,
those transaction requirements remain unchanged and have been moved to new Form SF-3.
(1)

Certification
(a)

Proposed Rule

As part of the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we proposed to require a certification by the
depositor’s chief executive officer as a criterion for shelf eligibility. 943 After considering the
comments received on the proposed certification in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we re-

942

See footnote 874.

943

In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we proposed that the depositor’s chief executive officer certify that to
his or her knowledge, the assets have characteristics that provide a reasonable basis to believe they will
produce, taking into account internal credit enhancements, cash flows at times and in amounts necessary to
service payments on the securities as described in the prospectus. Under the 2010 ABS Proposal, the chief
executive officer would also certify that he or she has reviewed the prospectus and the necessary
documents for this certification.

326

proposed the requirement in the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release. The re-proposed requirement
would require the CEO or the executive officer in charge of securitization for the depositor to
certify that:
•

The executive officer has reviewed the prospectus and is familiar with the structure of
the securitization, including without limitation the characteristics of the securitized
assets underlying the offering, the terms of any internal credit enhancements, and the
material terms of all contracts and other arrangements entered into to effect the
securitization;

•

Based on the executive officer’s knowledge, the prospectus does not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make
the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were
made, not misleading;

•

Based on the executive officer’s knowledge, the prospectus and other information
included in the registration statement of which it is a part, fairly present in all material
respects the characteristics of the securitized assets underlying the offering described
therein and the risks of ownership of the asset-backed securities described therein,
including all credit enhancements and all risk factors relating to the securitized assets
underlying the offering that would affect the cash flows sufficient to service payments
on the asset-backed securities as described in the prospectus; and

•

Based on the executive officer’s knowledge, taking into account the characteristics of
the securitized assets underlying the offering, the structure of the securitization,
including internal credit enhancements, and any other material features of the
327

transaction, in each instance, as described in the prospectus, the securitization is
designed to produce, but is not guaranteed by the certification to produce, cash flows
at times and in amounts sufficient to service expected payments on the asset-backed
securities offered and sold pursuant to the registration statement.
In the 2011 ABS Re-Proposal, we stated, as we did when we proposed the certification
for Exchange Act periodic reports, that a certification may cause these officials to review more
carefully the disclosure, and in this case, the transaction, and to participate more extensively in
the oversight of the transaction, which is intended to result in shelf-eligible ABS being of a
higher quality than ABS structured without such oversight. 944
(b)

Comments on Proposed Rule

Comments on the certification requirement in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release were
mixed. Some commenters supported our proposed certification by noting, among other things,
that the certification would create accountability at the highest levels of an issuer’s organization
and more careful issuer review of the securitization. 945 Other commenters generally opposed the

proposed certification in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release for various reasons, including that the
certification would constitute a guarantee or would cause undue reliance on the certification. 946
In response to comments on the proposed certification, in the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing
Release, we re-proposed the certification taking into account commenters’ concerns and
recommendations. Comments received on the re-proposed certification requirement were mixed.
Several commenters generally supported the re-proposed certification for similar reasons as
articulated in comments on the 2010 proposed certification. 947 For example, one commenter
agreed with our view that the certification may result in a more careful review of the disclosure
and transaction by the issuer, and ultimately in higher-quality ABS eligible for shelf. 948 Other
commenters generally opposed the re-proposed certification shelf requirement. 949 Although the
investors of a trade association applauded the intention behind the proposed certification
requirement and concurred with us that executive oversight of a securitization transaction is
important, they also expressed concern about the certification imposing a barrier to new ABS
issuance. 950 Some of these commenters contended that the proposed certification would not

and their trust in the market’s determination of the issuer’s soundness. 951
Commenters provided differing views on the scope of the certification. Some
commenters believed the certification should encompass both the structure of the transaction and
the prospectus disclosure, as proposed. 952 One commenter, supportive of the re-proposed
certification, emphasized that the quality of an ABS offering is fundamentally a function of
whether the assets and structure are capable of producing sufficient cash flows to service
payments. 953 On the other hand, several commenters believed that the certification should focus
only on the disclosure in the prospectus and not on the performance of the assets for various
reasons, including the role of the executive officers and their limited credit analysis expertise. 954
Many commenters also offered alternative language or specific changes to the text of the
certification to address their concerns. The specific changes included: using defined terms,
adding materiality to certain parts of the certification, replacing the term “fairly presented,” and
permitting the certifier to take into consideration external credit enhancement. We considered

certification requirements, as proposed, were broad and executives would fear litigation if, in fact, the
securities failed to perform as expected).

these specific changes and made revisions to the certification, which are reflected in the final
version of the certification that we are adopting. Below we discuss these recommendations and
the revisions made to each paragraph of the certification in order to highlight how we have
addressed commenters’ concerns.
(c)
Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Shelf
Certification Requirement
After taking into consideration the comments we received and alternatives to the reproposed certification, we are adopting as one of the transaction requirements for shelf eligibility
that a certification about the disclosures contained in the prospectus and the structure of the
securitization be provided by the chief executive officer of the depositor at the time of each
takedown. We believe, as discussed more fully below, that requiring the chief executive officer
to sign a certification at the time of each takedown will help to ensure that he or she is actively
involved in the oversight of the transaction when the actual structuring occurs. We have made
significant changes to the language of the certification to address commenters’ concerns, which
are described below.
The financial crisis revealed several failures of the ABS market. Some issuers of assetbacked securities were creating securitization transactions without considering whether the assets
or the structuring of cash flows could support the scheduled distributions due to investors. 955 In

955

See, e.g., Susanne Craig & Kara Scannell, Goldman Settles Its Battle with SEC, WALL ST. J., July 16,
2010, at A1 and John Griffin and Gonzalo Maturana, “Who Facilitated Misreporting in Securitized
Loans?,” working paper, 2013 (for evidence that underwriters were aware of some types of asset quality
misrepresentation by loan originators, but nevertheless facilitated issuance of RMBS backed by such
assets).

331

addition, it has been difficult to hold senior officers of ABS issuers accountable for the failure to
provide accurate information.
At the time of filing a shelf registration statement, the chief executive officer of the
depositor, as well as the depositor’s other principal officers, are required to sign the registration
statement and are liable under Securities Act Section 11 for material misstatements or omissions
in the registration statement, subject to a due diligence defense. As a result, signers of a
registration statement are expected to satisfy themselves about the accuracy of disclosure at the
time of effectiveness. The disclosure at the time of effectiveness of the shelf registration
statement does not typically include transaction specific information because the shelf
registration process permits a separation between the time of effectiveness and the time securities
are offered in a takedown. Shelf takedowns sometimes occur long after the effectiveness of the
registration statement, and the signers of a registration statement are not required to sign a
prospectus supplement for a takedown. Thus, the process that an officer signing the registration
statement would undertake at the time of shelf effectiveness might not necessarily be followed at
the time of a takedown. At the time of a takedown, some of these officers may not have
carefully reviewed the prospectus disclosures for the accuracy of the disclosures of the pool
assets, cash flows, and other transaction features. We believe that investors’ willingness to
participate in ABS offerings may have suffered, in part, because of a belief by investors that
sufficient attention may not have been devoted to the preparation of the disclosures in
prospectuses, especially in asset classes characterized by the largest losses and due diligence
failures.

332

Prior to today, a certification by the chief executive officer of the depositor has not been a
requirement at the time of registered offerings of ABS. As part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
(“SOX”) enacted in 2002, CEOs of operating companies are required to certify to the accuracy of
the financial statements of their companies. 956 Those SOX certifications are filed with their
periodic reports and then incorporated by reference into their shelf registration statements. The
same does not apply to ABS. The SOX certifications that are provided by ABS issuers are
limited to the disclosures regarding periodic distributions and servicing of the underlying assets
since ABS issuers do not provide financial statements. Further, the information in periodic
reports relates to an individual ABS transaction, and therefore in most cases, periodic reports of
one ABS offering would be unrelated to future offerings of ABS off the same shelf. Thus, the
periodic reports of an ABS issuer are not typically incorporated into the shelf registration
statement.
We believe, therefore, that because of the market failures described above and where the
depositor is a limited purpose entity created by the sponsor for a particular securitization
program, it is appropriate to condition shelf eligibility on a certification requirement that should
result in a review of the disclosure at the time of a takedown similar to what would occur if the
offering were being conducted at the time of effectiveness of the initial registration statement.
As noted above, the shelf requirements and practices under the existing regulatory structure were
not sufficient to address the failures in the market to provide accurate and full information to

956

333

investors. An ABS offering most resembles an IPO, 957 which under our rules would not be
eligible for shelf registration. The principal executive officer signs the registration statement for
an IPO, but no similar process is involved at the time of an offering of ABS off a shelf
registration statement. Corporate issuers that are eligible for shelf registration file periodic
reports that are certified by their principal executive and financial officers and, for Section 11
purposes, the filing of the annual report on Form 10-K is considered an amendment to a shelf
registration statement with a new effective date. We believe that requiring the certification with
each takedown will put ABS issuers on a similar footing in that this requirement will provide an
incentive for all CEOs to participate more extensively in the oversight of the transaction at the
time of takedown. We acknowledge that the certification shelf transaction requirement will
impose additional costs on ABS issuers, as discussed more fully below.
The depositor’s chief executive officer will need to certify to the characteristics of the
asset pool, the payment and rights allocations, the distribution priorities and other structural
features of the transaction. We note that because the chief executive officer could rely, in part,
on the review that is already required in order for an issuer to comply with Securities Act Rule
193, much of the additional costs will relate to reviewing the securitization structure to have a
reasonable basis to conclude that the expected cash flows are sufficient to service payments or
distributions in accordance with their terms. 958 We also note that the certification requirement

957

See footnote 923.

958

See Securities Act Rule 193 (requiring, at a minimum, that the issuer review must be designed and effected
to provide reasonable assurances that the disclosure regarding the pool assets in the prospectus is accurate
in all material respects). In that rulemaking, we also added Item 1111(a)(7) to Regulation AB [17 CFR

334

does not dictate that the chief executive officer follow any particular procedures in order to make
the certification. By allowing the issuers to determine what procedures are necessary to meet the
obligations of the certification, we have attempted to mitigate the costs associated with
compliance. The new certification, however, is intended to increase oversight by the chief
executive officer, which will likely require that issuers create or strengthen internal controls and
procedures to enable the chief executive officer to meet the certification obligation under the new
requirement. To the extent that issuers already regularly monitor and evaluate their policies and
procedures, their incremental costs will be lower than those issuers with less robust controls and
procedures. Because the size and scope of these internal systems is likely to vary among issuers,
it is difficult for us to provide an accurate cost estimate. 959
The final rules may also affect competition in the asset-backed securities market. For
example, the requirement that the chief executive officer provide a certification concerning the
disclosures contained in the prospectus and the structure of the securitization is based on the
intent that the certification will strengthen oversight over the transaction. Prior to today, a
certification by the chief executive officer has not been a requirement of public offerings of
ABS. Just as every issuer in an IPO must go through a process to satisfy itself with the

229.1111(a)(7)] to require disclosure in the prospectus regarding the nature of the review performed by the
issuer, and the findings and conclusions of the review of the assets. See the January 2011 ABS Issuer
Review Release.
959

The number of ABS deals by each depositor annually varies widely. According to ABS issuance databases
ABAlert and CMAlert, the maximum annual number of ABS issued by a single depositor was 175
(Countrywide Home Loans in 2005), the maximum annual number issued post-crisis was 15 (Citibank in
2013), and, in the real estate sector, 14 (Redwood Trust in 2013), the median is 2 deals per year per
depositor both pre- and post-crisis.

335

disclosure in a prospectus, ABS issuers must institute controls in order to provide the
certification. The burden of the certification requirements will likely fall disproportionately on
smaller-sized sponsors to the extent that there are direct fixed (i.e., non-scalable) costs related to
administrative and legal expenses. This could ultimately result in smaller sponsors not
registering their offerings on shelf (by registering their ABS on Form SF-1 instead), offering
them through unregistered offerings, or quitting the securitization markets altogether, thereby
reducing competition. 960

960

We considered academic studies that examined the overall impact of the SOX requirements, which
included officer certification as one element, for information about the possible differential impact of a
certification requirement on differently-sized sponsors. Because the SOX requirements apply primarily to
operating companies and include the internal control report requirement and the auditor’s attestation of the
report in addition to officer certification, we do not believe these studies provide a direct comparison for
assessing the impact of the certification alone. For a general discussion of costs related to these
requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, see, e.g., OFFICE OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS, STUDY OF THE
SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 SECTION 404 INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
REQUIREMENTS (2009), available at http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2009/sox-404_study.pdf (finding
that the start-up costs related to SOX Section 404 compliance and the internal control report requirement
weighed proportionally more on smaller companies, but dissipated over time and noting that 79% of
executives surveyed acknowledged that compliance had a positive impact on the quality of their internal
control structure); Cindy R. Alexander, Scott W. Bauguess, Gennaro Bernile, Yoon-Ho Alex Lee, &
Jennifer Marietta-Westberg, Economic Effects of SOX Section 404 Compliance: A Corporate Insider
Perspective, 56 J. ACCT. & ECON. 267 (2013) (finding that corporate executives perceived significant
benefits from compliance, particularly for larger companies); Ehud Kamar, Pinar Karaca-Mandic & Eric
Talley, Sarbanes-Oxley’s Effects on Small Firms: What is the Evidence?, in IN THE NAME OF
ENTREPRENEURSHIP? THE LOGIC AND EFFECTS OF SPECIAL REGULATORY TREATMENT FOR SMALL

Pub. Pol’y 2007) (discussing the impact of the entire Sarbanes-Oxley Act, not only the CEO certification
requirement); Ellen Engel, Rachel M. Hayes & Xue Wang, The Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Firms’ Going
Private Decisions, J. ACCT. & ECON. (2007) (finding that the frequency of going-private transactions
increased after the passage of SOX, that SOX compliance costs were more burdensome for smaller and less
liquid firms, and that small firms with highly concentrated ownership structures had higher going-private
announcement returns); and Peter Iliev, The Effect of SOX Section 404: Costs, Earnings Quality and Stock
Prices, J. FIN. (2010) (finding that among small companies, SOX compliance reduced the market value of
those that had to comply with Section 404 relative to those that did not because they were under the $75
million compliance threshold).

336

As noted above, commenters expressed concern that the certification could be interpreted
as a guarantee of the future performance of the assets underlying the ABS. In an attempt to
mitigate these costs and taking into account commenters’ suggestions, we have revised the
certification language to reflect that it is a statement of what is known by the certifier at the time
of the offering and that he or she has a reasonable basis to conclude that the securitization is
structured to produce, but the certification is not a guarantee that it will produce, expected cash
flows at times and in amounts to service scheduled payments of interest and the ultimate
repayment of principal on the securities (or other scheduled or required distributions on the
securities, however denominated) in accordance with their terms as described in the
prospectus. 961 In addition, to address some commenters’ concerns about increased certifier
liability, which would in turn increase costs, the final certification includes a new paragraph that
clarifies that the certifier has any and all defenses available under the securities laws. 962
When deciding whether to conduct a shelf offering, an issuer may consider the review
and due diligence costs, the liability implications, and the reputational consequences to the chief
executive officer of signing the certification. We believe that for securitizations of low-risk pool
assets, simple structures, or structures used previously that have performed well in the past,
issuers likely will conclude that the due diligence, liability, and reputation costs will be relatively
low. For such securitizations these costs will likely be justified by the benefits of quick access to

961

See, e.g., letters from AFME, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. dated Oct. 4, 2010 submitted in response to the
2010 ABS Proposing Release (“J.P. Morgan II”), SIFMA III-dealers and sponsors, and Wells Fargo II.

337

the capital markets, and these securitizations will continue to be offered off a shelf registration
statement. On the other hand, for securitizations of high-risk assets and complex cash-flow
structures, the expected costs of shelf offerings may increase. Issuers may choose not to use
shelf registration because the chief executive officer may need to dedicate additional time to
review the pool assets and the securitization structure in order to provide the assurances included
in the certification. In addition, for such securitizations, the potential litigation risk to the chief
executive officer may be higher, even when prudent measures are employed to structure an
offering, thus further increasing the costs of shelf registration.
We also acknowledge a commenter’s concern that certification is not a requirement for
any other debt or equity offering and another commenter’s opinion that the certification
requirement will impose a barrier to new ABS issuance. 963 We note, however, unlike other
offerings, ABS issuers can go directly to shelf without any reporting and operating experience
for the trust or any size requirement designed to be a proxy for market following. 964 We also
note that the principal executive and financial officers certify the Exchange Act reports that are
incorporated by reference into a shelf prospectus of a corporate issuer. The certification
requirement is not intended to be a barrier to new issuance of ABS since the certification is not a
condition for selling or registering ABS as they may be offered in unregistered transactions or
registered on new Form SF-1. The certification requirement, along with the other shelf

We further note that we have replaced the investment-grade rating shelf criterion for non-convertible
securities with alternative criteria that serve as proxies for market following. See the Security Ratings
Release.

338

transaction requirements, should encourage ABS issuers to design and prepare ABS offerings
with greater oversight and care and should incentivize issuers to provide investors with accurate
and complete information at the time of the offering. It is these transactions that are appropriate
to be offered to the public off a shelf without prior staff review. For these reasons, we are not
limiting the certification to disclosure alone as suggested by some commenters, but we have
taken into account those commenters’ concerns in developing the text of the final certification.
Other financial regulators, including foreign counterparts, have adopted similar rules
designed to enhance accountability for the transaction structure. For example, the European
Union adopted requirements that ABS issuers disclose in each prospectus that the securitized
assets backing the issue have characteristics that demonstrate a capacity to produce funds to
service any payments due and payable on the securities. 965 Although we considered adopting an
issuer disclosure requirement, we believe that requiring the chief executive officer to provide a
certification is a stronger approach and more appropriate for purposes of determining shelf
eligibility.
Therefore, while we recognize that the new shelf certification requirement introduces
new costs to issuers, we believe that its net effect on capital formation in the ABS markets would
be positive. The certification will help to ensure that the chief executive officer of the depositor

is actively involved in the oversight of the transaction, and, as discussed above, along with the
other shelf transaction requirements, it should encourage ABS issuers to design and prepare ABS
offerings with greater oversight and care and should incentivize issuers to provide investors with
accurate and complete information at the time of the offering. As a result, we believe that the
certification may also improve investor perceptions about the accuracy and completeness of the
disclosures, which may, in turn, help restore investors’ willingness to invest and participate in
the ABS markets. The impact of certification requirements in other contexts – in particular,
certification requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act – provides information about the
potential consequences of certification in the securitization market. 966 Several academic studies
found that the overall effect on issuer’s capitalization and on measures of market efficiency has
been estimated to be either neutral 967 or positive, 968 suggesting that many investors perceived

966

We note that there are some differences between the SOX certification requirements and the certification
requirements in the rule we are adopting. First, the burdens are different, as SOX mandates that a CEO
sign certifications that require a sizeable commitment of resources, whereas the rule we are adopting may
require hundreds of ABS deals to be certified each year (see footnote 959 for the estimates of annual
certification burden per depositor) but with a significantly lower burden for each certification. Second, the
SOX CEO certification carries both civil and criminal penalties for false certification, and, thus, due in part
to the availability of criminal penalties, likely imposes higher litigation costs for certifying officers and
issuing corporations than the new shelf certification.

967

See Utpal Bhattacharya et al., Is CEO Certification of Earnings Numbers Value-Relevant?, 14 J.

Mechanisms and the Early-Filing of CEO Certification, 25 J. ACCT. & PUB. POL’Y, 121 (2006). These
papers examined the market reaction to early filing of CEO certifications that the Commission required in
advance of the passage of SOX using event-study methodology and found no reaction to early filing for the
market as a whole. The Battacharya et al. study also found that certification had a neutral effect on returns,
volatility of returns, and volume of trade not only for early certifiers around their certification date, but for
the non-certifiers as well.

that the benefits of SOX certification outweighed the costs. We believe there will be potentially
similar benefits for capital formation and market efficiency resulting from the new shelf
certification. The final certification consists of five paragraphs. 969 We discuss each one in order
below.
(i)

Paragraph One

The first paragraph of the final certification is substantially similar to the re-proposed
text, with some modifications made in response to comments. The final text of paragraph one
reads as follows:
I have reviewed the prospectus relating to [title of all securities, the offer and sale of
which are registered] (the “securities”) and am familiar with, in all material respects, the
following: the characteristics of the securitized assets underlying the offering (the
“securitized assets”), the structure of the securitization, and all material underlying
transaction agreements as described in the prospectus;
As proposed, the certifier is required to certify that he or she has reviewed the prospectus
and the necessary documents to make the certification. We believe that the chief executive
officer should be sufficiently involved in overseeing the transaction and should review the
prospectus and the documents necessary to make the certification. Several commenters
suggested that we clarify that the chief executive officer may rely on senior officers under his or

CREDIT AND BANKING, 1263 (2006) (finding a positive market reaction to certification requirements among
bank holding companies, given the inherent opacity in the banking system, with the certification providing
valuable information to investors). Because we are requiring new asset-level disclosure to address
asymmetric information in addition to the shelf certification, we recognize that the results from these
studies may not provide a fully comparable basis for the potential impact of requiring certification for
asset-backed securities.
969

Consistent with other certifications, the language of the certification must not be revised in providing the
required certification. See the 2004 ABS Adopting Release at 1570.

341

her supervision that are more familiar and involved with the structuring of the transaction in
order to more accurately reflect the team-oriented nature of the transaction. 970 We understand
that a principal officer of the depositor may rely on the work of other parties, thus we are not
requiring that the chief executive officer actually structure the transaction. We continue to
believe, however, that the chief executive officer should provide appropriate oversight so that he
or she is able to make the certification. Furthermore, the text of this certification in this respect
is consistent with the text of other certifications, which do not specifically state that the certifier
relied on the work of others. 971
At the suggestion of commenters, we are adding defined terms for “securities” and
“securitized assets” for purposes of the certification and incorporating those defined terms
throughout the remainder of the certification to ease readability. 972 In the final rule, the term
“securities” refers to all of the securities that are offered and sold with the related prospectus.
The term “securitized assets” refers to the assets underlying the securities that are being offered.
Commenters also requested that the paragraph be revised to make it more explicit that the
certifier is responsible for knowing material aspects of the assets and the material underlying
transaction agreements. 973 Commenters argued that “material” is consistent with customary

disclosure principles, including Regulation AB, and therefore provides consistency. 974
Additionally, commenters explained that the contracts for the transaction and the documents for
each underlying asset are extensive and that the certifying officer should not be expected to be
familiar with all of the terms in these documents. 975 We have revised the first paragraph to
clarify that the certifier is speaking of material facts by inserting “in all material respects.” We
have also used this phrase at the beginning of paragraphs three and four to address similar
concerns by commenters.
We have deleted “including without limitation” in response to commenters’ suggestions
that this language made the scope of the certification unclear. 976 In addition, some commenters
requested that we add “described therein” following “am familiar with the structure of the
securitization” to clarify that the certification is based on the certifier’s review of the
prospectus. 977 The final text does not incorporate this suggestion because we do not believe the
chief executive officer’s review should necessarily be based solely on the review of the
prospectus, which we discuss in more detail below.
Finally, under the re-proposed rule, the certifying officer could take into account only
internal credit enhancements in making the certification. 978 Commenters, however, believed that

978

See footnotes 33 and 55 in the 2011 ABS Re-Proposal. In the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release, we noted
that internal credit enhancement would include subordination provisions, overcollateralization, reserve
accounts, cash collateral accounts or spread accounts, as well as guarantees applicable to an underlying

343

the certifier should be permitted to take into consideration external credit enhancement in
providing the certification. One commenter noted, for example, that investors in ABS with
external credit enhancement rely on and give credit for external credit enhancement just as they
do for internal credit enhancement. 979 Another commenter noted that external credit
enhancements can play an integral role in maximizing the likelihood that securities will receive
payment. 980 Further, one issuer noted that it could not provide the certification unless it is able
to take into account external credit enhancements. 981
In light of comments, under the final rule, the certifier is permitted to consider internal
and external credit enhancement in providing the certification. We continue to believe, however,
that the primary focus of the certification should be on the underlying assets rather than on any
credit enhancement since, consistent with the Regulation AB definition of asset-backed security,
the cash flows from the pool assets should primarily service distributions on the ABS. 982 We
also note that we decided not to list “credit enhancement” specifically in the final certification
because we believe that the phrase “the structure of the securitization” encompasses, among
other things, credit enhancement and cash flows.

pool assets or the securities.

enhancement would include guarantees applicable to the underlying loans.

344

(ii)

Paragraph Two

We did not receive any comments suggesting specific changes to paragraph two and we
continue to believe that it is appropriate to expect signers of a registration statement to satisfy
themselves about the accuracy of the disclosure at the time of each takedown. The final text
reads, as proposed:
Based on my knowledge, the prospectus does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading;
(iii)

Paragraph Three

The third paragraph of the final certification is substantially similar to the proposed text,
with some modifications. The final text of paragraph three reads as follows:
Based on my knowledge, the prospectus and other information included in the
registration statement of which it is a part fairly present, in all material respects, the
characteristics of the securitized assets, the structure of the securitization and the risks of
ownership of the securities, including the risks relating to the securitized assets that
would affect the cash flows available to service payments or distributions on the
securities in accordance with their terms; and
Paragraph three requires a certification that the disclosures in the prospectus and other
information in the registration statement are fairly presented. 983 Several commenters requested
that we delete the term “fairly present” and suggested that we use alternative language. 984 Some
commenters noted that the term “fairly presents” is customarily used by experts primarily in

983

For the same reasons articulated in our discussion of paragraph one, we have also added “structure of the
securitization” here in paragraph three and in paragraph four.

345

certifying the accuracy of the financial information. 985 For example, one commenter stated that
because the certifying officer is not certifying to the accuracy of the financial information, but
rather to the adequacy of the disclosure in the prospectus regarding the securitization it would be
more appropriate to use a different term. 986 Commenters differed as to an appropriate
replacement. Several commenters recommended “describe,” 987 and several other commenters
suggested “disclose.” 988 The term “fairly presents” is used in our regulations with respect to
financial information; however, we do not intend for the term to have the same meaning in this
context. We are retaining the phrase in the certification because we believe it articulates the
appropriate standard for the certification. The term “fairly presents,” as adopted, will require the
CEO to consider whether the disclosure is tailored to the risks of the particular offering and
presented in a clear, non-misleading fashion. Commenters also requested that we insert the term
“material” in certain places in the paragraph similar to their requests in connection with
paragraph one. 989 We are not adding the term “material” in multiple parts of the paragraph as
requested because we believe that the phrase “in all material respects” sufficiently captures
materiality across all the statements in the paragraph and therefore use of the term “material”
elsewhere in the paragraph would be redundant.

In addition, paragraph three, as re-proposed, would have required that the certifier
consider the risk factors relating to the securitized assets underlying the offering that would
affect the cash flows sufficient to service payments on the asset-backed securities as described in
the prospectus. Commenters requested that we revise our reference to “risk factors” 990 so that
the certifier considers instead “all material risks” because disclosure of risks related to the
securitized assets is not limited to the information included under the risk factors section of the
prospectus but also includes information in other parts of the prospectus, such as historical static
pool “loss” data. 991 One commenter recommended that instead of referring to “all risk factors,”
as proposed, that the certification be limited to only the most significant risks because a
certifying officer cannot reasonably anticipate that an insignificant risk might cause significant
losses at the time the officer signs the certification. 992 The same commenter noted that the
existing standard for risk factor disclosure requires “a discussion of the most significant risk
factors that make the offering speculative or risky” and expressed concern that the language in
paragraph three could lead to increased disclosure of risk factors that are not significant to the
ABS transaction. 993
We have considered the comments received and are revising the language of the
certification to replace the phrase “all risk factors” with “the risks relating to the securitized

slightly different qualification, namely that “all risks relating to the Assets that would materially and
adversely affect the cash flows”) (emphasis added).

assets that would affect the cash flows available to service payments or distributions on the
securities in accordance with their terms.” We agree with commenters that the disclosure related
to the risks of the securitized assets is not limited to only the risk factor section of the prospectus
and may be appropriately presented in other parts of the prospectus. Some commenters also
believed that the certification with regard to material risks related to the securitized assets should
be further qualified to include only those that would “adversely” affect the cash flows
“available” to service payments on the ABS “in accordance with their terms.” 994 We are not
inserting the word “adversely” because we believe that the concept is incorporated in the term
“risk” and therefore would be redundant to include. We are, however, revising the phrase “cash
flows sufficient” to “cash flows available” in order to more accurately reflect the nature of passthrough certificates and junior tranches of registered ABS. We are also adding the phrase “in
accordance with their terms” as suggested, because we believe it better describes the certification
that we are requiring by paragraph three (i.e., fair presentation of the risks relating to the
securitized assets that would affect the cash flows available to service payments or distributions
on the securities in accordance with their terms). 995

994

See letters from ASF V and J.P. Morgan II.

995

We are also making revisions to enhance readability by listing each element of the certification in
paragraph three, which eliminates redundancies from the proposed language, as phrases in the proposed
language such as “described therein” and “as described in the prospectus” are no longer necessary to
include. See letters from ABAASA II, ASF V, BoA II, J.P. Morgan II, and Wells Fargo II (noting that it
was unclear how the language after the third comma modifies the prior portion of the sentence and also
whether this language is intended to extend the certification beyond the disclosure to the performance of
the transaction and recommending that “including all material credit enhancements” should be moved to
follow “the material characteristics of the securitized assets underlying the offering described therein”).

348

(iv)

Paragraph Four

Paragraph four of the final certification has also been modified. As described below, we
have also added a fifth paragraph to address concerns related to paragraph four. The final text of
paragraph four reads as follows:
Based on my knowledge, taking into account all material aspects of the characteristics of
the securitized assets, the structure of the securitization, and the related risks as described
in the prospectus, there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the securitization is
structured to produce, but is not guaranteed by this certification to produce, expected cash
flows at times and in amounts to service scheduled payments of interest and the ultimate
repayment of principal on the securities (or other scheduled or required distributions on
the securities, however denominated) in accordance with their terms as described in the
prospectus.
We have made revisions to this paragraph similar to revisions made to paragraph one.
First, commenters suggested that we add the word “material” because, in general, the paragraph
should relate only to material information about the securitized assets, the structure of the
securitization (as discussed below, which includes any credit enhancement) and the related risks
of the offering. 996 We are adding the phrase “all material aspects of” to paragraph four. Second,
commenters asked that we remove the limitation that the certifier consider only internal credit
enhancement in providing the certification. 997 In response to comments, we have revised

996

See letters from ABA II, ABAASA II, ASF V, BoA II, CREFC II, J.P. Morgan II, and Wells Fargo II.

997

Several commenters contended that the certifying officer must be permitted to take into account the
external credit enhancements given that they can play a critical role in certain transactions. See letters from
ABAASA II, ASF V, AFME, and SIFMA III-dealers and sponsors. Another commenter requested that the
Commission clarify that external credit enhancement that is ultimately backed by the full faith and credit of
the United States government may be considered by the certifying officer. See letter from Sallie Mae II.
This commenter explained that a certifying officer cannot certify that “a transaction backed by FFELP
loans is designed to produce cash flows at times and in amounts sufficient to service expected payments on
the ABS” unless it is able to take into account external credit enhancement. To address this issue, this
commenter recommended that the Commission either exempt ABS transactions backed by FFELP loans

349

paragraph four to remove this limitation for the same reasons articulated in our discussion of
paragraph one. 998
We also received several detailed comments on the remaining text of paragraph four.
Some commenters suggested that we replace the word “designed” with “structured” when
certifying to the cash flows that will service payments on the securities. 999 Commenters
explained that the term “structured” is better understood in the context of these transactions and
also reflects the nature of these securitizations as a type of structured finance. 1000 Several
commenters recommended adding that the securitization is structured “to be expected to
produce” rather than just “structured to produce” for further clarification that paragraph four
does not constitute a guarantee. 1001 We are revising the final certification to use the term
“structured” as requested by some commenters; however, we note that we believe the term
“structured” to encompass more than tranching to include, among other things, selection of the
assets, credit enhancement, and other structural features designed to enhance credit and facilitate

from the proposed certification requirement or clarify that external credit enhancements from sources
backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government may be considered by the certifying
officer.
998

As we emphasized in connection with paragraph one, while we are permitting the certifier to consider
credit enhancement in providing the certification, the primary focus in providing the certification should be
on the assets, not the credit enhancement. We note that we have also removed the phrase “any other
material features of the transaction” from paragraph four since we also believe that “structure of the
securitization” encompasses such features.

timely payment of monies due on the pool assets to security holders. 1002 We are not inserting the
term “expected” before “to produce” because we believe that the concept of expected is implicit
in the phrase “structured to produce” and that the phrase “is not guaranteed by this certification
to produce” adequately addresses some commenters’ concern about paragraph four constituting
a guarantee.
Many commenters stressed that they were unsure what the “expected payments” would
be with respect to any particular securitization, such as with pass-through certificates or more
junior tranches of registered ABS. With respect to the issue of pass-through certificates, one
commenter noted that “no fixed principal payments are required to be made.” 1003 Additionally,
several commenters explained that the proposed language failed to account for the possibility
that more junior tranches of registered ABS may bear a moderate credit risk somewhere in
between the most senior registered tranches and the most subordinated unregistered tranches. 1004
Several commenters recommended deleting “expected payment” and inserting “the assets will
produce cash flows at times and in amounts sufficient to service payments on the offered
securities in accordance with the terms described in the prospectus.” 1005 One commenter
expressed concern that the proposed form of the certification could be interpreted to suggest that

1002

See, e.g., Item 1113 of Regulation AB (describing the disclosure required for the structure of transaction).

1003

See letter from ABA II (noting that many pass-through securities “require payment only to the extent of
cash flows actually received and available in accordance with the priority of payments waterfall” and also
indicating that credit rating agencies, in evaluating the likelihood of the payment on ABS classes, typically
refer to “scheduled payments” of interest and “ultimate” repayment of principal and recommended using
those terms here).

the adverse effects of the potential risk had been negated through structuring. 1006 Therefore, this
commenter supported modifying the certification so that it clearly states that the risks described
in the prospectus could adversely affect the cash flows. 1007 Other commenters similarly noted
that the certification fails to acknowledge the Commission’s intent, as stated in the 2010 ABS
Proposing Release, to qualify the certification by the disclosure in the prospectus. 1008
To address commenters’ concerns with “expected payments,” we have revised paragraph
four so that the certification relates to “expected cash flows at times and in amounts to service
scheduled payments of interest and the ultimate repayment of principal on the securities (or other
scheduled or required distributions on the securities, however denominated) in accordance with
their terms as described in the prospectus.” We agree with commenters that certain ABS may
not be required to produce fixed payments, as is the case with pass-through certificates, and that
using the term “expected payments” may have caused confusion. 1009 We believe the revised
language provides greater clarity as to what the chief executive officer is certifying to and more

1006

See letter from ABA II. See also letter from Wells Fargo II (stating that the certification, as currently
drafted, could be interpreted to say that the certifying officer has taken into consideration all the material
information included in the prospectus and that, notwithstanding the risks and uncertainties described in the
prospectus, the certifying officer has certified that the securitization is designed to produce cash flows
sufficient to service the ABS).

1007

See letter from ABA II (recommending the following language: “provided that the risks described in the
prospectus may adversely affect such cash flows”).

1008

See letters from ABAASA II, AFME (stating that it is important that the certification specifically state that
its conclusion takes into account any assumptions described in the prospectus, and also that it state that
cash flows may vary if and to the extent that any of the risk factors described in the prospectus come to
pass), ASF V, and SIFMA III-dealers and sponsors.

1009

See, e.g., letter from ABA II.

352

precisely captures the varying terminology used to describe the amounts due to investors
depending upon the type of ABS transaction.
We also recognize that characterizing the cash flows as “sufficient” to service the
payments or distributions may have inadvertently implied that there will always be adequate cash
flows to service such payments or distributions regardless of whether the ABS is of a lower
tranche or structured as a pass-through security. We have deleted the term “sufficient” to
eliminate this possible confusion. 1010 We believe, however, that even if fixed payments are not
required to be made, a securitization is structured with the expectation that cash flows from the
assets will provide distributions at certain times and amounts, and accordingly we believe that
certification should reflect that expectation. We have therefore moved “expected” to before
“cash flows” to clarify the requirement. We also believe that this change addresses some
commenters’ concerns about lower tranches of shelf registered ABS in that the expectation is not
so much related to payment as to how the cash flow has been structured to allocate distributions
of interest and principal.
One commenter suggested inserting language to indicate that the certifying officer’s
statements are his or her “current beliefs” and that there may be future developments that would
cause his or her opinion to change or result in the assets not generating sufficient cash flows. 1011
Also, commenters stressed the importance of including cautionary statements in the certification

1010

We also removed the term “sufficient” in paragraph three for the same reason where we changed the
language from “the cash flows sufficient” to “cash flows available.”

1011

353

that identify those risks and uncertainties as factors that could cause the actual results to differ
materially from those set forth in the certification. 1012 Several commenters supported the
Commission’s language outlined in Request for Comment No. 4 in the 2011 ABS ReProposal. 1013 As we note above, the certification will be a statement of what is known by the
certifier at the time of the offering. This is made clear by the introductory language to
paragraphs three and four (“based on my knowledge”) and therefore we have not made this
change. 1014 We are also revising the text to insert the phrase “a reasonable basis to conclude,” as
suggested by some commenters to further clarify that the certification applies to what is known
at the time of securitization. 1015 Many commenters argued that paragraph four represents an
assessment and forecast of the future performance of the securitized assets and the ABS, which
would make it a forward-looking statement, and thus the issuers should be entitled to protections
afforded by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements. 1016 We do not believe that paragraph
four is protected by the statutory safe harbor for a forward-looking statement. 1017 We have,

the certification to state, among other things, that it is only an expression of the executive officer’s current
belief and is not a guarantee that those assets will generate such cash flows).

1014

Also note that paragraph one requires that the certifier review the prospectus and the necessary documents
regarding the assets, transactions and disclosures.

1015

See letters from ABAASA II, ASF V, J.P. Morgan II (noting that this language is also consistent with the
defenses that an officer of a registrant would have under the federal securities laws), and Wells Fargo II.

The statutory safe harbor for forward-looking statements is only available to an issuer that is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The depositor for the

354

however, included “related risks” of the securitized assets and structure as described in the
prospectus to address comments that the certifier should be allowed to take risk disclosure into
account. We also note that because the language of the certification cannot be altered, any issues
in providing the required certification must be addressed through disclosure in the prospectus.
For example, if the prospectus describes the risk of nonpayment or other risk that such cash
flows will not be produced, then the certifier would take those disclosures into consideration in
signing the certification.
(v)

Paragraph Five

As discussed above, some commenters expressed concern over potential increased
liability with the certification. We acknowledge that the potential litigation risk to the chief
executive officer may be higher, and we recognize that participants in securities offerings who
make statements about those offerings can face liability for their statements, but we believe that
possible additional risk to the certifier is justified where each takedown provides investors with
offering information about the underlying assets and structure of the securities and recent market
events persuade us that these were insufficient incentives for proper oversight over the
transaction. In this regard, we also note that the certification is tied to the disclosure in the
prospectus. For example, if the prospectus includes disclosure that the terms of the securities do

issuing entity of an asset-backed security is a different “issuer” from that same person acting as a depositor
for any other issuing entity or for purposes of that person’s own securities. See Securities Act Rule 191 [17
CFR 230.191], and Exchange Act Rule 3b-19 [17 CFR 240.3b-19]. Therefore, at the time of an ABS
takedown, other than in the case of master trusts, the entity acting as issuer is not subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. See Securities Act Section 27A (15
U.S.C. 77z-2).

355

not include any expectation (or limited expectation) that the structure will produce cash flows
sufficient to make distributions, the certifier would nonetheless be able to sign the certification
because the certification is based, in part, on the disclosure in the prospectus. In response to
commenters’ concerns about certifier liability, 1018 we note that the CEO can take steps to
mitigate the risks of signing. In addition, the final certification includes a fifth paragraph to
further clarify that the certifier has any and all defenses available to him or her under the federal
securities laws. The final text of paragraph five reads:
The foregoing certifications are given subject to any and all defenses available to me
under the federal securities laws, including any and all defenses available to an executive
officer that signed the registration statement of which the prospectus referred to in this
certification is part.
(vi)

Signature Requirement

In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we had proposed that the depositor’s chief executive
officer sign the certification. We explained that the chief executive officer of the depositor is
already responsible for the disclosure as a signer of the registration statement. 1019 We also
asked, in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, whether an individual in a different position should
be required to provide the certification, such as the senior officer of the depositor in charge of
securitization, in order to be consistent with other signature requirements for ABS. In response
to comments, as part of the 2011 ABS Re-Proposal, we re-proposed to allow either the chief

1018

See letter from ASF V (requesting that the Commission make clear that the certifying officer have any and
all defenses available under the federal securities laws as a person signing the registration statement and
providing recommended language to include in the certification). See also letters from ABA II & J.P.
Morgan II (supporting ASF’s recommended language).

1019

See the 2010 ABS Proposing Release at 23346.

356

executive officer of the depositor or the executive officer in charge of securitization of the
depositor sign the certification.
We received various comments on the appropriate party to sign the certification. One
commenter supported the re-proposal to allow “the executive officer in charge of securitization”
to sign the certification but suggested modifying it to require the signature of “an executive
officer in charge of the securitization.” 1020 This commenter explained that it may be the case that
more than one person may satisfy the role of executive officer in charge of securitization, and it
would be appropriate to permit the executive officer with particular knowledge of the specific
securitization to sign the certification. In response to a request for comment in the 2011 ABS
Re-Proposal regarding whether we should conform signature requirements across forms (e.g.,
Form 10-K and proposed Form SF-3), 1021 one commenter recommended that the “senior officer
in charge of securitization” sign the certification, 1022 and another suggested we broaden the list
of signers to include the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer and controller
or the principal accounting officer of the depositor. 1023 One commenter recommended requiring

1020

See letter from MBA III (stressing that in the context of CMBS it is common for more than one person to
satisfy the definition of executive officer who has worked closely with the securitization).

1021

See Request for Comment No. 3 in the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release. The Form 10-K [17 CFR
249.310] report for ABS issuers must be signed either on behalf of the depositor by the senior officer in
charge of securitization of the depositor, or on behalf of the issuing entity by the senior officer in charge of
the servicing. In addition, the certifications for ABS issuers that are required under Section 302 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act must be signed either on behalf of the depositor by the senior officer in charge of
securitization of the depositor if the depositor is signing the Form 10-K report, or on behalf of the issuing
entity by the senior officer in charge of the servicing function of the servicer if the servicer is signing the
Form 10-K report.

357

an executive officer with a title such as “chief transaction officer” if the Commission is seeking a
party to assume more responsibility for disclosure. 1024
Commenters also provided comments as to why an executive officer would be unable to
provide the certification. For example, some commenters argued that executive officers lack the
expertise to perform the credit analysis necessary to provide the certification. 1025 Another
commenter recommended that, with respect to paragraph four as to any assurance about the
structure and cash flows of the securitization, the issuer, not a principal officer, should provide
the certification because the chief executive officer may be too removed from the process and the
team approach to securitization may not leave any one person in a position to evaluate all of the
material attributes of the securitization. 1026
Similarly, some commenters explained why an executive officer might be unwilling to
provide the certification. One commenter noted that depositors would be unable to effectively
price for the possibility of liability under such a broad certification. 1027 The commenter
explained that to the extent that an executive officer is willing to sign it, he or she will likely do
so only in the most conservative circumstances, which may result in shelf-offered ABS of only
the highest quality and thus preclude shelf offerings of securities with different credit risk and

proposed certification would not provide any additional oversight than what is presently required with
regard to the signers of a registration statement).

perform the type of credit analysis that would be required to give a certification and that credit rating

profiles. Another expressed concern that principal officers may be discouraged from taking such
positions due to exposure to personal litigation. 1028
After considering the comments, the final rule requires that the certification be signed by
the chief executive officer. We are not adopting the suggestion that the executive officer in
charge of the securitization for the depositor sign the certification, as re-proposed, because we
are not acting at this time on the proposal to revise the signature requirements for the registration
statement. We believe that the certification should be signed by a signatory to the registration
statement. Furthermore, we believe that having the chief executive officer as the sole signatory
is appropriate for other policy reasons. Although we understand that the chief executive officer
may not personally undertake credit analysis and that he or she will likely rely on the work of
others to assist him or her with structuring the transaction and preparing the certification as noted
by some commenters, we believe that the depositor’s chief executive officer, as an officer of the
depositor at the highest level, should be responsible for providing proper oversight over the
transaction and thus should be held accountable for the structuring of the transaction and for the
disclosure provided in the prospectus supplement. In that regard, we believe, as we did when we
proposed the certification for Exchange Act periodic reports, that a certification should cause the
chief executive officer to more carefully review the disclosure, and in this case, the transaction,
and to participate more extensively in the oversight of each transaction. 1029

(vii)

Date of the Certification

The date of the certification, as proposed, is required to be as of the date of the final
prospectus. 1030 One commenter supported the proposed date because the deal structure will be
final at that time and the final deal structure is what is being addressed in the certification. 1031
(viii) Opinion by an Independent Evaluator
Alternative
In the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release, we also requested comments on whether, in lieu
of the requirement that the chief executive officer or executive officer in charge of the
securitization of the depositor provide a certification, the Commission should allow an opinion to
be provided by an “independent evaluator.” 1032 Several commenters supported allowing an
opinion by an “independent evaluator” in lieu of the proposed certification. 1033 One commenter
believed that allowing an opinion by an independent evaluator meeting particular requirements
would provide a more detached and objective basis for certification. 1034 The other commenter
stressed that an independent evaluator is particularly important in evaluating the structure of a

1030

See Item 601(b)(36) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.601(b)(36)]. The certification should be filed as an
exhibit to the final 424(b)(2) or (5) prospectus. See also new Item 1100(f) of Regulation AB [17 CFR
229.1100(f)] (specifying procedures for filing required exhibits).

transaction structure but emphasized that the responsibility for the certification would still reside with the
executive).

transaction given that structures are often the product of investment bankers or third parties who
know what securities will sell in the market. 1035 Relatedly, several commenters noted that a
credit rating agency is the more appropriate party to perform the credit analysis required. 1036
In contrast, one commenter noted its opposition to allowing the use of an independent
evaluator, stating that the certification, as proposed, may result in a more careful review of the
disclosure and transaction by the issuer and ultimately higher-quality ABS in shelf offerings. 1037
Another commenter recommended that we not mandate the use of an independent evaluator,
explaining that it is uncertain, especially in the RMBS market, whether there are companies
willing to serve as an independent evaluator given the possibility of increased liability and
preclusion from performing other more desirable roles in the transaction. 1038
As reflected in the comments above, an independent evaluator alternative may provide
benefits to investors and issuers. For issuers that conduct offerings on an infrequent basis, such
an alternative may be less costly than implementing an infrastructure in order for the chief
executive officer to conduct the review required by the certification. However, as one
commenter noted with respect to RMBS, such issuers may encounter difficulty hiring a company

See letter from Kutak.

1036

See letters from AFME and SIFMA III-dealers and sponsors (noting that any conflict of interest inherent in
the rating agency’s credit analysis would be magnified exponentially were such analysis to be effectively
required to be undertaken by an affiliate of an issuer). Additionally, SIFMA III-dealers and sponsors was
troubled that given the Commission’s express intent to reduce the reliance on credit analysis by NRSROs,
that shelf eligibility would instead be conditioned on a credit analysis by an officer of the depositor.

361

that is willing to provide such services and sign the certification. 1039 A certification by the chief
executive officer is designed to increase internal oversight within the issuer. For investors, the
independent evaluator may be able to provide a more detached and objective opinion; however,
investors should also benefit from the enhanced internal oversight by the issuer obtained from
the CEO certification. We are therefore not adopting the independent evaluator as an alternative
to providing a certification.

Asset Review Provision
(a)

Proposed Rule

Investors have expressed concerns about the effectiveness of the contractual provisions
related to the representations and warranties about the pool assets and the lack of responsiveness
by sponsors about potential breaches. 1040 A significant hurdle faced by investors seeking to
enforce repurchase obligations has been that transaction agreements typically have not included
specific mechanisms to identify breaches of representations and warranties or to resolve a
question as to whether a breach of the representations and warranties has occurred. Further,
investors have had to rely upon the trustees to enforce repurchase covenants because the
transaction agreements do not typically contain a provision for an investor to directly make a
repurchase demand. Investors have been frustrated with this structure and process because

1039

See letter from MBA III.

1040

In the underlying agreements for an asset securitization, sponsors or originators typically make
representations and warranties about the pool assets and their origination, including representations about
the quality of the pool assets. Upon discovery that a pool asset does not comply with the representation or
warranty, an obligated party (typically the sponsor) must repurchase the asset or replace it with an asset that
complies with the representations and warranties. See the 2011 ABS Re-Proposal at 47956-57. See also
the Section 943 Adopting Release at 4489-90.

362

trustees have not enforced repurchase rights, and investors have been unable to locate other
investors in order to force trustees to do so. 1041 Furthermore, these contractual agreements have
frequently been ineffective because, without access to documents relating to each pool asset, it
can be difficult for the trustee, which typically notifies the sponsor of an alleged breach, to
determine whether a representation or warranty relating to a pool asset has been breached. 1042
The impact of these difficulties for investors is particularly concerning given the pervasiveness
of misrepresentation among securitized residential real estate loans in the 2000’s. 1043
To address this concern, we proposed in the 2011 ABS Re-Proposal as one of the
transaction requirements for shelf eligibility, that the underlying transaction documents of an
ABS include provisions requiring a review of the underlying assets of the ABS for compliance
with the representations and warranties upon the occurrence of certain post-securitization trigger

1041

Typically, investor rights require a minimum percentage of investors acting together in order to enforce the
representation and warranty provisions contained in the underlying transaction agreements. See Housing
Finance Reform: Fundamentals of a Functioning Private Label Mortgage Backed Securities Market
Hearing Before the S. Comm. on Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs, 113th Cong. 39 (2013) (statement of
Adam J. Levitin, law professor at Georgetown University Law Center) (noting that “before PLS [private
label securities] investors are able to spur a trustee to take action to protect their interests, they face the
challenge of limited information available on which to determine if an event of default has occurred, the
information problem of identifying other PLS investors in their deal, and the collective action problem of
coordinating the required threshold of PLS investors (who do not always have identical incentives and may
trade in and out of their positions), and the expense of indemnifying the trustee).

1042

See, e.g., Kathryn Brenzel, $615M MBS Suit Aims To Rewrite Deal’s Terms, Deutsche Says, LAW360,
May 6, 2013 (noting that the defendant argued that the notification provided by the trustee did not
adequately show misrepresentations). Our requirement addresses this problem because the review required
will provide evidence of misrepresentations that the trustees and investors can then use in making a
repurchase request.

1043

Between 10% and 30% of securitized residential real estate loans exhibited some indication of potential
misrepresentation. See Tomasz Piskorski et al., Asset Quality Misrepresentation by Financial
Intermediaries: Evidence from RMBS Market, (Nat’l Bureau of Econ. Research, Working Paper No.

events. Specifically, we proposed that the transaction agreements require, at a minimum, a
review of the underlying assets (1) when the credit enhancement requirements, as specified in the
transaction documents, are not met, or (2) at the direction of investors pursuant to processes
provided in the transaction agreement and disclosed in the prospectus. 1044 We proposed that the
review would be conducted by a “credit risk manager” who would have access to the underlying
loan documents to assist in determining whether the loan complied with the representations and
warranties provided to investors. 1045 A report of the findings and conclusions of the review
would be provided to the trustee to use in determining whether a repurchase request would be
appropriate, and would also be filed as an exhibit to the Form 10-D.
Finally, we proposed to require certain provisions in the underlying transaction
agreements that would help to resolve repurchase request disputes. We discuss the dispute
resolution provision requirement below in Section V.B.3.a)(3) Dispute Resolution Provision
because we are adopting it as a stand-alone shelf eligibility condition.
As noted above, studies have highlighted the extent of misrepresentations among
securitized residential real estate loans in the 2000’s; however, we are unable to quantify the
extent to which enforcing representations and warranties was an issue during the crisis. While
recently adopted Exchange Act Rule 15Ga-1 implementing Section 943 of the Dodd-Frank Act

1044

We also proposed that disclosure of the findings and conclusions of the review be required on Form 10-D if
an event triggers a review.

1045

Under the proposal, the credit risk manager would be appointed by the trustee and could not be affiliated
with any sponsor, depositor, or servicer in the transaction. Disclosure about the experience of the credit
risk manager in prospectuses would also be required.

364

requires disclosure of fulfilled and unfulfilled repurchase request activity, as a practical matter, it
does not address directly the enforceability of put-back provisions in the underlying transaction
agreements. Further, the historical data provided by Rule 15Ga-1 is limited, as initially only
those securitizers that issued ABS between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2011 were
required to report on Form ABS-15G demand and repurchase history that occurred during that
same period. 1046 As we discussed in the Section 943 Adopting Release, we limited the rule to a
three-year look-back period because we recognized concerns regarding the availability and
comparability of historical information related to repurchase demands. 1047 While we recognize
these limitations, we used the information contained in recent Form ABS-15G filings in order to
provide some baseline information on current market practices. Based on Form ABS-15G filings
of the first quarter of 2013, we find that more than 99% of repurchase requests are in dispute, and
with respect to the resolved requests: 16.5% were satisfied, 48.5% were withdrawn, and 35%
were rejected. 1048 These numbers highlight the fact that enforcing representations and warranties
may be time-consuming and lead to uncertain outcomes for investors. We believe that the asset
review shelf requirement will help to address this problem and enhance the enforceability of the
representations and warranties regarding the pool assets.

1046

See Exchange Act Rule 15Ga-1(c)(1). After December 31, 2011 all securitizers are required to report, on a
quarterly basis, demand and repurchase activity for any new or outstanding ABS. See Exchange Act Rule
15Ga-1(c)(2).

1047

See the Section 943 Adopting Release at 4498-99. We noted that the three-year look-back period for initial
disclosures struck the right balance between the disclosure benefits to investors, availability of historical
information and compliance costs to securitizers. In doing so, we acknowledged that older data may be
very hard or impossible for securitizers to obtain if they have not had systems in place to track the data
required for the required disclosures, which may lead to less comparable data.

1048

We found similar figures for Form ABS-15G filings in other quarters.

Comments on Proposed Rule

Several commenters generally agreed that a review of assets for compliance with
representations and warranties should be a shelf eligibility requirement. 1049 Commenters made it
clear that investors desire more robust representation and warranty enforcement mechanisms. 1050
Many commenters noted that a review mechanism would enhance investor protection and
promote the integrity of asset-backed securities. 1051 Some commenters argued that the proposed
requirement should not be imposed upon transactions other than RMBS transactions. 1052 They
were concerned that enforcement mechanisms could increase costs on transactions where there
have been only a limited number of repurchase requests historically. 1053 Some commenters
responded to the 2011 ABS Re-Proposal by suggesting that the Commission adopt, as an
alternative criterion for shelf eligibility for asset classes other than RMBS, the original proposed

shelf requirements that there be a quarterly third-party review of the assets for compliance with
the representations and warranties, which we did not re-propose in light of comments. 1054 Below
we discuss comments about the various parts of the proposal.
Commenters provided varying comments on the appropriateness of the proposed review
triggers. Several commenters suggested that a trigger for review should not be tied to credit
enhancement, as proposed. 1055 Commenters stated that, for most transactions, a credit
enhancement trigger would not be a feasible measurement across asset classes because many
deals provide for a buildup of credit enhancement over time and, under the proposed rule, the
first distribution could trigger a review. 1056 One commenter stated that certain transactions do
not have pool-level credit enhancements that would trigger a review. 1057 Given these potential
issues with a credit enhancement trigger, some commenters suggested as an alternative that the

1054

See letters from ASF III, BoA II, and VABSS III. In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, the Commission
proposed to require a provision in the pooling and servicing agreement requiring the party obligated to
repurchase the assets for breach of representations and warranties to periodically furnish an opinion of an
independent third party regarding whether the obligated party acted consistently with the terms of the
pooling and servicing agreement with respect to any loans that the trustee put back to the obligated party
for violation of representations and warranties and which were not repurchased. In the 2011 ABS ReProposal, we replaced the quarterly third-party opinion proposal with a proposed review of the underlying
assets upon certain triggers being reached in response to the comments received on the 2010 ABS Proposal.

is built up over time by applying excess interest to pay principal on the ABS, resulting in
overcollateralization), BoA II (noting that in cases where credit enhancement is built over time, credit
enhancement levels do not meet required target levels during most of the early life of the deal), VABSS III

trigger for review be based on a more common measurement of asset performance such as
delinquencies. 1058
As part of the 2011 ABS Re-Proposal, we requested comments on certain aspects of the
investor-directed trigger. For example, we requested comment on whether we should require
that at least 5% of investors must first call for an investor vote on the question of whether to
initiate a review before a vote occurs. 1059 Although comments received were mixed, several
commenters supported such a provision. 1060 Additionally, many commenters agreed that
investors should have the ability to direct a review of assets and suggested procedures that would
provide investors with an effective means to request a review while minimizing baseless claims
that could impose costs. 1061

1058

See letters from ASF III (suggesting objective factors such as cumulative losses, delinquencies, or average
loss severity be the trigger), Metlife II (noting the review should be based on delinquencies as a percentage
of the original subordination for the senior-most class in a transaction), Prudential II (stating that a review
should be triggered if the 60+ day delinquencies percentage is greater than the currently available credit
support or if a loan becomes 90 days delinquent within six months of the loan’s origination or four months
from being included in the pool) and Sallie Mae II (recommending “linking the action of the CRM to an
element that can arise across all asset classes and all structures, namely losses”).

SIFMA II-investors (suggesting that at least 5% of the total interest in the pool may poll other investors to
determine whether a review should be performed). See also letter from Metlife I (explaining that the vast
majority of securitization transactions require a “25%-in-interest voting threshold” before the trustee can be
directed by investors to undertake actions such as polling investors as to whether to exercise rights or
remedies under the transaction agreements).

See, e.g., letters from ASF III (stating that its investor members generally favor the proposal while issuer
members generally oppose it), J.P. Morgan II (stating their belief that investors representing a minimum of

required to agree to a review due to the potential costs), Prudential II (stating that note holders should be
permitted to request a credit risk manager review if 25% of the note holders believe a review is warranted),
SIFMA II-investors (stating their belief that a review be triggered if investors with at least 25% (by
principal balance) of the total interest in the pool of securitized assets agree to a review), and Sallie Mae II

368

We also requested comment on whether, as an alternative to specifying voting
procedures, it would be appropriate to specify certain maximum conditions, where the
percentage of investors required to direct review could be no more than a certain percentage,
such as 5%, 10%, or 25%. Commenters provided differing views on imposing maximum
conditions. Several commenters suggested that 25% would be the appropriate percentage of
investors that should agree to a review before one is required. 1062 Another commenter suggested
that we consider a majority or plurality of those casting a vote, and that we also specify a quorum
requirement. 1063 One commenter suggested that a super-majority would be appropriate. 1064
With respect to disclosing the report on the findings and conclusions of the review,
several commenters recommended that we require a summary of the report instead of the
proposed requirement that the full report be filed as an exhibit to Form 10-D because of privacy

(suggesting specific requirements if the final rule permits investors to direct a review independently of the
credit enhancement trigger).
1062

percentage of investors, we strongly recommend that the required percentage of investors required to direct
a review be no less than 25% of each class of securities outstanding”), Prudential II (“Note holders should
be permitted to request a credit risk manager review if 25% of the note holders believe a review is
warranted. A 25% threshold would serve to limit both the number of frivolous claims and any unnecessary
credit risk manager expenses.”), and Sallie Mae II (stating that if an investor is allowed to direct a review,
among other requirements, the requesting investor must own at least 25% of the outstanding principal
balance of the related ABS).

concerns or potential problems that the requirement would cause with workouts or modifications
with delinquent borrowers. 1065
We also received comments on the selection and appointment of the credit risk manager.
Commenters, in general, opposed the proposal to require that the trustee appoint the credit risk
manager. Commenters noted that the trustee would not be a suitable party to appoint the credit
risk manager and would not be likely to accept the responsibility for appointing the credit risk
manager. 1066 Furthermore, commenters generally explained that the appointment by a trustee
would be unworkable since the trustee is not typically a party to the transaction until it closes,
therefore the trustee would technically not have the authority to appoint the manager until after
the transaction closes. 1067 One of these commenters stated that it is important to have details
about the manager disclosed in the prospectus so that investors can fully understand their impact
on the transaction. 1068
With respect to the proposed prohibited affiliations between the credit risk manager and
certain transaction parties, several commenters supported the proposal, although some
commenters suggested that we not permit the credit risk manager to be affiliated with other

that trustees would not likely accept the responsibility of appointing a manager), and VABSS III (stating
that the independent reviewer should be appointed in the relevant agreement but not solely by the trustee).

additional transaction parties, such as the trustee or any investor. 1069 One commenter stated that
the credit risk manager should not be affiliated with any party hired by the sponsor or
underwriter to perform pre-closing due diligence on the pool assets. 1070 However, one
commenter suggested that the proposal to limit affiliations was overly broad. 1071
Additionally, commenters provided comments about other aspects of the credit risk
manager. For example, some commenters recommended that we revise the title “credit risk
manager” as it may not properly describe its function. 1072 Commenters also stated that it was
important for managers to have access to the underlying documents in order to perform their
duties. 1073 Some commenters also offered their views about the process and conditions for the
removal and replacement of a credit risk manager. One commenter stated that it would be
acceptable for the trustee to appoint a new credit risk manager if the existing one needs to be
removed or replaced for any reason. 1074 Another commenter suggested that we require an

(c)
Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Asset
Review Provision
We are adopting, as a second shelf eligibility requirement, that the underlying transaction
agreements include provisions requiring a review of pool assets in certain situations for
compliance with the representations and warranties made with regard to those assets. Under the
final rule, the agreements must require a review, at a minimum, upon the occurrence of a twopronged trigger based first upon the occurrence of a specified percentage of delinquencies in the
pool and if the delinquency trigger is met, then upon direction of investors by vote. We have
made modifications to the review triggers, discussed below, that we believe help to address some
of the cost concerns expressed by commenters for asset classes that historically have seen a
limited number of repurchase requests. Because we are unable to predict which asset classes
may experience problems in the future, we believe that it is prudent to impose this requirement
for all asset classes. 1077
We have taken into consideration the array of comments received related to the triggers
and potential costs, while at the same time balancing the need for stronger mechanisms to

1075

See letter from Prudential II.

1076

See letter from MetLife II.

1077

We note, for example, that there was not a need to enforce representations and warranties for RMBS and
CMBS until the crisis.

372

enforce underlying contract terms. As we noted above, most transaction agreements lack a
specific mechanism for investors to not only identify potential assets that fail to comply with the
representations and warranties made but also to resolve a question of whether noncompliance of
the representations and warranties constitutes a breach of the contractual provisions. These
problems have been compounded by the fact that investors typically cannot make repurchase
requests directly, thus they have had to rely upon the trustees who have not enforced repurchase
requests in most circumstances. We believe that adopting this shelf provision coupled with the
new dispute resolution and investor communication shelf requirements should provide investors
with effective tools to address the enforceability of repurchase obligations and help overcome
collective action problems. In that regard, we see these shelf requirements working together to
help investors enforce repurchase obligations. Our investor communication provision, discussed
below, will help investors to communicate with each other in order to determine whether they
should vote to direct a review of the assets and later whether to initiate a repurchase request. The
review of the assets required once certain triggers are met will not only benefit investors in
determining whether the assets have breached the representations and warranties but also
whether to move forward with a repurchase request. Additionally, should those parties with
repurchase obligations fail to address investors’ repurchase requests in a timely manner,
investors will now have a means to demand resolution through arbitration or mediation. We
believe that these transactional safeguards will collectively enhance the enforceability of
representations and warranties about the pool assets and provide incentives for obligated parties
to more carefully consider the characteristics and quality of the assets that are included in the
pool. Therefore, this shelf transaction requirement should encourage ABS issuers to design and
373

prepare ABS offerings with greater oversight and care. We believe that stronger enforcement
mechanisms should incentivize issuers to provide investors with accurate and complete
information at the time of the offering. It is these transactions that are appropriate for public
offerings off a shelf without prior staff review. The magnitude of these benefits will depend on
whether the reviewers are able to correctly evaluate the contractual terms to identify noncompliance with the representations and warranties about the pool assets. Such evaluations may
be challenging to the extent that the contractual language for the representations and warranties
are incomplete or ambiguous. Nonetheless, we conclude that the asset review provision will
enhance investor protection for the reasons stated above. We also note that the review
requirement we are adopting is similar to post-crisis industry efforts, such as the American
Securitization Forum’s Project RESTART, which includes repurchase principles for
investigating, resolving, and enforcing remedies with respect to representations and warranties in
RMBS transactions. 1078 Additionally, some recent CMBS deals have included a provision for a
third-party review of the underlying assets.
While we believe that this review requirement will enhance the enforceability of
repurchase obligations, we acknowledge that it will also increase costs, particularly on investors,
who will incur the expense of the reviews. A group of investors noted that despite the additional
costs, increased investor protection will produce net economic benefits to investors. 1079 We

1078

See letter from ASF III.

1079

See letter from SIFMA II-investors (“The concept of increasing costs to investors in order to increase
investor protections is not new. On balance, the strict enforcement of the deal documents by an

374

expect that the bulk of the costs for this shelf requirement will be incurred with individual
reviews of pool assets directed by investors. There will also be some expense arising from
retaining a reviewer to conduct the reviews in the form of an annual retainer fee. 1080 Although
the exact magnitude of the expenses incurred in connection with the reviews is not possible to
predict, we expect that they will depend on the frequency with which a review is triggered and
on the extent of the review. 1081 For instance, securitizations of high-risk assets are more likely
to meet the delinquency threshold and therefore more likely to undergo a review and incur the
review expenses. Additionally, sponsor representations about pool assets characterized by low
or no documentation may require more time for the reviewer to examine and therefore may result
in higher expenses. We have attempted to mitigate the potential costs by not requiring a review
of the assets until after the occurrence of a two-pronged trigger as described below. We expect
that investors will weigh the benefits of a review of the assets against the costs and vote for a

independent credit risk manager, we believe, will in the ordinary course produce net economic benefits to
the investors.”).
1080

The staff is aware of only several recent unregistered RMBS transactions that include a comparable
provision for which we have some cost information. According to Kroll’s Pre-Sale Report for J.P. Morgan
Mortgage Trust 2013-1, the reviewer will be paid an annual retainer fee of $20,000 for the first six years
and $12,000 annually thereafter. The reviewer will also be paid $525 for each mortgage loan subject to a
review. See Kroll’s Pre-Sale Report: J.P. Morgan Mortgage Trust 2013-1(Mar. 20, 2013). We believe that
these costs figures are generally comparable to the costs that RMBS issuers and investors will likely incur
in connection with our review requirement. The costs for other asset classes may be more or less than these
costs figures depending upon the quality of the assets, the extensiveness of the representations and
warranties, and the volume of documents required to review.

1081

In a typical ABS transaction, fees are paid before distributions are made to investors. We remind issuers
that information related to the review fees should be disclosed in accordance with Regulation AB
requirements. See, e.g., Items 1109(b)(4) and 1113 of Regulation AB.

375

review only if the benefits justify the costs. This revised approach should address concerns
about potentially frivolous review requests being made at the cost of other investors.
We also recognize that our approach to require that a reviewer be engaged at the time of
issuance, as opposed to when the above two triggers are met, will be more costly. For asset
classes that rarely experience breaches of representations and warranties, the benefits of this
shelf provision may be smaller than for other asset classes and thus there may be situations
where the costs may be greater than the benefits. We believe, however, that for asset classes
where the likelihood of investors using the review provision is low, the upfront retainer fee
should also be low. We note also that the requirement that the reviewer be engaged at the time
of issuance could potentially create incentive alignment issues. Because of this requirement, a
reviewer could seek to be appointed to as many ABS transactions as possible, thus potentially
creating an incentive to submit reports favorable to sponsors and win future business from them.
This could potentially impact the quality and usefulness of the reports if the reviews are not – or
are not perceived as being – objective. 1082 The significance of this problem should be reduced to
the extent that the reviewer’s compensation is paid by investors, particularly if done so after the
objective triggers for the asset reviews are met. In addition, transaction agreements may
prescribe mechanisms to replace reviewers in the event of failure to meet their obligations.
Finally, reputational concerns could potentially influence reviewers’ decisions to adhere to their
limited role of determining whether the assets comply with the representations and warranties

We note that our rules do not mandate the particular contents of the report. Should these reports ultimately
include subjective elements, the potential incentive misalignments could increase.

376

made. As discussed below, the investors through the trustee, not the reviewer, are responsible
for determining whether to initiate a repurchase request. 1083 Furthermore, we have chosen to
require that the reviewer be named in the offering documents because the identity and
competency of the reviewer is an important consideration for investors in making an ABS
investment decision.
(i)

Triggers for Review

As noted above, the 2011 ABS Re-Proposal specified two separate events, either of
which would trigger a review of the underlying assets under the new shelf eligibility
requirement. One proposed trigger would have required a review when the credit enhancement
requirements of the transaction are not met. The other proposed trigger would have permitted
investors to direct a review of the assets, pursuant to procedures specified in the transaction
agreements. After taking into account the comments received related to the applicability of the
proposed triggers and potential costs, we are modifying the triggers for review.
Under the new shelf eligibility requirement, the pooling and servicing agreement, or other
transaction agreement, must provide for a review of assets, at a minimum, upon the occurrence
of a two-pronged trigger with the first prong being a percentage of delinquencies in the pool and
the second prong being the direction of an investor vote, in each case as specified in the
transaction agreements. Because these thresholds are negotiated by sponsors and investors in

1083

As we have indicated above, investors have encountered difficulty with getting the trustees to initiate
repurchase obligations. We believe that the required report of the conclusions and findings to the trustee,
which should provide evidence of any noncompliance, will make it difficult for trustees to ignore possible
breaches of the contractual provisions.

377

advance of the ABS issuance, and could vary by asset class, deal structure, or takedown, this
approach allows the market to optimize and determine the most effective thresholds, subject to
caps discussed below. In developing this two-prong trigger approach, we have attempted to
balance some commenters’ concerns about potentially unfounded claims by requiring that an
objective threshold based on delinquencies first be met while protecting investors’ ability to
effectively direct a review at a time when rising delinquencies may begin to cause concern that
the assets in the pool may not have met the representations and warranties made in the
transaction documents.
(a)

Delinquency Prong

Rather than tying the trigger to credit enhancement levels, we are adopting an objective
trigger based on delinquencies. 1084 As summarized above, although commenters generally
supported the requirement of an objective trigger, many stated that the proposed credit
enhancement trigger did not easily apply across different asset classes and deal structures. 1085

1084

Current Regulation AB does not establish a standard for determining delinquencies, and we are not
providing a definition of delinquency for purposes of the asset review provision. Regulation AB requires
disclosure of the methodology for determining delinquencies in the prospectus and accordingly, we expect
that the transaction agreements provide the method of determining delinquencies. See Item 1101(d) of
Regulation AB [17 CFR 229.1101(d)]. If the transaction agreements do not use delinquencies to measure
late or non-payment of an underlying obligor, then in order to meet this shelf requirement, a comparable
metric measuring late or non-payment should be used and disclosed. As discussed below, the final rule
requires disclosure regarding how the delinquency trigger was determined to be appropriate. See Item
1113(a)(7)(i) of Regulation AB [17 CFR 229.1113(a)(7)(i)]. Under the new rule, in the case of a
transaction using a metric other than delinquencies, disclosure regarding why a different metric is
appropriate would need to be included.

1085

See letters from ASF III, BoA II, MBA III, SIFMA II-investors, VABSS III, and Wells Fargo II (all noting
that many transactions do not provide for a specific level of credit enhancement to be maintained or the
credit enhancement levels build up over time to a target. In these situations, the review would be triggered
before there would be any real indication that there have been breaches of representations or warranties).

378

We received some recommendations for alternative objective triggers and, in particular,
commenters noted that a trigger based on delinquencies would work across all deal types. 1086
The amount of delinquencies in an asset pool is a metric that is required to be reported at the
time of offering and on an ongoing basis. 1087
We are not specifying the threshold amount of delinquencies that must first be reached,
given the variety of thresholds that may be relevant and the differing approaches offered by
commenters. For instance, we note that some ABS transactions include delinquent loans at the
onset. Furthermore, the shelf eligibility requirements permit registration of offerings of ABS
that include up to 20% of delinquent assets. 1088 We also acknowledge that transaction
participants should have some flexibility across deal structures and asset classes so that they may
negotiate the terms appropriate for each particular offering, including the appropriate
delinquency threshold. 1089 We recognize, however, that providing the transaction parties with
such flexibility may impose costs to investors depending on the procedures established. In
particular, we recognize that by not prescribing a particular delinquency threshold, transaction

1086

See letters from ASF III (suggesting objective factors such as cumulative losses, delinquencies or average
loss severity be the trigger), Metlife II (noting the review should be based on delinquencies as a percentage
of the original subordination for the senior-most class in a transaction), and Prudential II (stating that a
review should be triggered if the 60+ day delinquencies percentage is greater than the currently available
credit support or if a loan becomes 90 days delinquent within six month of the loan’s origination or four
months from being included in the pool).

1087

See Items 1100(b), 1101(c), 1105, 1111(c) and 1121(a)(9) of Regulation AB.

1088

See General Instruction I.B.1(e) of Form SF-3.

1089

We also note that our proposed credit enhancement trigger provided the transaction parties with the
flexibility to set the target levels of the credit enhancement requirements so that they could tailor the
procedures to each ABS transaction, taking into account the specific features of the transaction and/or asset
class.

379

parties could theoretically set this threshold high and thereby make it difficult for investors to
exercise their rights under this provision. To address this concern, we are requiring disclosure in
the prospectus that describes how the delinquency trigger was determined to be appropriate. 1090
The disclosure must include a comparison of the delinquency trigger against the delinquencies
disclosed for prior securitized pools of the sponsor for that asset type. Using this disclosure,
investors will be able to analyze the reasonableness of the delinquency trigger.
The final rule provides some specificity as to how the delinquency threshold must be
calculated in order to provide clarity to issuers and consistency to investors across various
transactions and assets classes, and to prevent possible mechanisms from reducing the
effectiveness of the trigger. The delinquency prong requires that the delinquency threshold be
calculated as a percentage of the aggregate dollar amount of delinquent assets in a given pool to
the aggregate dollar amount of all the assets in that particular pool, measured as of the end of the
reporting period in accordance with the issuer’s reporting obligations. By requiring that the
delinquency calculation be measured as a percentage of the aggregate dollar amount of all assets
in the pool, the calculation will better reflect the magnitude of delinquencies, as compared to a
delinquency calculation measured by counting only the number of delinquent assets without
consideration of the delinquent assets’ relative dollar values. 1091 Furthermore, to prevent issuers
from imposing a higher hurdle to trigger the delinquency threshold for transactions with multiple

1090

See Item 1113(a)(7)(i) of Regulation AB.

1091

We also note that this requirement is similar to how delinquencies are reported by servicers in their
monthly reports (as a percentage of the ending pool balance).

380

sub-pools, we are also requiring that the percentage be based on the percentage of delinquencies
in the sub-pool. For example, if a transaction has divided the underlying assets into three subpools, there will be three separate delinquency trigger calculations. If the delinquencies in one
sub-pool triggers an investor vote (and, as explained below, the subsequent vote is attained to
trigger a review), the final rule requires that the transaction documents specify, at a minimum,
that the assets of the respective sub-pool would be subject to review. 1092 We believe that
requiring the delinquency threshold to be calculated on a sub-pool basis also recognizes the
notion that investors would be primarily concerned about the assets that support their respective
pool. 1093
(b)

Investor Vote Prong

The underlying transaction documentation must include a provision that, after the
delinquency threshold has been reached or exceeded, investors have the ability to vote to direct a
review. In formulating the final rule, we considered whether an investor vote would be
necessary given that the final rule would require an objective trigger first be satisfied. We
appreciate the costs that will be incurred by the investors in connection with these reviews. 1094
Furthermore, we acknowledge that there may be cases where some investors may not wish to
incur the cost of an asset review, for example, when the transaction is performing as expected.

1092

Transaction participants may, however, provide for reviews of additional assets in this instance.

1093

See letter from Metlife II (noting that the review should be based on delinquencies as a percentage of the
original subordination for the senior-most class in a transaction).

1094

See letter from SIFMA II-investors (noting that although the review requirement would result in additional
costs, it would also increase investor protections).

381

For these reasons, the review is not automatic but rather must be initiated by investors as
specified in the transaction documents. In order to balance the concern that the transaction
parties may impose stringent voting requirements in the transaction documents in an effort to
diminish investors’ voting rights, we have imposed certain restrictions on the voting
requirements in response to comments that we received.
Under the final rule, if the transaction agreement includes a minimum investor demand
percentage in order to trigger a vote on the question of whether to direct a review, then the
maximum percentage of investors’ interest in the pool required to initiate a vote may not be
greater than 5% of the total investors’ interest in the pool (i.e., interests that are not held by
affiliates of the sponsor or servicer). 1095 We are imposing this restriction because we believe that
a higher threshold will blunt its effectiveness. 1096 Once the requisite percentage of investors’
interest seeks to initiate a vote, as required by the transaction agreement, investors will proceed
to vote on whether to direct a review. Our interpretation of “pool,” as discussed above in
connection with the delinquency trigger, is also applicable for the voting procedures. Thus, if
there are multiple sub-pools, then the calculation of whether there is the requisite percentage of
investors’ interest to initiate a vote would be determined based on that particular sub-pool.

1095

The final rule does not require that the transaction agreement include a minimum investor demand
percentage to trigger a vote; rather the final rule requires that if such provision is part of the transaction
agreement, then it may require no more than 5% of the total interest in the pool.

1096

See letter from Metlife I (noting that many securitization transactions impose a 25%-in-interest voting
threshold before the trustee can be directed by investors to undertake certain actions such as polling
investors on questions as to whether to exercise certain rights or remedies, thereby making it difficult for
investors to act).

382

Under the proposed rule, the transaction parties would have been given significant
flexibility in setting the voting requirements for the investor vote trigger. We are concerned,
however, that the transaction parties could establish a high delinquency threshold and high
investor vote threshold as noted by one commenter, thus making it difficult for investors to
utilize this shelf provision. 1097 We requested comments in the 2011 ABS Re-Proposal on
whether we should establish maximum conditions for voting. Commenters offered a range of
thresholds from 25% to a supermajority. 1098 Under the final rule, the transaction parties will be
able to specify the percentage of investors’ interest required to direct a review, provided that the
threshold of approval shall be no more than a simple majority of those interests casting a vote.
The final rule requires a simple majority of those interests casting a vote as the maximum
condition because we believe that a simple majority threshold will help to reduce potentially
frivolous claims while also helping to ensure that investors will be able to use the review
provision. In addition to imposing restrictions on the voting requirements, we note that issuers
are required to provide disclosure in the prospectus regarding the voting procedures for the
review under existing Regulation AB, which will permit investors to analyze the reasonableness
of the voting procedures. 1099

1097

See letter from Metlife II (explaining, for example, that in a case where a transaction agreement requires
25% of all investors to initiate a vote, and 75% of all investors to approve a resolution, the likelihood of
meeting a voting threshold would be slim at best).

1098

See letters from J.P. Morgan II and Sallie Mae II (recommending a 25% threshold), MetLife II (suggesting
a majority or plurality of those casting a vote), and Wells Fargo II (recommending a supermajority).

1099

See Item 1113(a)(12) of Regulation AB (requiring disclosure regarding allocation of voting rights among
security holders).

383

We also recognize that the rule may complicate the voting process for investors in
transactions that include assets consisting of previously issued ABS. In particular, when trigger
conditions for a review are met in connection with the previously issued ABS, the trustee acting
on behalf of the investors in the second securitization must vote since they are also investors in
the first securitization via the resecuritization. To address this potential issue, each securitization
will need to have clearly delineated voting rules and eligibility criteria in the event that some of
its investors are through a resecuritization. It is hard for us to evaluate the extent to which this
problem may affect the ABS markets because, over the past several years, there have been no
registered resecuritizations of RMBS, CMBS, or Auto ABS.
The requirements of this shelf eligibility criterion are meant to be the minimum
procedures that should be included in the transaction documents to provide investors with a
means to trigger a review of the assets. We acknowledge that transaction parties have and may
develop more specific and robust procedures for monitoring and reviewing assets that support
the ABS. 1100 The adoption of this rule will not preclude the transaction parties from specifying
additional, separate triggers for a review in the transaction agreements, as appropriate for a
particular deal or asset class. To clarify, while we are permitting additional triggers to be
established by the transaction parties, the final rule does not allow the transaction parties to add

1100

For example, the shelf requirement would not preclude an ABS issuer from including a review trigger for
any asset delinquent for 120 days or more, without requiring an investor vote, if such a trigger is
appropriate for that transaction. The transaction documents for the shelf registration statement would,
however, need to include, at minimum, the asset review requirements that we are adopting.

384

additional restrictions or requirements on the two triggers that we are establishing in order to
make it more onerous for investors to utilize the provision.
(ii)

Scope of the Review

We are also modifying the proposal to add some specificity regarding the scope of the
review, since we have changed the objective trigger from being based on credit enhancement to
one based on delinquencies and received varied comments regarding the appropriate scope for a
review based on delinquencies. 1101 Under the final rule, once both prongs have been met (the
delinquencies have reached or exceeded the threshold and investors have voted to conduct a
review), a review must be conducted of all assets that are 60 or more days delinquent as reported
in the most recent periodic report, at a minimum, for compliance with the related representations
and warranties, as suggested by commenters. We are also adopting, as proposed, that the
transaction agreement must provide the reviewer with access to copies of the underlying loan
documents in order to determine whether the loan complied with the representations and
warranties. 1102 As discussed below, a summary of the reviewer’s report must be included in the
Form 10-D. 1103

1101

See letters from Metlife II (stating that a random sample of all 60+ day delinquent loans should be
reviewed once a review is triggered) and Prudential II (stating that once a review is triggered the reviewer
should be required to “review all 60+ day delinquent loans and prior defaults”).

1102

See General Instruction I.B.1(b)(B) of Form SF-3.

1103

We would expect that the reviewer would conduct the review and provide its report to the trustee in a
reasonably prompt manner once the review is triggered.

385

(iii)

Report of the Findings and Conclusions

As proposed, under the final rule, a report of the reviewer’s findings and conclusions for
all assets reviewed will be required to be provided to the trustee. 1104 The trustee could then use
the report to determine whether a repurchase request would be appropriate under the terms of the
transaction agreements. We are also requiring, as proposed, that disclosure be provided about
any event triggering a review of the assets in the Form 10-D filing for the period in which the
event occurred. 1105
We proposed to require that any report of results provided to the trustee also be filed on
periodic report Form 10-D. Commenters generally supported filing the reports on Form 10-D.
Several commenters indicated, however, that privacy concerns may arise related to the
information about the underlying loans if a full report is filed and recommended that we instead
require summaries of the reports. 1106 We are persuaded by commenters that only a summary of
the report of the findings and conclusions needs to be included on the Form 10-D. We
acknowledge, however, a potential cost of this approach is that investors may not receive all of
the information necessary to determine whether the trustee, or another party with demand rights,
has made an appropriate decision regarding whether to initiate a repurchase request.

1104

See General Instruction I.B.1(b)(E) of Form SF-3.

1105

If the transaction parties decide to include additional triggers beyond the minimum two-prong trigger
required by this shelf eligibility rule, then disclosure is required about those trigger events as well.

1106

See letters from ABAASA II, ASF III, CREFC II, MBA III, VABSS III, and Wells Fargo II.

386

(iv)

Selection of the Reviewer

In response to comments received, we are not adopting the proposal to require that the
trustee appoint the reviewer. We are requiring, instead, that the pooling and servicing agreement
or other transaction agreement provide for the selection and appointment of the reviewer since
we believe that the transaction parties should be able to agree on who should serve as the
reviewer. 1107
We are requiring, as proposed, disclosure in the prospectus of the name of the reviewer,
its form of organization, the extent of its experience serving as a reviewer for ABS transactions
involving similar pool assets, and the manner and amount in which the reviewer is
compensated. 1108 ABS investors will benefit from this increased disclosure as they will be able
to assess the qualifications of the reviewer. ABS issuers will incur some additional disclosure
costs to provide this information. In addition, as proposed, under the new rule disclosure is
required with respect to: the reviewer’s duties and responsibilities under the governing
documents and under applicable law; any limitations on the reviewer’s liability under the
transaction agreements; any indemnification provisions; any contractual provisions or
understanding regarding the reviewer’s removal, replacement, or resignation, and how any
related expenses would be paid. 1109 In addition, we are adopting, as proposed, a requirement that
if, during the reporting period, the reviewer has resigned, or has been removed, replaced or

1107

See General Instruction I.B.1(b) of Form SF-3.

Id.

387

substituted, or if a new reviewer has been appointed, then disclosure regarding the event and
circumstances surrounding the change must be provided in the report for the period in which the
event occurred. 1110
We are also adopting a requirement that prohibits the reviewer from being affiliated with
certain transaction parties and from performing certain duties due to concerns over potential
conflicts of interest. Under the final rule, the reviewer, at a minimum, cannot be affiliated with
the sponsor, depositor, servicer, the trustee, or any of their affiliates. 1111 In addition, a conflict
may arise if the reviewer is also assigned the responsibility under the transaction documents to
determine whether non-compliance with representations and warranties constitutes a breach of
any contractual provision. Therefore, the reviewer shall not be the party to determine whether
the non-compliance constitutes a breach. We believe that the role of the reviewer should be
limited to reviewing the assets’ compliance with the representations and warranties since we
believe that the investors through the trustee are the most appropriate parties for determining,
after reviewing the report of the conclusions and findings, whether to pursue a repurchase claim.
In response to comments, particularly in the context of CMBS, the final rule will permit that the
reviewer may be the same party serving another role in the transaction, provided that it is not
affiliated with the sponsor, depositor, servicer, trustee, or any of their affiliates. As
recommended by one commenter, however, the final rules prohibit the reviewer from being the
same party or an affiliate of the party hired by the sponsor or underwriter to perform pre-closing

1110

See Item 1121(d)(2).

1111

See Item 1101(m) of Regulation AB (defining the reviewer).

388

due diligence on the pool assets due to the inherent conflict posed by the same party performing
the pre-closing review and the review required by this shelf provision. 1112 The reviewer is also
prohibited from being affiliated with the trustee in light of several commenters recommending
this prohibition given the economic relationships the trustee or its affiliates may have with other
transaction parties and the conflicts of interest that such relationships may create. 1113 We have
not, however, added investors as a prohibited affiliation, as some commenters requested. 1114 We
understand that issuers might view investor affiliation with the reviewer as a possible conflict;
however, since issuers will be responsible for selecting the reviewer, they will be able to address
any concern. We do not think such an affiliation will likely cause harm or conflict to investors
as a whole because, if there is evidence of high or growing delinquencies in the asset pool, it
would be in the best interest of investors as a whole to have a review conducted in order to
determine whether investors should make a repurchase demand. 1115 Because the rule establishes
the minimum restrictions on affiliations, the transaction parties could agree to exclude other
parties based on their relationships. As proposed, the final rule requires disclosure about those
relationships in the prospectus, which will help alert investors to any potential conflicts. 1116

1112

See letter from SIFMA II-investors.

1113

See letters from Better Markets, J.P. Morgan II, and Prudential II.

1114

See letters from Better Markets and J.P. Morgan II.

1115

However, any investor, or affiliate of an investor, affiliated with a sponsor, depositor, or any servicer would
not qualify as a reviewer. For example, in the context of CMBS, an investor that is affiliated with a special
servicer would not qualify as a reviewer.

1116

Item 1119 of Regulation AB requires disclosure of any known, material relationships among the various
parties to the transaction and the character of those relationships.

389

As noted above, some commenters suggested, as an alternative, that we revert back to an
approach proposed in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release. They recommended that we allow
issuers of asset classes other than residential mortgages the option to choose between the 2011
ABS Re-Proposal to require review of the assets upon certain triggers being met or the 2010
ABS Proposal to allow for a third-party review opinion. 1117 These commenters explained that
the 2010 ABS Proposal for a third-party review opinion would limit costs on the issuers where
repurchases have not presented the same difficulties as they have in RMBS. 1118 However, in
response to the 2010 ABS Proposal, some commenters stated that the third-party opinion
provision would not provide investors with the protection they would need in the event issues
arise with the enforcement of representations and warranties provisions because, in general,
transaction agreements have not included mechanisms to identify potential breaches of
representations and warranties. 1119 The rule we are adopting is designed to protect against
potential risks even where they have not surfaced in the past. As noted above, a group of
investors commented that despite the additional costs, increased investor protections will
produce net economic benefits to investors. 1120 In light of these considerations, rather than
permitting a third-party opinion as an alternative requirement for shelf eligibility, we have
revised the review process to address the costs concerns.

(3)

Dispute Resolution Provision
(a)

Proposed Rule

In the 2011 ABS Re-Proposal, along with the credit risk manager proposal, we proposed
to require that underlying transaction documents include repurchase request dispute resolution
procedures. As we have noted elsewhere, not only have investors lacked a mechanism to
identify potential breaches of the representations and warranties, they have also lacked a
mechanism to require sponsors to address their repurchase requests in a timely manner. 1121
Under the proposal, the transaction agreements would be required to provide that if an asset
subject to a repurchase request pursuant to the terms of the transaction agreements is not
repurchased by the end of the 180-day period beginning when notice is received, then the party
submitting such repurchase request will have the right to refer the matter, at its discretion, to
either mediation or third-party arbitration, and the party obligated to repurchase must agree to the
selected resolution method. As noted above, the dispute resolution provision, along with the
other new shelf transaction requirements, should encourage ABS issuers to design and prepare
ABS offerings with greater oversight and care. We believe that the dispute resolution provision
will enhance the enforceability of the transaction terms and should incentivize issuers to provide
investors with accurate and complete information at the time of the offering. We believe that
these requirements are appropriate for asset-backed securities transactions to be offered to the
public off a shelf registration statement.

(b)

Comments on Proposed Rule

Commenters generally supported a dispute resolution process. 1122 Several commenters
recommended that we require that binding arbitration be the sole process. 1123 We received a
significant number of comments stating that 180 days is an appropriate time period for the
obligated party to review repurchase requests. 1124 One commenter stated that 180 days may not
be long enough for RMBS. 1125 Another commenter noted that transactions backed by assets that
have shorter maturity dates should have a shorter timeframe. 1126 Although the proposed rule did
not specifically address payment of the costs of the dispute resolution process, several
commenters made recommendations for which party should pay. 1127 We also received
comments that we specify that a repurchase is not the only way a repurchase request can be
satisfied. 1128

resolution).

See letters from ASF III, J.P. Morgan II, Metlife II, and Prudential II.

See letter from MBA III (stating that due to rebuttals it may take longer than 180 days to resolve a dispute).

See letter from Metlife II (stating that 180 days may be too long for shorter term transactions since some
investors may hold classes that pay off sooner).

1127

Nine commenters suggested that the party that loses the dispute should pay for all legal fees incurred by the
prevailing party. See letters from ABASA II, BoA II, J.P. Morgan II, MBA III, Metlife II, SIFMA IIinvestors, SIFMA III-dealers and sponsors, and Sallie Mae II. One commenter recommended that the
arbitrator should be responsible for determining who pays. See letter from Prudential II. Another
suggested that the transaction documents specify who pays for the resolution. See letter from Wells Fargo
II.

See letters from ASF III (stating that the requirement, as written, may have the unintended effect of

392

(c)
Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Dispute
Resolution Shelf Requirement
As a third transaction requirement for shelf registration, we are requiring, as proposed but
with slight modification, that the underlying transaction documents include dispute resolution
procedures for repurchase requests. 1129 We note that our original proposal for the dispute
resolution requirement appeared in the same subsection of Form SF-3 as our credit risk manager
proposal, even though we intended them to operate separately from each other. Thus, while we
believed that our asset review shelf requirement would help investors evaluate whether a
repurchase request should be made, we structured the dispute resolution provision so that
investors could utilize the dispute resolution provision for any repurchase request, regardless of
whether investors direct a review of the assets. We believe that organizing the dispute resolution
requirement as a separate subsection in the shelf eligibility requirements will help to clarify the
scope of the dispute resolution provision.
As we have discussed above, the shelf eligibility conditions that we are adopting are
intended to help ensure that ABS shelf offerings have transactional safeguards and features that
make securities appropriate to be issued off a shelf. We believe that the dispute resolution
provision will provide a key procedural safeguard for investors to resolve disputes over

proposal from ‘repurchases’ not completed in 180 days to ‘resolutions’ not completed within 180 days”),
and SIFMA II-investors and SIFMA III-dealers and sponsors (noting that remedies for a breach would be
“cure of the breach, repurchase of the affected pool asset for the purchase price specified in the transaction
documents, or, if applicable and if provided in the transaction documents, substitution of a pool asset
having substantially similar characteristics as the defective pool asset”).
1129

Disclosure regarding the dispute resolution procedures is required in the prospectus under Item 1111(e) of
Regulation AB.

393

repurchase requests in an effective and timely manner. We expect that the dispute resolution
provision should generate efficiencies in the repurchase request process. We believe that, as a
result of the asset review provision and the dispute provision, sponsors may have an increased
incentive to carefully consider the characteristics of the assets underlying the securitization and
to accurately disclose these characteristics at the time of the offering. We also believe that
investors should benefit from reduced losses associated with nonperforming assets since, as a
result of this new shelf requirement, sponsors will have less of an incentive to include
nonperforming assets in the pool.
Under the new rule, the transaction agreements must provide that if an asset subject to a
repurchase request pursuant to the terms of the transaction agreements is not resolved by the end
of the 180-day period beginning when notice is received, then the party submitting such
repurchase request will have the right to refer the matter, at its discretion, to either mediation or
third-party arbitration, and the party obligated to repurchase or replace must agree to the selected
resolution method. 1130 In response to comments, the final rule applies to those assets subject to a
repurchase request that has not been resolved. We agree with several commenters that indicated
that the term “resolved” is more appropriate than “repurchased,” which was proposed, since
“repurchased” could have the unintended effect of restricting resolution of a repurchase request

1130

Several commenters asked us to clarify that a repurchase is not the only way a repurchase request can be
satisfied. See letters from ASF III, MBA III, SIFMA II-investors, and SIFMA III-dealers and sponsors.

394

only to repurchasing the asset. 1131 We also believe that investors should be able to utilize the
dispute resolution provision not only in connection with those requests in which the sponsor has
failed to respond in a timely manner but also for those requests in which investors believe that
the resolution offered by the sponsor does not make them whole.
We realize there are possible costs associated with setting the waiting period at 180 days
before the party submitting the request has the right to refer the matter to mediation or
arbitration. On the one hand, we recognize that there is the possibility that 180 days may not be
long enough to come to a resolution due to numerous rebuttals in some situations, as noted by
one commenter. 1132 This commenter recommended that the 180 days serve as a timeframe for
due diligence and discussion and that the transaction parties be permitted to specify in the
transaction agreements how much additional time beyond the 180 days the responsible party
should be provided before the requesting party has the right to refer the dispute to mediation or
arbitration. We believe that such an approach, however, may result in investors having to wait
too long before being able to proceed to mediation or arbitration. On the other hand, we also
recognize that the 180-day period may be too long for shorter term transactions since some
investors may hold classes of assets that pay off sooner than 180 days. Although commenters
generally supported the 180-day waiting period, one commenter recommended, for shorter term
transactions, that the timeframe be reduced to 90 days before investors could proceed to

1131

See letters from ASF III, MBA III, SIFMA II-investors, and SIFMA III-dealers and sponsors. We made a
similar change in an asset-level data point capturing repurchase requests in order to use consistent
terminology and to help ensure accurate tracking of the status of repurchase requests. See footnote 225.

1132

See letter from MBA III.

395

mediation or arbitration. 1133 While we appreciate the timing issues raised by shorter term
transactions, it is not clear that 90 days provides the responsible party with enough time to
complete due diligence and engage in discussions with the requesting party. For these reasons,
we believe 180 days, in general, fairly balances the need of investors for quick resolution with
the desire of issuers for time to address the request.
In addition, some commenters recommended that we require binding arbitration as the
single form of dispute resolution. Because we believe that investors should have access to all
options available to resolve a dispute, we are not requiring a specific form or process to resolve
disputes. The final rule permits a demanding party to determine what form of dispute resolution
is appropriate.
Finally, after considering the comments received, we are requiring that the transaction
documents specify that if arbitration occurs, the arbitrator will determine the party responsible
for paying the dispute resolution fees and in the case of mediation, the parties, with the assistance
of the mediator, will mutually agree on the allocation of the expenses incurred. While some
commenters recommended that the losing party should pay the expenses, we believe that letting
the arbitrator or the parties in mediation determine who pays balances competing concerns. On
the one hand, some commenters expressed concern about the possibility of investors using the
dispute resolution process for frivolous disputes and therefore recommended that we require the

1133

See letter from MetLife II.

396

transaction documents to specify that the losing party pays. 1134 On the other hand, there may be
instances where the requesting party uses the dispute resolution process for a legitimate claim
and the arbitrator rules against the claim but believes that the requesting party should not be
required to bear all the expenses associated with the dispute resolution. 1135 By giving the
arbitrator the discretion to make this determination based on the facts and circumstances of the
repurchase claim at issue, we believe investors will not be discouraged from using the dispute
resolution process for valid claims while also curbing potentially frivolous claims, given the
possibility of having to pay the fees associated with the dispute resolution.
We recognize that the dispute resolution provision could result in increased costs for
ABS issuers and investors. We believe that these costs will likely be similar to other securities
industry dispute resolution costs, which typically include filing fees, hearing session fees, and
other miscellaneous arbitrator or mediator expenses. According to FINRA, arbitration and
mediation filing fees depend on the size of the claim and can be up to $500 for an amount in
controversy over $100,000. 1136 In addition, the dispute parties will incur the costs of
arbitrator/mediator compensation, which depends on the length of the hearing and the
complexity of the case. A typical arbitration hearing of three days can cost from $2,700 to

1134

$6,750 for an amount in controversy in the $100,000 to $500,000 range. 1137 A typical mediation
hearing of one day can cost between $1,000 and $6,400. 1138 The parties will also incur
attorneys’ fees with arbitration or mediation hearings, which will depend upon the length of the
hearing, the number of attorneys involved, and the amount of preparation required.
Because the dispute resolution provision is not limited strictly to repurchase requests
connected with a review pursuant to the asset review provision, there is a possibility that
frivolous repurchase requests could be made and thus subject to the dispute resolution process.
As discussed above, under the final rule the requesting party could be responsible for paying the
dispute resolution expenses based on a determination by the arbitrator (or if the parties mutually
agree that the requesting party should incur these expenses in the case of mediation). This is
intended to limit the number of potentially frivolous claims.

Investor Communication
(a)

Proposed Rule

In the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release, we proposed, as a shelf eligibility requirement, a
method for facilitating investor communication with other investors related to their rights under

1137

See FINRA Manual, Section 12902, Hearing Session Fees, and Other Costs and Expenses, available at
http://finra.complinet.com/en/display/display_main.html?rbid=2403&element_id=4190. See also Seth

http://www.forbes.com/2009/07/14/lipner-arbitration-litigation-intelligent-investing-cost.html (stating that
the average arbitration requires three days of hearings).

1138

See FINRA’s Mediation Web site,
http://www.finra.org/ArbitrationAndMediation/Mediation/Process/MediationSessions/index.htm (stating
that mediations usually take one day). We used mediation hourly rates provided by the American

mediator’s hourly rates. For more information about the costs of mediation, see the American Arbitration
Association’s Web site, www.adr.org.

the terms of the ABS. In particular, the proposed rule would require that the transaction
agreements contain a provision requiring the party responsible for filing the Form 10-D to
include in ongoing distribution reports on Form 10-D any request received from an investor to
communicate with other investors related to investors exercising their rights under the terms of
the asset-backed security. The request to communicate would be required to include: the name
of the investor making the request, the date the request was received, and a description of the
method by which other investors may contact the requesting investor. As we discussed in the
2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release, investors have raised concerns about the inability to locate
other investors in order to enforce rights contained in the transaction documents, such as those
relating to the repurchase of underlying assets for breach of representations and warranties. 1139
Frequently, in order to act, the transaction agreements require a minimum percentage of
investors acting together. Additionally, as one investor noted, since most ABS are held by
custodians or brokers in “street name” through the Depository Trust Company (DTC), investors
face further difficulties in trying to locate one another to communicate about exercising their
investor rights. 1140

While we did not propose specific procedural requirements for verifying that the person
requesting to communicate is a beneficial owner of the particular ABS, we proposed to include
an instruction to limit investor verification requirements, if the underlying transaction
agreements contain such procedures, to no more than the following: (1) If the investor is a
record holder of the securities at the time of a request to communicate, then the investor would
not have to provide verification of ownership because the person obligated to make the
disclosure will have access to a list of record holders; and (2) if the investor is not the record
holder of the securities at the time of the request to communicate, the person obligated to make
the disclosure must receive a written statement from the record holder verifying that, at the time
the request is submitted, the investor beneficially held the securities.

Comments on Proposed Rule

Many commenters were generally supportive of the concept to allow for mechanisms for
investors to contact and communicate with each other. 1141 Some commenters generally
supported the proposal that investors’ requests to communicate be reported on Form 10-D. 1142
Other commenters suggested that the Commission allow for alternative methods of
communication and recommended that the Commission permit the use of investor registries and

trustee Web site processes currently in practice for many recent CMBS transactions. 1143 Some
of these commenters noted that it would be quicker for investors to communicate with each other
on a Web site compared to requiring the issuer to include the notice on Form 10-D and would be
less costly. 1144 One of these commenters also recommended a Web site approach because it
would provide investors with more privacy, which investors may want in certain situations. 1145
The other commenter noted that a Web site approach could provide investors with an open and
instant dialogue with other investors. 1146
Commenters suggested other methods to simplify the verification process. One
commenter opposed the proposed instruction on how an investor’s ownership of the securities is
verified because most certificates are held through DTC, which may make it difficult and costly
to determine who the ultimate holders are. 1147 Several commenters suggested requiring investors
to complete a certification regarding their ownership. 1148 Another commenter suggested a
written certification plus one or more items to verify interest. 1149 One commenter suggested that
the right to communicate be limited to current investors and that the nature of communication be

limited to a “factual statement that the investor wishes to communicate with other investors with
respect to exercising a right under the transaction documents.” 1150 This commenter explained
that limiting the nature of the communication would eliminate any need for the filing party to
monitor or edit the communication and also would address any liability concerns associated with
the inclusion of references to a specific party to the transaction or as to what contractual standard
may have been violated. Responding to a request for comment in the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing
Release, 1151 some commenters stated the disclosure should include a reason for the
communication that would be specified in a pre-set list. 1152 One commenter, however, opposed
requiring the issuer to disclose the type or category of matter that the investor wishes to discuss
with other investors. 1153
(c)
Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the
Investor Communication Shelf Requirement
We are adopting, as proposed, a shelf eligibility requirement that an underlying
transaction agreement include a provision to require the party responsible for making periodic
filings on Form 10-D to include in the Form 10-D any request from an investor to communicate
with other investors related to an investor’s rights under the terms of the ABS that was received

1150

See letter from MBA III.

1151

See Request for Comment No. 43 in the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release (requesting comment as to
whether a pre-set list of reasons for communication should be required – the pre-set list would include the
following categories: servicing, trustee, representations and warranties, voting matters, pool assets, and
other).

1152

See letters from ABAASA II and BoA II.

1153

See letter from ABA II (noting its belief that “such information is more appropriately conveyed directly by
the investor itself and should not be given an imprimatur of the issuer (or trustee) involved in facilitating
the request”).

402

during the reporting period by the party responsible for making the Form 10-D filings. 1154
Without an effective means for investors to communicate with each other, investors may be
unable to utilize the contractual rights provided in the underlying transaction agreements. 1155
Therefore, we are requiring that the investor communication provision be included in an
underlying transaction agreement so that the party responsible for making Form 10-D filings will
be contractually obligated to disclose an investor’s desire to communicate. 1156 We continue to
believe that this is an appropriate requirement for ABS shelf eligibility because facilitating
communications among investors enables them to more effectively exercise the rights included
in the underlying transaction agreements, which we believe will enhance the enforceability of
representations and warranties regarding the pool assets. As noted above, the new shelf
transaction requirements should encourage ABS issuers to design and prepare ABS offerings
with greater oversight and care. We believe that stronger enforcement mechanisms should
incentivize issuers to provide investors with accurate and complete information at the time of the
offering. This shelf eligibility requirement, for example, will assist investors in exercising their
rights related to the new asset review provision required for shelf eligibility. Those rights would

1154

Most ABS issuers report and distribute payments to investors on a monthly basis. The Form 10-D is
required to be filed within fifteen days after a required distribution date, and a distribution date is typically
two weeks after the end of a reporting period. For example, under our final rule, for the month of June, a
request from an investor would have to be received prior to the close of the reporting period on June 30, a
distribution would be due to investors by July 15, and the Form 10-D filing due date would be July 30.

Securitization Transactions, J. STRUCTURED FIN., Summer 2013, at 27-31 (discussing the problems

critical piece of an effective bondholder communication system is [the] initial ‘push’ of information out to
the investor”).

See also new Item 1121(e) (requiring disclosure of investors’ request to communicate on Form 10-D).

403

include the right to direct a review of underlying assets to determine whether the assets comply
with the representations and warranties. Consequently, we believe that these new shelf
requirements aimed at helping investors exercise their contractual rights will assist in increasing
investors’ participation in the ABS markets and thereby foster greater capital formation.
In previous releases, we have recognized that in certain circumstances the Internet can
present a cost-effective alternative or supplement to traditional disclosure methods. We
considered whether a Web site or investor registry would be a more effective approach to
facilitate investor communication, including consideration of the comments received supporting
a Web site approach. While we appreciate some of the potential benefits that may be afforded by
a Web site approach, such as faster dissemination of the notices and more robust communication
capabilities as noted by some commenters, 1157 we believe that requiring that the investor
communication notices be filed with the Form 10-D is the best way to ensure that these requests
reach investors. This approach is consistent with our efforts to facilitate the distribution of all
investor information regarding the ABS in one place at an expected time – that is, through
distribution reports that are attached as exhibits to the Form 10-D. We also believe that this
approach is a cost-effective means for issuers to provide investors with communication notices
since we are using an existing periodic report. Additionally, by requiring issuers to file the
notices with the Commission, as opposed to posting the notices on a Web site, we will be able to
more effectively monitor compliance with this shelf requirement and provide investors with

1157

See, e.g., letters from CREFC II and Wells Fargo II.

404

reliable access to the notices through EDGAR, even at times when the markets are in distress and
issuers’ Web sites are not accessible. Finally, we note that while our shelf requirement is
intended to provide investors with at least one method to contact other investors, the final rule
does not preclude issuers from utilizing Web sites to provide investors with more robust
communications capabilities and we encourage issuers to do so.
We acknowledged in the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release that transaction parties might
want to specify procedures in the underlying transaction agreements for verifying the identity of
a beneficial owner in a particular ABS prior to including a notice in a Form 10-D. While we did
not propose specific procedural requirements to be added to the agreements, we did propose to
limit the extent of the verification procedures that the transaction parties could impose to verify
investor ownership. As summarized above, several commenters consisting of issuers, investors,
trustees, and trade associations suggested that the investor verification procedures should be easy
and quick to perform and provided various recommendations for the Commission to consider. 1158
Taking into account suggestions from commenters, we are modifying part of the proposed
instruction to specify that, if the investor is not the record holder of the securities, an issuer may
require no more than a written certification from the investor that it is a beneficial owner and
another form of documentation such as a trade confirmation, an account statement, a letter from
the broker or dealer, or other similar document verifying ownership. 1159 We are making this

1158

See letters from ABA II, BoA II, CREFC II, and MBA III.

1159

We note that these ownership verification procedures are less prescriptive than the ownership eligibility
requirements to submit a proposal under Exchange Act Rule 14a-8; however, we believe that this flexibility

405

change since ownership of most ABS is held in book-entry form through DTC. 1160 We are also
adopting, as proposed, the other part of the instruction that states that if the investor is the record
holder of the securities, an investor will not have to provide verification of ownership because
the person obligated to make the disclosure will have access to a list of record holders.
Under the final rule, the disclosure in Form 10-D is required to include no more than the
name of the investor making the request, the date the request was received, a statement to the
effect that the party responsible for filing the Form 10-D has received a request from such
investor, stating that such investor is interested in communicating with other investors about the
possible exercise of rights under the transaction agreements, and a description of the method by
which other investors may contact the requesting investor. 1161 While we requested comment on
whether we should prescribe a pre-set list of objective categories from which an investor could
choose for the purpose of indicating why it is requesting communication with other investors, we
are not requiring that the investor specify the substance of the communication due to concerns
raised by commenters. As summarized above, some commenters opposed imposing any
obligation on the party responsible for filing the Form 10-D to monitor or edit the
communications. 1162 We also agree with one commenter that the substance of the
communication is more appropriately conveyed directly by the investor and should not be given

is appropriate because the provision is more limited in its scope to only providing notification to other
investors of their interest to communicate.

See letter from CREFC II (explaining that although the trustee can request a list of beneficial owners from
DTC, the process can be costly and can take days or weeks to complete).

an imprimatur of the party involved in facilitating the communication request. 1163 Thus, the
purpose of this communication requirement is not to communicate specific issues or concerns of
an investor but rather is intended to be a method for investors to notify other investors of their
interest to communicate.
As proposed, we are also including an instruction to Item 1121(e) of Regulation AB to
define the type of notices that are required to be on Form 10-D. The party responsible for filing
the Form 10-D will be required to include disclosure of only those notices of an investor’s desire
to communicate where the communication relates to the investor exercising its rights under the
terms of the ABS. Thus, the party responsible for filing is not required to disclose an investor’s
desire to communicate for other purposes, such as identifying potential customers or marketing
efforts. 1164
While we acknowledge that issuers will incur some cost to implement this provision, we
believe, taken together with the new asset review provision, that the disclosure will benefit
investors by helping them establish communication and overcome collective action problems.
As a result, this requirement should help investors exercise their rights under the transaction
agreements, including those that are required to be included in the transaction documents to
comply with shelf eligibility requirements. We acknowledge that the rule will minimally

1163

See letter from ABA II.

1164

To the extent an investor wishes to communicate with other investors about other matters, the investor must
consider independently the potential applicability of other regulatory provisions under the federal securities
laws. For example, an investor proposing to commence a tender offer for securities in the ABS class must
evaluate whether such a communication is subject to Exchange Act Sections 14(d) and 14(e) and
Regulations 14D and 14E thereunder.

407

increase the costs for the party responsible for making the periodic filings on Form 10-D since it
will need to modify its existing information systems to receive investors’ requests to
communicate. However, this is a very low cost method to help distinguish shelf appropriate
ABS offerings. The Form 10-D is an existing periodic report that provides investors with,
among other things, distribution information and pool performance information for the
distribution period. Given the nature and frequency of the Form 10-D, we believe that adding
the investor communication request requirement to the Form 10-D is appropriate and beneficial
to investors because it will facilitate the distribution of all investor information regarding the
ABS in one place, at an expected time. Using an existing form will also limit the cost for issuers
because a separate reporting mechanism will not be necessary. While we have sought to limit
costs by using Form 10-D, we recognize for those issuers that currently offer investor registries
or Web sites and decide to continue to offer those methods of communication that there will be
additional costs.
b)

Shelf Eligibility – Registrant Requirements

In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we proposed new registrant requirements related to
compliance with the proposed transaction requirements for shelf eligibility (i.e., risk retention, a
third-party opinion provision in transaction agreements, an officer certification, and an
undertaking to file ongoing Exchange Act reports). 1165 We proposed that prior to filing a
registration statement on proposed Form SF-3 to the extent the depositor, any issuing entity that

1165

For a list of existing shelf eligibility conditions that we are including in new Form SF-3, see footnote 874.

408

was previously established by the depositor, or an affiliate of the depositor is or was at any time
during the previous twelve months required to comply with the proposed transaction
requirements of Form SF-3 with respect to a previous offering of asset-backed securities
involving the same asset class, such depositor, each such issuing entity, and any affiliate of the
depositor must have filed all material required to be filed during the twelve months (or shorter
period that the entity was required to have filed such materials). Also, such material, other than
certain specified reports on Form 8-K, must have been filed in a timely manner. 1166 Finally, we
proposed a separate registrant requirement that there be disclosure in the registration statement
stating that the proposed registrant requirements have been complied with.
In light of the changes to proposed amendments to the transaction requirements for shelf
eligibility, we revised the proposed registrant requirements to make conforming changes in the
2011 ABS Re-Proposal. We re-proposed that to the extent the depositor, any issuing entity that
was previously established by the depositor, or any affiliate of the depositor is or was at any time
during the twelve month look-back period required to comply with the proposed transaction
requirements of Form SF-3 with respect to a previous offering of asset-backed securities
involving the same asset class then the registrant must meet certain registrant requirements at the
time of filing the shelf registration statement. The re-proposed registrant requirements would
require that such depositor, each such issuing entity, and any affiliate of the depositor must have
timely filed all required certifications and all transaction agreements that contain the required

1166

See General Instruction I.A.2 to Form SF–3.

409

provisions relating to the credit risk manager, repurchase request disputes, and investor
communication.
In addition, we re-proposed to make the proposed separate registrant requirement that
would have required the registrant to include disclosure in the registration statement stating the
depositor has complied with the registrant requirements an instruction rather than a shelf
eligibility registrant requirement.
Because we did not receive any comments on the revised registrant requirements for shelf
eligibility, we are adopting the revised registrant requirements largely as re-proposed. Under the
final rule, we are retaining the registrant requirement that was previously in Form S-3 relating to
delinquent filings of the depositor or an affiliate of the depositor for purposes of new Form SF-3.
Since registrants are already required to comply with this particular existing shelf registrant
requirement, registrants should not incur additional compliance costs.
The final rule also requires that to the extent the depositor or any issuing entity that was
previously established by the depositor, or any affiliate of the depositor is or was at any time
during the twelve month look-back period required to comply with the transaction requirements
of Form SF-3 with respect to a previous offering of asset-backed securities involving the same
asset class, then such depositor, each such issuing entity, and any affiliate of the depositor, must
have timely filed all required certifications and all transaction agreements that contain the
required provisions relating to the asset review provision, dispute resolution, and investor
communication.
We believe that connecting the registrant requirements to the transaction requirements of
prior offerings by the depositor, or affiliates of the depositor, will incentivize the depositor to
410

timely file all required transaction documents with the required provisions and the required
certifications.
In addition, as proposed, we are including an instruction stating that the registrant must
disclose in a prospectus that it has met the registrant requirements. We believe disclosure of
compliance with the registrant requirements will provide a means for market participants (as well
as the Commission and its staff) to better gauge compliance with the shelf eligibility conditions
of Form SF-3.
c)
Annual Evaluation of Form SF-3 Eligibility in Lieu of Section
10(a)(3) Update
(1)
Annual Compliance Check Related to Timely Exchange
Act Reporting
(a)

Proposed Rule

As we noted in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, Form S-3 eligibility is determined at
the time of filing the registration statement and again at the time of updating the registration
statement under Securities Act Section 10(a)(3) by filing audited financial statements. 1167 We
explained that, because ABS registration statements do not contain financial statements of the
issuer, we believe a different periodic determination of continued shelf eligibility must be
established. We believed that such an evaluation would provide us and the staff with a better
means to oversee compliance of the new Form SF-3 eligibility conditions that would replace the
investment-grade ratings requirement. Therefore, in lieu of the Section 10(a)(3) updating, we

1167

15 U.S.C. 77j(a)(3).

411

proposed to revise Securities Act Rule 401 to require, as a condition to conducting an offering
off an effective shelf registration statement, an annual evaluation of whether the Exchange Act
reporting registrant requirements have been satisfied. An ABS issuer wishing to conduct a
takedown off an effective shelf registration statement would be required to evaluate whether the
depositor, any issuing entity previously established by the depositor or any affiliate of the
depositor that was required to report under Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act during
the previous twelve months for asset-backed securities involving the same asset class, have filed
such reports on a timely basis, as of 90 days after the end of the depositor’s fiscal year end. 1168
Under this proposal the related registration statement could not be utilized for subsequent
offerings for at least one year from the date the depositor or the affiliated issuing entity that had
failed to file Exchange Act reports then became current in its Exchange Act reports (and the
other requirements had been met).
(b)

Comments on Proposed Rule

We received only a few comments on our proposal. One commenter expressed concern
that it is not possible for ABS issuers to fully verify compliance with the Exchange Act reporting
registrant requirements as of 90 days after the end of the depositor’s fiscal year end because there
could be an unknown defect, latent or otherwise, in one or another of the relevant issuing

1168

See the 2004 ABS Adopting Release at 1525 (noting our belief that given past deficiencies in Exchange
Act reporting compliance in the ABS sector that issuers that fail to comply with their responsibilities under
the Exchange Act for prior transactions should not continue to receive the benefits of shelf registration and,
further, that issuers should not be able to create a new special purpose depositor to avoid the consequences
of Exchange Act reporting noncompliance).

412

entities’ reports or reporting history. 1169 Another commenter suggested that the loss of shelf
eligibility should not be automatic. 1170 This commenter suggested allowing for an explanation
and any resulting penalty should be at the staff’s discretion. 1171
(c)
Rule

Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Final

Under the new rule, an ABS issuer with an effective shelf registration statement will be
required to evaluate whether the depositor, any issuing entity previously established by the
depositor or any affiliate of the depositor was required to report under Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act during the previous twelve months for asset-backed securities involving the
same asset class, have filed such reports on a timely basis. As noted above, one commenter
expressed concern that ABS issuers would be unable to fully verify compliance with the
Exchange Act reporting registrant requirements as of 90 days after fiscal year end due to an
unknown defect in one or another of the relevant issuing entities’ periodic reports or reporting
history. 1172 We note that this annual compliance check is the same evaluation undertaken today
by registrants at the time of filing the registration statement and at the time of filing Form 10-K;
therefore, we expect that issuers would use the same procedures that are used to verify

type of registration statements in question here.

compliance at the time of filing the registration statement. As a result, this rule conforms the
ABS process to the corporate issuers’ process. Additionally, we believe that the costs will be
minimal and limited to ABS issuers performing the same procedures they perform at the time of
filing a registration statement. We believe that this annual shelf eligibility compliance check will
benefit investors because it will encourage issuers to file their Exchange Act reports in
connection with prior offerings at the required time and therefore enhance informed investment
decisions. We acknowledge, however, that there will be costs to those issuers that determine, as
a result of their annual evaluation, that they did not timely file their Exchange Act reports and
lose shelf access since they will be required to use Form SF-1. These costs are related to market
timing given the possibility of additional staff review that may occur with a Form SF-1
compared to Form SF-3. We believe that this new provision simply ensures that the shelf
process for ABS includes a mechanism to check whether the shelf issuer is current and timely
with its Exchange Act reporting obligations as is currently required for corporate shelf issuers.

Annual Compliance Check Related to the Fulfillment of
the Transaction Requirements in Previous ABS Offerings

Proposed Rule

In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we also proposed to require that, for continued shelf
eligibility, an ABS issuer would be required to conduct an evaluation at the end of the fiscal
quarter prior to the takedown of whether the ABS issuer was in compliance with the proposed
transaction requirements relating to risk retention, third-party opinions, the officer certification,
and the undertaking to file ongoing reports. If the ABS issuer was not in compliance with the

414

transaction requirements, then it could not utilize the registration statement or file a new
registration statement on Form SF–3 until one year after the required filings were filed.
In the 2011 ABS Re-Proposal, we re-proposed this registrant requirement to require an
annual evaluation of compliance with the transaction requirements of shelf registration rather
than an evaluation on a quarterly basis as we had originally proposed. Therefore,
notwithstanding that the registration statement may have been previously declared effective, in
order for the registrant to conduct a takedown off an effective registration statement, an ABS
issuer would be required to evaluate, as of 90 days after the end of the depositor’s fiscal year
end, whether it meets the registrant requirements. Under the 2011 ABS Re-Proposal, to the
extent that the depositor or any issuing entity previously established by the depositor or any
affiliate of the depositor, is or was at any time during the previous twelve months, required to
comply with the proposed new transaction requirements related to the certification, credit risk
manager and repurchase dispute resolution provisions, and investor communication provision,
with respect to a previous offering of ABS involving the same asset class, such depositor and
each issuing entity must have filed on a timely basis, at the required time for each takedown, all
transaction agreements containing the provisions that are required by the proposed transaction
requirements as well as all certifications.
In response to commenters’ concerns that the one-year penalty for non-compliance with
the transaction requirements was too extreme, we revised and re-proposed to allow depositors
and issuing entities to cure any failure to file the required certification or transaction agreements
with the required shelf provisions. Under the proposed cure mechanism, the depositor or any

415

issuing entity would be deemed to have met the registrant requirements, for purposes of Form
SF-3, 90 days after the date all required filings were made.
(b)

Comments on Proposed Rule

Commenters recommended that we reduce the waiting period after curing the deficiency.
Some commenters requested that the waiting period after curing the deficiency be reduced to 30
days. 1173 Another commenter recommended changing the period to 30 or 45 days. 1174
(c)
Rule

Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Final

The final rule includes a registrant requirement that requires an annual evaluation of
compliance with the transaction requirements of shelf registration, as re-proposed in the 2011
ABS Re-Proposing Release. Under the final rule, notwithstanding that the registration statement
may have been previously declared effective, in order to conduct a takedown off an effective
shelf registration statement, an ABS issuer would be required to evaluate, as of 90 days after the
end of the depositor’s fiscal year end, whether it meets the registrant requirements, which is the
same look-back period for the ABS issuer as the compliance evaluation for Exchange Act
reporting described above.
Under the final rule, a depositor and issuing entity may cure the deficiency if it
subsequently files the information that was required. After a waiting period, it will be permitted

1173

See letters from CREFC II and Kutak.

1174

See letter from MBA III.

416

to continue to use its shelf registration statement. 1175 Under the cure mechanism, the depositor
and issuing entity will be deemed to have met the registrant requirements, for purposes of Form
SF-3, 90 days after the date all required filings are filed.
Because the issuer can cure the deficiency while it continues to use the shelf and before
the required annual evaluation, the issuer can avoid being out of the market. For example, a
depositor with a December 31 fiscal year end has an effective shelf registration statement and on
March 30 of Year 1, it evaluates compliance with all registrant requirements under new Rule
401(g) (90 days after the last fiscal year end) and determines that it is in compliance. The
depositor then offers ABS but does not timely file the required transaction agreements that
should have been filed on June 20 of Year 1. The depositor would be able to continue to use its
existing shelf until it is required to perform the annual evaluation required by new Rule 401(g),
on March 30 of Year 2. After March 30 of Year 2 and until June 20 of Year 2 (one year after the
agreements should have been filed), the depositor would not be able to offer ABS off of the shelf
registration statement, and would not be permitted to file a new shelf registration statement.
However, if the depositor had cured the deficiency by filing the agreements on July 1 of Year 1,
under the final rule, a new registration statement could be filed 90 days after July 1 of Year 1 (or
September 29 of Year 1), instead of waiting until June 20 of Year 2 (when it otherwise would

1175

Curing the deficiency also allows the depositor, or its affiliates, to file a new registration statement if it also
meets the other registrant requirements. See General Instruction I.A.1. of Form SF-3. As we emphasized
in the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release, failure to file the information required (i.e., the required
certification and transaction agreements with required provisions) will be a violation of our rules, and
subject to liability accordingly. Furthermore, failing to provide disclosure at the required time periods may
raise serious questions about whether all required disclosure was provided to investors prior to investing in
the securities.

417

meet the twelve month timely filing requirement). In that case, at the time of the next annual
evaluation for the registration statement on March 30 of Year 2, the depositor would be deemed
to have met the registrant requirements because it would have cured the deficiency more than 90
days earlier on July 1 of Year 1, and thus the depositor could continue to use its existing shelf
registration statement. 1176
Our approach is designed to strike a balance between encouraging issuers’ compliance
with the shelf transaction requirements and commenters’ concerns that the one-year time out
period in the 2010 ABS Proposals was too long. Also, as discussed above, we received
comments that 90 days was still too long and that a 30 or 45 day waiting period would be more
appropriate. 1177 We continue to be concerned that 30 or 45 days would not adequately
incentivize issuers to comply with the transaction requirements. Based on staff observations of
shelf offerings since the crisis, registrants typically conduct between two and three offerings
during the course of a year. Under such conditions, a short waiting period such as 30 or 45 days
would provide minimal, if any, incentive to comply with transaction requirements.
We are not adopting another commenter’s suggestion that the loss of shelf eligibility not
be automatic and that issuers should instead be allowed to explain and be penalized at the staff’s

1176

Using the example above, if the failure occurs in the first 90 days of the year before the March 30 annual
compliance evaluation, but the issuer corrects the deficiency by filing the required information before
providing the evaluation on March 30, the issuer will still be deemed to satisfy the registrant requirements
for purposes of continued shelf eligibility and thus not be required to wait until March 30 of the next year
to use the existing shelf registration statement or file a new one. The issuer, however, must still wait 90
days after filing the required information before using the existing effective shelf registration statement or
filing a new shelf registration statement. We have revised the requirement to make this clear.

1177

418

discretion. 1178 The eligibility requirement is an incentive for issuers to comply with the shelf
transaction requirements – providing the market with information about the issuer and thus an
appropriate eligibility criterion to offer securities off the shelf. Furthermore, an ad hoc review of
justifications for delays or missing filings would be inefficient use of the Commission’s
resources and would not incentivize issuers to monitor compliance.
We believe that the annual shelf eligibility compliance check will benefit investors
because it will encourage issuers to file their transaction documents in connection with prior
offerings at the required time and therefore enhance informed investment decisions. We
acknowledge that the annual evaluations of compliance with the transaction requirements will
impose additional costs on ABS issuers in the form of systems needed to examine compliance
with the filing requirements. However, we believe that these costs should be minimal because
issuers should already have, in most instances, systems designed to ensure that the transaction
agreements are being filed timely in accordance with rules under the Securities Act.
4.

Continuous Offerings
a)

Proposed Rule

In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we had proposed to amend Rule 415 to limit the
registration of continuous offerings for ABS offerings to “all or none” offerings. In an “all or
none” offering, the transaction is completed only if all of the securities are sold. In contrast, in a
“best-efforts” or “mini-max” offering, a variable amount of securities may be sold by the issuer.

1178

See letter from SIFMA III-dealers and sponsors.

419

In those latter cases, because the size of the offering would be unknown, investors would not
have the transaction-specific information and, in particular, would not know the specific assets to
be included in the transaction. Thus, information about the asset pool required by Item 1111 of
Regulation AB, either in its existing form or as amended today, could not be complied with. 1179
As noted in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we believe that our proposed restriction would
help ensure that ABS investors receive sufficient information relating to the pool assets, if an
issuer registered an ABS offering to be conducted as a continuous offering. 1180
b)

Comments on Proposed Rule

Only one commenter commented on the proposal to limit the use of continuous offerings
on shelf to “all or none” offerings. 1181 This commenter agreed that “in a continuous offering
where the ultimate size of the offering is unknown, investors would not necessarily know the
specific assets to be included in the transaction” and the proposal properly eliminates this issue.
However, this commenter suggested more guidance on what constitutes an “all or none”
offering. 1182
c)

Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Final Rule

We are adopting the rule as proposed. The new rule will provide ABS investors in
continuous ABS offerings with information about all relevant pool assets and would close a

1179

The staff has advised us that they believe that neither “best efforts” offerings nor any continuous offerings
have been utilized in the past for public offerings of asset-backed securities.

1180

See the 2010 ABS Proposing Release at 23350.

See letter from ASF I.

1182

See letter from ASF I (suggesting that there are offerings that should not be included in the “mini-max”
definition).

420

potential gap in our regulations for ABS offerings. Under the final rule, the continuous offering
must be commenced promptly and must be made on the condition that all of the consideration
paid for such security will be promptly refunded to the purchaser unless (A) all of the securities
being offered are sold at a specified price within a specified time, and (B) the total amount due to
the seller is received by the seller by a specified date. 1183
As one commenter noted, in some ABS offerings, all or a portion of one or more classes
of ABS that are offered for sale to investors through one or more underwriters may initially be
retained by the depositor or sold to one or more of its affiliates. 1184 In these cases, the offerings
may be conducted as a firm commitment underwritten offering or as a best efforts offering. The
commenter believed that such offering would not be a “mini-max” offering because the total size
of the offering is known and disclosed in the prospectus. We agree with the commenter that
these offerings would not be a “mini-max” offering if the prospectus includes all transactionspecific information, including information about the specific assets included in the pool.
This rule will be beneficial to investors in continuous offerings by ensuring that the
information they receive is about all pool assets underlying the asset-backed securities they
purchase. While ABS offerings are typically not conducted as a continuous offering, we believe
that it is important for us to close a potential gap in our regulations for ABS offerings so that

1183

All or none offerings are described in Exchange Act Rules 10b-9 [17 CFR 240.10b-9] and 15c2-4 [17 CFR
240.15c2-4] in the same manner.

1184

See letter from ASF I (noting that this typically arises when the offered securities have a lower return or
carry a lower spread relative to market demand and confirming that any subsequent sale of the securities by
the depositor or its affiliates would be undertaken in accordance with the registration provisions under the
Securities Act).

421

ABS investors receive this material information when making an investment decision –
irrespective of the type of public offering. We acknowledge that restricting continuous offerings
to “all or none” limits issuers’ choice and may potentially impose costs on those issuers that
would have preferred to conduct the offering on a best efforts basis. However, we also note that
the staff is not aware of any prior public offering of ABS that was conducted on a continuous
offering – either as “all or none” or best efforts – and therefore we expect these costs to be
minimal. For similar reasons, we do not believe that the amended rule will have an impact on
competition, efficiency, or capital formation.
5.

Mortgage Related Securities
a)

Proposed Rule

In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we proposed to require that offerings of mortgage
related securities be eligible for shelf registration on a delayed basis only if, like other assetbacked securities, they meet the registrant and transaction requirements for shelf registration.
Under the proposal, delayed shelf offerings of mortgage related securities could be registered
only on new Form SF-3, and accordingly, must meet the eligibility requirements of Form SF-3.
We proposed eliminating the provision in Rule 415 that permits the registration of “mortgage
related securities,” as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(41) of the Exchange Act, for shelf
offerings without regard to form eligibility requirements. This was a provision that was added to
Rule 415 contemporaneous with the enactment of SMMEA. 1185 Therefore, under the provision,

1185

See Section V.A. Background and Economic Discussion.

422

an offering of mortgage related securities did not have to meet the requirements of Form S-3 and
could have been registered on a delayed basis on Form S-1. 1186 As we stated in the 2010 ABS
Proposing Release, we proposed this requirement based on our belief that mortgage related
securities should be required to meet all the requirements that we proposed for shelf eligibility in
order to be eligible for registration on a delayed basis since these securities present the same
complexities and concerns as other ABS. 1187
b)

Comments on Proposed Rule

One commenter agreed that mortgage related securities should be held to the same
standards as other asset-backed securities. 1188 Another commenter believed that both proposed
Forms SF-1 and SF-3 should be available for delayed offerings of mortgage related securities “to
accommodate issuers or transactions that may not have a need for an SF-3 registration or assets
that are unique and better suited for an SF-1 filing,” but the commenter did not provide specific
examples or further explanation. 1189
c)

Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Final Rule

We are revising Rule 415 as proposed. The change requires that mortgage related
securities meet all criteria for eligibility for shelf registration on new Form SF-3. We believe
that mortgage related securities should meet all the requirements we are adopting in order to be

1186

1188

1189

See letter from MBA I.

423

eligible for shelf registration on a delayed basis since these securities present the same
complexities and concerns as other asset-backed securities. If we continue to allow issuers of
mortgage related securities to offer securities on a delayed basis off the shelf without regard to
the shelf eligibility requirements, we would effectively allow mortgage related securities issuers
to circumvent the requirements we are adopting.
We believe that the amendment to Rule 415 adopted today will result in consistent and
fair treatment of all asset-backed securities, regardless of the nature of the underlying pool assets.
We believe that the impact of this rule on competition and capital formation will be minimal
since most, if not all, issuers of mortgage related securities have met the shelf eligibility
requirements and conducted offerings off shelf registration statements.
C.

Exchange Act Rule 15c2-8(b)
1.

Proposed Rule

Except for securities issued under master trust structures, shelf-eligible ABS issuers
generally are not reporting issuers at the time of issuance. Under Exchange Act Rule 15c28(b), 1190 with respect to an issue of securities where the issuer has not been previously required
to file reports pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, unless the issuer has been
exempted from the requirement to file reports thereunder pursuant to Section 12(h) of the
Exchange Act, a broker or dealer is required to deliver a copy of the preliminary prospectus to
any person who is expected to receive a confirmation of sale at least 48 hours prior to the

1190

17 CFR 240.15c2-8(b).

424

sending of such confirmation (“48-hour preliminary prospectus delivery requirement”). The rule
contains an exception to the 48-hour preliminary prospectus delivery requirement for offerings of
asset-backed securities eligible for registration on Form S-3. An exception to the 48-hour
preliminary prospectus delivery requirement was first provided in 1995 by staff no-action
position. 1191 This staff position was later codified in 2004. 1192
In light of recent economic events and to make this rule consistent with our other
proposed revisions, in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we proposed to eliminate this exception
so that a broker or dealer would be required to deliver a preliminary prospectus at least 48 hours
before sending a confirmation of sale for all offerings of asset-backed securities, including those
involving master trusts. Because each pool of assets in an ABS offering is unique, we believe
that an ABS offering is akin to an IPO, and therefore we believe the 48-hour preliminary
prospectus delivery requirement in Rule 15c2-8(b) should apply. Even with subsequent
offerings of a master trust, the offerings are more similar to an IPO given that the mix of assets
changes and is different for each offering. Additionally, requiring that a broker or dealer provide
an investor with a preliminary prospectus at least 48 hours before sending a confirmation of sale
should be feasible and made easier to implement as a result of our proposal that a form of

1191

See footnote 163 of the 2004 ABS Adopting Release and accompanying text (discussing staff no-action
letters providing relief to ABS issuers from Rule 15c2-8(b)).

1192

In the 2004 ABS Adopting Release, we noted some concerns that investors did not have sufficient time to
consider ABS offering information. However, as we were considering other proposals at that time that
sought to address information disparity in the offering process, we decided to codify the staff position.

425

preliminary prospectus be filed with the Commission at least three business days in advance of
the first sale in a shelf offering.
2.

Comments on Proposed Rule

Commenters generally supported the proposal. 1193 Several trade associations agreed that
investors should have sufficient time to review an offering. 1194 One trade association supported
the proposal, but suggested an “access equals delivery” model akin to final prospectuses to
satisfy the requirements. 1195 One individual commenter supported the proposal but suggested
that ABS structured as master trusts be treated differently so as not to require information
delivered previously to be delivered again. 1196
3.

Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Final Rule

We are eliminating the exception in Rule 15c2-8(b) for shelf-eligible asset-backed
securities from the 48-hour preliminary prospectus delivery requirement as proposed. 1197 Under

1193

See letters from ASF I, A. Zonca, BoA I, MBA I, Sallie Mae I, and SIFMA I.

1194

See letters from ASF I, MBA I, and SIFMA I.

1195

See letter from ASF. See also letters from MBA I and SIFMA I (focusing their comments in this area on
the waiting period that would be required by proposed Rules 424(h) and 430D).

1196

See letter from A. Zonca (also suggesting that ABS master trusts not be required to deliver the information
if any changes to previously delivered information relates to new account additions with balances
representing less than five percent of the master trust).

1197

Because of the other changes we are adopting, we are also repealing Securities Act Rule 190(b)(7). Rule
190(b)(7) provides that if securities in the underlying asset pool of asset-backed securities are being
registered, and the offering of the asset-backed securities and the underlying securities is not made on a
firm commitment basis, the issuing entity must distribute a preliminary prospectus for both the underlying
securities and the expected amount of the issuer’s securities that is to be included in the asset pool to any
person who is expected to receive a confirmation of sale of the asset-backed securities at least 48 hours
prior to sending such confirmation. Rule 190(b)(7) effectively overrules the exclusion in Rule 15c2-8 for
ABS issuers from the 48-hour preliminary prospectus delivery requirement for particular types of ABS
offerings. Because we are repealing the Rule 15c2-8 exclusion for ABS issuers, and because our disclosure
requirements regarding the underlying securities for resecuritizations requires significantly more

426

the final rule, a broker or dealer is required to comply with the 48-hour preliminary prospectus
delivery requirement with respect to the sale of securities by each ABS issuer, regardless of
whether the issuer has previously been required to file reports pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d)
of the Exchange Act. 1198 In addition, the 48-hour preliminary prospectus delivery requirement
also applies to ABS issuers utilizing master trust structures that are exempt from the reporting
requirements pursuant to Section 12(h) of the Exchange Act. This requirement is necessary
because assets in a master trust routinely change, whether or not they are exempt from or subject
to Section 13(a) or 15(d) reporting requirements. In a master trust securitization, assets may be
added to the pool in connection with future issuances of the securities backed by the pool. 1199
Although ABS issuers utilizing master trust structures may be reporting under the Exchange Act
at the time of a “follow-on” or subsequent offering of securities, additional assets are added to
the entire pool backing the trust in connection with a subsequent offering of securities.
The adoption of today’s amendment will benefit investors by allowing them more time to
consider the characteristics of the offering. We recognize that this benefit may be lower for
investors in ABS structured as master trusts, because such offerings are issued from an existing
issuing entity, which would have previously disclosed much of the information to be provided in
the 48-hour preliminary prospectus. Nonetheless, such investors should benefit from having

information than what is required in Rule 190(b)(7) to be provided in the preliminary prospectus, we are
deleting Rule 190(b)(7).
1198

See definition of issuer in relation to asset-backed securities in Exchange Act Rule 3b-19.

1199

The typical master trust securitization is backed by assets arising out of revolving accounts such as credit
card receivables or dealer floorplan financings.

427

additional time to consider information about the new assets that is not provided in Exchange
Act reports. The cost of today’s amendment will be borne by issuers, who will have to prepare
and provide to investors the preliminary prospectus. These costs will likely be small as a result
of our other new rule requiring that a preliminary prospectus be filed with the Commission at
least five days in advance of the first sale. 1200
We considered one commenter’s suggestion to provide for an “access equals delivery”
model akin to final prospectuses. 1201 Access equals delivery is only permitted for a final
prospectus and not a preliminary prospectus. The rule is the same for prospectuses of both
corporate securities as well as ABS. The commenter did not address why ABS should be
different from corporate securities in the context of delivery of a preliminary prospectus under
Rule 15c2-8(b). 1202
We are also adopting, as proposed, a correcting amendment to Rule 15c2-8(j). Paragraph
(j) states that the terms “preliminary prospectus” and “final prospectus” include terms that are
defined in Rule 434. 1203 In 1995, at the same time we adopted Rule 434, we added paragraph (j)
to expand the use of the terms “preliminary prospectus” and “final prospectus” to reflect the

1200

1201

However, as is the case today, delivery of a preliminary prospectus may be made electronically as
permitted under our current rules. See Use of Electronic Media for Delivery Purposes, Release No. 337233 (Oct. 6, 1995) [60 FR 53458] (the 1995 Release).

requirements of Securities Act Section 10(a).

D.
Including Information in the Form of Prospectus in the Registration
Statement
1.

Presentation of Disclosure in Prospectuses
a)

Proposed Rule

We proposed to eliminate the current practice in shelf ABS offerings of providing a base
prospectus and prospectus supplement by requiring the filing of a form of prospectus at the time
of effectiveness of the Form SF-3 and a single prospectus for each takedown. As we noted in the
2010 ABS Proposing Release, we are concerned that the base and supplement format has
resulted in unwieldy documents with excessive and inapplicable disclosure that is not useful to
investors. 1206 To address this concern, we proposed to add a provision in proposed Rule 430D
and an instruction to proposed Form SF-3 that would require ABS issuers to file a form of
prospectus at the time of effectiveness of the proposed Form SF-3 and to file a single prospectus
for each takedown, which would include all of the information required by Regulation AB. We
also proposed to require each depositor to file a separate registration statement for each form of
prospectus. Under this proposal, each registration statement would cover offerings by depositors
securitizing only one asset class.

1204

b)

Comments on Proposed Rule

Several commenters supported 1207 our proposal requiring the filing of one integrated
prospectus rather than a base prospectus and prospectus supplement for each takedown, and one
commenter opposed. 1208 One commenter, in support of the proposed rules, believed that our
proposal will provide investors with clearer information relating to the assets that are the subject
of the takedown by not being encumbered with information that may not relate to that particular
transaction. 1209 Another commenter, opposing the proposal, argued that our concern that the
base and supplement format has resulted in unwieldy documents with excessive and inapplicable
disclosure that is not useful to investors is unwarranted. 1210
With respect to our proposal to limit each shelf registration statement to one asset class,
one commenter asserted its belief that this proposal had no bearing on the nature and quality of
disclosure for any particular shelf offering. 1211 This commenter also noted that our proposed
limitation would not permit securitization platforms where more than one depositor transfers or
sells pool assets into the same issuing entity to conduct shelf offerings. The commenter,
although opposing the proposal, recommended that the Commission clarify the scope of any

limitation so that multiple depositors who transfer or sell pool assets into the same issuing entity
would be permitted under the final rule.
c)

Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Final Rule

After considering the comments provided, we are adopting the rule regarding
presentation of disclosure in prospectuses as proposed so that issuers must file a form of
prospectus at the time of effectiveness of Form SF-3 and file a single prospectus for each
takedown. 1212 We continue to believe that the current format has the unintended effect of
encouraging ABS issuers to draft disclosure documents that build in maximum flexibility for as
many differing transactions as possible with the investor bearing the burden of determining
which disclosures are relevant to a particular transaction. Given that the registration statement is
primarily for the benefit of investors, we believe that we should facilitate investor understanding
and access to prospectuses for ABS and eliminate unnecessary disclosures given to investors. 1213
A single form of prospectus at the time of effectiveness and a single prospectus for each
takedown should provide investors with clearer and more focused information relating to the
assets that are the subject of the takedown by not encumbering investors with information that
may not relate to that particular transaction. Additionally, because we believe that this rule will
enhance investor understanding of the offering materials and the transaction, the rule will, in
turn, promote more efficient capital formation. While we note one commenter’s view that the

1212

See General Instruction IV of Form SF-3.

1213

See the 2010 ABS Proposing Release at 23352.

431

existing practice did not result in unwieldy documents, 1214 we remain concerned about the
usefulness of the prospectus supplement format for investors, especially in light of other
commenters’ support for our proposal and the staff’s experience in reviewing prospectuses in
registration statements and in takedowns. 1215
We are also adopting our proposed limitation of one asset class per registration statement
with one clarification in response to comments. 1216 We continue to note the practice of some
issuers to include multiple depositors, multiple base prospectuses and multiple prospectus
supplements all in one registration statement. 1217 We believe that this practice has made the
disclosure difficult for investors to understand and difficult for market participants to locate and
obtain offering documents. Although one commenter stated that limiting each shelf registration
statement to one asset class has no bearing on the quality or nature of the disclosure for any
particular shelf offering, we disagree. 1218 The cumulative effect of including multiple depositors,
multiple base prospectuses and multiple prospectus supplements in one registration statement is
an unwieldy registration statement for investors to navigate in determining what information they
should review before making their investment decision and difficult for market participants to

1214

See letter from ASF I.

1215

See letters from BoA I, CFA I, and MBA I.

1216

See General Instruction IV of Form SF-3. We note existing market practice in the case of some master
trust structures, such as credit card ABS involving a single platform, in which multiple affiliated depositors
transfer credit card receivables into the issuing entity. We would view, in these limited instances, such
master trust structure with a single securitization platform as one transaction (that is, one program), with
multiple registrants.

follow which registration statement relates to which takedown. By limiting a registration
statement to one asset class, the quality and nature of the disclosure should be enhanced as the
disclosure would be presented in a more accessible and useful format for investors. While the
revisions to both presentation of disclosure as well as the limitation of one asset class per
registration statement could place additional costs on issuers that need to file additional
registration statements, we believe that these additional costs are reasonable in light of the
expected improved transparency benefits for investors. 1219 Furthermore, we believe that our payas-you-go amendment that we are also adopting should offset some of the costs that issuers could
incur with additional registration statements.
2.

Adding New Structural Features or Credit Enhancements
a)

Proposed Rule

We proposed to restrict the ability of ABS issuers to add information about new structural
features or credit enhancements by filing a prospectus under Rule 424(b). 1220 It has been our
longstanding position, as articulated in the 2004 ABS Adopting Release, that structural features
or credit enhancements must be fully described in the registration statement at the time of
effectiveness. 1221 As part of this position, we have stated that a takedown off a shelf that
involves new structural features or credit enhancements that were not described as contemplated
in the base prospectus will usually require a post-effective amendment rather than describing

1219

See Section X Paperwork Reduction Act (estimating this requirement will result in approximately four new
registration statements to be filed annually by shelf ABS issuers).

1220

1221

See the 2004 ABS Adopting Release at 1524.

433

them in the final prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Securities Act Rule 424. 1222
In that regard, we proposed to codify our position that when an issuer desires to add information
that relates to new structural features or credit enhancements, the issuer must file that
information by a post-effective amendment to the registration statement. By requiring the issuer
to file a post-effective amendment, the Commission’s staff would have an opportunity to review
the disclosure regarding these new structural features and credit enhancements that would be
contemplated for future takedowns from the shelf registration statement.
b)

Comments on Proposed Rule

Commenters were generally supportive of our proposal to codify the requirement of a
post-effective amendment for new structural features or credit enhancements. 1223 One
commenter believed that all market participants would benefit from the enhanced understanding
of a transaction that would result from the proposed rule. 1224 One commenter noted that the
proposed rule would provide the staff with time to focus on new structural features or credit
enhancements. 1225 Another commenter noted that the proposed rule would allow the
Commission to control the purpose of shelf filing and allow for more targeted review. 1226 One

issuers on Form S-3 with the ability to include information previously omitted in a prospectus filed

ABS Adopting Release).

commenter noted that the term “structural features” is too vague and suggested that the
Commission provide more specificity. 1227
c)

Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Final Rule

After considering the comments, we are adopting, as proposed, new Securities Act Rule
430D(d)(2), which codifies a longstanding position of the Commission that an ABS issuer must
file a post-effective amendment to the registration statement when it wants to add information
about new structural features or credit enhancements that were not described as contemplated in
the base prospectus of an effective registration statement. As noted above, one commenter stated
that the term “structural features” was too vague to use as a trigger for a post-effective
amendment and was concerned that the term could be interpreted to trigger a post-effective
amendment for minor structural adjustments that would not have required a post-effective
amendment under the existing standard. 1228 Because our new rule merely codifies the
Commission’s longstanding position, the final rule does not change when such requirement is
triggered. 1229
We believe that codification of our existing position will provide issuers with clarity
about how the rules work. It will also help to ensure that the staff has the opportunity to review

1227

1229

See the 2004 ABS Adopting Release at 1524 (“A takedown off of a shelf that involves assets, structural
features, credit enhancement or other features that were not described as contemplated in the base
prospectus will usually require either a new registration statement (e.g., to include additional assets) or a
post-effective amendment (e.g., to include new structural features or credit enhancement) rather than
simply describing them in the final prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Securities Act Rule
424.”).

435

these new structural features or credit enhancements that would be contemplated for future
offerings. Because this rule is simply a codification of our existing position, we believe that the
new rule will result in no material increase in costs and will be neutral in terms of its impact on
competition, efficiency, and capital formation.
E.

Pay-as-You-Go Registration Fees
1.

Proposed Rule

To alleviate some of the burden of managing multiple registration statements among ABS
issuers, we proposed to allow, but not require, ABS issuers eligible to use Form SF-3 to pay
filing fees as securities are offered off a shelf registration statement, commonly known as “payas-you-go.” 1230 Under the proposal, the triggering event for a fee payment would be the filing of
a preliminary prospectus.
2.

Comments on Proposed Rule

Several trade associations agreed that the proposal would be a helpful change. 1231 Some
commenters noted that they would like the Commission to clarify that, under existing Rule
457(p), if an ABS offering is not completed, or the size of the offering is reduced, after the fee is

1230

In 2005, we first adopted pay-as-you-go rules to allow well-known seasoned issuers using automatic shelf
registration statements to pay filing fees at the time of a securities offering. See Section V.B.2.b.(D) of the
Securities Offering Reform Release. Under the current pay-as-you-go procedure for WKSIs, an issuer can
pay any filing fee, in whole or in part, in advance of takedown or at the time of takedown, providing
flexibility in the timing of the fee payment. Issuers using pay-as-you-go can still deposit monies in an
account for payment of filing fees when due. The fee rules applicable to the use of such account, also
referred to as the “lockbox account,” apply. The amount of the fee is calculated based on the fee schedule
in effect when the money is withdrawn from the lockbox account. This flexibility had been provided so
issuers may determine the fee payment approach most appropriate for them. See footnote 529 of the
Securities Offering Reform Release. See Securities Act Rules 456(b) [17 CFR 230.456(b)] and 457(r) [17
CFR 230.457(r)].

1231

See letters from ABA I, ASF I, MBA I, and SIFMA I.

436

paid, the unused portion of the fee can be applied to future takedowns off the same or a
replacement registration statement by the depositor or an affiliate of such depositor. 1232 One
issuer requested that the timing of the fee payment be changed from the filing of the preliminary
prospectus to the filing of the final prospectus in order to alleviate any risk that the issuer did not
pay sufficient registration fees to cover any upsizing of the offering as well as to alleviate the
possibility of overpayment of the registration fees if the offering is downsized. 1233
3.

Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Final Rule

We are adopting, as proposed, revisions to our rules to permit ABS issuers to pay
registration fees as securities are offered off a registration statement as opposed to paying all
registration fees upfront at the time of filing a registration statement on Form SF-3. As
proposed, under the new rule, a dollar amount or a specific number of securities is not required
to be included in the calculation of the registration fee table in the registration statement, unless a
fee based on an amount of securities is paid at the time of filing. 1234 As proposed, the fee table
on the cover of the registration statement must list the securities or class of securities registered
and must indicate if the filing fee will be paid on a pay-as-you-go basis. 1235

1232

See letters from ASF I, BoA I, MBA I, and Sallie Mae I.

1233

See letter from Sallie Mae I.

1234

See new Securities Act Rule 457(s).

1235

In the case of ABS, the fee table on the registration statement typically lists the offering of certificates and
notes as separate classes of securities. Each class (or tranche) of those certificates and notes offered would
not need to be separately listed on the fee table. However, if the ABS is a resecuritization, where
registration of the underlying securities would be required under Rule 190 and the underlying security was
not listed on the fee table of the Form SF-3 registration statement, the underlying securities would need to
be registered on a different new registration statement. Likewise, if a servicer or trustee invests cash
collections in other instruments which may be securities under the Securities Act, such as guarantees or

437

Under the final rule, as proposed, the triggering event for a fee payment will be the filing
of an initial preliminary prospectus. 1236 At the time of filing an initial preliminary
prospectus, 1237 the ABS issuer is required to include a calculation of registration fee table on the
cover page of the prospectus and to pay the appropriate fee calculated in accordance with
Securities Act Rule 457. In light of one commenter’s concern about the possibility of
overpaying the registration fee by requiring it to be paid in connection with the preliminary
prospectus, we note ABS issuers opting to pay the required registration fees with each takedown
could rely upon Rule 457(p) to apply a portion of the fee associated with the unsold securities
under a previously-filed registration statement as an offset against the filing fee due at the time of
the preliminary prospectus filing by the same depositor or affiliates of the depositor across asset
classes. Similarly, such registrants could apply unused fees paid in connection with a
preliminary prospectus filing toward a future takedown off the same registration statement. We
believe that this amendment will alleviate some of the burden ABS issuers incur with managing
multiple registration statements. Additionally, it should offset some of the additional costs that

debt instruments of an affiliate, under Rule 190 those underlying securities also may need to be registered
concurrently with the asset-backed offering. If those underlying securities were not listed on the fee table
of the registration statement, a new registration statement would be required.
1236

See new Securities Act Rule 456(c). Unlike the pay-as-you-go rules for WKSIs, we do not believe that a
cure period is necessary for ABS issuers because we are requiring ABS issuers to pay the required fee at
the time the preliminary prospectus is filed. The timing of the fee payment for ABS would not give rise to
the same effective date and registration concerns that arise with WKSIs. See Section V.B.2.b.(D) of the
Securities Offering Reform Release.

1237

If, after the initial preliminary prospectus, an issuer files a subsequent preliminary prospectus or prospectus
supplement solely to update the fee table and pay additional fees, the subsequent preliminary prospectus
will not trigger a new waiting period. See discussion in Section V.B.1 New Shelf Registration Procedures
related to preliminary prospectuses and related waiting periods.

438

issuers will incur with our new rule, discussed earlier, requiring a separate registration statement
for each form of prospectus. We also believe that our pay-as-you-go rule should produce some
efficiencies in the shelf offering process by providing shelf issuers with greater payment
flexibility.
F.

Codification of Staff Interpretations Relating to Securities Act Registration

We proposed to codify several staff positions relating to the registration of asset-backed
securities. 1238 In proposing these codifications, we sought to simplify our rules by making our
staff’s positions more transparent and readily available to the public.
1.
Fee Requirements for Collateral Certificates or Special Units of
Beneficial Interest
We proposed to amend Rule 190 1239 of the Securities Act to clarify the existing
requirement that if the pool assets for the asset-backed securities are collateral certificates or
special units of beneficial interest (SUBIs), 1240 then the offer and sale of those collateral
certificates or SUBIs must be registered concurrently with the registration of the asset-backed
securities. While the offer and sale of the certificates or SUBIs must be concurrently registered,
we proposed to codify the staff position that no separate registration fee for the collateral

1238

See Section VII.A. of the 2010 ABS Proposing Release.

1239

17 CFR 230.190. Rule 190 governs the registration requirements for the underlying securities of an asset
securitization.

1240

In some ABS transactions backed by auto leases, the leases and car titles are originated in the name of a
separate trust to avoid the administrative expenses of re-titling the physical property underlying the leases.
The separate trust, commonly referred to as the “origination trust” or “titling trust,” will issue a collateral
certificate, often called a “special unit of beneficial interest,” to the issuing entity for the asset-backed
security. The issuing entity will then issue the asset-backed securities backed by the collateral certificate or
SUBI.

439

certificates or SUBIs is required to be paid, provided that the certificates or SUBIs meet the
requirements of Rule 190(c). 1241 Additionally, we proposed to amend Rule 457 1242 of the
Securities Act, governing the computation of registration fees, to reflect the staff’s position that
where the securities to be offered are collateral certificates or SUBIs underlying asset-backed
securities which are being concurrently registered, no separate fee for the certificates or SUBIs
will be payable.
Several commenters supported the proposal to codify the staff’s position in Rule 190 and
Rule 457 under the Securities Act. 1243 One commenter noted generally that codifying the staff’s
interpretations is a benefit for all market participants, 1244 and another commenter indicated that it
concurred with the Commission’s rationale. 1245 No commenter opposed the proposal. After
considering the comments, we are adopting the amendments to Rule 190 and Rule 457 of the
Securities Act as proposed. 1246

Incorporating by Reference Subsequently Filed Exchange Act
Reports

Rule 190(c) provides for the conditions in which an asset-backed issuer is not required to register a pool
asset representing an interest in or the right to the payments or cash flows of another asset.

440

a)

Proposed Rule

Item 12(b) of Form S-3 requires that the registrant incorporate by reference all
subsequently filed Exchange Act reports prior to the termination of the offering. In the 2004
ABS Adopting Release, we explained that Item 12(b) of Form S-3 is required for asset-backed
issuers only “if applicable.” 1247 The staff has provided interpretive guidance to issuers as to
which periodic reports and other Exchange Act reports the issuer may be required to incorporate
by reference into the registration statement. 1248 The staff has noted that information filed with a
current report on Form 8-K prior to the termination of the offering would often be required to be
incorporated into the registration statement. 1249 In contrast, the staff has explained that Form 10D or Form 10-K reports may not necessarily contain information that is required to be, or that the
issuer desires to be, incorporated by reference into the registration statement. 1250
To simplify our rules, we proposed to codify the staff’s position that an issuer of assetbacked securities may modify the incorporation by reference language included in the
registration statement to provide that only the current reports on Form 8-K subsequently filed by

1247

See Section III.A.3 of the 2004 ABS Adopting Release.

1248

See Interpretation 15.02 of the Division’s Manual of Publicly Available Interpretations on Regulation AB
and Related Rules.

1249

Examples of circumstances when an asset-backed issuer may be required to incorporate by reference its
current reports on Form 8-K into the registration statement include filing required exhibits, such as legal
and tax opinions, or to provide disclosure under Item 6.05 of Form 8-K regarding changes in the
composition of the pool assets.

1250

We explained in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release that because the Form 10-Ds and Form 10-Ks that are
filed prior to the termination of the offering are generally for a different ABS issuer than the ABS issuer
that has filed the prospectus, the Form 10-D and Form 10-K reports may not be relevant to the asset-backed
offering that is the subject of the prospectus. See Section VII.B of the 2010 ABS Proposing Release.

441

the registrant prior to the termination of the offering shall be deemed to be incorporated by
reference into the registration statement. 1251
b)

Comments on Proposed Rule

Several commenters supported the proposal, and no commenters opposed it. 1252 One
commenter believed that the proposed rule struck the right balance by permitting issuers to
incorporate by reference only Form 8-K filings rather than requiring issuers to incorporate all
subsequently filed Exchange Act reports. 1253 Some commenters indicated that the proposed rule
is consistent with current practice of issuers. 1254
c)

Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Final Rule

After consideration of the comments, we are adopting the proposed codification of the
staff’s position regarding incorporation by reference of subsequently filed periodic reports in
Form SF-3. Thus, under Item 10(d) of Form SF-3, the prospectus shall provide a statement
regarding the incorporation by reference of Exchange Act reports prior to the termination of the
offering pursuant to one of the following two ways. The registrant may state that all reports
subsequently filed by the registrant pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act prior to the termination of the offering shall be deemed to be incorporated by reference into
the prospectus. In the alternative, the registrant may state that all current reports on Form 8-K

1251

See Section VII.B of the 2010 ABS Proposing Release.

1252

See letters from BoA I, MBA I, Prudential I, and SIFMA I.

1253

See letter from BoA I.

1254

See letters from BoA I and MBA I.

442

subsequently filed by the registrant pursuant to Sections 13(a), 13(c), or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act prior to the termination of the offering shall be deemed to be incorporated by reference into
the prospectus.
We believe that the codification of these staff positions will simplify our rules by making
our staff’s positions more transparent and readily available to the public. Because these
codifications are consistent with current practice of issuers, we do not believe that they will pose
a cost to either issuers or investors.
VI.

Filing Requirements for Transaction Documents
A.

Proposed Rule

Item 1100(f) of Regulation AB allows ABS issuers to file agreements or other documents
as exhibits on Form 8-K and, in the case of offerings off a shelf registration statement,
incorporate the exhibits by reference instead of filing a post-effective amendment. In the 2010
ABS Proposing Release, we noted our belief that the information in the transaction agreements
and other documents provide important information on the terms of the transactions,
representations and warranties about the assets, servicing terms, and many other rights that
would be material to an investor. In the staff’s experience with the filing of these documents,
some ABS issuers have delayed filing such material agreements with the Commission until
several days or even weeks after the offering of securities off a shelf registration statement. We
also noted that investors have expressed concerns regarding the timeliness of information in ABS

443

offerings, including the timeliness of the filing of these documents. 1255 In light of these
concerns, we proposed to revise Item 1100(f) of Regulation AB to state explicitly that the
exhibits filed with respect to an ABS offering registered on Form SF-3 must be on file and made
part of the registration statement at the latest by the date the final prospectus is required to be
filed. 1256 In response to the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, some commenters recommended that
the exhibits should be available for investor review prior to making an investment decision. 1257
Therefore, in the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release, we re-proposed the amendments to Item
1100(f) of Regulation AB to also require that the underlying transaction documents, in
substantially final form, be filed and made part of the registration statement by the date the
preliminary prospectus is required to be filed rather than by the date that the final prospectus is
required to be filed.

1255

See the 2010 ABS Proposing Release at 23388.

1256

We permit the filing of these agreements with the Form 8-K and incorporated by reference into the
registration statement in lieu of filing a post-effective amendment to the registration statement. As such,
the filing requirements for these agreements, including the timing of the filing, is governed by our
registration requirements, not the provisions of Form 8-K.

Proposing Release (suggesting that the rules require that key disclosures, including the pooling and
servicing agreement, be made available to investors during the marketing period so that investors have
adequate time to review prior to making an investment decision), Prudential I (noting its concern with
possible “last minute financial engineering” that contributes to poor understanding of the transaction), and
SIFMA I (requesting for purposes of shelf eligibility that we clarify that if exhibits are timely filed in
substantially final form, the fact that any such document is subsequently amended or otherwise corrected
will not be viewed by the Commission as a failure to timely file the corrected document).

B.

Comments Received on Proposed Rule

Comments on the re-proposed amendments to Item 1100(f) of Regulation AB were
mixed with mostly investors supporting the amendments 1258 and issuers opposing them. 1259 The
commenters that opposed the proposal generally believed that the preliminary prospectus
provides all material information related to a particular transaction and, therefore, there is no
material benefit to providing the transaction documents in substantially final form. 1260 The
commenters also were concerned that the requirement would likely result in additional costs to
issuers or consumers; 1261 that it would pose a restriction on the parties’ ability to tailor the
transaction to meet investor requests; 1262 revising the prospectus and the transaction documents
at the same time could lead to more inconsistencies or errors; 1263 and may require the filing of

the same documents three times. 1264 Some commenters also believed that for certain transactions
the documents cannot be given in the proposed time frame. 1265 Similarly, another commenter
contended that the requirement compels issuers to “finalize transaction agreements” by the time
of the preliminary prospectus filing, which will inevitably delay issuers’ access to the market and
thereby potentially expose both issuers and investors to market movements that may be adverse
to one or the other. 1266
On the other hand, some investors believed that the transaction documents should be
provided in substantially final form at least five business days before the first sale in an
offering, 1267 and one of these investors believed that an executed set of operative documents
should be released with the filing of the final prospectus (at least three business days prior to

specific terms create significant changes to or clarifications of the forms filed with the registration
statement, then the updated documents should be made available to investors one business day before they
are asked to make an investment decision).

See letter from ASF V (stating that a filing may be necessary, at the time the preliminary prospectus is
filed, again at the time the final prospectus is filed, in the event a change (other than a “minor” change) to
the agreement occurs, and at or after the time those transaction agreements are executed because
“regulations appear to provide that an exhibit to a registration statement filed without signatures would be
considered an incomplete exhibit and, therefore, could not be incorporated by reference in any subsequent
filing under any Act administered by the Commission”).

investors, so long as they are properly drafted) and Kutak (suggesting the documents are constantly being

conduct appropriate due diligence on transactions, 1269 and a group of investors also stated that
the underlying transaction documents are material to their investment decision and should be
available in substantially final form at the time the preliminary prospectus is filed. 1270 Another
group of investors supported the proposal and stated that “[t]he complexity of those transactions
does not lend itself to abbreviated disclosure.” 1271 Another commenter noted that “access to the
underlying transaction documents is also essential for the benefit of investors.” 1272
In the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release, we also requested comment on whether we
should require issuers to file as an exhibit a copy of the representations, warranties, remedies,
and exceptions marked to show how it compares to industry-developed model provisions. The
comments that we received on our request for comment as to filing exhibits marked to industrydeveloped models were mixed with investors supporting the proposal 1273 and mostly issuers
opposing it. 1274

C.

Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Final Rule

After considering the comments received, we are adopting the requirement, as proposed
in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, to clarify existing exhibit filing requirements by making
explicit that the exhibits filed with respect to an ABS offering, registered on new Form SF-3,
must be on file and made part of the registration statement at the latest by the date the final
prospectus is filed. We believe that this revision should address the problem that we noted above
about some issuers delaying their filing of the transaction agreements with the Commission until
several days and, in some cases, even weeks after a shelf offering of the securities. We also note
that ABS shelf offerings were designed to mirror non-shelf offerings in terms of filing the
exhibits and final prospectuses. Because all exhibits to Form SF-1 must be filed by the time of
effectiveness, we believe that all transaction agreements for shelf offerings filed as exhibits
should be filed and made part of the shelf registration statement by the time of the final
prospectus.
We are not adopting at this time, however, the part of the proposal to require the
transaction documents be filed, in substantially final form, and made part of the registration
statement by the date the preliminary prospectus is required to be filed. We continue to consider

that the release of operative documents and blacklined documents should begin within 30 days after
adoption of the new rules because this information is critical to an investor’s understanding of a
securitization).

See letters from Better Markets, CREFC II (noting that the representations and warranties will be in the
“substantially final mortgage loan purchase agreement” filed with the Rule 424(h) filing), MBA II (with
respect to CMBS), and SIFMA III-dealers and sponsors (noting its support of industry efforts to develop
model provisions but emphasizing that such models do not currently exist for most asset classes and that

manner would be an enormous challenge while resulting in minimal additional investor protection).

the balance between investors’ interest in having access to the transaction documents earlier and
the costs and difficulties with requiring issuers to provide the transaction documents in
substantially final form by the time of the preliminary prospectus. Also, in light of the new
disclosure requirements that must be provided at the time of the preliminary prospectus, as well
as the certification by the issuer that the prospectus must fairly present information about the
transaction, including the structure of the transaction, we believe further consideration is
warranted. Therefore, the proposal to require the transaction documents be filed, in substantially
final form, and made part of the registration statement by the date of the preliminary prospectus
is required to be filed remains outstanding and unchanged.
In light of the comments received, we are also not adopting any requirements that
investors be provided with blacklines of how the issuer’s representations and warranties compare
against the industry-developed model provisions or blacklines of how the transaction documents
compare to the transaction documents from prior transactions or from prior versions of the
transaction documents filed for the current transaction. While we believe that these types of
marked documents could be an important tool for the identification of discrete or material
changes between original and revised documents, we acknowledge commenters’ concerns that
there is no consistent industry standard at this time nor a clear identity of what other agreements
to use as a comparison. We also believe, at this time, that most investors should have the
capacity to produce documents marked to show differences from prior documents.

VII.

Definition of Asset-Backed Security
A.

Proposed Rule

As part of our effort to provide more timely and detailed disclosure regarding the pool
assets to investors, we proposed revisions to the Regulation AB definition of an asset-backed
security. 1275 A security must meet the definition of an “asset-backed security” under Regulation
AB in order to utilize the disclosure requirements of Regulation AB and be eligible for shelf
registration as an asset-backed security. 1276 As noted in previous releases, a core principle of the
Regulation AB definition of an asset-backed security is that the security is backed by a discrete
pool of assets that by their terms convert into cash, with a general absence of active pool
management. However, in response to commenters and previous staff interpretation, in 2004, we
adopted certain exceptions to the ‘‘discrete pool’’ requirement in the definition of asset-backed
security to accommodate master trusts, prefunding periods, and revolving periods. 1277
In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we proposed to amend the “discrete pool of assets”
exceptions to the current definition of “asset-backed security” by amending:
(i)

the master trust exception to exclude securities that are backed by assets that arise in nonrevolving accounts;

(ii)

the revolving period exception to reduce the permissible duration of the revolving period
for securities backed by non-revolving assets from three years to one year; and

1275

See Item 1101(c) of Regulation AB.

1276

See Item 1100 of Regulation AB.

1277

See Item 1101(c)(3) of Regulation AB.

450

(iii)

the prefunding exception to decrease the prefunding limit from 50% to 10% of the
offering proceeds or, in the case of master trusts, from 50% to 10% of the principal
balance of the total asset pool. 1278

We were concerned that pools that are not sufficiently developed at the time of an offering to fit
within the ABS disclosure regime may, nonetheless, qualify for ABS treatment, which may
result in investors not receiving appropriate information about the securities being offered. 1279
Consequently, we proposed amendments to these exceptions in order to restrict deviations from
the “discrete pool of assets” requirement.
B.

Comments on Proposed Rule

While some commenters provided specific comments, several commenters provided
general comments on the proposal to change the definition of asset-backed security. One
commenter noted that the changes to the definition would not prohibit public issuances of ABS
with larger prefunding accounts and revolving periods, and noted that such offerings would be
governed by the more extensive disclosure requirements of Form S-1. 1280 Another commenter
requested that the definition of asset-backed security be sufficiently narrow to restrict access to
only those securities where sufficient and robust disclosure, including collateral pool disclosure,
can be provided during the initial offering process and at the same time, the definition should be

calibrated to permit a reasonable degree of flexibility to accommodate innovation and new
product development. 1281
1.

The Master Trust Exception

One commenter supported the proposal to exclude securities that are backed by assets
that arise in non-revolving accounts. 1282 This commenter noted that master trust structures are
appropriate for sponsors with recurring variable collateral funding needs (e.g., credit cards, fleet
leases, floor plans, and rental cars) and that any asset type that follows a traditional amortization
schedule or without the ability to redraw on the loan generally should not be included in a
publicly issued master trust structure. 1283
However, other commenters opposed the proposal to limit the exception to master trusts
backed by revolving accounts. 1284 Several commenters believed that distinguishing securities
backed by revolving versus non-revolving assets is unwarranted. One commenter noted that it
did not believe there is any credit, disclosure, or other investor protection reason to support the
change. 1285 The issuer and investor members of another commenter agreed that, in applying the
master trust exception, efforts to distinguish securities backed by revolving versus non-revolving

assets will impose artificial limits on which asset classes may use the master trust structure,
thereby eliminating an investment option that both issuers and investors desire. 1286
Some commenters noted that the master trust structure is commonly used to securitize
mortgages in the United Kingdom and that the proposed rule would result in those mortgage
master trusts no longer being eligible for shelf registration. 1287 One commenter noted that
European market participants expressed concern that since the proposed change would reduce
the ability of mortgage master trust issuers to place their bonds in the U.S. market, it would
effectively reduce the efficiency of issuances for existing master trusts, which would adversely
impact the overall efficiency of the asset-backed market. 1288
2.

The Revolving Period Exception

Although an investor commenter supported the proposal relating to reducing the
revolving period for non-revolving assets (e.g., auto loans and equipment loans), the commenter
acknowledged that concerns about lack of information about new collateral additions to the pool
would be mitigated if the issuer would be required to file loan-level information at issuance and
each month that new assets are added to the collateral pool. 1289 This commenter also noted that

1286

See letter from ASF I.

1287

See letters from AFME/ESF (noting that it would still be possible for such transactions to be registered in
the U.S. using a new registration statement for each offering) and BoA I (noting that while the domestic
RMBS market does not currently utilize a master trust structure, given the current mortgage finance market,
we should allow for the possibility that a master trust structure could develop).

1288

See letter from AFME/ESF.

1289

See letter from Prudential I.

453

this transparency will allow investors to evaluate the changing nature of the risk layering
introduced by the new assets.
Several commenters opposed the proposal. 1290 One commenter noted that investors have
a significant interest in purchasing ABS supported by non-revolving assets with longer maturities
than are possible without the use of revolving periods and reducing the revolving period to one
year would effectively eliminate the ability of issuers to satisfy such investor demand. 1291 One
commenter stated that the primary effect of not being able to register these offerings on Form
SF-3 would be to increase the timing and cost burdens placed on issuers. 1292 Another
commenter stated that the proposed one-year period for revolving periods should not apply to
certain loans that are homogenous in nature. 1293 It explained, for example, that since all loans
issued under a federal student loan program such as the Federal Family Education Loan Program
(“FFELP”) 1294 have the same credit risk, investors need not be concerned that the addition of
future FFELP loans would adversely impact the credit quality of the asset pool. 1295

1295

See letter from Sallie Mae I (also noting that revolving periods allow issuers to efficiently manage their
funding needs without having to issue additional bonds).

454

3.

The Prefunding Exception

Certain investor members of one commenter were supportive of the proposal to decrease
the prefunding limitation. 1296 Several commenters did not support the proposal to decrease the
prefunding limitation and believed that the prefunding amount should remain at 50% of the
offering proceeds. 1297 One commenter noted that by utilizing securitizations rather than more
expensive warehouse credit facilities or other financing alternatives, it is able to pass along cost
savings to consumers via low interest rates and that reducing the limit to 10% would reduce
flexibility and cost efficiencies when executing a securitization. 1298
Issuer members of one commenter noted that the greater the limits on prefunding, the
more expensive the carrying costs for originators and, potentially, the higher the borrowing rates
for consumers and small businesses. 1299 This commenter suggested that the prefunding limit
instead be based on the duration of the prefunding period, 1300 or the prefunding limit should
decrease from 50% to 25% (but retain a prefunding period of up to one year), which would make
the standard consistent with the prefunding standards under the Employee Retirement Income

1296

See letter from ASF I.

1297

See letters from AmeriCredit, IPFS I, and VABSS I.

1298

See letter from AmeriCredit (also suggesting that disclosures involving prefunding structures be required to
include certain representations and warranties that there has been no material variation in the overall

loans and the pool of loans as whole after giving effect to the transfer of the subsequent loans).

1299

See letter from ASF I.

1300

See letter from ASF I (suggesting, for example, permitting prefunding not in excess of 10% where a
prefunding period may last up to one year, prefunding not in excess of 25% where a prefunding period may
last up to nine months, and prefunding not in excess of 50% where a prefunding period may last up to six
months).

455

Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”). 1301 Several other commenters also suggested that a 25%
prefunding ceiling would be more appropriate for the same reason. 1302 Another commenter
suggested reducing the limit to 20%, while imposing a 10% limit in the case of shelf offerings on
Form SF-3 because it would be more consistent with market practice and more restrictive than
the limitation on prefunding that is applicable to ABS that are eligible for sale under ERISA. 1303
Lastly, one student loan issuer believed that the proposed 10% limitation on prefunding
should not apply to FFELP loans (or other asset types) that are homogenous in nature. 1304
C.

Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Final Rule

We are adopting the prefunding limitation in the definition of asset-backed security, as
proposed, with some modification. The new rule decreases the prefunding limit from 50% to
25% (instead of 10%, as proposed) of offering proceeds or, in the case of master trusts, the
principal balance of the total asset pool. The new rule is based on suggestions from several
commenters that 25% would be an appropriate restriction, in part, because it is consistent with
prefunding standards under ERISA.

1301

Pub. L. No. 93-406, 88 Stat. 829 (1974). ERISA is a federal law that sets uniform minimum standards to
ensure that employee benefit plans are established and maintained in a fair and financially sound manner.
In addition, employers have an obligation to provide promised benefits and satisfy ERISA's requirements
for managing and administering private retirement and welfare plans.

1302

See letters from BoA I and Sallie Mae I.

1303

See letter from SIFMA I (also noting that the Commission staff would have the opportunity to review and
comment on the disclosure for an offering on Form SF-1 where the 20% limit would be applicable and
reiterating that a 10% limit on prefunding is appropriate in a shelf offering).

1304

See letter from Sallie Mae I.

456

We believe that this reduction will result in the asset pool being more developed at the
time of the offering, which will provide investors with more appropriate information about the
securities being offered. We recognize, however, that the rule could impose higher carrying
costs on originators and, in turn, potentially higher borrowing rates for consumers and small
businesses. We believe that our final rule balances the need to provide investors with more
appropriate information and these cost concerns by raising the prefunding period limit from the
proposed 10% to 25% of the offering proceeds (or principal balance of the total assets for master
trusts).
We are not adopting the revision to the master trust exception to exclude securities that
are backed by assets that arise in non-revolving accounts because we are persuaded by
commenters’ concerns that it would eliminate the use of shelf for certain master trusts. The cost
of not adopting this revision today is the possibility that more ABS issuers of non-revolving
assets will utilize master trust structures, which will result in investors lacking access to
information about all pool assets before making an investment decision. This concern is
mitigated, to some extent, by the adoption of initial and ongoing asset-level disclosure
requirements for some asset classes.
We are also not adopting the proposal to revise the revolving period exception that would
reduce the permissible duration of the revolving period for securities backed by non-revolving
assets from three years to one year due to comments received. An investor commenter noted, for
example, that receiving updated asset-level information about the pool’s assets on an ongoing

457

basis would mitigate concerns regarding the duration of the revolving period. 1305 We also
recognize, as noted by another commenter, that shortening the revolving period for securities
backed by non-revolving assets could preclude certain issuers, such as auto and equipment
issuers, from issuing securities with longer maturities than the underlying loans. 1306

Distribution Reports on Form 10-D
1.

Delinquency Presentation
a)

Proposed Rule

In the 2004 ABS Adopting Release, we stated that delinquency disclosures required in
the Form 10-D under Item 1121(a)(9) were based on materiality 1307 and not on Item 1100(b) of
Regulation AB, which requires presentation of delinquency data to be provided in 30- or 31-day
increments, as applicable, beginning at least with assets that are 30 or 31 days delinquent, as
applicable, through the point that assets are written off or charged off as uncollectable.
However, in registration statements, delinquency disclosures are to be presented pursuant to Item
1100(b). Consistent with our efforts to standardize the disclosure across all ABS, we proposed
to add a new instruction to Item 1121(a)(9) to require that pool-level delinquency disclosure in
periodic reports be provided in accordance with Item 1100(b) of Regulation AB.

Comments on Proposed Rule

We received several comment letters that provided differing views on the proposal. One
commenter stated that it would not object to the proposal because it would “provide clarity and
consistency in reporting.” 1308 This commenter also indicated that disclosure provided in the
CREFC’s IRP contains delinquency information in this format. 1309 On the other hand, several
commenters expressed concern about applying the requirements of Item 1100(b) to ongoing
reporting in that it applies a “one-size-fits-all approach across different asset classes.” 1310 They
believed that for various asset classes the presentation of delinquency information would be
provided for “considerably longer periods of time, or in more granular increments, than would be
required under general principles of materiality” and in ways that differ from the current
disclosure practices across different asset classes. 1311 The commenter believed that issuers and
servicers should not be required to incur the additional time and cost to track and present
delinquency information in additional prescribed increments as required under Item 1100(b). 1312

1308

1310

See letters from ASF I and VABSS I.

1311

See letter from ASF I (noting that standard practice in the mortgage industry has been to present
delinquency information in Form 10-D reports and in static pool information in 30- or 31-day increments
through the point that loans are 179 or 180 days delinquent, followed by an additional 180-day increment
and a final increment of 359 or 360 days or more, and for ABS supported, directly or indirectly, by motor
vehicles, equipment and other similar physical assets that have finite lives over which their value
depreciates, delinquency information is presented in 30- or 31-day increments through the point that loans
are 119 or 120 days delinquent, followed by a final increment of 119 or 120 days or more).

1312

Even though we did not propose any changes to Item 1100(b)(1), ASF I requested we make revisions to
Item 1100(b)(1) that they believed would provide for consistent presentation of delinquency information
across issuers within the same asset class, while recognizing that “some variation across asset classes is
meaningful and appropriate.” See letter from ASF I (Exhibit L).

459

c)

Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Final Rule

We are adopting a revised requirement in light of comments received. The final
instruction to Item 1121(a)(9) requires delinquency disclosures included in the Form 10-D to be
presented in accordance with Item 1100(b) with respect to presenting delinquencies in 30- or 31day increments. In response to commenters’ concerns that requiring such granular presentation
through charge-off is too long a time period, we have modified the proposed instruction to
require such presentation through no less than 120 days. We believe that this revised time period
helps to address commenters’ concerns about the cost and burden of having to track and report
this information in a more granular manner for a longer period of time while still providing
investors with a more comprehensive picture of delinquencies and losses in a uniform manner
across asset classes. We also note that the revised time period is consistent with the new assetlevel data requirement for presentation of delinquencies and losses in RMBS. 1313 While
investors will not receive as granular a presentation as proposed (through charge-off), investors
investing in asset classes required to provide asset-level disclosures will be receiving more
detailed information about the payment status of each individual asset, such as the paid through
date. 1314 We recognize that to the extent that issuers will now be required to present
delinquencies and losses for a longer period of time than previously provided in the distribution

See new Item 1(g)(33) of Schedule AL.

1314

See new Item 1(g)(28) of Schedule AL. See Section III.A.2.b Asset Specific Disclosure Requirements and
Economic Analysis of These Requirements. Due to the transition period for implementing the loan-level
requirements, there will be a period of time during which investors will not have access to this more
granular data about assets in prior securitized pools. See Section IX.B Transition Period for Asset-Level
Disclosure Requirements.

reports, such issuers will incur some costs. We believe, however, the benefits gained from
standardized and comparable delinquency and loss disclosure justify the costs issuers may incur
to provide the information.
2.
Identifying Information and Cross-References to Previously Reported
Information

In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we proposed several revisions to Exchange Act
Form 10-D or to the requirements governing the disclosures to be provided with the Form 10D. 1315 We proposed to revise General Instruction C.3. of Form 10-D to provide that if
information required by an item has been previously reported, 1316 the Form 10-D does not need
to repeat the information. Because information that is previously reported may relate to a
different issuer from the issuer to which the report relates, such information may be difficult to
locate. As a result, we also proposed to amend Form 10-D to require disclosure of a reference to
the CIK number, file number, and date of the previously reported information. Additionally, we
proposed to revise the cover page of the Form 10-D to include the name and phone number of
the person to contact in connection with the filing because we believed this would assist the staff
in its review of asset-backed filings. 1317 We did not receive any comments regarding these
proposed revisions to Form 10-D. We believe the costs of these requirements to be very limited
and offset by the benefit to investors and staff in easily and quickly locating the previously

1315

The term “previously reported” is defined in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2 [17 CFR 240.12b-2].

Issuers are also encouraged to provide the name and phone number of the outside attorney or other contact
in accompanying correspondence to their reports on Form 10-D.

reported information. Because of that and since we did not receive any comments opposing
these proposed revisions to Form 10-D, we are adopting them as proposed.
3.

Changes in Sponsor’s Interest in the Securities
a)

Proposed Rule

To assist investors in monitoring the sponsor’s interest in the securities, we proposed to
add a new item to Form 8-K to require the filing of a Form 8-K for any material change in the
sponsor’s interest in the securities. Under the proposal, the report on Form 8-K would be
required to include disclosure of the amount of change in interest and a description of the
sponsor’s resulting interest in the transaction.
b)

Comments on Proposed Rule

We received a mixed response to the proposal with some commenters supporting the
proposal 1318 and other commenters opposing the disclosure and suggesting that the disclosures
were not material. 1319 In support of the proposal, the investor members of a trade association
believed that if the sponsor retains exposure to the risks of the assets, the sponsor will likely have
greater incentives to include higher quality assets and ongoing monitoring of this exposure helps
to align the interests of the sponsor and investors. 1320 They also believed that the sponsor is akin

1319

See letters from ASF I (expressed views of dealer and sponsors only) (stating that the information has not
been shown to be material), BoA I, MBA I (questioning the materiality of the disclosure and suggesting
that all the disclosure would provide was that the sponsor was at some level above the minimum required
level), and SIFMA I.

See letter from ASF I (expressed views of investors only) (suggesting that because our shelf eligibility
requirements proposed in 2010 to require disclosure that the sponsor or an affiliate of the sponsor retained a

to an “insider” and its decision to hold or sell its retained interest may be triggered based upon a
negative or positive view of the securitization. Another investor stated that the sponsor and its
affiliates should regularly report their current risk retention related holdings by each tranche of a
securitization, because any change in risk retention holdings is material. 1321 Another commenter,
an issuer of student loan ABS, generally supported the proposal, but requested an instruction be
added to clarify that transfers by the sponsor to its affiliates or subsidiaries would not trigger a
filing obligation under Item 6.09 because transfers within a corporate family are not material
changes that should require a Form 8-K filing. 1322
Some commenters who opposed the proposal suggested it was too broad and should be
limited to the monitoring of a sponsor’s retention of risk that is required as a condition of shelf
eligibility, law, or regulation. 1323 Another commenter also opposed the proposal because it did
not see a benefit to the disclosure, the compliance costs would be substantial, and the issuer
would need information from parties that it does not control. 1324 In addition, the issuer members
of a trade association also disagreed with the investor members who suggested, as discussed
above, that a sponsor’s decision to hold or sell any portion of its interest in the securities may

net economic interest in each securitization that this requirement should be extended to affiliates of the
sponsor).

serve as an indicator of the future prospects for the securitization 1325 and that the requirement
should extend to changes in the interest of affiliates of the sponsors. 1326 The issuer members also
stated that privacy concerns could arise with disclosing this type of information, although no
further detail was provided. 1327
We also received several comments seeking revisions to the proposal. For instance, some
commenters suggested that, if we adopt the rule, it should not include the reporting of changes
that arise as a result of organic changes in the sponsor’s interest in securities, such as pool assets
converting into cash in accordance with their terms or, in the case of revolving pool assets,
fluctuating account balances based on credit line usage or those arising as a result of payments
made on other securities issued by the issuing entity. 1328 One of these commenters also
suggested that we make clear that no reporting requirement arises as a result of the “sponsor’s
pledge of the securities in the ordinary course of business for on balance sheet funding
purposes.” 1329 Finally, some commenters suggested that the disclosure be provided in the Form

1325

See letter from ASF I (expressed views of dealers and sponsors only) (stating in many deals, the sponsor is
not an affiliate of the servicer and may not even be an affiliate of the depositor and, in any event, a

relationship of an officer, director, or other control person to a corporation).

10-D rather than in the Form 8-K. 1330 One of these commenters believed that this approach
would permit issuers to avoid constant monitoring of changes in retained interest and repeated
filing of Forms 8-K, while keeping investors informed of the sponsor’s retained interest
amount. 1331
c)

Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Final Rule

We are adopting the proposed requirement that disclosure be provided regarding material
changes in a sponsor’s interest in the ABS transaction with some modification. Instead of
providing a description in a Form 8-K as proposed, we are requiring that if there has been a
material change in the sponsor’s interest during the period covered by the Form 10-D, then a
description of the material change must be provided in the Form 10-D for that reporting period.
We agree with the commenters that suggested this approach because it would permit issuers to
avoid monitoring of changes in retained interest to meet the current reporting requirements of
Form 8-K, thus minimizing costs. 1332 At the same time, investors will continue to benefit from
being kept informed of the sponsor’s retained interest amount. Further, we are also clarifying

1330

See letters from ASF I (expressed views of dealers and sponsors only) (requesting that, in cases where the
sponsor is not an affiliate of the ABS issuer, the Commission except Item 6.09 Form 8-K reports from the
Exchange Act filing requirements for Form SF-3 eligibility purposes. The dealer and sponsor members
stated that unlike other cases where the content or completeness of an Exchange Act report is dependent on
the timely receipt of reports or other information from unaffiliated third parties, an ABS issuer would have
no way of even knowing whether and when a change in a sponsor’s interest in the securities had occurred
and, therefore, it would be inappropriate and unfair for a registrant to lose its eligibility to use Form SF-3)

1332

See letters from ASF I (expressed views of dealers and sponsors only) and Discover. The obligation to file

465

that disclosure of any material change in the sponsor’s retained interest includes any interest held
by an affiliate of the sponsor in order to be consistent with the disclosure required in the
prospectus and to allow investors to monitor changes in the interest held. The rule requires
disclosure of a material change in the sponsor’s retained interest in the ABS transaction due to
the purchase, sale or other acquisition or disposition of the securities by the sponsor or an
affiliate. 1333 While we note that the credit risk retention rules under Section 15G of the
Exchange Act have not yet been adopted, 1334 under the rules we are adopting, if there is a
material change (such as a transfer) in any interest or assets that are required to be retained in
compliance with law, disclosure of such change would be required. In order to clarify the
interplay of the disclosure requirement with risk retention requirements, we have included an
instruction specifying that the disclosure about the resulting amount and nature of any interest or
asset retained in compliance with law must be separately stated. Finally, we understand that the
sponsor may not be a party that is controlled by the issuer. We believe, however, that contracts
that relate to the transfer of the assets to the trust can include an ongoing duty for the sponsor to
provide the information required for this disclosure. Furthermore, we believe that by requiring
changes in the sponsor’s interest to be disclosed periodically on the Form 10-D, instead of on a
Form 8-K, lessens the burden of obtaining this information from parties that the issuer may not
control.

Activities like pledging would not be required. See letter from ASF I (expressed views of issuers only).

Annual Report on Form 10-K
1.

Servicer’s Assessment of Compliance with Servicing Criteria
a)

Proposed Rule

The Form 10-K report of an asset-backed issuer is required to contain, among other
things, an assessment of compliance with servicing criteria that is set forth in Item 1122 of
Regulation AB by each party participating in the servicing function. 1335 The body of the Form
10-K report must also contain disclosure regarding material instances of noncompliance with
servicing criteria. Our rules require an asset-backed issuer to provide an assessment of
compliance with respect to all asset-backed securities transactions involving the asserting party
that are backed by assets of the type backing the asset-backed securities. 1336 In order to provide
enhanced information regarding instances of noncompliance with servicing criteria with respect
to the offering to which the annual report relates, including information on steps taken to address
noncompliance, we proposed to expand the disclosure requirements to require in the body of the
annual report disclosure as to whether the instance of noncompliance identified under Item 1122
involved the servicing of the assets backing the asset-backed securities covered in the particular

1335

Exchange Act Rules 13a-18(b) and 15d-18(b) [17 CFR 240.13a-18(b) and 17 CFR 240.15d-18(b)] and Item
1122 of Regulation AB. Item 1122 of Regulation AB defines “a party participating in the servicing
function” as any entity (e.g., master servicer, primary servicers, trustees) that is performing activities that
address the criteria set forth in paragraph (d) of Item 1122, unless such entity’s activities relate only to 5%
or less of the pool assets. See Instruction 2 to Item 1122. For purposes of this discussion, we refer to the
party that is required to provide a servicer’s assessment as the “servicer.”

1336

Issuers should provide descriptions of each servicing party’s role in the transaction, particularly if multiple
servicing parties have overlapping responsibilities, by describing in the Form 10-K the responsibilities
assigned to each party and the servicing criteria applicable to such party under Item 1122(d) of Regulation
AB.

467

Form 10-K report. 1337 As part of its assessment of compliance, the asserting party typically
conducts a sampling of the transactions for which it is responsible for the Item 1122 criteria in
order to determine whether there is a material instance of noncompliance in their servicing. The
proposed rule would require that if the examination of the sample found a material instance of
noncompliance and that material instance of noncompliance involved the servicing of assets of a
particular ABS, then the annual report covering that particular ABS would include disclosure
indicating that the material instance of noncompliance involved the servicing of the assets
underlying the ABS. We also proposed to require that the body of the annual report discuss any
steps taken to remedy a material instance of noncompliance previously identified by an asserting
party for its activities made on a platform level. 1338
b)

Comments on Proposed Rule

One commenter supported the proposed requirement that the body of the annual
report indicate whether an instance of noncompliance identified under Item 1122 involved the
servicing of the assets backing the asset-backed securities covered in the particular Form 10K report, 1339 while several commenters opposed the proposal. 1340

1337

See the 2010 ABS Proposing Release at 23391. While some information about instances of noncompliance
may also be required by Item 1123 of Regulation AB, because of the differences in the definition of
servicer between Item 1122 and Item 1123, we believed that Item 1123 does not cover the same
information that our proposed revision to Item 1122 would cover.

1338

This proposed disclosure would be required whether or not the instance of noncompliance involved the
servicing of assets backing the securities covered in the particular Form 10-K.

1340

See letters from ASF I, CREFC I, and KPMG (stating the proposed requirement would require an issuer to
identify each transaction that involved the instance of noncompliance identified in the Item 1122
assessment and attestation and then report in the annual report of each transaction that had that instance of

468

The commenter, who supported the proposed requirement, noted that such
information is, in fact, already being reported in annual reports on Form 10-K. 1341 However,
the commenter requested that we clarify that the “lack of such disclosure could not be
interpreted as confirmation that the transaction had not been affected.” On the other hand, a
commenter who opposed the requirement stated that it is not possible “for the servicer (much
less an ABS issuer) to identify each transaction impacted by the instance of noncompliance”
and “it would be ‘inappropriate and arbitrary’ to require an ABS issuer to identify only those
transactions within the test sample that were impacted by the instance of noncompliance.” 1342
This commenter believed that if an ABS issuer were required to disclose whether a reported
instance of noncompliance involved assets backing the ABS covered in a particular 10-K
report, then investors may draw the incorrect conclusion that in the absence of such
disclosure, the reported instance of noncompliance did not involve the servicing of assets
backing its ABS. 1343
One commenter supported requiring the disclosure of any steps taken to remedy a
material instance of noncompliance previously identified by an asserting party for the

noncompliance, which may offset the efficiencies gained by allowing management to provide a platformlevel assessment).

See letter from ASF I.

all transactions where noncompliance may have occurred”), CREFC I, and KPMG.

469

activities made on a platform level. 1344 This commenter recommended, however, that instead
of requiring the disclosure in the body of the annual report that the disclosure be included as
part of the servicer’s management assessment of compliance. The commenter explained that
in certain circumstances the management responsible for the noncompliance (e.g., servicer
management) is not the same as management responsible for filing the Form 10-K (e.g.,
issuer). The commenter also requested that we clarify that the remediation activity described
in the servicer’s management assessment is not covered by the auditor’s servicing compliance
report because the remediation activities are undertaken subsequent to the date of the
auditor’s report. Another commenter generally requested that we not adopt any of the
proposed revisions to Item 1122. 1345
c)

Final Rule and Economic Analysis of the Final Rule

After considering the comments received, we are adopting a requirement that disclosure
be provided in the body of the annual report as to whether the identified material instance of
noncompliance pursuant to Item 1122 was determined to have involved the servicing of the
assets backing the asset-backed securities covered in the particular Form 10-K report. 1346 If the
material instance of noncompliance is identified as relating to a particular transaction, investors

1344

See letter from KPMG.

1345

See letter from CREFC I (without explaining why this particular proposed revision to Item 1122 should not
be adopted).

1346

For example, if the servicer selected 10 transactions as part of their sample for purposes of assessing Item
1122 servicing criteria and it was determined that five of those transactions involved instances of
noncompliance that are material to the platform, then, under this requirement, each Form 10-K report for
those five transactions must disclose in the body of the 10-K report that: (1) this transaction was part of the
sample and (2) it was determined that this particular transaction involved a material instance of
noncompliance.

470

with investments in that particular transaction will benefit from receiving this information. 1347
We continue to believe that testing every transaction in the platform is cost prohibitive and that a
platform-level assessment for purposes of assessing servicing compliance provides an
appropriate level of information to investors while balancing the substantial increase in cost that
issuers would incur to assess the compliance with servicing criteria for every transaction in the
platform. 1348 The amendments that we adopt today do not require any change in that approach.
We understand that some commenters are concerned that requiring issuers to disclose
a reported instance of noncompliance involving assets backing the ABS covered by the 10-K
report may impose an indirect cost to investors if investors draw the incorrect conclusion that
in the absence of such disclosure, the reported instance of noncompliance did not involve the
servicing of assets backing its ABS. 1349 We believe disclosure can be provided in the Form
10-K or in the servicer’s Item 1122 report regarding the scope and structure of the assessment
that can adequately addresses this concern.
We are also adopting, as proposed, the requirement to disclose any steps taken to remedy
a material instance of noncompliance for activities made on a platform level in the body of the
annual report. While we note one commenter’s recommendation that such disclosure be

1347

We observe, however, that the absence of disclosure of instances of noncompliance involving the servicing
of assets backing a particular transaction in an annual report is not necessarily an indication that the
transaction had not been affected. We also note that, to the extent appropriate, issuers can provide
explanatory disclosure in the annual reports of the transactions that were not part of the Item 1122 sample
and explain that it is not clear whether their transaction has been affected by the material instance of
noncompliance identified in the Item 1122 assessment and attestation.

1348

See Section III.D.7.b.iii of the 2004 ABS Adopting Release.

1349

See letters from ASF I, CREFC I, and KPMG.

471

provided as part of the servicer’s management assessment of compliance rather than in the body
of the Form 10-K, we continue to believe that the issuer is ultimately responsible for the
disclosure provided in the Form 10-K and therefore should be assessing the information provided
by the servicers in their reports, including considering whether the information provided by the
servicers in their reports at the platform level applies to the transaction for which the 10-K is
filed. 1350 The final rule does not, however, prohibit the servicer from also providing such
disclosure in the servicer’s assessment of compliance. We are adopting the disclosure
requirement in order to provide investors with insight into the potential impact of the instance of
noncompliance on their transaction and whether they should reassess their continuing investment
decision. Further, we do not believe adding this disclosure is burdensome to the issuers since the
information should be readily available to them and is a logical extension of the disclosure of
material instances of noncompliance.
Finally, in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we noted the staff’s belief that the
application of Item 1108(b)(2), which requires a detailed discussion in the prospectus of the
servicer’s experience in, and procedures for, the servicing function it will perform in the current
transaction for assets of the type included in the current transaction, has not been consistent
among issuers. 1351 While we are not adopting any changes to Item 1108(b)(2) at this time, we
continue to believe that Item 1108(b)(2) requires disclosure in the prospectus of any material

1350

See letter from KPMG.

1351

See the 2010 ABS Proposing Release at 23383. Item 1108 also requires a general discussion of the
servicer’s experience in servicing the assets of any type.

472

instances of noncompliance noted in the assessment or attestation reports required by Item 1122
or the servicer compliance statement that is required by Item 1123. In addition, the prospectus
should provide disclosure of any steps taken to remedy the noncompliance disclosed and the
current status of those steps. With respect to requiring disclosure in the prospectus of a material
instance of noncompliance noted in Item 1123 servicer compliance statements, we believe such
disclosure is appropriate because investors should have access to information related to the
performance of servicers.
2.
Codification of Prior Staff Interpretations Relating to the Servicer’s
Assessment of Compliance with Servicing Criteria

We also proposed to codify certain staff positions issued by the Division of Corporation
Finance relating to the servicer’s assessment requirement, with some modification. The first
staff interpretation that we proposed to codify related to aggregation and conveyance of
information between a servicer and another party (who may also be a servicer for purposes of the
servicer’s assessment requirement). 1352 This new criterion, as proposed, would, if information
obtained in the course of performing the servicer’s duties is required by any party or parties in
the transaction in order to complete their duties under the transaction agreements, require an

1352

The staff had taken the position that, while the conveyance of information to another party is not explicitly
contained in any of the criterion in Item 1122(d), the accurate conveyance of the information was part of
the same servicing criterion under which the activity that generated the information was assessed. See the
Division of Corporation Finance’s Manual of Publicly Available Interpretations on Regulation AB and
Related Rules, Interpretation 11.03. We proposed to codify this position, but instead of requiring it be
included with an existing criterion, the proposed rule would make it a new servicing criterion in Item 1122.
See proposed Item 1122(d)(1)(v).

473

assessment that the aggregation of such information, as applicable, is mathematically accurate
and the information conveyed accurately reflects the information. 1353
We also proposed to codify in an instruction to Item 1122 staff interpretations relating to
the scope of the Item 1122 servicer’s assessment. In a publicly available telephone interpretation
the staff explained, among other things, that the platform for reporting purposes should not be
artificially designed, but rather, it should mirror the actual servicer practices of the servicer. 1354
The servicer may, however, take into account in determining the platform for reporting purposes
divisions in its servicing function by geographic locations or among separate computer systems.
Although, if the servicer includes in its platform less than all of the transactions backed by the
same asset type that it services, the proposed instruction would provide that a description of the
scope of the platform should be included in the servicer’s assessment.
We received general support for the proposed codifications from several commenters 1355
and one commenter generally requested that we not adopt any of the proposed changes to Item

1353

For example, if Servicer A is responsible for administering the assets of the pool and passing along the
aggregated information about the assets in the pool to Servicer B, and Servicer B is responsible for
calculating the waterfall or preparing and filing the Exchange Act reports with that information, Servicer
A’s activity with respect to administering the assets would be required to be assessed under Item
1122(d)(4). In addition to assessing Servicer A’s pool asset administration, Servicer A would be required
under proposed Item 1122(d)(1)(v) to separately assess whether its aggregation of the information is
mathematically accurate and the information conveyed to Servicer B accurately reflects the information. If
instead of aggregating the individual asset information, Servicer A conveys it un-aggregated, then Servicer
B would be required to include its own aggregation of the individual asset data in Servicer B’s assessment
of calculating the waterfall or preparing and filing Exchange Act reports. Servicer A would still need to
assess under proposed Item 1122(d)(1)(v) that the un-aggregated information conveyed to Servicer B
accurately reflects the information.

and Related Rules, Interpretation 17.03.

See letters from E&Y, KPMG, and Prudential I.

474

1122. 1356 We are adopting these codifications, as proposed, because we continue to believe that
adopting these positions makes them more transparent and readily available to the public. We do
not anticipate that these codifications will cause a hardship for servicers as they are consistent
with current servicer practices to the extent they were executed under existing staff
interpretations.

Central Index Key Numbers for Depositor, Sponsor and Issuing Entity

In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we noted that ABS offerings with a particular file
number may be associated with a registration statement with a different file number and that
Forms 8-K for ABS offerings may be filed under the depositor file number, making it difficult to
track material for the related offering with only the information provided in the Form 8-K. To
make it easier for interested parties to locate the depositor’s registration statement and periodic
reports associated with a particular offering and information related to the sponsor of the
offering, we proposed amendments to require that the cover pages of registration statements on
Form SF-1 and Form SF-3 include the CIK number 1357 of the depositor, and if applicable, the
CIK number of the sponsor. We also proposed to require that the cover pages of the Form 10-D,
Form 10-K, and Form 8-K for ABS issuers include the CIK number of the depositor, the issuing
entity, and, if applicable, the sponsor.

1356

See letter from CREFC I (opposing without providing an explanation why this particular proposed revision
to Item 1122 should not be adopted).

1357

The CIK is a number that we assign to each entity (company or individual) that submits filings to the
Commission. Use of the CIK allows the Commission to differentiate between filing entities with similar
names. A CIK is used to identify all filers, both EDGAR and non-EDGAR.

475

Several commenters expressed general support for these proposals; no commenters
opposed. 1358 These commenters agreed that adding the CIK numbers of the depositor and the
issuing entity to the cover pages of filings will enhance the accessibility of information to
investors. 1359
We are adopting these amendments, as proposed, given the benefits that they will provide
as recognized by commenters. Furthermore, we do not believe that requiring this information on
certain cover pages for ABS filings will be burdensome to issuers, nor did we receive any
comments stating any cost concern.
IX.

Transition Period
In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we noted our belief that compliance dates should

not extend past a year after adoption of the new rules, but we sought comment about feasible
dates for implementation of the proposed amendments. We also acknowledged that the assetlevel disclosure requirements may initially impose significant burdens on sponsors and
originators as they adjust to the new requirements, including changes to how information relating
to the pool assets is collected and disseminated to various parties along the chain of the
securitization. 1360 We also requested comment on whether we should provide a transition period
for compliance with the asset-level disclosure requirements that would allow the filing of test

CIK number). See also letter from BoA I (stating our proposal to require CIK numbers for the depositor

investors locate materials related to an ABS offering or ABS issuer).

submissions. 1361 We describe below the comments received and the overall transition period for
revisions to Regulation AB and the additional transition period for asset-level disclosure
requirements.
A.

General Transition Period

With respect to implementation of the overall proposals to revise Regulation AB, a
majority of commenters expressed a need for a longer transition period. The commenters were
generally concerned that the proposed rules would impose new substantial obligations on various
industry parties, such as originators, sponsors, and other transaction parties that will require
changes to operational procedures and infrastructures in order to meet the new disclosure
requirements. 1362 These commenters suggested that we consider various factors when
determining the implementation timeframe, including: the existence of other rulemaking
processes and regulatory developments, 1363 how the final regulations relate to and work with
other new and revised regulations, 1364 and the ability of issuers to implement the various rules’
changes simultaneously. 1365

1361

EDGAR currently provides the ability to file a test submission which allows the filer to test the ability to
create a filing in an EDGAR-acceptable format. For a test submission, fees will not be deducted, the filing
will not be disseminated, and the filing will not count towards any filing requirements.

1362

See letters from ASF I, ABA I, BoA I, CREFC I, and MBA I (requesting an 18-month implementation
period because the new obligations will require the implementation of new operational procedures and
infrastructures, and originators and servicers will need sufficient time to evaluate and update their
origination and servicing platforms).

1363

See, e.g., letters from ABA I, CREFC I, and MBA I.

1364

See letters from CREFC I (stating we should take into consideration how the final rules’ new and revised
regulations relate to and work with other new or proposed regulations, such as those described in Section
941(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, which provides for a two-year transition period for securitizers and

477

As noted above, several commenters suggested compliance timeframes that would extend
past the proposed one-year transition period. One trade association suggested an implementation
period of at least eighteen months 1366 and another suggested two years. 1367 Another commenter
suggested that implementation of the proposed rules should be staggered in one and two year
increments with those changes that can be implemented in the near-term implemented in a oneyear timeframe and the “more elaborate implementation measures” implemented within two
years. 1368 Another trade association did not specifically suggest a longer compliance period, but
suggested that for the disclosure aspects of the proposal that the effective date should be no
earlier than one year following the date of publication of the related final rules in the Federal
Register. 1369
We understand that some of the requirements that we are adopting, including the assetlevel disclosure requirements, will take time and resources in order to satisfy the new
requirements. We also understand that issuers and market participants are working to implement

originators of all classes of asset-backed securities other than RMBS to comply with risk retention
requirements) and MBA.

See letter from MBA III (with respect to CMBS) (reiterating its suggested implementation timeframes in its
Oct. 4, 2011 letter submitted in response to the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release).

1369

See letter from ASF I (suggesting that if a prospectus is included in a new registration statement filed on or
after the effective date that the new disclosure rules should apply to that prospectus and that we should also
allow for a period to convert to the proposed new Form SF-3 so that a prospectus included in the
registration statement may be made compliant). The ASF reiterated this position in its Oct. 4, 2011 letter
submitted in response to the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release. See letter from ASF III.

478

many different regulations that have recently been adopted or may be adopted in the near future.
We are therefore adopting a tiered approach. All new rules, except for asset-level disclosures
require compliance within one year from the effective date of the rules. We believe that this time
period provides a sufficient transition period for compliance. We believe that 12 months will
allow the transaction parties to better manage the changes necessary to their systems and
processes. Therefore, any registered offering of asset-backed securities commencing with an
initial bona fide offer one year after the effective date of the rules and the asset-backed securities
that are the subject of that offering must comply with the new rules and forms, except for assetlevel disclosures. Consequently, after the one year transition period, ABS issuers seeking to
conduct a shelf ABS offering must conduct such offering off of an effective Form SF-3
registration statement.
In addition, any Form 10-D or Form 10-K that is filed after one year after the effective
date of the rules must include the information required by the new rules, except for asset-level
disclosures.
B.

Transition Period for Asset-Level Disclosure Requirements

We received substantial feedback with respect to the appropriate compliance dates for our
requirements related to the asset-level disclosure requirements. Issuers, market participants, and
trade associations representing issuers generally believed that a significant number of the
proposed data points required data that is currently not captured by originators or servicers. 1370

1370

See, e.g., letters from ABA I, ASF I, BoA I, CREFC I, J.P. Morgan I, PricewaterhouseCoopers dated July
30, 2010 submitted in response to the 2010 ABS Proposing Release (“PwC”), MBA I, SIFMA I (expressed

They also argued that there will be substantial costs in time and resources to develop systems
that will capture the data in the required format and, therefore, believed an extended
implementation timeframe is appropriate.
Commenters suggested varying timeframes for implementation. For instance, investor
members of one group suggested that the transition period should not exceed one year from the
date the final rules are published. 1371 In contrast, other commenters suggested longer
timeframes, including: a transition period of no earlier than 12 months from the publication of
the final rules in the Federal Register, 1372 18 months, 1373 and 24 months. 1374 We also received a
number of comments suggesting that the asset-level disclosures may not be available for assets
originated before the effective date of the asset-level disclosure requirements or for assets
underlying asset-backed securities originated before the effective date of the requirements. 1375

estimate for compliance.
1371

See letter from SIFMA I (expressed views of investors only). The dealer and sponsor members of this
commenter suggested that a one-year transition period would be the minimum needed and recommending
18 months for asset-level disclosure because many securitizers are unprepared for these requirements and
this timeframe would also allow smaller originators and servicers to examine the feasibility of converting
their platforms to comply with the disclosure requirements.

See letter from ASF I.

See letters from J.P. Morgan I (suggesting an 18-month implementation period following the effective date
of the rule without specifying whether the recommended timeframe should apply to all of the rules or just
the new asset-level requirements), MBA I (with respect to RMBS) (suggesting 18 months will ensure more
compliance and smoother transition), SIFMA I, and Wells Fargo I (suggesting a 12-month implementation
period followed by a six-month test period).

These commenters suggested a range of possible solutions, including a full exemption, 1376 a
multi-year phase-in, 1377 and an exemption to the extent that information called for under those
rules with respect to legacy loans is unknown and not available to the issuer without
unreasonable effort or expense. 1378 However, investor members of one trade association
suggested that any grandfathering period for assets originated prior to the compliance date
should be limited to an additional one year after the compliance date. 1379
Some commenters also recommended allowing exemptions or “deferrals” from the
reporting requirements for data that they were unable to start collecting within the
implementation timeframe. 1380 One commenter also stated that it was important that the
Commission provide the public with the “the detailed file layout that is necessary with XML”

assets that may not be able to satisfy all of the disclosure requirements based on a Rule 409 type standard).

unreasonable effort or expense), Citi, and J.P. Morgan I (suggesting that we provide a bright-line test for
compliance based on the origination date of the related asset, or allow as an acceptable response to the data
points an indication that certain data fields for such asset are unavailable, accompanied by an explanation
of why the data is not available and whether it will be available in the future). See also letters from ASF II
and J.P. Morgan II.

See letter from SIFMA I (expressed views of investors only).

1380

See letters from ASF I (suggesting that some cases will exist where compliance cannot be accomplished
within the implementation timeframe and in those cases, issuers should be able to apply for a hardship
exemption and be granted additional time to comply as needed on a case-by-case basis, or on a “class of
transactions” basis, where the class might be defined by any number of common characteristics (e.g.,
common depositor, sponsor or other transaction party, asset type or transaction structure)) and BoA I
(suggesting we allow issuers to report exceptions or deferrals in cases where responses to non-crucial data
points cannot be provided in the exact manner contemplated by the proposed rule to ease transition
concerns and indicating that this is consistent with Regulation AB, which permits concessions when data
requests require significant cost or effort).

481

when the final rule is adopted so that market participants can begin programming their systems
and that any delay in receiving this information will greatly affect the industry’s ability to
comply in a timely manner. 1381
As we noted earlier, we believe that, in order for investors to have access to robust
information concerning the pool assets, asset-level disclosure needs to be provided. We
understand that some of the disclosures that we are requiring are not currently captured by
originators or servicers and that it will take time and resources to reprogram systems and
processes to capture the data and then report it in XML. We also understand that issuers and
market participants are working to implement many different regulations that have recently been
adopted. Therefore, we have decided to delay the compliance date for the asset-level disclosure
requirements so that market participants will have ample time to prepare and satisfy the new
requirements. In this regard, issuers will be required to provide asset-level information no later
than two years after the effective date of the rules, which we believe is a reasonable
implementation timeframe. We believe the extended timeframe will ultimately benefit investors
because it will give issuers and market participants the time to plan for and implement
appropriate reporting processes and more meaningful and relevant disclosure documents. In
addition, as discussed in Section III.A.2.b.5 Resecuritizations, we are adopting an exemption for
resecuritizations of ABS issued prior to two years after the effective date of the rules, the
compliance date for the asset-level disclosure requirements.

We also understand that certain changes to issuers’ and market participants’ systems may
not be able to occur until the final technical requirements are published in the EDGAR Filer
Manual and EDGAR Technical Specification documents. In order to provide issuers and other
filers time to make adjustments to their systems, we anticipate making a draft of the EDGAR
Technical Specification documents 1382 available soon.
We also note that at least one commenter requested a test period. We believe that
submissions may assist both the Commission and issuers with addressing unknown and
unforeseeable issues that may arise with the submission of the asset-level disclosures. 1383 We
will permit issuers to file test submissions during the transition period.
We are not adopting a commenter’s suggestion that we adopt a hardship exemption from
the reporting requirements for those issuers that may be unable to start collecting by the
implementation timeframe. We believe that our timeframe provides ample time for the
necessary reprogramming of systems and processes to capture the information, including for
smaller originators.

Paperwork Reduction Act
A.

Background

Certain provisions of the new rules and rule amendments contain “collection of
information” requirements within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995
(“PRA”). 1384 We published a notice requesting comment on the collection of information
requirements in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release and the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release, and
we submitted these requirements to the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) for review
in accordance with the PRA. 1385

An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to comply with, a
collection of information unless it displays a currently valid control number. The titles for the
collections of information are:
(1)

“Form S-1” (OMB Control No. 3235-0065);

(2)

“Form S-3” (OMB Control No. 3235-0073);

(3)

“Form 10-K” (OMB Control No. 3235-0063);

(4)

“Form 10-D” (OMB Control No. 3235-0604);

(5)

“Form 8-K” (OMB Control No. 3235-0060);

(6)

“Regulation S-K” (OMB Control No. 3235-0071);

(7)

“Regulation S-T” (OMB Control No. 3235-0424);

(8)

“Form SF-1” (OMB Control No. 3235-0707);

(9)

“Form SF-3” (OMB Control No. 3235-0690); and

(10)

“Form ABS-EE” (OMB Control No. 3235-0706).

The forms listed in Nos. 1 through 7 were adopted under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and set forth the disclosure requirements for registration statements and periodic
and current reports filed with respect to asset-backed securities and other types of securities to
inform investors. Regulation S-K, which includes the item requirements in Regulation AB,
contains the requirements for disclosure that an issuer must provide in filings under both the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Regulation S-T specifies the requirements that govern the
submission of electronic documents.
The regulations and forms listed in Nos. 8 through 10 are new collections of information
under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Form SF-1 and Form SF-3 represent the new
485

registration forms for offerings of asset-backed securities, as defined in Item 1101(c) of
Regulation AB. Form SF-3 represents the registration form for asset-backed offerings that meet
certain shelf eligibility conditions and can be offered off a shelf under Rule 415. Form SF-1
represents the registration form for other asset-backed offerings. Form ABS-EE 1386 is a new
form for the filing of certain asset-level information required in connection with registration
statements and periodic reports for asset-backed issuers. Under the requirements, an assetbacked issuer is required to submit to the Commission specified, tagged information on assets in
the pool underlying the securities.
The hours and costs associated with preparing disclosure, filing forms, and retaining
records constitute reporting and cost burdens imposed by the collections of information.
Compliance with the rule amendments is mandatory. Responses to the information collection
will not be kept confidential, and there is no mandatory retention period for the information
disclosed.

Summary of Comment Letters on the PRA Analysis

In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release and the 2011 ABS Re-Proposing Release, we
requested comment on the PRA analysis. While many commenters provided qualitative
comments on the possible costs of the proposed rules and amendments, we received limited
quantitative comments on our PRA analysis. The only quantitative comment we received on
asset-level disclosure came from a commenter representing a group of Auto ABS sponsors. This

1386

We proposed this new collection of information in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release under the title “Asset
Level Data.” We have revised the title of this collection of information to reflect the location of the assetlevel data requirements under the final rule.

486

commenter estimated that, if we adopted each of the Auto ABS data points originally proposed,
the average costs and employee hours per sponsor necessary to comply with the asset-level
requirements would be approximately $2 million and 12,000 hours, respectively. 1387 This
commenter also noted that if we adopted the reduced number of data points proposed in their
comment letter, the burden would decrease to $750,000 and 3,500 hours.
We received only one comment letter with quantitative comments on the additional
burden to complete Form SF-3. 1388 This commenter believed that our 100 burden hour estimate
for asset-backed issuers to complete the disclosure requirements for Form SF-3, prepare the
information, and file it with the Commission is “inadequate” and “not realistic.” This
commenter stated that at least 100 burden hours should be separately allocated to certain of the
shelf transaction requirements, including the certification provision, the asset review provision,
and the dispute resolution provision. The commenter noted that there would be an increased
burden of at least 100 hours for the certification requirement because the certifying officer would
likely need to rely on an independent evaluator or hire an additional executive officer with the
expertise necessary in order to provide the certification. The commenter also noted that there
will be additional burden in retaining a reviewer and its counsel to comply with the asset review

1387

See letter from VABSS IV. As the commenter noted, the sponsors “estimated the costs and employee
hours necessary to reprogram systems and business procedures to capture, track and report all of the items
for auto loans currently set forth in the [2010 ABS Proposing Release].” We assume that these costs and
burden hours include the costs and burden hours associated with providing information at the time the ABS
is issued as well as on an ongoing basis, as was contemplated in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release.

1388

See letter from Kutak.

487

provision. Finally, the commenter stated that the dispute resolution provision alone could exceed
our 100 burden hour estimate without providing any quantitative analysis.
Qualitative comments that we received generally noted that the new data collection
requirements will impose additional burdens on issuers and sponsors. For example, we received
several qualitative comments noting that the proposal would likely impose burdens on sponsors
by requiring them to collect, capture, maintain, evaluate and report data in new or different
ways. 1389
C.

Revisions to Proposals

We considered all of the comments we received, as we considered how to quantify and
possibly mitigate the burdens that could potentially be imposed by the new requirements. In
order to address commenters’ concerns about the asset-level requirements for Auto ABS, we
have significantly reduced the scope of the asset-level data required from the proposal.
For the new shelf eligibility criteria, we have made several changes to address cost
concerns – for example, we revised the certification to indicate that the certification is not a
guarantee about the future performance of the assets and have clarified that the certifying officer
has any and all defenses available under the securities laws. We also note, in response to one
commenter’s concern discussed above, 1390 that we do not believe that an additional executive
officer or independent evaluator will need to be hired as a result of the new rules to actually
structure the transaction because the certifying officer may rely on senior officers under his or

1389

See, e.g., letters from ABA I, J.P. Morgan II, MBA II, and Wells Fargo I.

1390

See letter from Kutak.

488

her supervision that may be more familiar with the structuring of the transaction. We do expect,
however, that the certifying officer will provide appropriate oversight over the transaction,
including supervision of the structuring, so that he or she is able to make the certification.
Finally, we believe that providing the certification should not impose any additional significant
burden in terms of preparing additional disclosure, as such burden is already accounted for in the
preparation of prospectus disclosure that is part of the Form SF-3 registration statement.
We acknowledge that the asset review provision will impose an upfront cost on the
transaction since we are requiring that the reviewer be named in the prospectus. We believe,
however, that most of the costs will be incurred in connection with reviews, which will occur
during the life of the securitization only if the triggering events have been met. Consequently, if
the reviewer does not perform any reviews, then the costs will be limited to the retainer fee.
Recognizing that the bulk of the cost will be incurred with the actual reviews, we have attempted
to reduce the burden of ongoing compliance with this shelf transaction requirement by requiring
that a delinquency threshold must first be reached or exceeded before investors will be able to
vote for a review. Disclosure is required in a Form 10-D only if a review is triggered.
We do not agree with a commenter that the dispute resolution provision could exceed the
100 burden hour estimate to collect the information. Under the final rules, a dispute resolution
provision is required in the pooling and servicing agreement and disclosure of that provision is
required in the prospectus. We acknowledge that additional costs may be incurred as a result of
the number of hours that will be expended by certain personnel, including counsel, to come to a
resolution if a dispute occurs. Because we are not requiring additional disclosures about the
dispute resolution provision, we are not increasing our burden estimates. Accordingly, while we
489

recognize that the new shelf conditions will impose additional costs on issuers, these costs are
not primarily disclosure or record keeping burdens. Thus, we do not believe that we need to
increase the 100 burden hour estimate to complete and file Form SF-3.
We have also made a number of changes in response to more general qualitative
comments in an effort to avoid potential unintended consequences and reduce potential
additional costs or burdens identified by commenters. For example, for the asset-level
requirements, we have attempted to reduce burden and cost concerns by aligning the
requirements with industry standards where feasible. We have also revised how we are
calculating the burden hours and costs for data collection to more accurately reflect how data
will be captured and organized in the industry, as described by commenters. Further, we are
providing for an extended implementation timeframe, which we also believe will reduce the
burden of implementing the requirements.

PRA Reporting and Cost Burden Estimates

Our PRA burden estimate for each of the existing collections of information, except for
Form 10-D, are based on an average of the time and cost incurred by all types of public
companies, not just asset-backed issuers, to prepare a particular collection of information. Form
10-D is a form that is prepared and filed only by asset-backed issuers. In 2004, we codified
requirements for asset-backed issuers in these regulations and forms, recognizing that the
information relevant to asset-backed securities differs substantially from that relevant to other
securities.
Our PRA burden estimates for the new rules and rule amendments are based on
information that we receive on entities assigned to Standard Industrial Classification Code 6189,
490

the code used for asset-backed securities, as well as information from outside data sources. 1391
When possible, we base our estimates on an average of the data that we have available for years
2004 through 2013. 1392 In some cases, our estimates for the number of asset-backed issuers that
file Form 10-D with the Commission are based on an average of the number of ABS offerings
from 2006 through 2013. 1393
1.

Form ABS-EE

The asset-level reporting requirement that we are adopting for issuances of certain ABS
is a new collection of information. 1394 As proposed, under the new rules the asset-level
information will be provided at the time the ABS is issued and on an ongoing basis. The rules
also require the information be filed as an exhibit to new Form ABS-EE.

1391

In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we relied on the AB Alert database for the initial terms of offerings
and supplemented that data with information from the Securities Data Corporation (SDC). In this release,
outside databases referenced in this section include the AB Alert and CM Alert databases for the initial
terms of offerings.

1392

We selected this time period in order to account for the market disruption caused by the financial crisis by
using data that captures both pre-crisis and post-crisis filings.

1393

Form 10-D was not implemented until 2006. Before implementation of Form 10-D, asset-backed issuers
often filed their distribution reports under cover of Form 8-K.

1394

We proposed this new collection of information in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release under the title “Asset
Level Data.” We are revising the title to reflect that the asset-level information will be filed as an exhibit to
new Form ABS-EE. Also, the proposed requirements would have required asset-level data across all asset
types, except for credit card receivables ABS and stranded costs ABS. We proposed that credit card ABS
issuers would be required to provide grouped account data, both at the time of securitization and on an
ongoing basis. The rules we are adopting at this time, however, only require asset-level data for ABS
where the underlying assets consist of residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, auto loans or auto
leases, resecuritizations of ABS, or of debt securities. Also, we are not adopting at this time the proposed
requirement that credit card ABS issuers provide grouped account data. Because of the number of data
points involved, our estimates for the asset-level requirements in the proposal were based on data for
RMBS, CMBS and credit card ABS issuers. In line with the requirements we are adopting, we have
revised our burden hour estimate to base the estimate on the hours that sponsors of RMBS, CMBS, Auto
ABS, debt security ABS or resecuritizations may incur to provide the required data.

491

Our estimates in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release were based on the costs to provide
the required data at the time of securitization and on an ongoing basis. We estimated that each
unique sponsor 1395 would incur a one-time setup cost for the initial filing of asset-level data. 1396
Software costs and costs associated with adjusting existing systems in order to provide the data
are included in the one-time setup costs. The burden estimate also included costs associated with
tagging the data and filing it with the Commission. After the first filing of asset-level

1395

In the proposal, we estimated that the number of unique ABS sponsors from 2004 to 2009 was 343, for an
average of 57 unique sponsors per year. We have updated our estimate of the total number of unique
sponsors among the relevant assets classes. Based on our updated estimate, we estimate 60 as the average
number of unique sponsors of registered ABS subject to the rules we are adopting per year (23 RMBS
sponsors, 25 CMBS sponsors, 20 Auto ABS sponsors, two debt security ABS sponsors, and one
resecuritization sponsor (the total of these numbers for all asset classes is greater than the 60 unique
sponsors estimate due to the fact that a single sponsor often sponsors ABS from different asset classes).
For purposes of our updated estimate, the average annual number of unique sponsors for RMBS, CMBS
and Auto ABS is based on data from outside databases for the period of 2004 through 2013. See footnote
1391. We believe the time period selected provides a conservative estimate of the average annual number
of unique sponsors for these asset classes as the 2004 through 2013 timeframe captures both the time period
prior to the financial crisis when there was a larger number of unique ABS sponsors per year and the more
recent time period when the number of unique sponsors per year has been substantially lower. For debt
security ABS and resecuritizations, we were unable to obtain from outside databases the average annual
number of unique debt security ABS or resecuritization sponsors. Based on data available through
EDGAR for the period of 2010 to 2013, we estimate that for each year there will be two unique debt
security ABS sponsors. There have been no registered resecuritization offerings over the past several
years. We assume for this estimate, however, that for each year there will be at least one unique
resecuritization sponsor.

1396

Under the proposal, the asset-level information outlined in proposed Schedule L would be required at the
time of issuance. On an ongoing basis, the asset-level information outlined in proposed Schedule L-D
would be required. Under the final rules, we are condensing these schedules into one schedule titled
Schedule AL. See Section III.B.2 The Scope of New Schedule AL. The burden estimate in the proposal
provided an estimate for the one-time burden cost for issuers to provide the asset-level disclosures required
at issuance and a separate estimate for the one-time burden cost for issuers to provide the ongoing
disclosures. For purposes of our updated estimate and in line with the condensed schedule format we are
adopting, we combined the estimates for one-time setup costs into one calculation. This change resulted in
a substantially lower estimate of average annual burden hours for filing asset-level data on an ongoing
basis, but a higher amount of professional costs associated with the first filing of asset-level data at
issuance.

492

information, we estimated that sponsors would incur costs to provide the required data with
subsequent offerings of ABS and with each Form 10-D.
Some comments on the asset-level proposal suggested that sponsors would incur
substantial costs to capture the required data and to provide it in the format requested. 1397 We
continue to assume that asset-backed issuers currently required by Regulation AB to file poollevel information on the assets in the underlying pool have access to a substantial portion of the
required asset-level information, although we acknowledge that sponsors may incur additional
costs to provide the data currently collected in the format required by the rules we are adopting.
We recognize that some of the required data is not currently collected by sponsors and that
sponsors will incur costs to capture and provide some of the required data in the format
requested.
To address concerns about the costs to provide the data, we revised our calculation of the
estimated number of burden hours a sponsor may incur to acknowledge that a sponsor may need
to revise its existing systems or procedures for each required data point. The burden estimate in
the proposal assumed that approximately two percent of the proposed asset-level data points
would require a sponsor to adjust its existing systems and procedures for capturing and reporting
data. For each data point that required the sponsor to adjust its existing systems and procedures,
a sponsor would expend at least 18 minutes per adjustment for each asset in the pool. We have
revised our estimate to assume that before the first filing of asset-level information a sponsor will

1397

See, e.g., letters from ABA I, ABAASA I, SIFMA I (expressed views of dealer and sponsors only), and
VABSS I.

493

need to adjust its existing systems and procedures in some way for each required data point in
order to provide the response to the data point based on our definitions and that each adjustment
will require ten hours. 1398
The burden estimate in the proposal for the initial filing of asset-level data included ten
hours to tag and file the data with the Commission. 1399 We continue to believe that a sponsor
will incur approximately ten hours to tag, review and file the required data the first time the
sponsor files the asset-level data to comply with our rules. Based on comments received raising
concerns about the burden to provide the asset-level data in XML, we are also estimating that
each sponsor will also expend approximately 10 hours per data point in order to adjust its
systems to be able to provide the data in XML with the first filing of asset-level data. 1400 Based
on the asset-level requirements applicable to each asset class and our estimates for the XML
conversion costs and filing costs, we estimate that each RMBS sponsor will incur 5,410 hours,

1398

For instance, the requirements for RMBS include 270 data points, and we estimate that for each of these
270 data points a sponsor will need to adjust its systems and procedures in some way and that each
adjustment will require ten hours. In the proposal, our calculation considered the number of assets in each
pool. Since we continue to assume that a sponsor will need to make a one-time change to its existing
systems and procedures before the first filing of asset-level information, the number of assets in the pool is
less relevant because the revisions to a sponsor’s existing systems and procedures will be completed before
it provides asset-level data for any ABS. The revised estimate focuses on the changes each required data
point will cause to a sponsor’s existing systems and procedures before it must provide asset-level
information.

1399

See the 2010 ABS Proposing Release at 23404.

1400

The estimated per hour cost to convert the required data into an XML format is based on the estimate of the
cost to provide the required asset-level data in XML provided in Section III.B.3. See footnote 748. For
purposes of that estimate, we assumed that a sponsor would work with all asset types and would need to
convert the data for all asset classes into an XML format and that conversion would require 6,283 hours.
With a combined 680 unique data points (RMBS = 270, CMBS = 152, Auto ABS = 138, debt security ABS
= 60 and resecuritizations = 60), we estimate that responding to each data point in XML for the first time
will require approximately 10 hours per data point.

494

each CMBS sponsor will incur 3,050 hours, each Auto ABS sponsor will incur 2,770 hours and
each debt security ABS sponsor or resecuritization sponsor will incur 1,210 hours 1401 in one-time
setup costs and to provide the asset-level data for the first time. 1402 Based on the average number
of unique sponsors in each asset class, we estimate that the total burden estimate for the initial
filing of asset-level data, including the one-time setup cost to be 259,711 hours. 1403 We allocate
25% of those hours (64,928) to internal burden hours and 75% of the hours (194,783) to out-ofpocket expenses for software consulting and filing agent costs at a rate of $250 per hour for a
total cost of $48,695,625.
After a sponsor has made an initial filing of asset-level data, we estimate that each
subsequent filing of asset-level data will take approximately 10 hours to prepare, review, tag and

1401

For each resecuritization, the asset pool is comprised of one or more ABS. The final rules require
disclosures about the ABS in the pool, and if the ABS in the asset pool is an RMBS, CMBS or Auto ABS,
issuers are also required to provide asset-level disclosures about the assets underlying the ABS. For
purposes of this estimate, the one-time setup costs for resecuritizations is based on the number of data
points each resecuritization sponsor must respond to for each ABS in the pool. Our estimate for the onetime setup cost for providing asset-level data for resecuritizations does not include the cost to provide assetlevel data if the ABS in the pool is an RMBS, CMBS or Auto ABS since these one-time setup costs are
already included in the one-time setup estimates for RMBS, CMBS and Auto ABS and sponsors of
resecuritizations may be able to reference asset-level information about the assets underlying the securities
in the pool.

1402

In the 2010 ABS Proposal, we estimated that an RMBS sponsor would incur a total of 7,005 hours (3,194
hours for the data required at securitization and 3,811 hours for the data required on an ongoing basis), and
a CMBS sponsor would incur a total of 178 hours (86 hours for the data required at securitization and 92
hours for the data required on an ongoing basis). See the 2010 ABS Proposing Release at 23404.

1403

The burden estimate in the proposal estimated the total annual burden hours for preparing, tagging and
filing asset-level disclosure at the time of securitization for all ABS issuers to be 151,368 with 25% of
those hours allocated to internal burden costs and 75% of those hours allocated to external burden hours.
For a description of the factors that contributed to differences between the proposed and final estimates see
footnotes 1396 and 1407.

495

file the information. Based on the number of offerings after the first filing of asset-level data 1404
and the number of Form 10-D filings per year, 1405 we estimate the average annual hours to
prepare and file asset-level disclosure after the first filing of asset-level data will be 140,215
hours. 1406 We allocate 75% of those hours (105,161) to internal burden hours and 25% of the
hours (35,054) to out-of-pocket expenses for software consulting and filing agent costs at a rate
of $250 per hour totaling $8,763,438. Thus, we estimate the total annual burden hours for the

1404

The burden estimate in the proposal estimated the average number of offerings for all asset classes to be
958 per year. For purposes of comparison, we have adjusted the average number of offerings from 958 to
629 to account for the fact that we are adopting asset-level requirements for fewer asset classes than we had
proposed. For purposes of this burden estimate because we are adopting requirements only for certain asset
classes, we estimate there will be an average of 431 registered ABS offerings per year (RMBS = 343,
CMBS = 33, Auto ABS = 51, debt security ABS and resecuritizations = 4). For purposes of this estimate,
the average annual number of registered RMBS, CMBS and Auto ABS offerings is based on data from
outside databases for the period of 2004 through 2013. We believe the time period selected provides a
conservative estimate of the average annual number of registered offerings for these asset classes as the
2004-2013 timeframe captures both the time prior to the financial crisis when there was a larger number of
registered ABS offerings per year and the more recent time period when the number of registered ABS
offerings per year has been substantially lower. For debt security ABS and resecuritizations, we are unable
to obtain from outside databases the average annual number of registered offerings of debt security ABS or
resecuritizations between 2004 and 2013. Based on data available through EDGAR for the period of 2010
to 2013, we estimate there will be three registered debt security ABS offerings per year. There have been
no registered resecuritization offerings over the past several years. We assume for this estimate, however,
that each year there will be at least one registered resecuritization offering.

1405

For purposes of estimating the number of expected Form 10-D filings, we are using the actual average
annual number of Form 10-D filings, which was 13,014. We apportioned the burden of Form 10-D filings
across each asset class based on the average number of offerings per year for each asset class. We believe
this results in a conservative estimate because the rules we are adopting do not require that all asset classes
provide asset-level disclosure and therefore not every Form 10-D filed will include asset-level data.

1406

We estimated in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release that the average annual burden hours to provide the
asset-level data with Form 10-D on an ongoing basis would be 207,009 hours for all ABS issuers with 75%
of those hours allocated to internal burden hours and 25% allocated to external burden hours. The final
estimate reflects the cost of ongoing maintenance for XML, which we estimated to be 5% of the initial
XML conversion costs. For a description of the factors that contributed to differences between the
proposed and final estimate and the proposed estimate see footnotes 1396 and 1407.

496

asset-level disclosure requirements at 170,089 hours 1407 and the total amount of out-of-pocket
expenses for software and filing agent costs at $57,459,063. 1408

Form S-3 and Form SF-3

Our current PRA burden estimate for Form S-3 is 136,392 annual burden hours. This
estimate is based on the assumption that most disclosures required of the issuer are incorporated
by reference from separately filed Exchange Act reports. However, because an Exchange Act
reporting history is not a condition for Form S-3 eligibility for ABS, asset-backed issuers using
Form S-3 often must present all of the relevant disclosure in the registration statement rather than
incorporate relevant disclosure by reference. Thus, our current burden estimate for asset-backed
issuers using Form S-3 under existing requirements is similar to our current burden estimate for
asset-backed issuers using Form S-1. During 2004 through 2013, we received an average of 71
Form S-3 filings annually related to asset-backed securities.
Under the rules that we are adopting, we are moving the requirements for asset-backed
issuers into new forms that will be used solely to register offerings of asset-backed securities.
New Form SF-3 is the ABS equivalent of existing Form S-3. For purposes of our calculations,
we estimate that the provisions relating to shelf eligibility will cause a 5% movement in the

1407

170,089 = 64,928+105,161. The proposal estimated that the total average annual burden hours to provide
the asset-level data or grouped asset data would be 193,099 hours and the total amount of out-of-pocket
expenses for software and filing agent costs would be $41,319,571. The drop in total average annual
burden hours can be attributed to changes in the average annual number of unique RMBS sponsors and the
expected annual number of registered ABS offerings. Also, other changes to our calculation to address
comments received (e.g., XML conversion cost, system changes) and differences between the proposed
requirements and the final requirements (e.g., combining the initial and ongoing disclosure schedules into
one schedule) also impacted our estimate.

number of filers (i.e., a decrease of four registration statements) out of the shelf system due to the
new requirements, which include the certification, the asset review provision, the dispute
resolution provision, the investor communications provision, and the annual evaluations of
compliance with timely Exchange Act reporting and timely filing of the transaction agreements
and the related certifications. 1409 On the other hand, we estimate the number of shelf registration
statements for asset-backed issuers will increase by four as a result of the amendments
eliminating the practice of providing a base prospectus and a prospectus supplement for ABS
offerings. 1410 Thus, we estimate that the annual number of shelf registration statements
concerning ABS offerings will remain the same. Accordingly, since the rule amendments will
shift all shelf-eligible ABS filings from Form S-3 to Form SF-3, we estimate that the
amendments will cause a decrease of 71 ABS filings on Form S-3 and a corresponding increase
of 71 ABS filings on Form SF-3 filed annually. 1411
In 2004, we estimated that an asset-backed issuer, under the 2004 amendments to Form
S-3, would take an average of 1,250 hours to prepare a Form S-3 to register ABS. 1412
Additionally, in the January 2011 ABS Issuer Review Release, we estimated that the

1409

We calculated the decrease of four Form SF-3s by multiplying the average number of Form S-3s filed (71)
by 5%.

1410

Based on staff reviews, we believe that it is unusual to see ABS registration statements with multiple
unrelated collateral types such as auto loans and student loans. There are occasionally multiple related
collateral types such as HELOCs, subprime mortgages and Alt-A mortgages in ABS registration
statements.

1411

This is based on the number of registration statements for asset-backed issuers currently filed on Form S-3
and the new shelf eligibility requirements.

1412

See the 2004 ABS Adopting Release.

498

requirements described in that release would increase the annual incremental burden to assetbacked issuers by 30 hours per form. 1413 For registration statements, we estimate that 25% of the
burden of preparation is carried by the company internally and that 75% of the burden is carried
by outside professionals retained by the registrant at an average cost of $400 per hour.
We are also adopting additional disclosure requirements that will impose some additional
costs to asset-backed issuers with respect to registration statements, which we have included as
part of our burden estimate for Form SF-3. We do not believe, however, that the shelf eligibility
requirements that we are adopting will substantially increase the burden hours of filing a Form
SF-3 since they generally do not impose significant new disclosure or record-keeping
obligations. 1414 We note that we have added a disclosure component to the asset review
provision to require information about the reasonableness of the delinquency trigger selected by
the transaction parties. We did not increase the total burden hours for this additional disclosure
because the additional burden to provide this information should be minimal since issuers
already have the required information.
We estimate that the incremental burden for asset-backed issuers to complete the
additional disclosure requirements for Form SF-3, prepare the information, and file it with the
Commission will be 100 burden hours per response on Form SF-3. As a result, we estimate that

1413

See the 2011 ABS Issuer Review Adopting Release.

1414

In connection with the new shelf eligibility requirements, we are adopting a number of ongoing disclosure
requirements that will be triggered at the time a particular provision (e.g., the asset review or investor
communications provision) is invoked. As discussed below, the burden of these additional disclosure
requirements is reflected in the revised burden estimate for Form 10-D.

499

each Form SF-3 will take approximately 1,380 hours to complete and file. 1415 We estimate the
total internal burden for Form SF-3 to be 24,495 hours and the total related professional costs to
be $29,394,000. 1416 This would result in a corresponding decrease in Form S-3 burden hours of
22,720 and $27,264,000 in professional costs. 1417
3.

Form S-1 and Form SF-1

New Form SF-1 is the ABS equivalent of existing Form S-1. As noted above, for
purposes of our calculation, we estimate that the new requirements for shelf eligibility and new
shelf procedures will cause some movement in the number of filers from the shelf system to the
non-shelf system. For purposes of the PRA, we estimate four asset-backed issuers will move
from the shelf system to the non-shelf system of Form SF-1. 1418 From 2004 through 2013, an
average of two Forms S-1 were filed annually by asset-backed issuers. Correspondingly, we

1415

The total burden hours to file Form SF-3 are calculated by adding the existing burden hours of 1,280 that
we estimate for Form S-3 and the incremental burden of 100 hours imposed by our new requirements for a
total of 1,380 total burden hours.

1416

To calculate these values, we first multiply the total burden hours per Form SF-3 (1,380) by the number of
Forms SF-3 expected under the new requirements (71), resulting in 97,980 total burden hours. Then, we
allocate 25% of those hours to internal burden, resulting in 24,495 hours. We allocate the remaining 75%
of the total burden hours to related professional costs and use a rate of $400 per hour to calculate the
external professional costs of $29,394,000.

1417

To calculate these values, we first multiply the total burden hours per Form S-3 (1,280) by the average
number of Forms S-3 over the period 2004-2013 (71), resulting in 90,880 total burden hours. Then, we
allocate 25% of these hours to internal burden, resulting in 22,720 hours. We allocate the remaining 75%
of the total burden hours to related professional costs and use a rate of $400 per hour to calculate the
external professional costs of $27,264,000.

1418

We estimate in the section above that the requirements relating to shelf eligibility and new shelf procedures
will cause a 5% movement in the number of ABS filers out of the shelf system. We assume, for the
purposes of our PRA estimates, that the other filers that do not move to Form SF-1 will utilize unregistered
offerings or offshore offerings for offerings of ABS.

500

estimate that the number of filings on Form SF-1 will be six, which is the sum of the two average
filings per year and the estimated incremental four filings from shelf to Form SF-1.
For ABS filings on Form S-1, we have used the same estimate of burden per response
that we used for Form S-3, because the disclosures in both filings are similar. 1419 Even under the
new requirements, the disclosures will continue to be similar for shelf registration statements and
non-shelf registration statements. The burden for the new requirements for the Asset Data File to
be filed as an exhibit to Forms SF-1 and SF-3 is included in the new Form ABS-EE collection of
information discussed above. Thus, we estimate that an ABS Form SF-1 filing will impose an
incremental burden of 100 hours per response, which is equal to the incremental burden to file
Form SF-3. We estimate the total number of hours to prepare and file each Form SF-1 to be
1,380, the total annual burden to be 2,070 hours and added costs for professional expenses to be
$2,484,000. 1420 This will result in a corresponding decrease in Form S-1 burden hours of 640
and $768,000 in professional costs. 1421

1419

See Section IV.B.2 of the 2004 ABS Proposing Release.

1420

The total burden hours to file Form SF-1 are calculated by adding the existing burden hours of 1,280 and
the incremental burden of 100 hours imposed by the new requirements for total of 1,380 hours. To
calculate the annual internal and external costs, we first multiply the total burden hours per Form SF-1
(1,380) by the number of Forms SF-1 expected under the new requirements (six), resulting in 8,280 total
burden hours. Then, we allocate 25% of these hours to internal burden, resulting in 2,070 hours. We
allocate the remaining 75% of the total burden hours to related professional costs and use a rate of $400 per
hour to calculate the external professional costs of $2,484,000.

1421

To calculate these values, we first multiply the total burden hours per Form S-1 (1,280) by the average
number of Form S-1s filed during 2004-2013 (two), resulting in 2,560 total burden hours. Then, we
allocate 25% of these hours to internal burden, resulting in 640 hours. We allocate the remaining 75% of
the total burden hours to related professional costs and use a rate of $400 per hour to calculate the external
professional costs of $768,000.

501

4.

Form 10-K

The ongoing periodic and current reporting requirements applicable to operating
companies differ substantially from the reporting that is most relevant to investors in assetbacked securities. For asset-backed issuers, in addition to a specified set of Form 10-K
disclosure items, the issuer must file a servicer compliance statement, a servicer’s assessment of
compliance with servicing criteria, and an attestation of an independent public accountant as
exhibits to the Form 10-K. In 2004, we estimated that 120 hours would be needed to complete
and file a Form 10-K for an asset-backed issuer. We believe that our revisions related to the
disclosure requirements for material instances of noncompliance will cause an increase in the
number of hours incurred to prepare, review, and file Form 10-K by five hours. We estimate
that, for Exchange Act reports, 75% of the burden of preparation is carried by the company
internally and that 25% of the burden is carried by outside professionals retained by the
registrant at an average rate of $400 per hour. We also estimate that 1,046 Form 10-K filings for
asset-backed issuers are filed per year, based on the average number of Forms 10-K filed over
the period 2004-2013. Therefore, we estimate for PRA purposes that the increase in total annual
number of hours to prepare, review, and file Form 10-K for asset-backed issuers will be 5,230
hours. 1422 We allocate 75% of those hours (3,923) to internal burden and the remaining 25% to
external costs totaling $523,000 using a rate of $400 per hour.

1422

To calculate the annual internal and external costs, we first multiply the incremental burden of five hours
imposed by the new requirements by the number of Forms 10-K (1,046), resulting in an increase of 5,230
burden hours.

502

5.

Form 10-D

In 2004, we adopted Form 10-D as a new form for only asset-backed issuers. This form
is filed within 15 days of each required distribution date on the asset-backed securities, as
specified in the governing documents for such securities. The form contains periodic distribution
and pool performance information.
In 2004, we estimated that it would take 30 hours to complete and file Form 10-D. 1423
We also estimate that 13,014 Form 10-D filings are filed per year based on current annual
responses. 1424 As discussed above, we are adopting asset-level disclosure requirements that
relate to ongoing performance of the assets to be filed at the same time as Form 10-D; the burden
of this requirement is included in our estimate of the asset-level disclosure collection of
information requirements. We estimate that the new Regulation AB disclosure requirements that
will be included in Form 10-D related to the asset review (Item 1121(d)), investor
communications (Item 1121(e)), and material changes to the sponsor’s interest in the transaction
(Item 1124) will result in an additional burden of five hours for Items 1121(d) & (e), plus two
hours for Item 1124 per filing to prepare. Therefore, we estimate that the new requirements will
increase the number of hours to prepare, review, and file a Form 10-D to 37 hours, thereby

1423

See the 2004 ABS Adopting Release.

1424

To calculate current annual responses, we used the average number of respondents that filed Form 10-Ds
between 2011 and 2013, which was 2,169. We then multiplied the average number of respondents (2,169)
by the average number of times that a respondent would file a Form 10-D per year (6) for a total of 13,014
Form 10-Ds per year. Different types of asset-backed securities have different distribution periods, and the
Form 10-D is filed for each distribution period. We derived the multiplier of six by comparing the number
of Forms 10-D that have been filed since 2006 with the number of Forms 10-K (which are only required to
be filed once a year) that have been filed.

503

increasing the total burden hours for all Form 10-Ds filed annually to 481,518 hours. We
allocate 75% of those hours (361,139) to internal burden and the remaining 25% to external costs
totaling $48,151,800 using a rating of $400 per hour.
6.

Form 8-K

Our current PRA estimate for Form 8-K is based on the use of the report to disclose the
occurrence of certain defined reportable events, some of which are applicable to asset-backed
securities. In the 2010 ABS Proposing Release, we noted three portions of the proposal which
would cause an increase in the number of reports on Form 8-K for ABS issuers; however, we are
not adopting any of those proposed requirements. 1425 We are amending Form 8-K to include a
specific item number under which static pool information that is filed on Form 8-K must be
reported. This amendment will assist investors in locating static pool information that is
incorporated by reference into the prospectus. Because the static pool requirement is included in
the existing burden estimate for Form S-3, which we are transferring to the new Form SF-3, we
are not assigning any additional burden hours to the Form 8-K for this new requirement.
7.

Regulation S-K and Regulation S-T

Regulation S-K, which includes the item requirements in Regulation AB, contains the
requirements for disclosure that an issuer must provide in filings under both the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act. As noted above, Regulation S-T contains the requirements that govern
the electronic submission of documents.

1425

See Section X.B.5. of the 2010 ABS Proposing Release.

504

The new rules and rule amendments that we are adopting will result in revisions to
Regulation S-K and Regulation S-T. The collection of information requirements, however, are
reflected in the burden hours estimated for the various Securities Act and Exchange Act forms
related to asset-backed issuers. The rules in Regulation S-K and Regulation S-T do not impose
any separate burden. Consistent with historical practice, we have retained an estimate of one
burden hour each to Regulation S-T and Regulation S-K for administrative convenience.

Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification
In Part XIV of the 2010 ABS Proposing Release and Part IX of the 2011 ABS Re-

Proposing Release, we certified pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that the new rules contained in this
release would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
One commenter provided comments in response to the Commission’s request for written
comments regarding this certification. 1427 This commenter faulted the Commission for reaching
its conclusion by “focusing exclusively on the size of the sponsors that would be required to
comply.” 1428 The commenter suggested that the analysis should extend beyond the impact on
small entities as sponsors of securitization transactions. 1429 This commenter did not suggest that
there would be a significant impact on entities directly subject to any of the rules we had
proposed. 1430 Further, the commenter did not describe the nature of any impact on small entities
or provide empirical data to support the extent of the impact. The Regulatory Flexibility Act
analysis only applies to those entities “which will be subject to the requirement[s]” of the
rule. 1431 Accordingly, based on the analysis set forth in the 2010 ABS Proposing Release and the

1427

See letter from ABA II.

1428

Id.

1429

In justifying a thorough regulatory analysis, the ABA contended, “[g]iven securitization’s pervasive role in
our economy and the importance of securitization to the availability of credit to small businesses, it is
difficult to fathom how the 2010 ABS Proposals, as revised by the Re-Proposing Release, if adopted, would
not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.”

(reasoning that because “Congress did not intend to require that every agency consider every indirect effect
that any regulation might have on small businesses in any stratum of the national economy”), Cement Kiln

prospectus under § 230.424 of this chapter] that:
511

A

A

1.

I have reviewed the prospectus relating to [title of all securities, the offer

and sale of which are registered] (the “securities”) and am familiar with, in all
material respects, the following: the characteristics of the securitized assets
underlying the offering (the “securitized assets”), the structure of the
securitization, and all material underlying transaction agreements as described in
the prospectus;
2.

Based on my knowledge, the prospectus does not contain any untrue

statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were
made, not misleading;
3.

Based on my knowledge, the prospectus and other information included in

the registration statement of which it is a part fairly present, in all material
respects, the characteristics of the securitized assets, the structure of the
securitization and the risks of ownership of the securities, including the risks
relating to the securitized assets that would affect the cash flows available to
service payments or distributions on the securities in accordance with their terms;
and
4.

Based on my knowledge, taking into account all material aspects of the

characteristics of the securitized assets, the structure of the securitization, and the
related risks as described in the prospectus, there is a reasonable basis to conclude
that the securitization is structured to produce, but is not guaranteed by this

512

certification to produce, expected cash flows at times and in amounts to service
scheduled payments of interest and the ultimate repayment of principal on the
securities (or other scheduled or required distributions on the securities, however
denominated) in accordance with their terms as described in the prospectus.
5.

The foregoing certifications are given subject to any and all defenses

available to me under the federal securities laws, including any and all defenses
available to an executive officer that signed the registration statement of which
the prospectus referred to in this certification is part.

fees (pay-as-you-go registration fees) calculated in accordance with § 230.457(s) in advance of
or in connection with an offering of securities from the registration statement at the time of filing

securities or the maximum aggregate offering price of any securities until the issuer updates the
"Calculation of Registration Fee" table to reflect payment of the registration fee, including a payas-you-go registration fee in accordance with § 230.456(c). The registration fee shall be
calculated based on the fee payment rate in effect on the date of the fee payment.

beneficial interest, underlying asset-backed securities (as defined in § 229.1101(c) of this

unit of beneficial interest shall be payable.

registration of asset-backed securities (as defined in 17 CFR 229.1101(c)) under the Securities
Act which are offered in any transaction specified in paragraph (b) of this section provided that
the requirements applicable to the specified transaction are met. Terms used have the same
meaning as in Item 1101 of Regulation AB (17 CFR 229.1101).
(a) Registrant requirements. Registrants must meet the following conditions in order to
use this Form for registration under the Securities Act of asset-backed securities offered in the
transactions specified in paragraph (b) of this section:
(1) To the extent the depositor or any issuing entity previously established, directly or
indirectly, by the depositor or any affiliate of the depositor (as defined in Item 1101 of
Regulation AB (17 CFR 229.1101)) is or was at any time during the twelve calendar months and
any portion of a month immediately preceding the filing of the registration statement on this
Form required to comply with the transaction requirements in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of
this section with respect to a previous offering of asset-backed securities involving the same
asset class, the following requirements shall apply:
(i) Such depositor and each such issuing entity must have filed on a timely basis all
certifications required by this paragraph (b)(1)(i); and
(ii) Such depositor and each such issuing entity must have filed on a timely basis all
transaction agreements containing the provisions that are required by paragraphs (b)(1)(ii)
through (iv) of this section.
(iii) If such depositor or issuing entity fails to meet the requirements of
paragraphs(a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, such depositor or issuing entity will be deemed to
641

satisfy such requirements for purposes of this Form 90 days after the date it files the information
required by paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section; provided however that if the information
is filed within 90 days of evaluating compliance with this paragraph (a) such depositor and
issuing entity will be deemed to have been in compliance with such requirements for purposes of
this Form 90 days after the date it files the information required by paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii)
of this section.
Instruction to paragraph (a)(1). The registrant must provide disclosure in a prospectus
that is part of the registration statement that it has met the registrant requirements of paragraph
(a)(1) of this section.
(2) To the extent the depositor or any issuing entity previously established, directly or
indirectly, by the depositor or any affiliate of the depositor (as defined in Item 1101 of
Regulation AB (17 CFR 229.1101)) is or was at any time during the twelve calendar months and
any portion of a month immediately preceding the filing of the registration statement on this
Form subject to the requirements of section 12 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78l or
78o(d)) with respect to a class of asset-backed securities involving the same asset class, such
depositor and each such issuing entity must have filed all material required to be filed regarding
such asset-backed securities pursuant to section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m
or 78o(d)) for such period (or such shorter period that each such entity was required to file such
materials). In addition, such material must have been filed in a timely manner, other than a
report that is required solely pursuant to Item 1.01, 1.02, 2.03, 2.04, 2.05, 2.06, 4.02(a), 6.01, or
6.03 of Form 8-K (17 CFR 249.308). If § 240.12b-25(b) of this chapter was used during such
period with respect to a report or a portion of a report, that report or portion thereof has actually
642

been filed within the time period prescribed by § 240.12b-25(b) of this chapter. Regarding an
affiliated depositor that became an affiliate as a result of a business combination transaction
during such period, the filing of any material prior to the business combination transaction
relating to asset-backed securities of an issuing entity previously established, directly or
indirectly, by such affiliated depositor is excluded from this section, provided such business
combination transaction was not part of a plan or scheme to evade the requirements of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act. See the definition of “affiliate” in § 230.405 of this chapter.

643

(2) The same party or an affiliate of any party hired by the sponsor or the underwriter to
perform pre-closing due diligence work on the pool assets;
(B) The asset representations reviewer shall have authority to access copies of any
underlying documents related to performing a review of the pool assets;
(C) The asset representations reviewer shall be responsible for reviewing the underlying
assets for compliance with the representations and warranties on the pool assets, and shall not

constitutes a breach of any contractual provision. Reviews shall be required under the
transaction documents, at a minimum, when the following conditions are met:
(1) A threshold of delinquent assets, as specified in the transaction agreements, has been
reached or exceeded; and

section are met; and
(E) The asset representations reviewer shall provide a report to the trustee of the findings
and conclusions of the review of the assets.
644

as a percentage of the aggregate dollar amount of delinquent assets in a given pool to the
aggregate dollar amount of all the assets in that particular pool, measured as of the end of the
reporting period. If the transaction has multiple sub-pools, the transaction agreements must
provide that:
1. The delinquency threshold shall be calculated with respect to each sub-pool; and
2. The investor vote calculation shall be measured as a percentage of investors’ interest in
each sub-pool.
(iii) Dispute resolution provision. With respect to each offering of securities that is
registered on this Form, the pooling and servicing agreement or other transaction agreement,
which shall be filed, must provide for the following:
(A) If an asset subject to a repurchase request, pursuant to the terms of the transaction
agreements, is not resolved by the end of a 180-day period beginning when notice of the request
is received, then the party submitting such repurchase request shall have the right to refer the
matter, at its discretion, to either mediation or third-party arbitration, and the party obligated to
repurchase must agree to the selected resolution method.
(B) If the party submitting the request elects third-party arbitration, the arbitrator shall
determine the allocation of any expenses. If the party submitting the request elects mediation,
the parties shall mutually determine the allocation of any expenses.

exercise of rights under the transaction agreements, and a description of the method other
investors may use to contact the requesting investor.
Instruction to paragraph (b)(1)(iv). If an underlying transaction agreement contains procedures
in order to verify that an investor is, in fact, a beneficial owner for purposes of invoking the
investor communication provision, the verification procedures may require no more than the
following:
1. If the investor is a record holder of the securities at the time of a request to
communicate, then the investor will not have to provide verification of ownership, and
2. If the investor is not the record holder of the securities, then the person obligated to
make the disclosure may require no more than a written certification from the investor that it is a
beneficial owner and one other form of documentation such as a trade confirmation, an account
statement, a letter from the broker or dealer, or other similar document.

leases other than motor vehicle leases, the portion of the securitized pool balance attributable to

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
I.

Eligibility Requirements for Use of Form SF-3.
This instruction sets forth registrant requirements and transaction requirements for the

use of Form SF-3. Any registrant which meets the requirements of I.A. below (“Registrant
Requirements”) may use this Form for the registration of asset-backed securities (as defined in
17 CFR 229.1101(c)) under the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) which are offered in
any transaction specified in I.B. below (“Transaction Requirements”) provided that the
requirements applicable to the specified transaction are met. Terms used in this Form have the
same meaning as in Item 1101 of Regulation AB.
A. Registrant Requirements. Registrants must meet the following conditions in order to
use this Form SF-3 for registration under the Securities Act of asset-backed securities
offered in the transactions specified in I.B. below:
1. To the extent the depositor or any issuing entity previously established, directly or
indirectly, by the depositor or any affiliate of the depositor (as defined in Item 1101
650

of Regulation AB (17 CFR 229.1101)) is or was at any time during the twelve
calendar months and any portion of a month immediately preceding the filing of the
registration statement on this Form required to comply with the transaction
requirements in General Instructions I.B.1(a), I.B.1(b), I.B.1(c), and I.B.1(d) of this
Form with respect to a previous offering of asset-backed securities involving the same
asset class, the following requirements shall apply:
(a) Such depositor and each such issuing entity must have filed on a timely basis
all certifications required by I.B.1(a);
(b) Such depositor and each such issuing entity must have filed on a timely basis
all transaction agreements containing the provisions that are required by
I.B.1(b), I.B.1(c), and I.B.1(d); and
(c) If such depositor or issuing entity fails to meet the requirements of I.A.1(a)
and I.A.1(b), such depositor or issuing entity will be deemed to satisfy such
requirements for purposes of this Form SF-3 90 days after the date it files the
information required by I.A.1(a) and I.A.1(b).
Instruction to General Instruction I.A.1: The registrant must provide disclosure in a
prospectus that is part of the registration statement that it has met the registrant
requirements of I.A.1.
2. To the extent the depositor or any issuing entity previously established, directly or
indirectly, by the depositor or any affiliate of the depositor (as defined in Item 1101
of Regulation AB (17 CFR 229.1101)) is or was at any time during the twelve
calendar months and any portion of a month immediately preceding the filing of the
651

registration statement on this Form SF-3 subject to the requirements of section 12 or
15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78l or 78o(d)) with respect to a class of assetbacked securities involving the same asset class, such depositor and each such issuing
entity must have filed all material required to be filed regarding such asset-backed
securities pursuant to section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78m or
78o(d)) for such period (or such shorter period that each such entity was required to
file such materials). In addition, such material must have been filed in a timely
manner, other than a report that is required solely pursuant to Item 1.01, 1.02, 2.03,
2.04, 2.05, 2.06, 4.02(a), 6.01, or 6.03 of Form 8-K (17 CFR 249.308). If Rule 12b25(b) (17 CFR 240.12b-25(b)) under the Exchange Act was used during such period
with respect to a report or a portion of a report, that report or portion thereof has
actually been filed within the time period prescribed by that rule. Regarding an
affiliated depositor that became an affiliate as a result of a business combination
transaction during such period, the filing of any material prior to the business
combination transaction relating to asset-backed securities of an issuing entity
previously established, directly or indirectly, by such affiliated depositor is excluded
from this section, provided such business combination transaction was not part of a
plan or scheme to evade the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.
See the definition of “affiliate” in Securities Act Rule 405 (17 CFR 230.405).
B. Transaction Requirements. If the registrant meets the Registrant Requirements
specified in I.A. above, an offering meeting the following conditions may be registered
on Form SF-3:
652

1. Asset-backed securities (as defined in 17 CFR 229.1101(c)) to be offered for cash
where the following have been satisfied:
(a) Certification. The registrant files a certification in accordance with Item

or (ii) the same party or an affiliate of any party hired by the
sponsor or the underwriter to perform pre-closing due diligence
work on the pool assets;
(B) The asset representations reviewer shall have authority to
access copies of any underlying documents related to
performing a review of the pool assets;
(C) The asset representations reviewer shall be responsible for
reviewing the underlying assets for compliance with the
representations and warranties on the pool assets, and shall not
653

otherwise be the party to determine whether noncompliance
with representations or warranties constitutes a breach of any
contractual provision. Reviews shall be required under the
transaction documents, at a minimum, when the following
conditions are met:
(1) a threshold of delinquent assets, as specified in the
transaction agreements, has been reached or exceeded; and
(2) an investor vote to direct a review, pursuant to the

(E) The asset representations reviewer shall provide a report to the

Instruction to I.B.1(b).
The threshold of delinquent assets shall be calculated as a percentage
of the aggregate dollar amount of delinquent assets in a given pool to
654

the aggregate dollar amount of all the assets in that particular pool,
measured as of the end of the reporting period. If the transaction has
multiple sub-pools, the transaction agreements must provide that (i)
the delinquency threshold shall be calculated with respect to each subpool and (ii) the investor vote calculation shall be measured as a
percentage of investors’ interest in each sub-pool.
(c) Dispute Resolution Provision. With respect to each offering of securities
that is registered on this Form, the pooling and servicing agreement or
other transaction agreement, which shall be filed, must provide for the
following:
(A) If an asset subject to a repurchase request, pursuant to the terms of
the transaction agreements, is not resolved by the end of a 180-day
period beginning when notice of the request is received, then the
party submitting such repurchase request shall have the right to
refer the matter, at its discretion, to either mediation or third-party
arbitration, and the party obligated to repurchase must agree to the
selected resolution method.
(B) If the party submitting the request elects third-party arbitration, the
arbitrator shall determine the allocation of any expenses. If the

received, a statement to the effect that the party responsible for filing the
Form 10-D has received a request from such investor, stating that such
investor is interested in communicating with other investors with regard to
the possible exercise of rights under the transaction agreements, and a
description of the method other investors may use to contact the
requesting investor.
Instruction to I.B.1(d). If an underlying transaction agreement contains
procedures in order to verify that an investor is, in fact, a beneficial owner
for purposes of invoking the investor communication provision, the
verification procedures may require no more than the following: (1) if the
investor is a record holder of the securities at the time of a request to
communicate, then the investor will not have to provide verification of
656

ownership, and (2) if the investor is not the record holder of the securities,
then the person obligated to make the disclosure may require no more than
a written certification from the investor that it is a beneficial owner and
one other form of documentation such as a trade confirmation, an account
statement, a letter from the broker or dealer, or other similar document.
(e) Delinquent assets. Delinquent assets do not constitute 20% or more, as
measured by dollar volume, of the asset pool as of the measurement date.

backed by leases other than motor vehicle leases, the portion of the
securitized pool balance attributable to the residual value of the physical
property underlying the leases, as determined in accordance with the
transaction agreements for the securities, does not constitute 20% or more,
as measured by dollar volume, of the securitized pool balance as of the
measurement date.

accordance with General Instruction I.B.1. where those securities represent an
interest in or the right to the payments of cash flows of another asset pool and
meet the requirements of Securities Act Rule 190(c)(1) through (4) (17 CFR
230.190(c)(1) through (4)).

II.

Application of General Rules and Regulations.

657

A. Attention is directed to the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act,
particularly Regulation C thereunder (l7 CFR 230.400 to 230.499). That Regulation
contains general requirements regarding the preparation and filing of registration
statements.
B. Attention is directed to Regulation S-K (17 CFR Part 229) for the requirements
applicable to the content of the non-financial statement portions of registration
statements under the Securities Act. Where this Form SF-3 directs the registrant to
furnish information required by Regulation S-K and the item of Regulation S-K so
provides, information need only be furnished to the extent appropriate.
Notwithstanding Items 501 and 502 of Regulation S-K, no table of contents is
required to be included in the prospectus or registration statement prepared on this
Form SF-3. In addition to the information expressly required to be included in a
registration statement on this Form SF-3, registrants also may provide such other
information as they deem appropriate.
C. Where securities are being registered on this Form SF-3, Rule 456(c) permits, but
does not require, the registrant to pay the registration fee on a pay-as-you-go basis
and Rule 457(s) permits, but does not require, the registration fee to be calculated on
the basis of the aggregate offering price of the securities to be offered in an offering
or offerings off the registration statement. If a registrant elects to pay all or a portion
of the registration fee on a deferred basis, the Fee Table in the initial filing must
identify the classes of securities being registered and provide that the registrant elects
to rely on Rule 456(c) and Rule 457(s), but the Fee Table does not need to specify
658

any other information. When the registrant amends the Fee Table in accordance with
Rule 456(c)(1)(ii), the amended Fee Table must include either the dollar amount of
securities being registered if paid in advance of or in connection with an offering or
offerings or the aggregate offering price for all classes of securities referenced in the
offerings and the applicable registration fee.
D. Information is only required to be furnished as of the date of initial effectiveness of
the registration statement to the extent required by Rule 430D. Required information
about a specific transaction must be included in the prospectus in the registration
statement by means of a prospectus that is deemed to be part of and included in the
registration statement pursuant to Rule 430D, a post-effective amendment to the
registration statement, or a periodic or current report under the Exchange Act
incorporated by reference into the registration statement and the prospectus and
identified in a prospectus filed, as required by Rule 430D, pursuant to Rule 424(h) or
Rule 424(b) (§ 230.424(h) or § 230.424(b) of this chapter).
III.

Registration of Additional Securities Pursuant to Rule 462(b).
With respect to the registration of additional securities for an offering pursuant to Rule

462(b) under the Securities Act, the registrant may file a registration statement consisting only of
the following: the facing page; a statement that the contents of the earlier registration statement,
identified by file number, are incorporated by reference; required opinions and consents; the
signature page; and any price-related information omitted from the earlier registration statement
in reliance on Rule 430A that the registrant chooses to include in the new registration statement.
The information contained in such a Rule 462(b) registration statement shall be deemed to be a
659

part of the earlier registration statement as of the date of effectiveness of the Rule 462(b)
registration statement. Any opinion or consent required in the Rule 462(b) registration statement
may be incorporated by reference from the earlier registration statement with respect to the
offering, if: (i) such opinion or consent expressly provides for such incorporation; and (ii) such
opinion relates to the securities registered pursuant to Rule 462(b). See Rule 411(c) and Rule
439(b) under the Securities Act.
IV.

Registration Statement Requirements.
Include only one form of prospectus for the asset class that may be securitized in a

takedown of asset-backed securities under the registration statement. A separate form of
prospectus and registration statement must be presented for each country of origin or country of
property securing pool assets that may be securitized in a discrete pool in a takedown of assetbacked securities. For both separate asset classes and jurisdictions of origin or property, a
separate form of prospectus is not required for transactions that principally consist of a particular
asset class or jurisdiction which also describe one or more potential additional asset classes or
jurisdictions, so long as the pool assets for the additional classes or jurisdictions in the aggregate
are below 10% of the pool, as measured by dollar volume, for any particular takedown.
