Respondent.

On December 4, 2009, the Commission published a notice of the Plan of Distribution
(“Plan”) proposed by the Division of Enforcement in connection with this proceeding (Exchange
Act Release No. 61117). No comments were received, and on February 4, 2010, the Plan was
approved (Exchange Act Release No. 61501).
The Plan of Distribution provides that a Distribution Fund consisting of $270,000,000 in
disgorgement, plus any accrued interest, be transferred to Deutsche Bank to be distributed by the
Plan Administrator to injured investors according to the methodology set forth in the Plan. The
Plan provides that the Commission staff will arrange for transfer of the appropriate amount of the
Distribution Fund when a Payment File listing the payees with the identification information
required to make the distribution has been received and accepted. The Payment File for the third
distribution in the amount of $25,777,983.40 has been received and accepted.

Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the Commission staff shall transfer $25,777,983.40 of
the Distribution Fund to Deutsche Bank, and the Plan Administrator shall distribute such monies
to investors, as provided for in the Plan of Distribution.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.
