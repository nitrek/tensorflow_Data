SUMMARY
1.
This case involves financial accounting and reporting fraud, as well as audit
failures, related to the valuation of certain oil and gas assets in Alaska (“the Alaska Assets”)
acquired by Miller Energy Resources, Inc. (“Miller Energy” or “the Company”). Miller Energy,
an oil and gas company headquartered in Houston, Texas, purchased these assets for $2.25 million
in cash – along with the assumption of certain liabilities it valued at approximately $2 million –
during a competitive bid in a bankruptcy proceeding in December 2009.
2.
The Company subsequently reported those assets at an overstated value of $480
million and recognized a one-time “bargain purchase” gain of $277 million for its fiscal third
quarter ended January 2010 and fiscal year ended April 2010.

engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct; or (3) to have willfully
violated, or willfully aided and abetted the violation of, any provision of the
securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder.

Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) provides, in pertinent part, that:
The Commission may . . . deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of
appearing or practicing before it . . . to any person who is found . . . to have
engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct.

The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer of Settlement and are not
binding on any other person in this or any other proceeding.

3.
Miller Energy’s financial statements for its fiscal year 2010, the first annual period
in which the Company reported the fair value of the acquired assets, were audited by Sherb & Co.
LLP (“Sherb & Co.”), a now defunct CPA firm that was suspended by the Commission in 2013 for
improper professional conduct unrelated to this matter. The lead engagement partner on the Miller
Energy audit, Vogt, failed to comply with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the
“PCAOB”) rules and standards in auditing Miller Energy’s financial statements that included its
accounting for its Alaska acquisition. Vogt failed to exercise due professional care and skepticism
by not adequately assessing whether the Company’s accounting treatment for the acquisition
complied with GAAP. Vogt also failed to obtain sufficient competent evidential matter for
management’s assertions regarding the fair value of the Alaska Assets.
RESPONDENT
4.
Carlton W. Vogt, III, CPA, resides in Warwick, New York. From January 2005 to
October 2012, Vogt was a partner at Sherb & Co., LLP, an accounting firm based out of New
York. He has been a licensed CPA in the state of New York since 1998.
THE COMPANY
5.
Miller Energy Resources, Inc. is a Tennessee corporation with its principal place
of business in Houston, Texas. It was founded in 1967 as an oil and gas exploration and
production company, and went public via a reverse merger in 1996. It changed its name from
Miller Petroleum to Miller Energy Resources in April 2011. The Company operated oil and gas
assets in the Appalachian region of east Tennessee until selling them in November 2014 for $3.3
million in cash. Miller Energy’s securities, registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(b),
were listed on the NYSE until September 2015, when the securities were delisted. Between early
2002 and December 2009, Miller Energy’s stock price regularly traded below one dollar per share,
falling to a low of $0.04 per share in December 2007. On October 1, 2015, Miller Energy filed a
voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter 11 of title 11 of the U.S. Code in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Alaska (the “Bankruptcy Case”).
FACTS
Miller Energy Acquires and Overvalues the Alaska Assets
6.
In the fall of 2009, Miller Energy became aware of certain oil and gas properties in
Alaska that were in the process of being “abandoned” as part of the bankruptcy proceedings of a
California-based energy company.
7.
Unable to service its heavy debt and pay the significant monthly costs required to
operate the properties, the bankrupt entity unsuccessfully sought for almost a year to sell its Alaska
Assets. Beginning in December 2008, months before it filed for bankruptcy, the former owner of
the assets marketed the same group of assets that Miller Energy ultimately bought to 40 potential
buyers. This process failed to attract any bidders, and the assets were auctioned by the bankruptcy
3

court in July 2009, with the winning bidder agreeing to a total purchase price of $8 million for the
assets. A second entity, who bid $7 million, was designated as the back-up purchaser. Neither
bidder closed.
8.
As a result, the former owner of the assets sought in August 2009, and was granted
in September, an order from the bankruptcy court allowing it to abandon title to the assets due to a
lack of interest.
9.
Due to renewed interest in the assets from Miller Energy following their
abandonment, the bankruptcy court permitted the debtor to reacquire the Alaska Assets and sell
them to Miller Energy in a competitive auction for $2.25 million in cash and the assumption of
certain limited liabilities. The transaction closed on December 10, 2009.
10.
On March 22, 2010, Miller Energy filed its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for its
fiscal third quarter ended January 31, 2010 and reported a value of $480 million for the Alaska
acquisition. That amount was comprised of $368 million for oil and gas properties and $110
million for fixed assets. Miller Energy also reported an after-tax $277 million “bargain purchase
gain” which boosted net income for the quarter to $272 million – an enormous increase over the
$556,097 loss reported for the same period the year before.
11.
These inflated balance sheet and income statement numbers were repeated in
numerous documents subsequently filed with the Commission, including the Company’s Form 10K for the year ended April 30, 2010.
12.
The newly-booked value of the Alaska acquisition, which resulted in a nearly
5,000% increase in Miller Energy’s total assets, had a significant impact on Miller Energy’s stock
price. On December 10, 2009, the date of the transaction, Miller Energy’s stock closed at $0.61
per share. By March 31, 2010, Miller Energy’s stock closed 982% higher at $6.60 per share.
Weeks later, its stock began trading on NASDAQ and, after moving to the NYSE a year later,
reached an all-time high price on December 9, 2013 of $8.83 per share.
13.
Miller Energy materially overstated the value of its Alaska Assets by more than
four hundred million dollars.
Miller Energy Failed to Record the Alaska Acquisition at Fair Value
14.
ASC 805, Business Combinations – formerly Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) 141(R) – became effective in December 2008. Among its principal revisions,
ASC 805 requires acquisitions that result in a “bargain purchase,” e.g., entities purchased at fire
sales prices in non-orderly transactions, to be measured at fair value, with any resulting gain
recorded on the income statement.
15.
ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements (formerly SFAS 157), provides the framework
for measuring fair value. “Fair value” is defined in ASC 820 as “the price that would be received
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
4

the measurement date.” A reporting entity must determine an appropriate fair value using one or
more of the valuation techniques described in accounting literature.
16.
ASC 820 outlines three broad approaches to measure fair value: the market
approach, income approach, and cost approach. Under the market approach, prices and other
relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or
liabilities are used to measure fair value. The income approach utilizes valuation techniques to
convert future amounts to a single discounted present value amount. Finally, the cost approach is
based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the assets in service, i.e., current
replacement cost.
17.
ASC 820 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entityspecific measurement, and should be determined based on the assumptions market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability.
18.
ASC 820 emphasizes that when a price for an identical asset or liability is not
observable entities should use a “valuation technique that maximizes the use of relevant observable
inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs” and entities may not ignore assumptions
market participants would use.4
19.
Miller Energy purported to value the Alaska acquisition using the income approach
for the oil and gas reserves and the cost approach for certain fixed assets. But the values that
Miller Energy recorded for these assets did not reflect fair value and thus did not comply with
GAAP.
The Valuation of the Acquired Oil and Gas Reserves
Was Based Upon a Reserve Report, Which Did Not Represent Fair Value
20.
Reserve reports are commonly used in the oil and gas industry to estimate quantities
of oil and gas (the reserves) expected to be recovered from existing properties.5 Generally, these
ASC 820 defines “unobservable inputs” as “inputs that reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions about
the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best
information available in the circumstances” and “observable inputs” as “inputs that reflect the assumptions market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources
independent of the reporting entity.”

Oil and gas reporting companies are subject to two principal authoritative pronouncements governing
financial accounting and reporting for oil and gas activities: Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X (17 C.F.R. 210.4-10),
Financial Accounting and Reporting for Oil and Gas Producing Activities Pursuant to the Federal Securities Laws
and the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (“Rule 4-10”); and ASC 932-235-50-29 through 33 (formerly
SFAS 19, Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies and SFAS 69, Disclosures
About Oil and Gas Producing Activities). ASC 932 establishes disclosure requirements for significant oil and gas
activities, including disclosure of the “standardized measure,” which is the future after-tax net cash flows discounted
at 10%. A non-GAAP measure known as “PV-10” is similar to the standardized measure but is typically presented
on a pretax basis. The FASB has noted that the standardized measure supplies investors with useful information,
however, they also noted their concern “that users of financial statements understand that it is neither fair market

5

reports list reserves in categories based on a minimum estimated percentage probability of eventual
recovery and production, i.e., proved, probable, and possible. Information in reserve reports that
are prepared in accordance with Commission regulations is frequently used, for among other
purposes, to satisfy supplemental accounting disclosure requirements concerning estimates of
future oil and gas production. However, the numbers used in reserve reports for this purpose are
expressly not considered “an estimate of fair market value.”
21.
To value the Alaska Assets oil and gas reserves, Miller Energy used a reserve report
prepared by an independent petroleum engineer firm that used a pretax present value of net cash
flows discounted at 10% (“PV-10”). That reserve report reflected a PV-10 of $368 million.
22.
Although that reserve report specifically cautioned that “[t]he discounted values
shown are for your information and should not be construed as our estimate of fair market value,”
Miller Energy, without undertaking any additional analysis, recorded as the fair value of the
acquired oil and gas properties the sum of the PV-10 estimates for 100% of the proved, probable,
and possible reserves.
23.
reasons.

The $368 million reserve report value did not represent fair value for several

24.
First, the reserve report did not represent fair value in part because the $237 million
of projected operating and capital expenses that Miller Energy provided the petroleum engineer
were unrealistically low, resulting in an overstated valuation. For example, internal Miller Energy
documents indicate that the cost to drill certain new wells was roughly $13 million. However,
Miller Energy told the petroleum engineer firm to use a cost of $4.6 million per well in its reserve
report. And instead of using recent expense data, Miller Energy gave the engineer firm nearly
three year old operating expense data, which in some cases, was even further reduced.
25.
Overall, the reserve report implied operating expenses of $4 per barrel of oil
equivalent (“boe”) for all categories of reserves. That level of operating expenses was
unreasonable in light of its predecessor’s actual operating expenses of $32.50/boe in 2008 and
$55.42/boe in the first half of 2009, before the wells were shut-in.
26.
Vogt was aware of the potential problems with the expense projections, cautioning
the Company’s Chief Financial Officer in December 2009 that the lack of any controls over the
expense estimates was a “concerning void.”
27.
Second, the reserve report did not include amounts for certain asset retirement
obligations, i.e., the legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets.
value nor the present value of future cash flows. It is a rough surrogate for such measures, a tool to allow for a
reasonable comparison of mineral reserves and changes through the use of a standardized method that recognizes
qualitative, quantitative, geographic, and temporal characteristics.” Paragraph 83 of the Basis for Conclusions of
SFAS 69.

28.
Third, despite showing years of net profit that market participants would expect to
be taxable, the reserve report did not make any adjustments for income taxes.
29.
Fourth, the reserve report used a 10% discount rate that was inappropriate under
GAAP for determining fair value. In a discounted cash flow model, a discount rate is used to
account for the uncertainties associated with risk and the time value of money. A discount rate is
the required rate of return that an investor would demand – based on the risks associated with the
benefit stream under consideration – to induce the investor to make an investment. The 10%
standard discount rate failed to consider assumptions market participants would use for the Alaska
Assets given the unique risks associated with those assets.
30.
Finally, the valuation also overstated cash flows from certain categories of reserve
estimates (e.g., “probable” and “possible” reserves) by failing to apply any risk weight to such
reserves and the resulting cash flows. Given the high degree of uncertainty associated with cash
flows from these reserve estimate categories, they are required to be risk weighted in order to
reflect an appropriate valuation.
Miller Energy Improperly Valued the Fixed Assets
31.
In addition to the $368 million value recorded for the oil and gas properties, Miller
Energy also erroneously recorded a separate value of $110 million for acquired fixed assets, such
as facilities and pipelines ancillary to the oil and gas reserves. This valuation violated GAAP for
several reasons.
32.
First, recording a separate and additional value for the fixed assets essentially
amounted to double counting those assets. Specifically, the reserve report Miller Energy relied on
to value the acquired oil and gas properties used a discounted cash flow model. Valuation
specialists use such models to estimate the value of an enterprise’s “operating assets” – i.e., the
assets employed to generate future cash flows – by converting future benefit streams into a net
present value. In Miller Energy’s case, the fixed assets were the very same operating assets that
were expected to generate the future cash flows in the reserve report. Accordingly, they should not
have been separately valued.
33.
Second, Miller Energy improperly relied on an insurance report for the fair value of
the fixed assets. The values for the fixed assets in that report had been given to the insurance
broker, and its predecessor, by its clients (i.e., Miller Energy and the previous owners of the fixed
assets) as far back as 2007 and were used as starting points for other types of estimates, such as
estimates for possible losses resulting from fire or natural disasters.
34.
The two employees at the insurance broker who were most familiar with the
original report stated that no one at the broker ever tested or in any way double-checked the values
given to them.

7

35.
Finally, the values in that report purported to show “asset replacement cost.”
Absent further adjustments, replacement cost new does not qualify as fair value under GAAP.
Vogt’s Fiscal Year 2010 Audit of Miller Energy
36.
As described below, Vogt failed to perform the 2010 Miller Energy audit in
accordance with PCAOB Standards. These deficiencies included, among other items, failing
properly to audit the fair value measurements, use the work of a specialist, plan, staff and supervise
the audit, obtain sufficient competent audit evidence, exercise due care and professional
skepticism, and perform required audit testing.
37.
In August 2008, Miller Energy hired Sherb & Co. to become the company’s
independent public accountant. Vogt led an audit team that audited Miller Energy’s financial
statements for fiscal years ended 2009 and 2010.
38.
As the partner in charge of the fiscal year 2010 Miller Energy audit, Vogt failed to
perform the 2010 Miller Energy audit in accordance with PCAOB Standards.
39.
Vogt’s failures related to the auditing of the Alaska asset acquisition. Despite the
materiality of the transaction on Miller Energy’s financial statements, Vogt failed to adequately
test the valuation of the assets and the related calculation of the gain on acquisition. Instead, he
inappropriately relied on the aforementioned reserve report and the so-called asset replacement
cost study to justify Miller Energy’s $480 million valuation of the Alaska Assets.
40.
Vogt did not perform the necessary procedures to enable him to use the findings of
the reserve report. See AU § 336.12.6 He and his audit staff performed a limited evaluation of the
petroleum engineer firm’s work and its qualifications as a specialist (as a petroleum engineer, not
as a fair value appraiser). The reserve report, which was included in the audit workpapers, clearly
stated that the engineer firm was not engaged to – and did not in fact – perform a fair value
estimate for the Alaska Assets. Among other significant flaws, Vogt never obtained an
understanding of the objectives and scope of the specialist’s work or the appropriateness of using
the specialist’s work for the purpose of fair valuing the assets. See AU § 336.09. Nor did he make
the appropriate tests of data provided to the specialist, including operating and capital expenses
estimated and provided by Miller Energy. See AU § 336.12.
41.
The audit of the recorded fixed assets of $110 million was similarly flawed. A
member of the audit team obtained the asset replacement cost study and placed a copy of it in the
workpapers, but Vogt failed to consider the nature of the fixed assets and whether they would be
utilized to generate the cash flow from the oil and gas properties, and, if so, what remainder value
would exist. Nor did Vogt or the audit team perform any meaningful work to consider the
expertise and experience of those persons determining the fair value measurement, the significant

8

management assumptions used in determining the fair value, and the documentation supporting
management’s assumptions. See AU § 328.12.
42.
Vogt knew at the time of the accounting for the acquisition that Miller Energy had
insufficient accounting staff and that any accounting was suspect. In a December 22, 2009 email
to Miller Energy’s senior management, Vogt indicated that he believed the Company’s accounting
staff was deficient, and that the Company’s CFO cut too many corners on the accounting
documentation. Furthermore, Vogt stated that Miller Energy’s modeling of cash flows and
expenses was “concerning” because there was no one taking a detailed look at the cost estimates
that the CEO of Miller Energy’s Alaska subsidiary provided to the petroleum engineer for the
Alaska Assets. In an email dated March 17, 2011, Vogt also knew that the reserve report used
suspect data and was completed on what he described as a “rushed basis,” as Miller Energy “had
very little time if none for any true due diligence of much depth into what [it] purchased.”
43.
Vogt, on behalf of Sherb & Co., issued an audit report containing an unqualified
opinion for use in Miller Energy’s 2010 Form 10-K that stated falsely that the audit had been
conducted in accordance with the PCAOB’s standards and that Miller Energy’s financial
statements were presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformity with GAAP. The specific
failures are detailed below.
Failures Auditing Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (AU § 328)
44.
AU § 328 requires auditors to obtain sufficient competent audit evidence to provide
reasonable assurance that fair value measurements and disclosures are in conformity with GAAP.
AU § 328.03. The standard provides that “[t]he auditor should test the data used to develop the fair
value measurements and disclosures and evaluate whether the fair value measurements have been
properly determined” including “whether the data on which the fair value measurements are based,
including the data used in the work of a specialist, is accurate, complete and relevant . . . .” AU §
328.39. In addition, “[t]he auditor should evaluate the sufficiency and competence of the audit
evidence obtained from auditing fair value measurements and disclosures as well as the
consistency of that evidence with other audit evidence obtained and evaluated during the audit.”
AU § 328.47. If a valuation model is utilized, the auditor reviews the model and evaluates whether
the assumptions used are reasonable. AU § 328.38.
45.
Vogt failed to comply with these requirements in connection with the 2010 audit of
Miller Energy. While Vogt performed some testing on the data used to create the reserve report,
he failed to test key elements such as the discount rate utilized, the risk weighting of the probable
and possible reserves, estimated oil prices, and operating and capital expenses. Vogt also never
properly considered the relevancy of the reserve report, improperly relying exclusively on the
report since the specialist, a petroleum engineer, was not engaged to estimate a fair valuation, as
expressly indicated in the report. Nor did he consider the consistency of the evidence in light of
the other evidence, such as Miller Energy’s actual purchase price of the assets (reported at less than
$5 million), and the fact that the assets had previously been abandoned during a bankruptcy
proceeding. While Vogt and his staff reviewed some aspects of the specialist’s valuation model,
they failed to sufficiently review and evaluate the reasonableness of assumptions such as the
9

discount rate, risk weighting of certain reserves, future oil prices, and operating and capital
expenses.
46.
Vogt also failed to obtain sufficient audit evidence to support the fair value of the
fixed assets. Vogt performed limited, if any, testing of the asset replacement cost study
purportedly supporting the fixed asset valuation. He did not assess the competency or sufficiency
of the asset replacement cost study, or understand who created the study, their qualifications, and
the data underlying their valuation. Finally, Vogt failed to consider whether some or all of the
fixed assets were being utilized in the estimated values captured in the reserve report.
Failure in Using the Work of a Specialist (AU § 336)
47.
AU § 336 provides guidance to auditors when the work of a specialist is used in
performing an audit of financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Among other
items, the standard requires the auditor to evaluate the specialist to ensure that the specialist
possesses the necessary skill or knowledge in the type of work under consideration and the
appropriateness of using the specialist’s work for the intended purpose. Specifically, AU § 336.08
states that “[t]he auditor should consider the following to evaluate the professional qualifications of
the specialist in determining that the specialist possesses the necessary skill or knowledge in the
particular field:
a. The professional certification, license, or other recognition of the competence of
the specialist in his or her field, as appropriate
b. The reputation and standing of the specialist in the views of peers and others
familiar with the specialist’s capability or performance
c. The specialist's experience in the type of work under consideration.”
48.
Furthermore, AU § 336.09 states “[t]he auditor should obtain an understanding of
the nature of the work performed or to be performed by the specialist. This understanding should
cover the following:
a. The objectives and scope of the specialist’s work
b. The specialist's relationship to the client
c. The methods or assumptions used
d. A comparison of the methods or assumptions used with those used in the
preceding period
e. The appropriateness of using the specialist's work for the intended purpose

10

f. The form and content of the specialist’s findings that will enable the auditor to
make the evaluation described in paragraph [336].12.”7
49.
Although the Standard allows an auditor to use the work of a specialist as evidential
matter in performing substantive tests to evaluate material financial statement assertions (see AU §
336.03), Vogt failed in several respects in his use of a specialist regarding the valuation of Miller
Energy’s Alaska acquisition.
50.
Vogt did not properly consider the petroleum engineer’s experience in fair
valuation of assets, which was nonexistent. See AU § 336.08. Vogt also failed to obtain an
understanding of the objectives and scope and intended purpose of the petroleum engineer’s
engagement for Miller Energy, which was to produce a reserve report for reserve disclosure
purposes, not a fair valuation of acquired assets. See AU § 336.09. Indeed, the single page of the
reserve report included in Vogt’s workpapers, to support his evaluation of Miller Energy’s $368
million valuation, clearly states that the “values shown . . . should not be construed as our estimate
of fair market value.”
51.
Furthermore, Vogt failed to adequately obtain an understanding of the methods and
assumptions used by the specialist, or appropriately test data provided to the specialist. See AU §
336.12. There is no evidence that Vogt considered the appropriateness of certain key assumptions
used by the petroleum engineer, such as the discount rate, estimated price of oil and gas, and the
lack of risk weighting of probable and possible reserves. Finally, Vogt, despite alerting Miller
Energy’s then CEO and CFO to the lack of sufficient review and inquiry, failed to adequately test
the operating and capital expense estimates provided to the specialist by Miller Energy, and took
few audit steps, other than inquiry, to assess the reasonableness of the expense estimates.
52.
Vogt performed no steps to evaluate the qualifications of the authors of the asset
replacement cost study, or understand the methods or assumptions they used or the appropriateness
of using the Asset replacement cost study to support the valuation of the fixed assets at $110
million.
Failure to Exercise Due Professional Care in the Performance of Work (AU § 230)
53.
PCAOB Standards require auditors to exercise due professional care in the planning
and performance of the audit. See AU § 230.01. Due professional care requires the auditor to
exercise professional skepticism: an attitude that includes a questioning mind and a critical
assessment of audit evidence. See AU § 230.07. Moreover, gathering and objectively evaluating
audit evidence requires the auditor to consider the competency and sufficiency of the evidence.
See AU § 230.08.
7

AU § 336.12 states that an auditor should evaluate the appropriateness and reasonableness of methods and
assumptions used, during which the auditor should: “(a) obtain an understanding of the methods and assumptions
used by the specialist, (b) make appropriate tests of data provided to the specialist, taking into account the auditor's
assessment of control risk, and (c) evaluate whether the specialist's findings support the related assertions in the
financial statements.”

11

54.
Vogt failed to exercise due professional care regarding the audit of the Alaska
acquisition valuation during the 2010 Miller Energy audit. Miller Energy had valued the assets
purchased for a few million dollars at $480 million and had recorded a corresponding $277 million
bargain purchase gain. Given the size of the transaction, Vogt should have focused more closely
on the diligence required to gather and objectively evaluate the evidence supporting the fair value
of the oil and gas properties acquired to comply with ASC 805 and common industry practice. He
failed to adequately consider the competency and sufficiency of the reserve report as evidence of
the fair value of the acquired oil and gas properties. Vogt also performed limited procedures and
failed to sufficiently evaluate the evidentiary value of the asset replacement cost study, including
failing to understand the source of the fixed asset values therein and the competency of the report
authors.
Failure to Plan and Supervise (AU § 311)
55.
AU § 311 requires an auditor to adequately plan the work and properly supervise
assistants. AU § 311.01. In planning the audit, the auditor should consider, among other matters,
the entity’s business, the entity’s accounting policies and procedures, and planned assessed level of
control risk. AU § 311.03. A written audit program is required. AU § 311.05. Supervision
involves directing the efforts of assistants who are involved in accomplishing the objectives of the
audit and determining whether those objectives were accomplished. The extent of supervision
appropriate in a given instance depends on many factors, including the complexity of the subject
matter and the qualifications of persons performing the work. AU § 311.11.
56.
Vogt’s work did not meet this standard. Vogt’s audit program to test Miller
Energy’s fair value assessment of the Alaska acquisition was insufficient. The planned procedures
largely consisted of verifying the credentials of a specialist. Vogt’s audit program failed to set
forth procedures necessary to ensure the appropriateness of using the specialist’s work for the
purpose of a fair valuation. Nor did his audit program provide additional and alternate procedures
for the insufficient evidence provided by the work of the specialist. As to the fixed assets, Vogt’s
program was insufficient in that it merely required agreeing the asset balance to the Asset
replacement cost study provided by Miller Energy.
57.
Vogt’s supervision of his staff was also deficient. Vogt spent little time on-site
while the field work was conducted, and he knew the staff auditors had insufficient oil and gas
industry experience. It was evident during their respective testimonies that the two staff members
assigned by Vogt to the Miller Energy audit, whose experience consisted almost entirely of
auditing microcap companies, were ill-prepared to test a transaction purportedly valued in excess
of $400 million. The most junior staff member was not a Certified Public Accountant, did not
appear to comprehend basic accounting principles, including elementary aspects of fair value
accounting, yet was charged with the testing of the oil and gas properties fair valuation.
Failure to Properly Assess Audit Risk and Materiality in Conducting an Audit (AU § 312)
58.
AU § 312 states that, when an auditor has concluded that there is a significant risk
of material misstatement of the financial statements, the auditor should consider this conclusion in
12

determining the nature, timing, or extent of procedures; assigning staff; or requiring appropriate
levels of supervision. Ordinarily, higher risk requires more experienced personnel or more
extensive supervision by the auditor with final responsibility for the engagement during both the
planning and the conduct of the engagement. Higher risk may cause the auditor to expand the
extent of procedures applied, apply procedures closer to or as of year-end, particularly in critical
audit areas, or modify the nature of procedures to obtain more persuasive evidence. AU § 312.17
59.
Vogt’s knowledge of the magnitude of the Alaska acquisition, and his knowledge
of the inadequacy of Miller Energy’s accounting personnel, including the Company’s CFO, should
have resulted in increased scrutiny of Miller Energy’s valuation of the Alaska Assets. Yet Vogt
assigned crucial audit procedures to staff who lacked appropriate industry and auditing experience,
and did not sufficiently supervise their work.
Failure to Obtain Sufficient Competent Evidential Matter (AU § 326)
60.
Under the third standard of field work, sufficient competent evidential matter is to
be obtained through inspection, observation, inquiries, and confirmations to afford a reasonable
basis for an opinion regarding the financial statements under audit. AU § 326.01. Since he over
relied on a reserve report and the asset replacement cost study, and took limited to no additional
audit steps to test that audit evidence, Vogt failed to obtain sufficient evidence for the fair value of
the Alaska acquisition.
Failure to Issue an Accurate Audit Report (AU § 508)
61.
Under AU § 508, an auditor may only express an unqualified opinion on historical
financial statements when the auditor has formed such an opinion on the basis of an audit
performed in accordance with PCAOB standards. AU § 508.07. Based upon the audit failures
discussed above, Vogt should not have issued an audit report containing an unqualified opinion on
Miller Energy’s fiscal year 2010 financial statements.
VIOLATIONS
62.
As a result of the conduct described above, Vogt engaged in a single instance of
highly unreasonable conduct in circumstances for which heightened scrutiny was warranted within
the meaning of Section 4C(a)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) of the Commission’s
Rules of Practice. Section 4C(a)(2) of the Exchange Act and Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) provide, in
pertinent part, that the Commission may censure or deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege
of appearing or practicing before the Commission to any person who is found by the Commission
to have engaged in improper professional conduct. Section 4C(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule
102(e)(1)(iv) define improper professional conduct with respect to persons license to practice as
accountants as (1) a single instance of highly unreasonable conduct in circumstances for which
heightened scrutiny is warranted; or (2) repeated instances of unreasonable conduct that indicate a
lack of competence.

IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in the Respondent’s Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, effective immediately, that:
A.
Vogt is denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as
an accountant.
B.
After three years from the date of this Order, Vogt may request that the
Commission consider his reinstatement by submitting an application (attention: Office of the
Chief Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as:
1.
a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or
review, of any public company’s financial statements that are filed with the Commission. Such
an application must satisfy the Commission that Vogt’s work in his practice before the
Commission will be reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public company
for which he works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as he practices before the
Commission in this capacity; and/or
2.
Commission that:

an independent accountant. Such an application must satisfy the

(a)
Vogt, or the public accounting firm with which he is associated, is
registered with the PCAOB in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and such
registration continues to be effective;
(b)
Vogt, or the registered public accounting firm with which he is
associated, has been inspected by the PCAOB and that inspection did not identify any criticisms
of or potential defects in Vogt’s or the firm’s quality control system that would indicate that the
respondent will not receive appropriate supervision;
(c)
Vogt has resolved all disciplinary issues with the PCAOB, and has
complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions imposed by the PCAOB (other than
reinstatement by the Commission); and
(d)
Vogt acknowledges his responsibility, as long as Vogt appears or
practices before the Commission as an independent accountant, to comply with all requirements
of the Commission and the PCAOB, including, but not limited to, all requirements relating to
registration, inspections, concurring partner reviews and quality control standards.
C.
The Commission will consider an application by Vogt to resume appearing or
practicing before the Commission provided that his state CPA license is current and he has
resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of accountancy. However, if
14

state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the Commission, the Commission will consider an
application on its other merits. The Commission’s review may include consideration of, in addition
to the matters referenced above, any other matters relating to Vogt’s character, integrity,
professional conduct, or qualifications to appear or practice before the Commission.
By the Commission.
