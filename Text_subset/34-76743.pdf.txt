SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
17 CFR Part 240

Release No. 34-76743; File No. S7-27-15
TRANSFER AGENT REGULATIONS
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission
ACTION: Advance notice of proposed rulemaking; Concept release; Request for comment
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) is publishing this
Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Concept Release, and Request for Comment on
Transfer Agent Regulations (“release”) to seek public comment regarding the Commission’s
transfer agent rules. The first transfer agent rules were adopted in 1977 and remain essentially
unchanged. At the same time, transfer agents now operate in a market structure that bears little
resemblance to the structure in 1977. The release, noting the importance of transfer agents
within the national market structure, includes a history of transfer agent services and applicable
regulations as well as an overview of current transfer agent services and activities, and requests
comment on all topics. The release includes an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in
specific areas, such as transfer agent registration and reporting requirements, safeguarding of
funds and securities, and revision of obsolete or outdated rules, along with requests for comment,
as well as a Concept Release and Request for Comment addressing additional areas of specific
Commission interest, including processing of book-entry securities, broker-dealer recordkeeping
for beneficial owners, transfer agents to mutual funds, and administration of issuer plans. The
Commission intends to consider the public’s comments in connection with any future

INTRODUCTION
The United States’ securities markets are indispensable to this country’s and the world’s

economy. The Commission believes that issuers, investors, and other participants in the
securities markets must be served by a well-functioning national system for the clearance and
settlement of securities transactions (“National C&S System”) that promotes safe, efficient,
prompt, and accurate settlement transactions. 1 Critical to this mission is the development and
maintenance of a comprehensive regulatory program that governs the functions of transfer agents
and related industry segments critical to the proper functioning of the National C&S System,
including entities that clear trades, provide custodial and safeguarding services, and perform
other “back-office” functions within the securities industry.
As agents for issuers, transfer agents play a critical role with respect to securities
settlement, though they rarely receive much public attention. Among their key functions, they
may: (i) track, record, and maintain on behalf of issuers the official record of ownership of each
issuer’s securities; (ii) cancel old certificates, issue new ones, and perform other processing and
recordkeeping functions that facilitate the issuance, cancellation, and transfer of those securities;
(iii) facilitate communications between issuers and registered securityholders; and (iv) make
dividend, principal, interest, and other distributions to securityholders. A transfer agent’s failure
to perform its duties promptly, accurately, and safely can compromise the accuracy of an issuer’s
securityholder records, disrupt the channels of communication between issuers and

securityholders, disenfranchise investors, and expose issuers, investors, securities intermediaries,
and the securities markets as a whole to significant financial loss. 2
The securities markets and the National C&S System in which transfer agents operate
have changed significantly since the Commission first began regulating transfer agents in the
1970s. The changes largely reflect a decades-long evolution from a manual securities settlement
process focused on the processing of physical securities certificates to a highly automated
electronic environment centered on the processing and transfer of electronic book-entry
securities. 3 The changes also reflect significant technological and operational developments in
other areas, as well as broader changes in the securities industry and the business and regulatory
environments in which transfer agents operate.
As a result, the Commission has observed over time that transfer agents now perform a
more diverse array of functions and services, many of which may not be fully addressed by the
Commission’s transfer agent rules. In addition, the Commission has observed that the manner in
which transfer agents carry out their traditional functions may no longer be adequately addressed
in the rules. The Commission’s consideration of these observations has led it to include two
interrelated approaches in this release. Under the first approach, the Commission believes it has

presenting significant potential adverse consequences). See also Processing Requirements for Cancelled
Security Certificates, Exchange Act Release No. 48931 (Dec. 16, 2003), 68 FR 74390, 74391 (Dec. 23,
2003) (“17Ad-19 Adopting Release”) (noting examples of substandard transfer agent performance and
significant adverse consequences).

the investor does not receive a certificate. Instead, a custodian, usually a broker or transfer agent, maintains
electronic records showing that the investor owns the particular security. For additional discussion of book
entry securities, see infra note 37.

identified a series of new and amended rules that, based on its current understanding of transfer
agents and their functions, it intends to propose. These anticipated new and amended rules,
which the Commission intends to propose as soon as is practicable, either individually or in
groups or phases, and irrespective of any other changes to the transfer agent rules, are discussed
in detail in the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking found in Section VI. The Commission
is soliciting public comment on the anticipated rulemaking proposals described in Section VI.
Public feedback and data would assist the Commission in further refining and calibrating the
anticipated proposals as well as other potential proposals.
Under the second approach, reflected in the Concept Release and Request for Comment
contained in Section VII, the Commission discusses and requests comment regarding a number
of additional transfer agent issues that primarily arise from the diverse array of transfer agent
functions and services which have developed over time. Public comment on these additional
issues will allow the Commission to evaluate the need for, and potentially develop, additional
rulemaking proposals appropriately tailored to these complex areas. In undertaking these
approaches, the Commission remains sensitive to whether any distinctions between the actual
activities of transfer agents and what is contemplated by the Commission’s rules may create
undue uncertainty or risks for the National C&S System and the market participants that rely
upon it, including investors, issuers, regulators, and transfer agents. As transfer agents continue
to evolve in their roles and activities, any such distinctions, and the commensurate risks
associated with them, may also grow.
We begin with an overview of the antecedents, advent, and subsequent history of the
National C&S System, including a discussion of the “Paperwork Crisis” which helped precipitate
the legislative amendments that gave rise to that system. We then describe the National C&S
Page 8 of 208

System and transfer agents’ role within that system as it functions today, followed by a
discussion of the current regulatory regime and the core functions performed by transfer agents.
The remainder of the release consists of the two sections noted above: the Advance Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking in Section VI and the Concept Release and Request for Comment in
Section VII.
We are mindful that the role of transfer agents in the National C&S System and the need
to address specific risks associated with transfer agents have been topics of discussion and
debate, both within and outside the Commission, for many years. 4 We intend for this release to
build on those discussions and therefore invite comment on the full range of topics and issues
associated with transfer agents and their activities, regardless of whether and in which section
those topics and issues are specifically addressed. Thus, while we set forth specific requests for
comments, we welcome comments on any concerns related to transfer agent activities, the
transfer agent regulatory program, or other areas of concern that commentators may have. We
specifically invite comment on any possible regulatory actions regarding the issues and concerns
described, including potential new rules or rule amendments or other reasonable regulatory
alternatives, as well as any related evidence, quantitative and/or qualitative, relating to a potential
regulatory action. Comments received on either or both sections of the release will be
considered in connection with any future rulemaking.

4

For example, in 2011 the Commission hosted a roundtable on the execution, clearance, and settlement of
microcap securities which covered, among other topics, the role of transfer agents in the issuance and
transfer of restricted securities. See transcript, available at
https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/microcap/microcaproundtable101711-transcript.txt.

We are also mindful that market developments have occurred beyond the changes that are
the focus of this release and that affect transfer agents. For example, transfer agents and market
participants now often communicate with one another using structured data on electronic
platforms. Data standardization efforts have emerged to further enhance these electronic
communication methods, such as the international standards effort focusing on corporate actions,
which may ultimately be used by transfer agents. 5 Although these issues are not specifically
addressed herein, comments on, and specific data about, any such developments are welcome.
The Commission is sensitive to the effects that could result from any regulatory action,
and accordingly we also seek input on the economic effects or tradeoffs associated with any
potential regulatory action, including any costs, benefits, or burdens of such action, and any
effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. We are also mindful that the various
aspects of the transfer agent regulatory program and securities transfer process that we address in
this release are interconnected, and that changes to one aspect may affect other aspects, as well
as complement or frustrate other potential changes. Therefore, we encourage the public to
consider these relationships when formulating comments, and invite comment on whether
alternative approaches, or a combination of approaches, would better address the concerns
raised.

THE NATIONAL CLEARANCE AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEM: HISTORY
AND BACKGROUND
A.

Transfer of Certificated Securities

Investment securities confer certain intangible rights and benefits upon the holder. 6 For
example, the rights and benefits represented by a share of stock generally include the right to
share in the capital and surplus of the corporation and receive certain other benefits and specified
rights. Because securities confer intangible rights, historically the transfer of investment
securities from one person to another has required special rules. In the past, the most common
way to transfer investment securities, such as shares of stock, was to transfer a paper certificate
that represents the benefits of ownership (“certificated security”). 7 Certificated securities have
been issued in the United States since the 1700s 8 and are evidence that the owner is registered on
the books of the issuer (or its transfer agent) as a securityholder. 9 Although the shares
themselves represent an intangible right, 10 the certificate is a negotiable instrument under state

6

Egon Guttman, Modern Securities Transfers § 1:5 (4th ed. 2010).

7

The Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) defines a “certificated security” as “a security that is represented
by a certificate.” U.C.C. 8-102(a)(4). The UCC, which was first published in 1952, is a uniform act
designed to standardize the law of sales and other commercial transactions in all 50 states. The UCC has
the effect of law only when adopted by a state, and while it has been adopted by all 50 states, there are
numerous state-by-state variations in the adopted texts.

8

The first major American issue of publicly traded securities occurred in 1790 when the federal government
issued $80 million of bonds to refinance federal and state Revolutionary War debt. In 1792, five
securities—two bank stocks and three government bonds—began trading on what was to become the New
York Stock Exchange. For a historical discussion of the development of trading on the exchange, see
Teweles and Bradley, The Stock Market 95-119 (6th ed. 1992).

law, which allows the registered owner of the certificated security to transfer the bundle of
intangible rights to a third party. 11
This ability to transfer the rights associated with share ownership helps drive the
securities markets. 12 Generally, under the UCC, “voluntary transfer of possession” is all that is
required to effect such a transfer. 13 But in order to qualify as a “protected purchaser” under the
UCC, and therefore acquire an interest in the security free of any adverse claim, the buyer must
give value, not have notice of any adverse claim to the security, and obtain control of it. 14 Thus,
for a buyer of registered certificated securities to achieve protected purchaser status, the
voluntary transfer of possession could involve a significant amount of paperwork and manual
processing, even in a direct transaction between a seller and a buyer:
[E]ither the certificate or a stock power must be indorsed,
the signature guaranteed, authority to transfer title
documented, and the stock certificate and the other
documentation delivered, not to mention the registration of
transfer on the stockholders list, the destruction of the old
certificate and the issue of a new one. 15
Historically, transactions involving certificated securities effected on securities
exchanges could be significantly more complex:

Generally, the UCC governs the transfer of securities. For further discussion of the UCC, see Section
IV.D.

U.C.C. 8-303. “Control” over a registered security is achieved by obtaining control of the security indorsed
to the holder or in blank, or if the issuer registers the holder in the securityholder list. See U.C.C. 8-106(b),
off. cmts. 2-3.

In sales and purchases by persons other than brokers and
specialists, the owner of the security will instruct a broker
to sell, the broker will transfer the order to the exchange
floor/system or a market maker, where it will be matched
wholly or partially with one or more buy orders. Once the
order is executed, the seller will have to deliver the
executed certificate(s) to his broker so that the selling
broker can deliver it to the buying broker, market maker,
specialist, or central counterparty. Once the buying broker
receives delivery, she will have to deliver to the issuer’s
transfer agent with a request for registration of transfer on
the stockholder list. The latter, after inspecting all
necessary documentation, will register the transfer, cancel
the old certificate, and issue a new certificate to the buyer.
Thus, beyond indorsement of the certificate and its
delivery, each stage of the transaction will demand the
documents, guarantees and assurances that constitute “good
delivery” on the respective exchange. 16
B.

Transfer Agent Processes For Transferring Certificated Securities

Historically, from the transfer agent’s perspective, the transfer of certificated securities
held by registered owners was a time-consuming manual process. First, the transfer agent would
receive from the broker a bundle of documents (the “transfer bundle”) that typically included the
following: (i) a “ticket” pinned to the bundle of documents that served as a transmittal letter and
receipt; 17 (ii) transfer instructions telling the transfer agent what action to take; (iii) the security

16

Id. at 7-8.

17

Historically, the term “ticket” referred to a broker-originated window ticket, which indicated the identity of
the delivering broker, the securities, and the quantity. It would be prepared by a broker in triplicate and
accompanied the transfer instructions and stock certificates when presented by the broker to the transfer
agent for transfer. SEC, Study of Unsafe and Unsound Practices of Brokers and Dealers, H.R. Doc. No.
92-231, at 182 n.32 (Dec. 1971) (“Unsafe Practices Study”). Today, a ticket may provide similar
information, either in electronic form, or in a highly structured and standardized paper form capable of
being scanned and converted to electronic form.

Page 13 of 208

certificates of the selling securityholder; (iv) a power of attorney; 18 and (v) a “guarantee,”
typically affixed to the power of attorney or certificate, guaranteeing the genuineness of the
signature of the selling securityholder indorsing the certificate over for transfer. 19
As an example of the extensive process for transferring certificated securities, prior to
1975, for New York City transfer agents, nearly 90 percent of these transfer bundles were
received from messengers at the transfer agent’s “window,” which was a physical drop-off
location at the transfer agent’s offices, rather than through the mail, in which case the transfer
bundles would be routed to the mail room. 20 Upon receipt at the window, the transfer agent
would perform a visual reconciliation to confirm that the number of securities shown on the
ticket matched the number on the certificates. If the transfer agent found a difference, the
transfer would be rejected as “out of balance” and returned to the broker, a process known as a
“window rejection.” 21 If no difference was found, the transfer agent would continue the process
with a more detailed inspection, starting with a detailed review of signature guarantees,

18

A power of attorney may also be referred to as a “stock power” (or “bond power” with respect to debt
securities) and grants legal authority to the registered securityholder’s broker, to a transfer agent, or to
another intermediary to transfer the securityholder’s securities ownership on behalf of the securityholder.
A seller may use a power of attorney rather than indorse the assignment and transfer form on the back of
the security certificate. For examples of forms of transfer and assignment (i) by stock power; (ii) by bond
power; and (iii) by execution of the transfer and assignment form on the back of a security certificate, see
Mark S. Rhodes, Transfer of Stock app. A § 678.3041 at forms 1-3 (7th ed. Apr. 2015).

the American Stock Exchange 47 (1969) (“Rockwell Study”).

20

It was estimated at the time that New York transfer agents only received approximately 10 percent of
certificates by U.S. mail. The pattern was the opposite for transfer agents outside of New York, which
were estimated to receive the vast majority of certificates for transfer through the mail. Id. at 51.

indorsements, 22 and attachments in order to determine if the certificates were in “good order” for
transfer. 23 If the transfer agent found a deficiency, it would attach a rejection sheet to the
certificate in question and return it to the broker, a process referred to as an “examination
rejection.” 24 If the certificates were found to be in good order, the transfer agent would perform
“stop checking,” the process of verifying each certificate number against a file it maintained
listing certificates reported stolen, missing, 25 or with “stop transfers” or legal holds. 26

22

Transfer agents may have reviewed indorsements but generally did not maintain signature cards for each
registered securityholder or otherwise verify authenticity of the signature by comparing it to specimen
signatures. Rather, the signature guarantee provided by the broker was intended to provide assurance
concerning the authenticity of the seller’s signature. Today, the signature guarantee process has been
enhanced and standardized through non-governmental Medallion guarantee programs. For additional
information regarding Medallion guarantees, see infra note 267.

23

Rockwell Study, supra note 19, at 53.

24

It was estimated that, in the mid- to late-1960s, window rejections were as high as 20 percent and
examination rejections were as high as 30 percent. Id.

25

Id. Today, there is a national system operated by the Securities Information Center (“SIC”) as the
Commission’s designee for maintaining a database concerning missing, lost, counterfeit, and stolen
securities that “reporting institutions” (brokers, dealers, registered transfer agents, certain types of banks,
and others) report information to and inquire into concerning the status of securities certificates. See
Exchange Act Rule 17f-1, 17 CFR 240.17f-1. However, transfer agents still maintain their own lists of
securities subject to stop transfers. For additional discussion of reporting requirements for lost and stolen
securities, see infra Sections IV.A.1 and IV.A.2.

26

A “stop transfer” or a “stop order” is a demand made by a registered securityholder to an issuer that a
security should not be transferred without the securityholder having an opportunity to assert a claim to the
security, typically because the security has been destroyed, lost, or stolen. See U.C.C. 8-403; Guttman,
supra note 6, at § B:11, form 62 (providing a form of stop transfer notice). Under U.C.C. 8-403, an
owner’s notification that a security certificate has been lost constitutes a demand that the issuer not register
transfer. U.C.C. 8-403, cmt. 2 (2005). If, after a stop transfer demand has become effective, a certificated
security in registered form is presented to an issuer with a request to register transfer (or an instruction is
presented to an issuer with a request to register transfer of an uncertificated security), the issuer must
promptly provide a notice with certain information to both the person who made the stop transfer demand
and the person seeking to transfer the security. See U.C.C. 8-403(b). When a security has been destroyed,
lost, stolen, or is otherwise missing, in addition to providing a stop transfer notice, a registered
securityholder commonly will seek to replace the security. The process of replacement is described in
detail infra in Section IV.A.2.

Page 15 of 208

The next step was to prepare the transfer journal entries documenting the cancellation of
the old certificate and the issuance of the new certificate. 27 Entering information into the transfer
journal was considered the most time consuming part of the transfer process because it was a
manual process, requiring gathering discrete pieces of information from different documents in
the transfer bundle. 28 Concurrently, the transfer agent would cancel the old certificate and
prepare a new certificate from the supply of blank certificates the transfer agent kept on hand. 29
Prior to sending certificates to a registrar, the transfer agent’s staff would perform several
audits to verify the accuracy of the transfer journal and new certificate. 30 After completion of
these audits, the transfer agent would send the certificates to a registrar, which would perform an
additional audit or quality control check primarily focused on verification that the share
quantities on the cancelled certificates and newly issued certificates matched and that the new
certificates were not issued in a manner resulting in an overissuance. 31 If the registrar was
independent of the transfer agent, as historically required by certain stock exchange rules, the
transfer agent would remove the window tickets from batches of securities to be sent to the

27

This record may also be referred to as a “transfer blotter,” or a “transfer log,” among other terms. As used
throughout this release, we refer to it as a “transfer journal.” A transfer journal is a continuous record of the
transfer of ownership of securities, including the identity of the party presenting the item for transfer,
whether the transfer was completed, and to whom the securities were made available

28

Rockwell Study, supra note 19, at 53.

29

Id. at 53-54, 57. These blank certificates typically would have been ordered by a corporate officer of the
issuer and been engraved by a bank note company before being delivered to the transfer agent. The
engraving was both aesthetic and a security feature designed to prevent counterfeiting. Id. at 100. To
avoid trading interruptions caused by running out of certificates, transfer agents had to carefully forecast
certificate demand and monitor their inventory of blank certificates. Id. Today, it is the understanding of
the Commission’s staff that some certificates may not be engraved but are produced by transfer agents
through “print-on-demand” services.

the bundles by messenger to the registrar, typically overnight. 32 The registrar would perform the
audit described above, countersign the new certificates, 33 and then return them to the transfer
agent. 34 The transfer agent would then need to reorganize the certificates and reattach them to
their window tickets before sending the new certificates and accompanying documents to the
designated receiving party, usually by messenger. 35
In 1977, the concept of the “uncertificated security” was introduced in Article 8 of the
UCC. 36 This innovation allowed issuers to issue uncertificated (i.e., certificateless) book-entry
securities, the transfer of which is greatly simplified compared to the transfer of certificated
securities because transfer can be effected and protected purchaser status can be achieved by
simply registering the transferee’s name on the books of the issuer. 37

Before the new certificate would be sent out to the designated receiving party, the transfer agent would also
countersign the new certificate. Thus, new certificates typically would include the signature of an officer of
the issuer and countersignatures by the transfer agent and registrar.

were cleared by small user-owned clearing corporations. In either instance, brokers had to settle
most transactions by physical delivery or receipt of certificates, and had to maintain an office or
establish a correspondent relationship with an entity with an office near the clearing agency.
As trading volume increased throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, the burdensome
manual process associated with transferring certificated securities created what came to be
known as the Paperwork Crisis. It was, at the time, “the most prolonged and severe crisis in the
securities industry” 41 since the Great Depression and to this day is one of the largest challenges
the U.S. securities markets have faced. The manual settlement processes for certificated
securities could not keep up with increasing trading volumes, deliveries to customers of both
cash and securities were frequently late, and stock certificates were lost in the rising tide of
paper. The substandard performance of transfer agents was “a significant contributing factor” to

39

A clearing agency may be referred to as a clearing corporation or a depository, depending on its functions.
Clearing corporations typically compare member transactions, clear, net and settle trades, and provide risk
management services, such as trade guarantees. Depositories immobilize securities by holding them on
deposit for their participants and effect transfers of interests in those securities through book-entry credits
and debits of participants’ accounts at the depository. For additional discussion, see infra Section III. See
also, e.g., Exchange Act Section 3(a)(23)(A), 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(23)(A) (defining the term “clearing
agency”); Clearing Agencies, SEC, https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrclearing.shtml (last visited
Nov. 25, 2015). Currently, DTC is both the only CSD in the United States and the only CSD registered
with the Commission as a clearing agency. See Exchange Act Section 3(a)(23)(A), 15 U.S.C.
78c(a)(23)(A) (requiring CSDs to register with the Commission as a clearing agency).

40

The term “OTC” refers generally to securities that are not listed on a national securities exchange. Many
equity securities, corporate bonds, municipal securities, government securities, and certain derivative
products are traded in the OTC market. The OTC Bulletin Board (“OTCBB”), which is a facility of
FINRA, for example, is an electronic inter-dealer quotation system that displays quotes, last-sale prices,
and volume information for many securities that are not listed on a national securities exchange, including
domestic, foreign and American depository receipts (ADRs). For additional discussion, see, e.g., Over the
Counter Market, SEC, https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrotc.shtml (last visited Nov. 20, 2015).

the Paperwork Crisis. 42 At times during 1967 and 1968, the New York Stock Exchange
(“NYSE”) closed early on some days and during a substantial portion of 1968 closed entirely on
Wednesdays to attempt to allow the brokerages and other firms to keep up with the volume. 43
In the immediate aftermath of the Paperwork Crisis, more than 100 broker-dealers went
bankrupt or were acquired by other firms and “[t]he inability of the securities industry to deal
with its serious operational problems . . . contributed greatly to the loss of investor confidence in
the efficiency and safety of [the U.S.] capital markets.” 44 However, other consequences of the
Paperwork Crisis were deeper and longer lasting. As discussed below, over the next years and
decades, Congress, federal and state regulators, and industry participants, including brokers,
dealers, banks, and securities exchanges, worked together to drastically reshape critical
operational aspects of the securities industry, ultimately leading to major revisions to both
federal and state securities laws, and the advent of the modern national market system and
National C&S System as they exist today.

reduce or eliminate the problems associated with the traditional process for transferring
certificated securities. First, in June 1968, the NYSE established the Central Certificate Service
(“CCS”) as a division of the Stock Clearing Corporation. Broker-dealers and banks who were
members of the NYSE were permitted to deposit their certificated securities with CCS, which
would hold the certificates in custody and transfer them into the name of a CCS nominee. 45 The
certificated securities deposited by that member would be represented by an appropriate bookentry credit reflected in that member’s account at CCS. Because all securities held by CCS were
registered in its nominee’s name, deliveries of securities between CCS members could be
effected by appropriate credits and debits to the members’ securities accounts rather than by
physical delivery of certificates. In this manner members’ accounts would be debited and
credited to reflect transactions among them, but the registered owner of the securities – CCS’s
nominee – would never change. Movement of certificates was thus eliminated, resulting in their
“immobilization.” 46 At the time, CCS was the most prominent example of the central securities
depository model discussed below in Section II.B.2. In 1970, CCS opened its services to

45

Unsafe Practices Study, supra note 17, at 184. The registration of securities into the name of a nominee
rather than the name of the investor is commonly referred to as “street name” registration, which stands for
“Wall Street name.” See The Stock Market, supra note 8, at 249-251, 307. A nominee is usually a
partnership formed exclusively to act as the record holder of securities and thereby to facilitate their
transfer. See Preliminary Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission on the Practice of Recording
the Ownership of Securities in the Records of the Issuer in Other than the Name of the Beneficial Owner of
Such Securities 2-15 (Dec. 4, 1975) (“Preliminary Street Name Study”) (providing extensive discussion of
the history of the practice of nominees and street name ownership, the scope of the practice, the concept of
beneficial ownership and then-current practices). For further discussion of registered ownership and street
name ownership (or beneficial ownership), see infra Section III.A. See also infra note 87, regarding DTC’s

members of the American Stock Exchange, 47 and in 1973 CCS changed its name to the
Depository Trust Company (“DTC”). 48
Rockwell Study (1969)
Around the same time, the American Stock Exchange hired the North American
Rockwell Information Systems Company to study and appraise the securities industry’s
operations. In 1969, it produced the Rockwell Study. Among other things, the Rockwell Study
found that the securities industry’s operations were unnecessarily complicated and had not kept
pace with technology and recommended that the actual physical movement of securities be
reduced. 49
To address unnecessary complexity, for example, the Rockwell Study focused on
whether more efficient clearance and settlement of securities could be achieved by allowing
single entities to perform both registrar and transfer agent functions. If so, the entity would need
to function in a way that still would preserve the independent audit and shareholder protection
function that a registrar historically was viewed, by many participants in the securities industry,
as providing. 50 However, at the time when the Commission adopted the majority of its transfer

agent rules in 1977 and 1983, independent registrars were still present in the marketplace and
indeed were required by the NYSE until 1984. 51
To reduce the physical movement of securities, the Rockwell Study recommended the
establishment of individual transfer agent depositories (“TADs”), which was, at the time, a
theoretical proposal that had not been implemented in any market. 52 As proposed, the TAD
model would have established a national clearing system together with a decentralized network
of individual transfer agent depositories. Securityholders would immobilize their certificated
securities by depositing them for custody with the transfer agent for the issuer, effectively
making each transfer agent an independent depository for its respective issuers. The transfer
agent would maintain the issuer’s register, or records of registered shareholders, in electronic
form on behalf of the issuer and would settle transactions by debiting and crediting the securities
accounts of the respective parties to the transaction on the issuer’s register instead of delivering
physical certificates. 53 Thus, the account on which transfers took place would also be the
issuer’s register, which would allow transfers to be effected by simply removing the seller’s
name from the register (i.e., debiting the seller’s securities account) and adding the buyer’s name
(i.e., crediting the buyer’s securities account). The national clearing system proposed under the
TAD model would settle all securities transactions, both exchange and OTC trades, by receiving

However, at that time, the American Stock Exchange did not require an independent registrar. Rockwell

that eliminated the requirement to use a separate transfer agent and registrar, subject to certain conditions.

the compared trades 54 directly from the floor of the exchange and receiving OTC trades by
messenger or other delivery service. 55 Compared trades would then be transmitted to the
appropriate TAD, where, as noted above, the respective accounts of the parties would be credited
and debited. 56 As with the CCS system established by the NYSE, the movement of certificates
would be eliminated, resulting in their immobilization.
Arthur Little Study (1969)
From July 1968 to April 1969, Arthur D. Little & Co. conducted a study for the National
Association of Securities Dealers (“NASD”) on the problem of settlement fails, 57 titled, “The
Multiple Causes of Fails in Stock Clearing in the United States With Particular Emphasis in
Over-The-Counter Securities” (“Arthur Little Study”). Among other things, the Arthur Little
Study compared the performance of two different types of clearing systems: (a) the “balance
order system” used by the New York, American, and National OTC Clearing Corporations, and
(b) the “net by net” or “continuous netting system” used by the Pacific Coast Stock Clearing
Corporation and the Midwest Stock Exchange Clearing Corporation. 58 The study showed that

54

Trade comparison, resulting in a compared trade, is the post-execution act of matching the two sides of a
trade and confirming the existence of a contract and the trade’s exact terms (security, parties, time of trade,
number of units, and price), usually by the exchange. It is generally regarded as the first step in the
clearance and settlement process. See The October 1987 Market Break, A Report by the Division of
Market Regulation, 10-2, 10-4 (1988) (“October 1987 Market Break Report”).

A settlement fail occurs if a seller does not deliver securities or a buyer does not deliver funds owed by the
settlement date.

58

See Arthur D. Little, Inc., The Multiple Causes of Fails in Stock Clearing in the United States 2414, 21-22
(“Arthur Little Study”). In the balance order system, after comparing the trades completed for the day by
each clearing corporation participant, the clearing corporation would net each participant’s trades in each
security and issue orders for the net sellers to deliver, and the net buyers to receive, specific amounts of
securities at the established settlement price directly from other participants. The duty to deliver and the

Page 23 of 208

the balance order system could reduce securities movement by approximately 25 percent and the
continuous netting system could result in a 50 percent reduction. 59 The Arthur Little Study,
along with the NASD, concluded that the best nationwide clearance and settlement system would
be one consisting of interconnected regional clearing centers, each using the net by net (or
continuous net settlement) system. 60
Formation of the National Clearing Corporation (1969)
In December 1969, the NASD formed the National Clearing Corporation (“NCC”) as the
vehicle for developing and implementing a nationwide system of interconnected regional
clearinghouses that would form a national OTC clearing system utilizing continuous net
settlement. NCC took over the operations of the National Over-the-Counter Clearing
Corporation and eventually grew to include OTC transactions in all issues listed on exchanges or
included on the NASDAQ system. 61 In 1977, NCC merged with the clearing facilities of both
the NYSE and the American Stock Exchange to form the National Securities Clearing

duty to receive would be allocated in such a way that, for each issue traded, the net seller would have to
make only one delivery and the net buyer would receive only one delivery, which could result in
participants receiving from or delivering to other participants with whom they did not transact that day. In
the net by net (or continuous net settlement system), each of the participant’s trades in every security were
netted for that day, so that each participant would be either a net seller or a net buyer for a particular
security, and the duty to deliver the net sales or receive the net purchase would be added to any outstanding
deliver or receive obligations of that participant in that security. In addition, all deliveries and receipts
would be made to or from the clearing corporation, rather than between other participants, as in the balance
order system. Unsafe Practices Study, supra note 17, at 167 n.6.

NASDAQ stands for National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations and was founded in
1971 by the NASD as an electronic quotation system. It later developed into an electronic stock market,
primarily focused on the OTC market and today is registered with the Commission as a national securities
exchange under Section 6 of the Exchange Act. See Exchange Act Section 6, 15 U.S.C. 78f; Teweles,

other services, including continuous net settlement of trades and payments, to its participants.
BASIC Study (1970)
In early 1970, around the same time that CCS extended its services to the American
Stock Exchange, the Banking and Securities Industry Committee (“BASIC”) was formed by
banking and securities industry participants to find solutions to problems affecting both those
industries. 62 After more than a year of review and analysis, BASIC advocated the
immobilization of securities certificates through a “Central Securities Depository System for the
entire securities industry comprised of regional depositories with an inter-connection between
the depositories.” 63 There was also agreement that “the certificate must be eliminated, but that
this will take time.” 64

Regulatory and Industry Responses (1971-1975)

Unsafe Practices Study (1971)
In 1970, Congress enacted the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 which
established the Securities Investor Protection Corporation for the broad purpose of affording
financial protection for the customers of registered brokers and dealers. 65 The act also directed
the Commission to conduct a study into the causes and potential responses to the Paperwork

BASIC was formed in March 1970 as an outgrowth of a joint committee established between
representatives of the securities and banking industries in 1968. BASIC was sponsored by the NYSE and
American Stock Exchange, the NASD, and the 11 New York Clearing House banks. Securities Industry

Crisis. 66 In response, the Commission held meetings, a conference, and hearings that included
participation by market participants and federal bank regulators to identify and correct
operational and financial problems in the securities industry, and then produced the Unsafe
Practices Study. 67 The Unsafe Practices Study in part concluded that the inherent inefficiencies
and risks associated with the processing of physical securities certificates contributed to the
Paperwork Crisis, and it was therefore necessary to reduce the amount of paperwork connected
with securities transfers. 68 There was disagreement, however, regarding the best way to
accomplish this goal.
Although it was generally recognized at the time that the complete elimination of
certificated securities, known as “dematerialization,” was the best approach to eliminating the
risks associated with the processing of physical securities, due to technological and legal
impediments, dematerialization was viewed as a “utopian solution” that “would require very
extensive legal work and lead time to implement.” 69 Indeed, as noted above, two of the leading
proposed securities settlement models designed to reduce the amount of paperwork being
discussed at that time – the central depository system represented by CCS and the TAD system –
would have resulted in the immobilization of securities rather than dematerialization, and

concerning restructuring of the securities markets).

Saunders, Folk on the Delaware General Corporation Law §158.4 (5th ed. 2013).

therefore were viewed as “interim measures for efficient operations” that could be taken
immediately but would also “serve as building blocks for that ultimate objective” of
dematerialization. 70
While there was widespread industry support for the TAD model, there were legal and
technological impediments to its immediate implementation. 71 In contrast, the central depository
system model had already been established on a limited basis as the CCS established by NYSE,
although it had not been implemented on a national basis. The proposal being discussed at the
time would use CCS as a starting point and gradually expand it into a New York central
securities depository that would link to similar regional depositories of other major financial
centers, thus resulting in each depository having an account at the others. 72 This would allow
members of one depository to transact with members of, and effect the delivery of securities via,
the other depositories. 73 Under this approach, no one depository would be restricted solely to the
specific members or securities listed on a particular exchange. Like the TAD, this approach
resulted in immobilization rather than dematerialization, but instead of a decentralized network
of transfer agents acting as individual depositories for issuers, all paper securities certificates for
all issuers would be deposited into one or more central pools and kept in custody by such central
depositories. Under this model, the more certificates deposited into a central depository, the
more efficient the system would be.

Securities Industry Study (1973)
Following publication of the Commission’s Unsafe Practices Study, the Senate
Subcommittee on Securities conducted its own 18-month study, which resulted in the Securities
Industry Study of 1973 Report (“Securities Industry Study”). 74 The Securities Industry Study
found “two primary functional causes” for the Paperwork Crisis: (i) the securities industry had
failed to develop a nationwide system for clearance and settlement of securities transactions; and
(ii) there existed a lack of uniformity and coordination among the various methods of clearing
and settlement in use. The Securities Industry Study’s recommendations included the following:
(i) that the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) be amended to “make it clear”
that the Commission has the “power and the responsibility to direct the evolution of clearance
and settlement methods employed by the national securities associations and by broker-dealers
engaged in interstate commerce;” (ii) that legislation should “requir[e] clearing agencies and
depositories to register with and report to the SEC and empower the Commission to review and
amend the rules of such entities;” (iii) that “the Commission be directed to proceed with dispatch
toward elimination of the stock certificate as a means of settlement between broker-dealers…”;
and (iv) that “the Commission be directed to consider the practice of registering securities in
‘street name….’” 75

The Securities Industry Study ultimately led to Congress enacting the Securities Act
Amendments of 1975 (“1975 Amendments”), 76 which made sweeping changes to the federal
securities laws, implemented many of the principal recommendations from the Securities
Industry Study, and established both the national market system 77 and the National C&S System
as they exist today. 78 In particular, in the new statute, Congress directed the Commission to,
among other things: (i) “facilitate the establishment of a national system for the prompt and
accurate clearance and settlement of transactions in securities;” 79 (ii) “end the physical
movement of securities certificates in connection with the settlement among brokers and dealers
of transactions in securities;” 80 and (iii) establish a system for reporting missing, lost, counterfeit,
and stolen securities. 81

Advent of the Modern Clearance and Settlement System (1975present)

Early Proliferation of Clearing Agencies
Between 1968 and 1975, in addition to CCS (now known as DTC), several other
securities depositories were established, including by the Midwest Stock Exchange, Inc., the
Pacific Stock Exchange, and TAD Depository Corporation. The number of shares evidenced by
certificates immobilized in depositories increased between 1968 and 1976 from approximately
400 million to over 4 billion. 82 On November 3, 1975, pursuant to its new authority and
directives under the 1975 Amendments, the Commission adopted Rule 17Ab2-1(c)(1) and Form
CA-1 for the registration of clearing agencies, including central securities depositories. 83 Later
in 1975, the Commission granted temporary registrations as clearing agencies to nine entities,
that were either clearing corporations or securities depositories. 84 Shortly after NSCC was
formed in 1977 through the merger of NCC and the clearing facilities of the NYSE and
American Stock Exchange, NSCC also sought, and was granted, temporary registration as a
clearing corporation. The Commission also granted temporary registrations as a clearing

Advances in Technology (1976-present)
Over the next several decades, factors such as technology enhancements and regulatory
changes led to the increased prevalence of securities depositories, and many of them
substantially expanded their services and participant base, especially DTC. Of particular note, in
1975, DTC introduced the Fast Automated Securities Transfer (“FAST”) Program, which was
approved by the Commission in 1976. 86 Among other things, it reduced the costs and risks
associated with moving street name securities between DTC and participants.
Prior to FAST, transferring securities to or from DTC on behalf of its participants
required moving certificated securities back and forth between DTC and transfer agents. For
securities being deposited with DTC, participants would send certificates to DTC, which would
then send the certificates to the transfer agent for re-registration into the name of DTC’s
partnership nominee, Cede & Co., 87 before returning the reregistered certificates to DTC. For
securities being withdrawn from DTC, DTC would send the certificates registered in the name of

Securities Exchange Act Release No. 12353 (Apr. 20, 1976), 41 FR 17823 (Apr. 28, 1976) (File No. SRDTC-76-3). The FAST Program was introduced in 1976 with ten transfer agents and 400 securities issues.

The name Cede & Co. was drawn from the term “certificate depository” and it was formed as a partnership
partly because it was considered simpler to effect a transfer of securities registered in the name of a
partnership nominee than in the name of a corporation. For more information about Cede & Co., including
regarding the terms of its partnership agreement, see S. Rep. No. 93-62 (1974) (“Disclosure of Corporate
Ownership”).

Cede & Co. to the transfer agent for re-registration into the name designated by the withdrawing
participant, and the transfer agent then returned to DTC both the reregistered certificate (which
DTC would then deliver to the withdrawing participant or other entity designated by the
participant) and a separate certificate registered in the name of Cede & Co. representing the
remainder of DTC’s position. 88
The FAST Program substantially reduced the movement of paper certificates by
permitting transfer agents to become custodians for balance certificates registered in the name of
Cede & Co. The balance certificate represents on the transfer agent’s books the sum total of
shares for that issue held by all of DTC’s participants. 89 Participants maintain corresponding
books representing their securityholder accounts held in street name. Then, when securities are
deposited into or withdrawn from DTC, FAST transfer agents adjust the denomination of the
balance certificates and electronically confirm the changes with DTC on a daily basis, with the
corresponding participant accounts adjusted accordingly by DTC. 90
In 1983, DTC adopted technological enhancements to its Participant Terminal System
which allowed participants to automatically match book-entry receive notifications and facilitate
redelivery to other participants. 91 DTC also partnered with NSCC to provide an Institutional

Delivery System which, through an interface with NSCC’s continuous net settlement system
(“CNS”), allowed brokers to net the often very large trades made for institutional customers
instead of settling trade-for-trade at DTC. In 1996, the Direct Registration System (“DRS”) was
implemented, which allowed investors to hold uncertificated securities in registered form directly
on the books of the issuer’s transfer agent. 92 DRS also allowed investors to transfer the shares to
and from a brokerage account through FAST when they choose to sell or transfer the stock. 93
A number of legal and regulatory changes also led to increased participation at securities
depositories among banks and broker-dealers. For example, in 1978, the UCC was revised to
substitute the concept of delivery of securities specific to the physical delivery of certificated
securities with the concept of “transfer” by book-entry on the books of a central depository. 94 As
a result, the only book-entry transfers that qualified the transferee for protected purchaser rights
under the UCC, as discussed above in Section II.A, were those made on the books of a clearing
corporation.
In 1982 and 1983, the NASD and five stock exchanges, including the NYSE and
American Stock Exchange, amended their rules to require their members to use a Commissionregistered securities depository for the confirmation, affirmation and settlement of transactions in

92

See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 37931 (Nov. 7, 1996), 61 FR 58600 (Nov. 15, 1996) (File
No. SR-DTC-96-15) (approving establishment of DRS). Prior to the advent of DRS, unless they were held
on a transfer agent’s books through a direct stock purchase plan or dividend reinvestment plan, book-entry
shares generally could only be held by beneficial owners in street name through FAST. For more detail on
DRS, see infra Section IV.C.2. See also infra note 144 (dividend reinvestment plan).

93

If the securityholder wants to sell the shares, they are transferred into a broker’s account by means of an
“Electronic Participant Instruction” through DTC’s proprietary communication network, the Profile
Modification System (“Profile”), through which the shares are re-registered in the name of Cede & Co.

depository eligible securities if the member provides its customer with delivery-versus-payment
privileges. 95 Delivery versus payment privileges allow payments to be made prior to or
simultaneously with delivery of the securities. Because customers typically wanted those
privileges, the rules had the effect of requiring the use of a registered securities depository to
clear and settle institutional trades. As a result, DTC participation soared. In 1995 and 1996,
several exchanges adopted uniform depository eligibility requirements, paving the way for an
industry standard for depository eligibility determinations. 96 Finally, 1997 revisions to UCC
Article 8 modernized securities holding rules by allowing depositories to make eligible
additional foreign securities that are held through foreign custodians as well as other financial
instruments. 97 New York’s adoption of these revisions enabled DTC to use foreign banks as
custodians. This increased DTC’s ability to maintain custody of securities abroad, 98 which
resulted in additional foreign securities and other financial products and instruments becoming
depository eligible. 99

Clearing Agency Consolidation (1980s-present)
Throughout the late 1980s and mid-1990s, DTC merged with or absorbed business from
several other depositories, leading to its further growth. First, in April 1987, the Pacific Stock
Exchange Board of Governors closed the Pacific Securities Depository Trust Company.
Virtually all eligible securities in its custody were moved to DTC. Then, in 1995, DTC and
NSCC worked together to absorb the business of Midwest Securities Trust Company and
Midwest Clearing Corporation in light of the Chicago Stock Exchange’s decision to exit the
clearing and settlement business.
By the late 1990s, DTC had become the largest depository in the United States, and
NSCC was the largest clearing agency. 100 On June 15, 1999, the Commission issued an order
approving DTC’s integration with NSCC.101 The Commission’s order authorized DTC and
NSCC to restructure their boards of directors so that one board served both corporations. 102 The
Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”), a holding company, was subsequently
formed with DTC and NSCC as its subsidiaries.
Today, DTC provides depository and book-entry settlement services for substantially all
corporate and municipal debt, equity securities, asset-backed securities, and money market
instruments available for trading in the United States. 103 It provides custody and asset services

transactions, with a value of approximately $600 billion, are completed at DTC each day. 105
DTC provides three primary services: (i) custody services; (ii) asset services, such as dividend
and interest payment, reorganizations, and proxy services; and (iii) settlement services (through
its interface with NSCC), all of which help facilitate the National C&S System mandated by the
1975 Amendments.

TRANSFER AGENT ROLE IN CLEARANCE AND SETTLEMENT PROCESSES
Because transfer agents operate within the National C&S System, it is important to

understand that system, especially concerning the services transfer agents provide by maintaining
accurate ownership records on behalf of issuers, facilitating the issuance or cancellation of
securities, and distributing dividends within that system. Accordingly, this section provides a
general overview of transfer agents’ operations and processes within the National C&S System.
A.

Types of Security Ownership

Under the current centralized depository model in the United States, there are two types
of securities owners: (a) registered and (b) beneficial.
1.

Registered Securityholders

Under state corporation law, certain securityholder rights commonly accrue only to those
registered on the securityholder list and not to persons who may have an ultimate economic
interest in the shares but who are not registered securityholders. 106 Registered securityholders

See, e.g., Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, § 219(c) (right to examine the stockholder list or to vote in person or by
proxy at any meeting of stockholders limited to registered securityholders).

Page 36 of 208

(who may also be referred to as “holders of record”) 107 own and hold securities in “registered
form.” 108 The UCC provides that an “issuer…may treat the registered owner as the person
exclusively entitled to vote, receive notifications, and otherwise exercise all the rights and
powers of an owner.” 109 Registered securityholders are listed directly on the records of the
issuer or the issuer’s transfer agent under their own names. 110 The issuer or its transfer agent
may have direct contact with the registered securityholder, keep the records that reflect the
ownership interest of the registered securityholder, and provide services directly to the registered
securityholder. These services may include issuing, cancelling and transferring shares, making
distributions, providing communications and mailings from the issuer, and answering
securityholder inquiries. Registered owners can hold their securities either in certificated form or
in uncertificated (i.e., book-entry) form, such as uncertificated securities held through DRS. 111

107

See Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-9(a)(3), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-9(a)(3) (referring to “securityholder’s
registration”); Exchange Act Rule17Ad-9(a)(4), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-9(a)(4) (referring to “registered
securityholder”); Exchange Act Rule 12g5-1, 17 CFR 240.12g5-1 (“securities shall be deemed to be ‘held
of record’ by each person who is identified as the owner of such securities on records of security holders
maintained by or on behalf of the issuer”).

108

See U.C.C. 8-102(a)(13). (“‘Registered form,’ as applied to a certificated security, means a form in which:
(i) the security certificate specifies a person entitled to the security; and (ii) a transfer of the security may be
registered upon books maintained for that purpose by or on behalf of the issuer, or the security certificate so
states.”)

109

U.C.C. 8-207.

110

Because a registered securityholder may be either a natural person or a legal entity, such as a partnership,
trust, or corporation, transfer agents generally are familiar with issues that may arise with respect to a
registered securityholder’s legal status in connection with securities processing transactions. See Guttman,
supra note 6, at § 5:19-5:28 (discussing different “aggregate” and corporate types of registered
securityholders).

111

A registered securityholder’s options for holding uncertificated securities, through DRS or otherwise, will
be subject to the issuer’s governing documents and the law of its jurisdiction of organization, as well as to
other legal requirements that may apply to the issuer, such as rules of SROs such as DTC and national
securities exchanges. For additional discussion of DRS, see supra note 92 and infra Section IV.

2.

Beneficial Owners

The vast majority of securityholders in the U.S. are beneficial owners rather than
registered owners. 112 Beneficial owners do not own the securities directly but generally have
purchased them through an intermediary, such as a broker or a bank, and determined to hold
them in street name through a book-entry account with that intermediary. The intermediary,
rather than the transfer agent, maintains and updates the securityholder records, facilitates or
executes transfers, and provides other services for the securityholder. 113
When securities are held in street name, there is a legal distinction between the nominee,
who has legal status as the registered securityholder, and the person with economic or beneficial
ownership of the security. 114 Securities held in street name are legally owned by and registered
in the name of the depository’s nominee (most often DTC’s nominee, Cede & Co.). The
individual investor’s broker (or other intermediary) who is a member or participant of the
depository will be identified on the books of the depository as having a “securities
entitlement” 115 to a pro rata share of the fungible bulk of that security held by the depository. 116

112

For more information regarding beneficial ownership, see, e.g., Final Street Name Study, supra note 82;

42982 (July 22, 2010) (“Proxy Concept Release”); Holding Your Securities—Get the Facts, SEC, available
at http://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/holdsec.htm.

113

These transfer and recordkeeping services provided to beneficial owners by intermediaries may be referred
to as “sub-transfer agent” services. For more information, see infra Section VII.B.

114

For additional detail concerning aspects of beneficial ownership, see Preliminary Street Name Study, supra
note 45, at 9-11. For an example of reference in a rule of the Commission to “beneficial owner[s],” see,
e.g., Exchange Act Rule 13d-3, 17 CFR 240.13d-3 (determination of beneficial owner).

115

See U.C.C. 8-102(a)(7) (defining “entitlement holder” as a person identified in the records of a securities
intermediary as the person having a security entitlement against the securities intermediary); U.C.C 8102(a)(17) (defining “security entitlement”); U.C.C. 8-102(a)(14) (defining “securities intermediary” as (i)
a clearing corporation or (ii) a person, including a bank or broker, that in the ordinary course of its business
maintains securities accounts for others and is acting in that capacity); U.C.C. 8-503(b) (providing that an

Correspondingly, the individual investor will be identified on the books of the depository
participant (his or her broker or other intermediary) as having a securities entitlement to a pro
rata share of the securities in which the participant has an interest. At each level, the
intermediary will be obligated to provide the entitlement holder with payments and distributions
with respect to the financial asset and to exercise rights as directed by the entitlement holder. 117
A securities intermediary satisfies such duties where the intermediary acts as required by any
agreement between the intermediary and entitlement holder. 118 The entitlement holder will be
permitted to look only to the intermediary for performance of the obligations. 119 Other rights
and interests that a beneficial owner has against a securities intermediary’s property are created
by agreements between the beneficial owner and the securities intermediary.

entitlement holder’s property interest with respect to a particular financial asset under [U.C.C. 8-503(a)] is
a pro rata property interest in all interests in that financial asset held by the securities intermediary).
116

For securities held in “fungible bulk,” there are no specifically identifiable shares directly owned by DTC
participants. Rather, each participant owns a pro rata interest in the aggregate number of shares of a
particular issuer held at DTC. In turn, each customer, such as an individual investor of a DTC participant,
owns a pro rata interest in the shares in which the DTC participant has an interest. See Processing of
Tender Offers Within the National Clearance and Settlement System, Exchange Act Release No. 19678,

Clearance and Settlement Process

The clearance and settlement process differs depending on the type of security being
traded, how the security is held by the investor (i.e., registered or beneficial form), the market or
exchange on which it is traded, and the specific entities and institutions involved. Yet, regardless
of the specific variables involved, the basic clearance and settlement processes are substantially
similar. For illustration purposes, this section describes generally the clearance and settlement
process for exchange-based equity trades held in street name.
All securities trades involve a legally binding agreement that sets forth the terms of the
trade. In general, the “clearing” of those trades is the process of comparing and confirming the
material terms of the agreement: (i) the identity of the buyer and seller; (ii) the identity and
quantity of the securities being traded; and (iii) the price, date, and other material details of the
trade. 120 Clearing can be “bilateral,” where the parties to the transaction work directly with each
other to take the steps necessary to clear the transaction, or “central,” where a third party, such as
a clearing agency, undertakes the steps necessary to clear the transaction. 121
Settlement is the fulfillment by the parties to the transaction of their respective
obligations for the trade, usually by exchanging funds for the delivery of securities. For equities,

120

121

Prior to the 1980s, central clearing predominantly involved a two-sided matching process conducted mainly
by the exchanges, where an exchange collected trade data and passed that information to the clearing
agency. After the October 1987 Market Break led to significant numbers of unmatched trades, the
Commission recommended that automated systems should be used to facilitate comparison at or near the
time of trade execution. See Securities and Exchange Commission Recommendations regarding the
October 1987 Market Break, contained in Testimony delivered by David S. Ruder, Chairman, Securities
and Exchange Commission, before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, p. 23
(Feb. 3, 1988). The recommendation was subsequently adopted in stages. See, e.g., New York Stock
Exchange, Inc. “Overnight Trade Comparison,” adopted Aug. 14, 1989, Exchange Act Release No. 27096
(Aug. 3, 1989), 54 FR 33299 (Aug. 14, 1989).

Page 40 of 208

settlement generally occurs three business days after the trade date (i.e., “T+3”), 122 although
other arrangements may be available by private agreement. 123 Delivery currently is far more
likely to be by book-entry than by exchange of physical certificates. As previously discussed,
the brokers’ certificates in DTC’s depository are held in fungible bulk and registered in the name
of Cede & Co. to facilitate book-entry transactions involving electronic debits (on the seller’s
side) and credits (on the buyer’s side) to the brokers’ securities accounts at the depository rather
than the movement of physical securities certificates. Because these shares are held in street
name, DTC knows the names of the brokers who are DTC participants (often referred to as
clearing brokers) but not the names of brokers who are not DTC participants (often referred to as
introducing brokers) or either type of brokers’ customers. 124 The brokers track the holdings of
their customers who are the ultimate beneficial owners of the securities. For securities held in
fungible bulk, rights are passed from record owner Cede & Co. through securities intermediaries
to the ultimate beneficial owner.
Equity trades that are cleared and settled through DTC’s facilities are generally processed
in NSCC’s CNS system, with final settlement on the third business day after the trade is
executed. NSCC has approximately 1,000 members, made up of brokers, dealers, banks, and
other intermediaries. Using CNS, NSCC nets multilaterally all of the clearing participants’

122

See Exchange Act Rule 15c6-1, 17 CFR 240.15c6-1. T (or T+0) is the day the trade is executed. The first
business day following the trade date is T+1, and so on. Thus, assuming there are no non-business days in
the week, a trade that is executed on a Monday (T or T+0) would settle on Thursday (T+3). A trade
executed on Friday would settle on the following Wednesday (Saturday and Sunday are not business days,
so T+1 is Monday, T+2 is Tuesday, etc.).

123

See, e.g., NYSE Rule 64 (2009).

purchases and sales in each security to one security position per participant per day in order to
arrive at a daily net settlement obligation for each participant. NSCC then makes deliveries only
on the remaining net positions through settlement accounts that the participants hold with DTC
(for securities) and the Federal Reserve System (for cash). 125 Because NSCC interposes itself
between trading brokers on each trade and guarantees the settlement as each broker’s
counterparty, 126 each broker’s settlement is with NSCC and DTC, not with the other clearing
participant, which reduces the brokers’ exposure to risk of default by other brokers (i.e.,
counterparty risk). A broker can either settle each day or carry open commitments forward to
net against the next business day’s settlement (hence the continuous nature of CNS). 127 On the
cash side of the trade, all money owed to or from a particular DTC participant will be netted
down each day by NSCC to a single dollar amount, which reduces the amount of money firms
need to have on hand to settle their obligations.
The goal of netting is to minimize the number and value of transactions required for
buyers and sellers (or the firms acting on their behalf) to settle their transactions. For example, if
a broker purchases 100 shares of XYZ stock for a customer and sold 50 shares of XYZ stock for
another customer, at the end of the day the broker’s securities account at DTC would be credited
with 50 shares of XYZ (the net difference between buying 100 shares and selling 50 shares). If

the broker paid $25 per share to buy the 100 shares of XYZ and sold the 50 shares for the same
price on the same day, at the end of the day the broker’s cash account would be debited $1,250.
The vast majority of equity trades handled by DTC clear and settle through NSCC’s CNS,
which, on average, results in an reduction of the volume of settlement transactions by
approximately 98%. 128 As a result, on average, 99% of all trade obligations that occur in U.S.
equity markets do not require the exchange of money. 129
For illustration purposes only, Figure 1 below depicts one possible example of how an
equity trade effected on a national securities exchange is cleared and settled, beginning with the
buyer conveying an order to an executing broker. If the executing broker is a member of NSCC
it may be referred to as a “clearing broker.” If it is not a member of NSCC, it may be referred to
as an “introducing broker” or “correspondent broker,” depending on whether the broker carries
and is responsible for the customer’s account. Where the executing broker is a member of
NSCC (i.e., a clearing broker) it routes the order for execution to a national securities exchange.
Where the executing broker is not a member of NSCC (i.e., an introducing or correspondent
broker) it routes the order to a clearing broker who will then route the order for execution to a
national securities exchange. The national securities exchange matches the order with a
corresponding sell order and then sends matched trade data to NSCC. NSCC nets these orders
using its CNS system. If the securities are held in street name, there will be no change to the

crediting and debiting the securities entitlement accounts of the buyer and seller, respectively.
Thus, final settlement of the securities leg of the transaction will involve the following sequential
steps: (i) the DTC securities account of the seller’s clearing broker will be debited with the
securities being purchased; (ii) NSCC’s securities account at DTC will be credited with the
securities purchased; (iii) the DTC securities account of the buyer’s clearing broker will also be
credited; and (iv) each broker will credit or debit their respective customers’ securities accounts
held with the broker. On the cash side, final settlement will involve the following sequential
steps: (i) the Federal Reserve bank account of the buyer’s clearing broker will be debited for the
sale price of the securities; (ii) DTC’s Federal Reserve bank account will credited for the sale
price of the securities; (iii) DTC will transfer this cash to the Federal Reserve bank account of
the seller’s Clearing Broker; and (iv) each broker will credit or debit its respective customers’
cash accounts held with the broker.

TRANSFER AGENT REGULATION: ORIGINS AND CURRENT STATUS
This section provides a general overview of the federal and state law and other

requirements, such as those of self-regulatory organizations (“SRO”), that apply to transfer
agents and their activities. We begin with a review and discussion of each of the Commission’s
Page 45 of 208

current transfer agent rules, then briefly discuss banking regulations and taxation-related
requirements that may apply to transfer agents. 131 We then review the requirements of SROs
that apply to transfer agents, particularly DTC and NYSE rules. Finally, we discuss the
regulation of transfer agents under state law. Later, in Sections V, VI, and VII of the release, we
discuss issues and concerns related to modern transfer agent activities and seek comment on the
best approach to addressing them.
A.

Federal Transfer Agent Rules

Prior to 1975, most transfer agents were banks or trusts. 132 There was no federal
regulation of transfer agents and transfer agents were subject to state law, generally pursuant to
UCC provisions. 133 Transfer agents were also subject to stock exchange requirements regarding
securities processing. For example, in 1869, the NYSE adopted a requirement that all shares of
NYSE-listed companies must be registered at a bank or other agency. 134 As another example,
the “Chambers Street Rule” of the NYSE required transfer agents to maintain offices for transfer
south of Chambers Street in New York City. 135 The American Stock Exchange had similar
requirements in its Rule 891. 136

131

See Section IV.B, supra, for discussion of bank transfer agents. Transfer agents that are not banks may be
referred to as non-bank transfer agents.

No. SR-DTC-96-09) (mentioning American Stock Exchange Rule 891 requirements). These requirements
were criticized by non-New York banks providing transfer agent services as many banks viewed providing

Page 46 of 208

The 1975 Amendments gave the Commission regulatory authority for the first time over
transfer agents. 137 Section 3(a)(25) of the Exchange Act defines a “transfer agent” as any person
who engages on behalf of an issuer of securities or on behalf of itself as an issuer of securities in:
(A)

countersigning such securities upon issuance;

(B)

monitoring the issuance of such securities with a view to preventing
unauthorized issuance (i.e., a registrar); 138

(C)

registering the transfer of such securities;

(D)

exchanging or converting such securities; or

(E)

transferring record ownership of securities by bookkeeping entry without
the physical issuance of securities certificates. 139

Section 17A(c)(1) of the Exchange Act requires any person performing any of these
functions with respect to any security registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act or
with respect to any security which would be required to be registered except for the exemption
contained in subsection (g)(2)(B) or (g)(2)(G) of Section 12 (“Qualifying Security”) to register

transfer agent services as an important part of providing the full-service relationship it was believed was
desired by corporate borrower clients. See Charles Welles, The Great Paper Fight: Who Will Control the
Machinery?, Institutional Investor (May 1973), Hearings on S.2058 before S. Comm. on Banking, Hous.
and Urban Affairs, Subcomm. on Securities, 93rd Cong. 334 (1973). The NYSE amended the Chambers
Street Rule in 1971, permitting out-of-town transfer agents to act as listed company transfer agents, subject
to certain conditions including that they maintain a “drop” office in lower Manhattan. In 2005, the
Commission issued an order that approved an NYSE rule change that eliminated the Chambers Street Rule.

to options contracts which it issues is excluded from the definition of “transfer agent” under the Exchange
Act. Id.

with the Commission or other Appropriate Regulatory Agency (“ARA”). 140 With respect to any
transfer agent so registered, Section 17A(d)(1) of the Exchange Act authorizes the Commission
to prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary or appropriate in the public interest,
for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange
Act. 141 Once a transfer agent is registered, either compulsorily or voluntarily, 142 the Commission
“is empowered with broad rulemaking authority over all aspects of a transfer agent’s activities as
a transfer agent.” 143
Beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Commission adopted a series of transfer
agent rules designed to regulate the basic recordkeeping and processing functions performed by
transfer agents. The rules primarily related to routine transfers of certificated equity and debt
securities and generally covered three areas: (i) registration and annual reporting requirements;
(ii) timing and certain notice and reporting requirements related to securities transaction
processing (referred to as “turnaround rules”); and (iii) recordkeeping and record retention rules
and safeguarding requirements for securities and funds.

discussion of bank ARAs.

141

As noted in the Committee Report which accompanied Section 17A(d)(1) of S.249, the precursor to Section
17A(d)(1) of the 1975 Amendments, Congress intended to “. . . empower[] [the Commission] with broad
rulemaking authority over all aspects of a transfer agents’ activities as transfer agent.” Senate Report on
Securities Act Amendments of 1975, supra note 44, at 57.

142

There is no statutory or other prohibition on voluntary registration as a transfer agent, although it is
relatively uncommon. See generally, Exchange Act Section 17A(c), 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(c). See also infra
Section VII.B.1, discussing the practice of voluntary registration as transfer agents by certain third party
administrators (“TPA”).

143

See Senate Report on Securities Act Amendments of 1975, supra note 44. The Committee Report
elaborated that it expected the Commission’s regulations “to include, among other matters, minimum
standards of performance, the prompt and accurate processing of securities transactions, and operational
compatibility of and cooperation by transfer agents with other facilities and participants in the securities
handling process.” Id.

Page 48 of 208

As discussed more fully below, processing obligations related to mutual funds, dividend
reinvestment plans (“DRIPs”), 144 and limited partnerships were expressly exempted from most
of the processing and recordkeeping rules because at the time, the Commission believed that the
activities required for the redemption of investment company shares and shares purchased or
sold through a DRIP were significantly different from those required for the transfer of stocks
and bonds. 145 Although the Commission has made modest revisions to the initial transfer agent
rules and has added several new rules since the adoption of those earlier rules, the core
registration, processing, recordkeeping, and safeguarding rules remain substantially unchanged,
and the exemptions for mutual funds, DRIPs, and limited partnerships have not been revisited.
1.

Registration and Annual Reporting Requirements

The rules setting forth the registration, annual reporting, and withdrawal requirements for
transfer agents are found in Exchange Act Rules 17Ac2-1 (application for registration), 17Ac2-2
(annual reporting), and 17Ac3-1 (withdrawal from registration).
Rule 17Ac2-1 and Form TA-1
Before a transfer agent may perform any of the statutory transfer agent functions defined
in Section 3(a)(25) of the Exchange Act for a Qualifying Security, it must apply for registration
by submitting Form TA-1 (Uniform Form of Registration as a Transfer Agent and for
Amendment to Registration) to its ARA and its registration as a transfer agent with its ARA must

144

DRIPs allow investors who already own an issuer’s stock to reinvest their cash dividends by purchasing
additional shares or fractional shares directly from the issuer or the issuer’s transfer agent, without going
through a broker. Most DRIPs require the investor to become a registered securityholder, as opposed to a
street name holder.

145

See Regulation of Transfer Agents, Exchange Act Release No. 13636 (June 16, 1977), 42 FR 32404, 32408
(June 24, 1977) (“Rule 17Ad-1 through 17Ad-7 Adopting Release”).

have become effective. 146 Form TA-1 requires a transfer agent seeking to register to disclose
information including the following: (a) general identification information 147 about the transfer
agent and whether it is part of any service company arrangements; 148 (b) the identity of its direct
and indirect owners and other control persons; 149 and (c) whether it or any of its control affiliates
has been subject to investment-related criminal prosecutions, regulatory actions, or civil
actions. 150 The registration automatically becomes effective 30 days after the Form TA-1 is
filed, unless the ARA takes affirmative action to accelerate, deny, or postpone registration in
accordance with the provisions of Section 17A(c) of the Exchange Act. 151 A registrant must
amend its Form TA-1 within 60 days following the date on which information reported therein

Exchange Act Section 17A(c)(1), 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(c)(1); 17 CFR 240.17Ac2-1; SEC Form TA-1, 17 CFR
249b.100. Once registration has become effective, a transfer agent may be subject to censure, suspension,
limitation, or revocation of its registration if the transfer agent or any person associated with the transfer
agent fails to obey Commission rules or violates certain of the securities laws. Exchange Act Section
17A(c)(3), 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(c)(3); Exchange Act Section 17A(c)(4)(C), 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(c)(4)(C).

phone number, address and email address), identification numbers including the transfer agent’s file
number and FINS number, and information concerning service company arrangements in which the
registrant may be involved). The file number for a transfer agent registered with the Commission would be
the file number assigned by the Commission. A FINS number, short for Financial Industry Number
Standard, is a unique five digit number issued by DTC and used by the securities industry as a means of
identifying financial institutions in automated data processing systems. See Notice of Assumption or
Termination of Transfer Agent Services, Exchange Act Release No. 35039 n.12 (Dec. 1, 1994), 59 FR

Commission is their ARA, they must file Form TA-1 and amendments thereto electronically on
the Commission’s EDGAR system and each answer provided by the transfer agent is required to
be formatted as an XML data tag. 153
Rule 17Ac2-2 and Form TA-2
All registered transfer agents, regardless of their ARA, must file an annual report with the
Commission using Form TA-2 (Form for Reporting Activities of Transfer Agents Registered
Pursuant to Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). 154 Form TA-2 covers a
calendar year reporting period that ends on December 31 155 and must be filed by March 31 of the
year following the end of the reporting period. Form TA-2 must be filed electronically on the
Commission’s EDGAR system and each answer provided by the transfer agent is required to be
formatted as an XML data tag. 156
Form TA-2 requires transfer agents to identify and report on the use of service
companies, or other transfer agents, in connection with their transfer agent activities. It also
requires transfer agents to provide annual data regarding the transfer agent’s compliance with the

turnaround rules. Additionally, the form requires transfer agents to provide the Commission
with updated information about their business activities, including accounts administered, items
received, 157 turnaround performance, total amounts of funds distributed, and lost securityholder
accounts. 158
Rule 17Ac2-2 provides exemptions from completing certain sections of Form TA-2 for
small transfer agents and for transfer agents that outsource their work completely to service
companies. If a registered transfer agent received fewer than 1,000 items for transfer in the
reporting period and did not maintain master securityholder files for more than 1,000 individual
securityholder accounts as of December 31 of the reporting period, it is only required to
complete Questions 1 through 5, 11, and the signature section of Form TA-2. 159 A named
transfer agent that engaged a service company to perform all of its transfer agent functions
during the reporting period is only required to complete Questions 1 through 3 and the signature
section of Form TA-2. 160
The Commission, other ARAs and members of the public (including issuers and
investors) use information on Forms TA-1 and TA-2. The Commission’s EDGAR database
provides a means through which information on these forms can be searched and retrieved. The
Commission uses the information on Form TA-1 to review an entity’s application for registration
as a transfer agent and to maintain current information about transfer agents. The Commission

for several purposes, including: (i) to determine the nature of the business conducted by a
transfer agent, (ii) to monitor transfer agent activities and to evaluate compliance with
Commission rules, and (iii) to inform Commission transfer agent policymaking. 161 In connection
with monitoring of and checking regulatory compliance by transfer agents, the Commission’s
examination and inspections program may use the information on Forms TA-1 and TA-2 to plan
their site visits in connection with an exam. The examination staff of the Commission may also
use the information on Forms TA-1 and TA-2 to identify particular issues to focus on during an
exam or to analyze industry trends and to provide basic census information concerning registered
transfer agents. In addition, Form TA-1 and TA-2 data provide the Commission with
information about securities processing issues that may need to be addressed by Commission
rulemaking. Form TA-1 and TA-2 data is also used by the Commission to assist it in evaluating
the costs and benefits of potential rulemaking.
Rule 17Ac3-1 and Form TA-W
Pursuant to Rule 17Ac3-1, a registered transfer agent may voluntarily withdraw its
registration by filing Form TA-W (Notice of Withdrawal from Registration as a Transfer Agent)
with the relevant ARA, disclosing, among other things, any actual or potential claims or legal
proceedings against the transfer agent, its reasons for withdrawing or ceasing to function as a
transfer agent, and whether one or more successor transfer agents will take over the maintenance

after filing Form TA-W, unless the Commission or applicable ARA finds it in the public interest
to take affirmative action to accelerate, deny, or postpone the request. 163
2.

Processing, Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Exemptions: Rules 17Ad-1
Through 17Ad-7 and Rules 17f-1 and 17f-2

On June 16, 1977, the Commission adopted Rules 17Ad-1 through 17Ad-7 as a set of
performance standards for transfer agents. 164 These turnaround and processing rules were
“designed to protect investors . . . and to contribute to the establishment of the national system
for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of transactions in securities by,” among
other things, “assuring that the transfer agent community performs its functions in a prompt,
accurate and more predictable manner.” The rules primarily focused on establishing minimum
performance and recordkeeping standards for routine transfers of certificated equity and debt
securities and the prompt and accurate cancellation and issuance of certificated securities. 165 The
rules were also designed to provide an early warning system to alert issuers and regulatory
agencies when the performance standards are not being met, prohibit under-performing transfer
agents from expanding their operations, require transfer agents to respond promptly to certain
written inquiries regarding items presented for transfer, and require the maintenance and
preservation of certain records necessary for regulatory authorities to monitor and enforce

162

Exchange Act Rule 17 Ac3-1, 17 CFR 240.17Ac3-1; Exchange Act Section 17A(c)(3)(a), 15 U.S.C. 78q1(c)(3)(A); SEC Form TA-W, 17 CFR 249b.101 (Notice of Withdrawal from Registration as a Transfer

transfer agent compliance with the turnaround rules. 166 The specific processing, reporting, and
retention requirements were metrics-based and, at the time, considered to be those necessary to
ensure that transfer agents adequately performed their functions and that the Commission and
other ARAs would be able to monitor transfer agents’ compliance with the turnaround rules. 167
Further, the new transfer agent rules established by the Commission were designed not only to
ensure that transfer agents meet prescribed performance standards for their core recordkeeping
and transfer activities, but to ensure they would be regulated appropriately in the context of the
National C&S System and that any problems meeting these performance standards would not
negatively impact individual investors or the clearance and settlement system as a whole. 168
Each rule is discussed in detail below.
Rule 17Ad-1 defines the relevant terms used throughout the rules. One of the most
important is “item,” which is defined as the certificates of a single issue of securities presented
under one ticket, 169 and is the basic unit for which the turnaround and other processing
requirements apply. 170 The other key definitions in Rule 17Ad-1 are “transfer” and
“turnaround.” “Transfer” of a certificated security (where an outside registrar is not involved) is
the completion of all acts necessary to cancel the certificate, issue a new one, and make it

available to the presentor, and “turnaround” for an item (where an outside registrar is not
involved) is completed when transfer is accomplished. 171
Rule 17Ad-2 sets the basic performance standards for transfer agents. 172 Transfer agents
who are not acting as a registrar must turnaround within three business days of receipt at least
90% of all “routine items” 173 received by the transfer agent during any month. 174 Non-routine
items must receive “diligent and continuous attention” and must be “turned around as soon as
possible.” 175 Routine items that are not turned around within three business days nevertheless
must be “turned around promptly.” 176 Registered transfer agents acting as a registrar must
“process” at least 90% of all items received during any given month no later than noon of the
next business day for any item received after noon and no later than the opening of business on
the next business day for those items received at or before noon. 177 If a transfer agent fails to
meet the performance standards for turnaround set forth in Rule 17Ad-2 with respect to any
month, it must notify the Commission and the transfer agent’s ARA if it is not the Commission

171

Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-1(d), (e), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-1(d), (e).

172

As discussed in more detail infra in Section IV.C.1, the NYSE imposes a 48 hour turnaround requirement.

173

Routine items are defined by Rule 17Ad-1(i), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-1(i). They are generally defined in the
negative such that most items are considered routine so long as they do not require the requisition of a new
certificate that the transfer agent does not have on hand, are not subject to a stop order, adverse claim, or
other restriction on transfer, do not require certain additional documentation or review to complete the
transfer, do not involve a transfer in connection with certain types of corporate actions, do not include a
security of an issue which within the previous 15 business days was offered to the public pursuant to a
Securities Act registration statement in an offering of a non-continuing nature, and do not include a
warrant, right or convertible security either presented for transfer within five business days before rights
expire or change or presented for exercise or conversion.

within 10 business days of the end of the month, provide certain turnaround data regarding
specific numbers and percentages of items, explain the reasons for the failure, identify what steps
have been taken to prevent future failures, and provide certain data regarding routine items that
have not been turned around and have been in the transfer agent’s possession for “more than four
business days.” 178 Similar notification requirements apply where a transfer agent acting as a
registrar fails to meet the processing performance standards. 179
Rule 17Ad-3 provides limitations on the expansion of transfer agent activities if a transfer
agent is unable to meet the minimum performance standards established by Rule 17Ad-2. Any
transfer agent that is required pursuant to Rule 17Ad-2 to provide notice for failure to meet the
performance standards for three consecutive months is prohibited from taking on new issues or
providing new services for existing issues. 180 Further, if a transfer agent fails to turnaround or
process at least 75% of all routine items, it must notify the chief executive officer of each issuer
for which the transfer agent acts. 181 Thus, Rules 17Ad-2 and 17Ad-3, taken together, provide an
early warning system to alert issuers, the Commission and other ARAs of untimely performance
and potential problems.
Rule 17Ad-4 provides certain exemptions from the turnaround, processing, and
recordkeeping rules. 182 Rule 17Ad-4(a) creates an exemption from Rules 17Ad-2, 17Ad-3, and

agent continue until there has been a period of three successive months in which no notices have been
required.

securities issued by investment companies registered under Section 8 of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 (“Investment Company Act”), which are also known as open-end
funds. 183 In 1977, the rationale for providing the exemption for interests in limited partnerships
was “the low volume of transfers of such interests,” 184 while the rationale for providing the
exemption for DRIPs was the Commission’s view at the time that transfer agents’ processing for
DRIPs “require[s] procedures significantly different from the procedures required to transfer
ownership of stocks and bonds.” 185
The Commission expressed the same rationale with respect to redeemable securities of
registered investment companies, stating that transactions in these securities were “significantly
different from the transfer of ownership of stocks and bonds on issuer’s records.” 186 In addition,

Regulation of Transfer Agents, Exchange Act Release No. 13293 (Feb. 24, 1977) (“Rule 17Ad-1 through
17Ad-7 Re-Proposing Release”) (“From the information provided in SEC Form TA-1, 17 CFR 249b.100,
the low volume of transfers of such [limited partnership] interests suggests that they may appropriately be
exempted from revised [Rules 17Ad-2, 17Ad-3, and 17Ad-6(a)(1) through (a)(7)].”).

185

Rule 17Ad-1 through 17Ad-7 Adopting Release, supra note 45 (“Lastly, the exemptions of paragraph
17Ad-4(a) have been expanded to include the transfers and withdrawals of shares from dividend
reinvestment plans which…require procedures significantly different from the procedures required to
transfer ownership of stocks and bonds.”)

186

Rule 17Ad-1 through 17Ad-7 Adopting Release, supra note 145, at n.13. As originally proposed, the
exemption would have been for “securities of open-end investment companies,” rather than “redeemable
securities of investment companies.” See Rule 17Ad-1 through 17Ad-7 Re-Proposing Release, supra note
184. By adding the word “redeemable,” redeemable securities of registered unit investment trusts (“UIT”)
were included within the exemption. However, because closed-end investment companies do not issue
redeemable securities, transfer agents servicing closed-end fund securities are not within the exemption.
Rule 17Ad-1 through 17Ad-7 Adopting Release, supra note 145, at n.14 (“The turnaround rules do apply to
registered transfer agents performing transfer agent functions for securities issued by closed-end investment
companies.”) (emphasis added).

Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. 80a-22(e),” 187 and that “[t]he amount of certificated fund shares is
relatively small, and the amount of transfer agent activity in connection with transferring
ownership of certificated shares represents a very small part of a transfer agent’s activity with
regard to an open-end investment company.” 188 For these reasons, the Commission believed at
the time that “it would be desirable to study further the need for, and the nature of, minimum
performance standards for the transfer of securities effected by open-end investment companies
registered under Section 8 of the Investment Company Act, 15 U.S.C. 80a-8.” 189
Rule 17Ad-4(b) provides a similar exemption for certain small transfer agents by
exempting a registered transfer agent from the turnaround, processing, recordkeeping, and other
provisions of Rules 17Ad-2(a), (b), (c), (d) and (h), 17Ad-3, and 17Ad-6(a)(2)-(7) and (11),
provided the transfer agent has received fewer than 500 items for transfer and fewer than 500
items for processing within a consecutive six month period, and provided that the transfer agent
has filed proper notice of its exempt status with its ARA or has prepared a document certifying
that the transfer agent qualifies as exempt (with respect to those ARAs where filing is not
required). 190 The rationale behind this exemption was that, because the number of transfers
performed by these smaller transfer agents was relatively small and involved issues which are
not traded actively, it was not necessary or appropriate at that time to require those smaller

The filing of notices of exempt status for these small transfer agents is required where the ARA is the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) or the Federal Reserve. Where the ARA is the
Commission or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the exempt transfer agent is not required to
file a notice but must prepare a document certifying that the transfer agent qualifies as exempt and retain it
in its records. See Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-4(b)(3), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-4(b)(3).

and other requirements in those rules. 191
Rule 17Ad-5 generally requires a registered transfer agent to respond within prescribed
timeframes to certain types of written inquiries. 192 Rule 17Ad-5(a) requires a registered transfer
agent to respond within five business days following the receipt of an inquiry from any “person”
concerning the status of an item presented for transfer by such person or their agent during the
preceding six months, provided the inquirer provides specific information concerning the
item. 193 Rule 17Ad-5(b) requires a registered transfer agent to respond to any “broker-dealer”
inquiry within five business days confirming or denying whether it has possession of a security
presented for transfer and, if it has possession, acknowledging the transfer instructions or
revalidating the window ticket, 194 provided the broker-dealer provides certain identifying
information. 195 Rule 17Ad-5(c) requires a registered transfer agent to respond within 10
business days confirming or denying possession of a security where any person or their agent has
requested that the transfer agent confirm possession as of a given date of a certificate presented
by such person during the preceding 30 days 196 and provides information similar to that which is

also provide assurance of payment. 198 Rule 17Ad-5(d) requires a registered transfer agent to
respond within 20 business days where any person requests a transcript of such person’s account
with respect to a particular securities issue as of a certain date not more than six months prior to
the request. 199 If required by the transfer agent, the inquirer must provide the transfer agent
assurance of payment of a reasonable fee for this service. 200
Rules 17Ad-6 and 17Ad-7, taken together, address some of the basic aspects of the
records that transfer agents must maintain and for how long. 201 Rule 17Ad-6 generally details
what records every registered transfer agent shall make and keep. Rule 17Ad-6(a)(1) requires
every registered transfer to make and keep receipts, tickets, logs, schedules, journals, and other
records showing the number of routine and non-routine items received and made available each
business day. 202 Rules 17Ad-6(a)(2) through (4) require maintenance of records that generally
relate to the monitoring of performance standards for turnaround and for processing under Rule
17Ad-2 for each month and notices required to be filed under Rule 17Ad-2 203 and any written
inquiries or requests, including those inquiries to transfer agents where the inquiries were not
subject to Rule 17Ad-5 or inquiries which were answered orally or where no response was made.
Rule 17Ad-6(a)(8) requires maintenance of any contracts and certain related documentation

2001 and 2003 to authorize the use of electronic recordkeeping, electronic storage media, and
micrographic storage media, such as microfilm records. 209 Paragraph (g) of Rule 17Ad-7

to clarify when a transfer agent is relieved of such recordkeeping responsibilities. 211
Rule 17f-1 212 was adopted in 1976 pursuant to Section 17(f)(1) of the Exchange Act in
order to curtail trafficking in lost, stolen, missing, and counterfeit securities certificates. 213 It
requires reporting institutions, which are defined as national securities exchanges, brokers,
dealers, registered transfer agents, and others, to report missing, lost, counterfeit, or stolen
securities to the Commission or its designee. This led to the Commission’s implementation in
1977 of the Lost and Stolen Securities Program and also led to subsequent Commission releases
addressing in detail the structure of the program. 214 The program became fully operational on
January 2, 1978 and consists mainly of an electronic database for securities certificates that have
been reported lost, stolen, missing, or counterfeit. 215 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and

Recordkeeping and Safeguarding Rules: Rules 17Ad-8 through 17Ad13

The new regulatory regime established by the turnaround rules provided the Commission
with visibility into the transfer agent industry and a way to review and analyze it. The first six
years of monitoring transfer agent performance under the new regulatory regime highlighted
some of the significant adverse operational and financial consequences for the securities
industry, securities markets, issuer community, and investing public that could occur when a
transfer agent’s operations collapse, when records maintained by a transfer agent contain
significant inaccuracies, or when a transfer agent’s internal accounting controls are

inadequate. 220 The Commission therefore determined that additional rulemaking was necessary
and appropriate to supplement the turnaround rules.
The impetus for Rule 17Ad-8 was the recommendation in the Final Street Name Study
that “each depository be required to transmit periodically to each issuer whose securities the
depository holds of record a list of the persons on whose behalf the depository holds the
securities.” 221 The rule, which was adopted in 1980, requires every registered clearing agency to
provide promptly to each issuer or transfer agent acting on its behalf, upon request, a securities
position listing which identifies the participants on whose behalf the clearing agency holds the
issuer’s securities in the name of the clearing agency or its nominee and the respective positions
in such securities as of a specified date. 222 The clearing agency may charge issuers who request
this service with fees designed to recover its reasonable costs. 223
On June 10, 1983, the Commission adopted Rules 17Ad-9 through 17Ad-13. 224 These
new rules established various requirements and exemptions designed to ensure that transfer
agents maintain appropriate internal controls, meet adequate levels of service and performance,
and avoid adverse operational and financial problems that could harm investors, issuers, or other
securities industry participants. Most notably, the new rules established additional minimum

220

See 17Ad-9 through 13 Proposing Release, supra note 2. In its release proposing Rules 17Ad-9 to 17Ad13, the Commission cited examples of substandard transfer agent performance in the areas of
recordkeeping and safeguarding and noted the significant adverse operational and financial problems
caused by poor transfer agent performance or operations.

standards for recordkeeping and codified minimum requirements for the safeguarding of funds
and securities. 225 The Commission believed that these additional minimum standards were
critical to addressing seriously deficient transfer agent performance. 226
Rule 17Ad-9 227 defines 12 principal terms with respect to transfer agents as used
especially in Rules 17Ad-10 through 17Ad-13, consisting of the terms “certificate detail,”
“master securityholder file,” “subsidiary file,” “control book,” “credit,” “debit,” “record
difference,” “record keeping transfer agent,” “co-transfer agent,” “named transfer agent,”
“service company transfer agent,” and “file.” 228
Rule 17Ad-9’s certificate detail, 229 with respect to certificated securities, includes, at a
minimum, all of the following (and with respect to uncertificated securities, includes only items
(ii) through (viii)): (i) the certificate number, meaning the unique serial number of each
certificate of an issue of securities, as distinct from the CUSIP number 230 which is the same
number for all certificates of the same issue; (ii) the number of shares (for equity securities) or
principal dollar amount (for debt securities) designated by the certificate; (iii) the
securityholder’s registration, which is the name of the individual, partnership, or corporation in

225

See 17Ad-9 through 13 Proposing Release, supra note 2.

226

Id. The Commission was particularly concerned with reducing the potential for transfer agent failure,
which inevitably imposes substantial potential liabilities and costs on issuers, securities firms, and
securityholders, as well as improving generally transfer agent performance, thereby reducing the brokerdealers’ costs associated with fails to settle and extended transfer delays.

which a securities certificate is held and which registration appears on the face of the certificate;
(iv) the address of the registered owner, which also appears on the face of the certificate; (v) the
date the certificate was issued, which likewise appears on the face of the certificate; (vi) the
“cancellation date of the securities certificate,” which, if and when the certificate is cancelled
will appear on the face of a certificate along with the word “cancelled” to evidence that the
certificate no longer has any market value and that it no longer represents a claim against the
issuer; (vii) in the case of redeemable securities of investment companies (e.g., securities issued
by open-end management companies and other investment companies registered under Section 8
of the Investment Company Act), an appropriate description of each debit and credit (i.e.,
designation indicating purchase, redemption, or transfer); and (viii) “[a]ny other identifiable
information about securities and securityholders” that the transfer agent reasonably deems
essential to its recordkeeping system for the efficient and effective research of record
differences. 231
“Master securityholder file” is defined as the official list of individual securityholder
accounts. With respect to uncertificated securities of investment companies registered under the
Investment Company Act, the master securityholder file may consist of multiple, but linked,
automated files. 232

232

Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-9(b), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-9(b). In other contexts, the master securityholder file
may be referred to as a “stockholder register,” “stockholder list,” “shareholder ledger,” or some other
designation. As used throughout this release, we refer to it as the master securityholder file. See, e.g., Del.
Code Ann. tit. 8 §220 (referring to a corporation’s “stock ledger” as well as its “list of its stockholders”).

Page 67 of 208

A “subsidiary file” is any list of record of accounts, securityholders, or certificates that
evidences debits or credits that have not been posted to the master securityholder file. 233
A “control book” is the record or other document that shows the total number of shares
(in the case of equity securities) or the principal dollar amount (in the case of debt securities)
authorized and issued by the issuer. 234 The control book may be referred to in the industry as a
registrar journal, and is one of the mechanisms transfer agents use to monitor against
overissuance. 235
A “credit” is an addition of appropriate certificate detail to the master securityholder file,
and a “debit” is a cancellation of appropriate certificate detail to the master securityholder file. 236
A “record difference” occurs when either: (i) the total number of shares or total principal
dollar amount of securities in the master securityholder file does not equal the number of shares
or principal dollar amount in the control book; or (ii) the security transferred or redeemed
contains certificate detail different from the certificate detail currently on the master
securityholder file, which difference cannot be immediately resolved. 237

234

Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-9(d), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-9(d).

235

The Commission’s transfer agent rules do not provide a definition of “overissuance” or explicitly import a
definition from other authorities that have defined this term. The UCC provides a definition of this term
which has been amended over the years and currently provides: “In this section ‘overissue’ means the issue
of securities in excess of the amount the issuer has corporate power to issue, but an overissue does not
occur if appropriate action has cured the overissue.” U.C.C. 8-210(a). One way in which an overissue can
occur is when a corporation issues more shares than are authorized under its charter, such as its articles of
incorporation. Under state law, shares over issued in such a manner may be deemed void. See, e.g., Del.
Gen. Corp. L. §§ 161, 242(a)(3). For more information concerning the general concept of “overissuances”
and types of transactions in which overissuances can occur, see Guttman, supra note 6, at § 11:7; Rhodes,

A “recordkeeping transfer agent” is the registered transfer agent that maintains and
updates a security’s master securityholder file. 238 All other transfer agents associated with a
given issue of securities are defined as “co-transfer agents,” which are registered transfer agents
that transfer securities but do not maintain and update the master securityholder file. 239 A cotransfer agent may include an outside registrar that keeps only the control book as defined in
Rule 17Ad-1(b). A “named transfer agent” is the registered transfer agent that is engaged by an
issuer to perform transfer agent functions for an issue of securities but has engaged a service
company to perform some or all of those functions. 240 And a “service company” is the registered
transfer agent engaged by a named transfer agent to perform transfer agent functions for that
named transfer agent. 241
Finally, Rule 17Ad-9(l) clarifies that the term “file” includes both automated and manual
records. 242
Rule 17Ad-10 243 requires each recordkeeping transfer agent to post promptly certificate
detail to its master securityholder file after a security is transferred, purchased, or redeemed. The
meaning of the term “promptly” varies with the relevant transaction but generally is five business
days, although for exempt transfer agents under Rule 17Ad-4(b) promptly means 30 calendar
days and for transfer agents functioning solely for their own or their affiliated companies’

securities and using batch processing promptly means ten business days. 244 Timely updating of
the master securityholder file is required because delayed posting or the failure to post would
promote the proliferation of record inaccuracies that could impede the accurate payment of
dividends and the processing of proxy solicitations. 245 Rule 17Ad-10(g) requires, with certain
exceptions, that any transfer agent that erroneously issues securities that result in an
overissuance 246 must “buy-in” (i.e., purchase securities in the open market) securities equal to
the number of shares (in the case of equity securities) or principal dollar amount (in the case of
debt securities) of the overissuance. 247 The buy-in requirement is designed to deter transfer
agents from permitting record differences to accrue and encourages them to maintain complete
and accurate records that assure that securityholders will receive all appropriate corporate
distributions and communications. 248
Rule 17Ad-11 249 requires that within ten business days following the end of each month,
registered recordkeeping transfer agents report to issuers and the ARA certain information
regarding aged record differences 250 when the dollar amount or the number of shares regarding

those shares reach certain preset levels. 251 The reports required by 17Ad-11 must set forth the
amount of aged record differences, the reasons for any difference, and the steps being taken to
resolve any difference.
Rule 17Ad-12 252 requires registered transfer agents to safeguard funds and securities of
which they have custody or possession in a manner reasonably free from theft, loss, destruction,
or misuse, in light of all the facts and circumstances including the cost of particular safeguards
and procedures that might be employed. A reasonable level of safeguarding is necessary due to
various duties of transfer agents which may include, for example: (i) holding balance certificates
as transfer agent custodians; (ii) administering DRIPs which involves the holding of funds and
securities; (iii) making distributions, including of principal, interest and dividends, as paying
agents of issuers; 253 and (iv) maintaining working inventories of unissued securities
certificates. 254
Rule 17Ad-13 255 requires registered transfer agents, with certain exceptions, to file
annually with the Commission a report prepared by an independent accountant concerning the
transfer agent’s system of internal controls and related procedures for the transfer of record
ownership and the safeguarding of related securities and funds based on an annual study and
evaluation made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. The purpose of the

rule is to ensure that transfer agents have a system of internal controls adequate to provide
reasonable assurances that securities and funds held by transfer agents – for example, when a
transfer agent facilitates a dividend or interest payment for an issuer – are safeguarded against
loss from unauthorized use or disposition and that transfer agent activities are performed
promptly and accurately. The rule requires that the independent accountant’s report state
whether the annual study and evaluation was made in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards using the criteria set forth in the rule and describe and comment upon any
material inadequacies found to exist in the system of internal accounting control as of the date of
the evaluation and any corrective action taken, or state that no material inadequacy exists. 256 An
accountant preparing reports under this rule is expected to use the general standards established
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”). 257

Issue-Specific Rules: Rules 17Ad-14 Through 17Ad-21T.

After the adoption of Rules 17Ad-8 through 17Ad-13, between 1983 and 2013 the
Commission continued to adopt new rules to address specific issues. Specifically, Rules 17Ad14 through 17Ad-20, as well as 17Ad-21T, address issues such as tender agent services,
signature guarantee programs, notifications when transfer agents begin or cease acting for
specific issues, lost shareholder searches, processes for cancelling certificates, transfer of
restricted securities, and anticipated risks associated with Year 2000 compliance.

Rule 17Ad-14 258 requires a registered transfer agent that acts as a tender agent or a
depositary for a party making a tender or exchange offer to establish and maintain special
accounts with all qualified registered securities depositories that hold the subject company’s
securities, thereby enabling depository participants to move securities to and from the tender
agent by book-entry. 259 Unless a bidder’s depositary establishes an account with a securities
depository, all the subject securities must be tendered in physical certificate form, rather than by
book-entry, which causes inefficiencies and other problems for securityholders, broker-dealers,
bidders, tender agents, and others. 260 The purpose of this rule is to reduce the processing costs
and trading inefficiencies that occur when tender offers are processed in a physical certificate
environment and to make the benefits of processing tender offers by book-entry available to the
investing public and the securities industry. 261
For example, securityholders sometimes have difficulty obtaining properly denominated
physical certificates for tender to the bidder’s depository prior to the offer’s expiration date.
Also, instances where there is unavailability of book-entry settlement have resulted in a
substantially higher number of fails-to-deliver between broker-dealers. As a result, brokerdealers who are unable to satisfy tender obligations may have to buy securities in the cash market
for same-day delivery (i.e., delivery on the day of the contract), which may create significant
price disparities between the cash market and the regular-way market (i.e., delivery on the third

business day following the day of the contract). 262 Prior to the adoption of Rule 17Ad-14,
bidders could insist upon the tender of physical securities certificates outside of securities
depositories (such as to the bidder’s broker or local bank), even if the delivering entities were
depository participants and even if the securities themselves were depository eligible. Doing so
not only increased the number of fails, but increased brokerage firms’ financing expenses and
made it more difficult to settle transactions in a timely way. 263
Rule 17Ad-15 264 prohibits inequitable treatment of eligible guarantor institutions (e.g.,
banks, brokers, and other financial institutions) that provide signature guarantee programs. The
rule implements Section 17A(d)(5) of the Exchange Act which expressly bars transfer agents
from exercising inequitable treatment of financial institutions with respect to security
guarantees. 265 The signature guarantee program requires that a securities certificate bear a
signature by a guarantor institution with a medallion stamp backed by a surety bond before the
transfer agent will accept the certificate for transfer. The guarantee program allows the highspeed processing of a large volume of securities certificates that would be impossible if transfer
agents had to examine the creditworthiness of the person behind each certificate being presented.
Specifically, the program establishes requirements for its members with respect to guaranteeing
and accepting securities certificates. The indorsing signature on a securities certificate is

guaranteed, typically by a financial institution, by the placement of a signature of the guarantor
or its representative and a medallion stamp backed by a surety bond which, in effect, states that
in event of mishap, the surety will pay for any damages incurred as a result of a forged signature
if the guarantor does not pay. 266 With these assurances of financial safety, a transfer agent is
able to accept a securities certificate without further examination or delay, as is required by the
terms of the program. 267 Rule 17Ad-15 requires transfer agents to establish written standards for
the acceptance of signature guarantees, and it authorizes signature guarantee programs. It also
enables transfer agents to reject a request for transfer where a securities certificate is not
guaranteed and bears no medallion stamp or where the guarantor is neither a member nor a
participant in a signature guarantee program. 268
Rule 17Ad-16 requires a registered transfer agent to provide written notice to an
“appropriate qualified registered security depository” (i.e., DTC) 269 when terminating or

266

The UCC provides: “A person who guarantees a signature of an indorser of a securities certificate warrants
that at the time of signing: (1) the signature was genuine; (2) the signer was an appropriate person to
indorse, or if the signature is by an agent, the agent had actual authority to act on behalf of the appropriate
person; and (3) the signer had legal capacity to sign.” U.C.C. 8-306.

There are currently three organizations that provide signature guarantee programs to their members:
Securities Transfer Agent Medallion Program, Stock Exchange Medallion Program, and New York Stock
Exchange Medallion Program. See, e.g., Signature Guarantees: Preventing the Unauthorized Transfer of

269

Rule 17Ad–16 defines an ‘‘appropriate qualified registered securities depository’’ as the “qualified
registered securities depository” that the Commission so designates by order or, in the absence of such
designation, the qualified registered securities depository that is the largest holder of record of all qualified
registered securities depositories as of the most recent record date. In 1995, the Commission issued an
order approving a DTC rule filing in which DTC was designated as the “appropriate qualified registered
securities depository” to receive notices of transfer agent changes pursuant to Rule 17Ad-16 in order to
eliminate uncertainty about where registered transfer agents should direct Rule 17Ad-16 notices, and to
reduce unnecessary costs and administrative burdens for transfer agents and registered securities

Page 75 of 208

assuming transfer agent services on behalf of an issuer or when changing its name or address. 270
The rule is intended to address the problem of unannounced transfer agent changes that adversely
affect the prompt transfer of securities certificates by causing needless delays, costs, and risks. 271
Depositories and other entities in the marketplace must have the correct information in order to
send transfer instructions to the appropriate transfer agent at the correct address. In addition to
causing delay in execution of the instructions, certificates sent to the wrong address may result in
a loss of certificates.
Rule 17Ad-17 is designed to ensure that the transfer agents, brokers, dealers, and other
financial intermediaries make adequate efforts to find lost securityholders. 272 It was first adopted
in 1997 273 and later amended at the beginning of 2013. 274 The rule defines “lost securityholder”
as a securityholder for whom an item of correspondence sent to his or her last known address
was “returned as undeliverable” and requires transfer agents, brokers, and dealers to conduct two
database searches in their efforts to locate a lost securityholder. It defines “unresponsive payee”
to mean a securityholder to whom a paying agent has sent a regularly scheduled check which
was not cashed or otherwise negotiated before the earlier of either the paying agent’s sending the
next regularly scheduled check or of 6 months after the sending of the not yet negotiated

depositories. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 35378 (Feb. 15, 1995), 60 FR 9875 (Feb. 22, 1995)

investment advisor, indenture trustee, custodian, or any other person that accepts payments from
the issuer of a security and distributes the payments to the holders of the security,” shall provide
to each unresponsive payee not less than one written notice stating that such payee has been sent
a check that has not yet been negotiated.
Rule 17Ad-19 was adopted in 2003 and requires every transfer agent to establish and
implement written procedures for the cancellation, storage, transportation, destruction, or other
disposition of securities certificates. 276 Specifically, it requires transfer agents to mark each
cancelled securities certificate with the word “cancelled,” to maintain a secure storage area for
cancelled certificates, to maintain a retrievable data base for of all its cancelled, destroyed, or
otherwise disposed of certificates, and to have specific procedures for the destruction of
cancelled certificates. The rule was adopted in response to a series of major thefts of cancelled
certificates from transfer agent facilities, after which the stolen certificates were recirculated into
the marketplace on a massive scale and fraudulently sold or used as loan collateral. 277
Rule 17Ad-20 prohibits registered transfer agents from effecting the transfer of any
equity security registered pursuant to Section 12 or that subjects an issuer to reporting under
Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act if such security is subject to any restriction or prohibition on

transfer to or from a securities intermediary in its capacity as such. 278 In the 2004 adopting
release for the rule, the Commission observed that issuers imposing such restrictions on transfer
to intermediaries believe that “precluding ownership by certain securities intermediaries forces
broker-dealers to deliver certificates on each transaction and eliminates the ability of naked short
sellers to maintain a naked short sale position.” 279 The Commission believed Rule 17Ad-20 was
necessary to prevent transfer agent facilitation of the transfer of securities subject to such
restrictions, because these types of restrictions disrupted prompt and efficient clearing and
settlement in the U.S. securities markets.
Two rules relate to Year 2000 compliance. Rule 17Ad-18 (Year 2000 Reports to be
Made by Certain Transfer Agents) was adopted by the Commission on July 13, 1998 and
required non-bank transfer agents to, among other things, file a report attesting to the Y2K
compliance of their mission critical computer systems by August 31, 1998. 280 The rule also
required non-bank transfer agents to notify the SEC of any material Y2K problems that would
affect the millennium transition. Similarly, Rule 17Ad-21T required non-bank transfer agents to
ensure that their mission critical computer systems were Year 2000 compliant by August 31,
1999 or to fix any non-compliant systems by November 5, 1999. 281 The purpose was to reduce
risk to investors and the securities markets that were posed by non-bank transfer agents that had
not adequately prepared their computer systems for millennium transition.

Bank and Internal Revenue Service Regulations

There are approximately 95 registered transfer agents that are banks or subsidiaries of
banks. For national banks and banks operating under the Code of Law for the District of
Columbia, the ARA is the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”); for State member
banks, subsidiaries thereof, bank holding companies, and bank subsidiaries thereof the ARA is
the Federal Reserve Board; and for banks insured by the FDIC (non-members of the Federal
Reserve), the ARA is the FDIC. Collectively, we refer to transfer agents registered with the
OCC, FDIC, or Federal Reserve Board as “bank transfer agents.” For non-bank transfer agents
(i.e., all other transfer agents), the ARA is the Commission.282
Prior to the 1975 Amendments and the adoption of the Commission’s transfer agent rules
discussed in Section IV.A above, many of the organizations performing transfer agent services
were banks or trust companies regulated by bank regulators. As noted in the Unsafe Practices
Study, at that time, “[t]he power of the bank regulatory officials over the transfer function [was]
not specific. Rather their concern [was] whether the performance of the transfer function may
endanger the financial stability of the bank.” 283 Today, pursuant to the 1975 Amendments and
the Commission’s transfer agent rules enacted thereunder, bank transfer agents must comply
with both the Commission’s transfer agent rules and any applicable rules promulgated by their
ARA. Accordingly, bank transfer agents who are required to register as a transfer agent under

282

Exchange Act Section 3(a)(34), 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(34).

283

See Unsafe Practices Study, supra note 17, at 38. In contrast, the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, including the Commission’s transfer agent rules, are focused on
protecting investors and the securities markets. See Rule 17Ad-1 through 17Ad-7 Adopting Release, supra
note 145 (noting the importance of avoiding impediments to “the Commission’s efforts to provide
necessary or appropriate regulations for transfer agents in the broader context of the establishment of a
national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.”).

Page 79 of 208

the Exchange Act initially register with their appropriate ARA, but must file an annual Form TA2 with the Commission.284 The bank ARAs have not promulgated separate rules designed to
address specifically the transfer functions of bank transfer agents, but instead generally require
bank transfer agents to comply with the Commission’s transfer agent rules. OCC, for example,
explicitly applies the Commission’s transfer agent rules to the “domestic activities of registered
national bank transfer agents.” 285 Similarly, the Federal Reserve Board’s rules provide that the
Commission’s transfer agent rules “apply to member bank transfer agents.” 286 The FDIC has
stand-alone registration requirements for transfer agents and may examine transfer agents for
both safety and soundness considerations under applicable banking regulations and for
compliance with the Commission’s transfer agent rules. 287
With respect to examination and enforcement, both the ARA and the Commission have
examinations powers over bank transfer agents, however, the Commission must provide notice to
the appropriate ARA prior to conducting an examination and to arrange for a joint examination
where desired. 288 In addition, both the Commission and the ARA have enforcement authority
over bank transfer agents. 289

Page 80 of 208

In addition to complying with the Commission’s transfer agent rules, bank transfer agents
must also comply with their ARA’s rules and standards. Those may supplement or exceed the
Commission’s rules. In part, this may be due to the fact that a bank transfer agent’s activities
could impact the proper functioning of the bank itself. As the FDIC explains in Section 11 of its
Trust Examination Manual, one rationale for its transfer agent examination program is to “to
detect and prevent situations which might threaten the viability of banks through diminution of
their capital accounts.” 290 It further notes that “to the extent that a registered transfer agent fails
to conduct transfer agent operations in a safe and efficient manner . . . the transfer agent function
could incur contingent liabilities or estimated losses which could adversely impact the bank’s
capital accounts.” 291
As a result, for example, the FDIC examines its transfer agents for internal control and
risk management policies and procedures that are similar to what is required for banks. 292 With
respect to internal controls, the FDIC specifies not only what it expects from the agent in order to
demonstrate compliance with the Commission’s rules, but additional standards as well. These
standards apply whether the transfer agent is housed within the bank’s trust department, is its
own operating unit, or if the transfer agent activities are outsourced. The FDIC specifies
suggested means for ensuring control over physical security, such as controlled access, secure
safes and cabinets, and maintenance of access logs, and generally expects to see management
oversight of operations consistent with bank management oversight. Supervision of the transfer

agent operations may be delegated, but ultimately rests with the bank’s Board and senior
management. 293
Separately, depending on its duties, an OCC-registered transfer agent also may have to
comply with statutory requirements for the treatment of “assets held in any fiduciary
capacity.” 294 For example, entities servicing in a fiduciary capacity may be required to segregate
the fiduciary funds from the “general assets” of the bank and have a separate accounting for
transactions involving the segregated funds. 295
In addition, depending on the nature and scope of the services that transfer agents
provide, they must comply with certain regulations and other guidance issued by the U.S.
Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) and the Internal Revenue Service. For example,
transfer agents track and report to the Internal Revenue Service the dividend income and share
sale activity they facilitate on behalf of issuers via Form 1099 reporting, 296 and follow federal
law requirements concerning tax withholding, where appropriate. 297

297

For example, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”), enacted in 2010, is intended to reduce
tax evasion by U.S. individuals with respect to income from financial assets held outside the United States
by requiring foreign financial institutions to, among other things, report directly to the Internal Revenue
Service certain information about financial accounts held by U.S. taxpayers, or by foreign entities in which
U.S. taxpayers hold a substantial ownership interest. See Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act,
Pub. L. No. 111-147, §§501-541 (1986). Under FATCA, foreign financial institutions such as investment
funds domiciled outside the United States are permitted to contract with their transfer agents or other agents
to perform certain due diligence and other FATCA obligations on their behalf. A transfer agent’s service
agreement may take into account these new responsibilities, under which the transfer agent may be required
to perform due diligence on all investors listed in the investor record, report on U.S. individuals and

SRO Rules and Requirements Applicable to Transfer Agents

This section discusses some of the SRO rules and requirements applicable to transfer
agents. While we focus here on NYSE and DTC requirements, we do so by way of example
only. Other SROs may have additional rules which could apply to transfer agents in different
contexts.
1.

NYSE Requirements

Transfer agents for NYSE listed securities are also subject to NYSE requirements. The
requirements focus on (i) dual registrars and transfer agents; (ii) turnaround times; (iii)
capitalization; and (iv) insurance coverage. The requirements also address transfer agent
personnel, safeguarding, and co-transfer agents.
First, the NYSE Listed Company Manual (“NYSE LCM”), Section 601.01(B), provides
that one person may serve as both registrar and transfer agent subject to compliance with the
following conditions: (i) meeting insurance and net capital requirements (discussed in more
detail below); (ii) maintaining the functions separately and distinctly with appropriate internal
controls; (iii) annual review of such internal controls by the transfer agent's independent auditors;
(iv) submitting financial statements to the exchange; and (v) obtaining a certification from the
transfer agent’s insurer that NSYE insurance requirements have been met. This provision is less
restrictive than stock exchange prohibitions on serving as a dual registrar and transfer agent that

institutions investing in the fund, and apply FATCA withholding to certain payments. For more
information on regulations, rulings, notices, announcements, and other FATCA-related guidance or
requirements for financial institutions, see, e.g., FATCA- Regulations and Other Guidance, IRS,
http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Corporations/FATCA-Regulations-and-Other-Guidance.

Page 83 of 208

existed in earlier eras. 298 It is the understanding of the Commission staff that outside or
independent registrars are rarely used today. 299
Second, as noted above, NYSE also imposes turnaround time requirements. NYSE LCM
Section 601.01(A)(2) requires that routine transfers (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-1)
“must be processed under normal conditions within 48 hours of receipt of the securities by the
transfer agent at its address designated for registration of transfers.” The 48 hour turnaround
requirement was adopted by the NYSE in 1971 (originally as Rule 496) in the immediate wake
of the transfer agent problems during the Paperwork Crisis. 300 The Commission adopted its Rule
17Ad-2 turnaround requirement (providing for three day turnaround) approximately six years
later in 1977. In the adopting release for Rule 17Ad-2, the Commission stated “The adopted
rules are not intended to and do not supersede any rules of self-regulatory organizations which
impose more stringent performance standards.” 301

298

See Rockwell Study, supra note 19, at 101 (1969 study discussing NYSE prohibition on serving as dual
registrar and transfer agent); Securities Exchange Act Release No. 21499, File No. SR-NYSE-84-33 (Nov.
19, 1984) (discussing prior 1971 NYSE rule change permitting banks and trusts to serve as dual registrar
and transfer agent and approving NYSE rule change to eliminate prohibition on acting as dual transfer
agent and registrar that had applied to transfer agents other than banks and trusts, subject to certain
conditions).

299

Separate registrars and transfer agents still were common between 1977 and 1983, when the Commission
adopted the majority of its transfer agent rules. Although even by that point, stock exchanges had relaxed
certain prohibitions on serving as dual transfer agent and registrar, the practice often was followed because
many securities industry participants believed that the independent registrar served an audit function that
protected investors. See Study of the Securities Industry: Hearings Before the Subcomm. on Commerce
and Fin. of the H. Comm. on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 92nd Cong. app. DD 2391 (1971) (“1971
Study of the Securities Industry Hearings”) (Statement of Herman W. Bevis, Executive Director of
BASIC).

Third, NYSE LCM Section 601.01(A)(1)(i) requires that a transfer agent must have at
least $10 million in “capital, surplus (both capital and earned), undivided profits, and capital
reserves.” Where a transfer agent is unable to meet this capital requirement, NYSE LCM
Section 601.01(A)(12) provides for a lower alternative capital standard of $2 million that the
transfer agent may meet if it maintains certain additional insurance coverage. 302 The
requirements may also be satisfied by a parent company. 303 Fourth, NYSE LCM Section
601.01(A)(1)(ii) requires that a transfer agent maintain insurance coverage of at least $25 million
“to protect securities while in process.” 304
The NYSE also requires transfer agents to be staffed with “experienced personnel
qualified to handle so-called ‘legal terms’ and to advise on and handle other transfer
problems.” 305 A transfer agent is also required to assume responsibility and liability for
securities in its possession and must “provide adequate facilities for the safekeeping of securities
in its possession or under its control.” 306 Additional provisions address other items specific to
the NYSE, co-transfer agents, and independent registrars. 307

302

See NYSE Listed Co. Manual §601.01(A)(12) (2013) (making the lower capital standard conditional on the
maintenance by the transfer agent of “errors and omissions insurance coverage in an amount which, taken
together with its capital, surplus (both capital and earned), undivided profits, and capital reserves, equals at
least $10,000,000 and, provided further, that such transfer agent maintains the insurance required by
Para.601.01(A)(1)(ii).”)

DTC Requirements

Transfer agents who participate in DRS must comply with DTC rules and regulations.
Many transfer agents participate in DRS, especially because national U.S. securities exchanges,
including NYSE and NASDAQ, require newly listed securities to be DRS eligible. 308
DTC requires transfer agents to satisfy four primary requirements before being eligible to
process DRS transactions, including the following:
•

Because DRS is integrated for communication purposes into DTC’s Profile
system, transfer agents must become “Limited Participants” in DTC by
submitting an application to the DRS Program Administration for DTC
approval. 309

•

Participate in DTC’s FAST program by becoming a FAST agent and agreeing to
DTC’s Operational Criteria for FAST Transfer Agent Processing (“FAST
criteria”). The FAST criteria outline rules for securities transfers through FAST,
DTC’s Operational Arrangements, and DTC’s Balance Certificate Agreement.
The Operational Arrangements include, among other things, DTC’s requirements
for issues to be DTC-eligible, additional transfer requirements for FAST agents,
record date requirements, and dividend and income notification procedures. By
signing the Balance Certificate Agreement with DTC, transfer agents agree to
maintain DTC-eligible inventory in the form of jumbo certificates registered in

308

See NYSE Listed Co. Manual §501.00 (2013) (requiring “all securities listed on the Exchange [to] be
eligible for a direct registration system operated by a securities depository”); NASDAQ Rule 5210(c)
(requiring “all securities initially listing on Nasdaq, except securities which are book-entry only, [to] be
eligible for a Direct Registration Program operated by a clearing agency registered under Section 17A of
the [Exchange] Act.”).

309

Profile was implemented by DTC in 2000 to “electronically convey an investor's request to move from one
form of securities ownership to another. Profile takes the place of the paper transaction advice for
electronic movement of securities positions between street-name positions and direct registration bookentry positions. Profile includes all the data fields listed on the paper transaction advice, including the
investor’s broker-dealer account number, investor’s DRS account number, Tax I.D./Social Security
number, full registration, and CUSIP.” DTC, An Overview, available at
http://www.dtc.org/dtcpublic/html/lob2/prod6/drsdetail.htm. In addition, since 2001, the Profile Surety
Program has provided for a surety bond to help mitigate the risks for parties using DRS and Profile, similar
to a medallion stamp on a certificated security.

Page 86 of 208

the name of DTC’s nominee, Cede & Co., and that they will electronically
reconcile DTC participants’ daily deposit and withdrawal activities.
•

Establish and maintain electronic communication links with DTC through Profile
so that DTC participants (e.g., broker-dealers) and limited participants (e.g.,
transfer agents) can communicate investors’ instructions electronically. DTC
requires transfer agents to complete DRS and Profile training before using Profile.
Profile includes data fields that would be included in a traditional paper
transaction, including the investor’s broker-dealer account number, investor’s
DRS account number, Tax I.D./Social Security number, and CUSIP numbers of
the securities. Once those instructions are transmitted, the actual movement of
securities ownership takes place in DRS.

•

Participate in DTC’s Profile Surety Program, which functions similarly to the
medallion guarantee programs for paper based transactions by providing for a
surety bond to back the representations made by the transacting parties. 310

Additionally, DTC criteria that must be met by a securities issuer to ensure its securities
are eligible for DRS and Profile may indirectly apply to transfer agents acting on behalf of the
issuer. For example, DTC requires issuers to mail DRS book-entry statements to registered
owners evidencing their holdings at least once a year. 311 Transfer agents acting on behalf of
issuers wishing to participate in DRS may therefore be asked by their issuer clients to handle this
statement mailing function.
D.

Regulation of Transfer Agents Under State Law

Transfer agents are subject indirectly to state corporation law when acting as agents of
corporate issuers, and they are directly subject to state commercial law, principal-agent law, and
other laws, many of which are focused on corporate governance and the rights and obligations of

310

See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 41862 (Sept. 10, 1999), 64 FR 51162, 51163 (Sept. 21, 1999)
(File No. SR-DTC-99-16). See also supra note 86 (regarding FAST requirements).

DTC requirements for DRS and Profile eligible transfer agents and issuers are discussed in greater detail at

issuers and securityholders. 312 While a full discussion of all state laws applicable to transfer
agents is beyond the scope of this release, the transfer of investment securities is primarily
governed by UCC Article 8, which has been adopted by the legislatures of all 50 states, 313 the
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Article 8 was most recently revised in
1994 to introduce the concept of a securities entitlement as a way to simplify and clarify the rules
for the modern street name system. 314 Although UCC Article 8 is intended to provide a uniform
and practical definition of the responsibilities of issuers and their agents in issuing and
transferring securities, it does not encompass or preempt the complete body of state laws that
may relate to transfer agent activity. 315 Transfer agents may also be subject to the laws of the
states of incorporation for both issuers and their securityholders that apply to specific services
provided by the transfer agent, such as data privacy. 316

EVOLUTION OF RECORDKEEPING, TRANSFER, AND RELATED
TRANSFER AGENT ACTIVITIES
This section discusses some of the core recordkeeping, transfer, and other activities that

transfer agents engage in, the manner in which the current transfer agent rules apply to those

312

See, e.g., Del. Code Ann. tit. 8 (Delaware General Corporation Law), Del. Code Ann. tit. 6, art. 8
(Investment Securities), Restatement (Third) of Agency (2006).

313

Louisiana has enacted the provisions of Article 8 into the body of its law, among others, but has not
adopted the UCC as a whole.

314

U.C.C. 8-501 et seq. (1994).

315

For example, in addition to UCC Article 8, various state laws relating to contracts, principal agent
relationships, estoppel, fraud, bankruptcy, escheatment (or abandoned property) and other areas may apply
to a specific transaction or situation.

316

For example, California’s privacy statute which became effective in 2003, was the first significant effort by
a state to assert substantive regulation of privacy of customer data. See Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1798.80–
1798.84. While state regulations vary across jurisdictions, other states have followed suit with similar
regulatory initiatives. See, e.g., Minn. Stat. § 325E.61, Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 87-801–807.

Page 88 of 208

activities, and how those activities have evolved over time. The world looks very different today
than it did in 1977, when the first transfer agent rules were adopted. Since then, the increased
use and decreased cost of technology, the expansion of corporate actions to bring securities into
the public market, the continued dematerialization of securities, and other changes have resulted
in significant evolution and changes to the types of services transfer agents provide and the
manner in which they provide them. At the same time, with limited exceptions, the
Commission’s transfer agent rules have not been updated. As a result, there may be divergence
between modern transfer agents’ activities and the activities that the Commission’s rules are
designed to regulate.
A.

Recordkeeping, Transfer, Issuance, and Corporate Actions

All transfer agents perform a number of core recordkeeping, transfer, and other services
related to their primary function of facilitating the transfer of securities. This section discusses
some of the activities transfer agents engage in with respect to these services and the relevant
transfer agent rules applicable to them.
1.

Recordkeeping: Rules 17Ad-9, 10, and 11

Transfer agents have direct responsibility for maintaining on behalf of the issuer the
currency and integrity of the official list of the registered owners of an issuer’s stocks and bonds,
how those stocks and bonds are held, and how many shares or bonds each investor owns. This
list is defined by Rule 17Ad-9(b) as the master securityholder file. 317 Without the master
securityholder file, registered owners of an issuer’s securities cannot be assured that they are

317

See Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-9(b), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-9(b).

Page 89 of 208

recognized as such by the issuer and that they will receive corporate distributions,
communications, and the other rights of security ownership to which they are entitled. 318
Transfer agents also maintain and keep current the control book which is defined by Rule
17Ad-9(d) as the record of the total number of shares of equity securities or the principal dollar
amount of debt securities authorized and issued by the issuer for each issue the transfer agent
services. 319 As discussed above in Section IV.A.3, one of the main purposes of the control book
is to allow the transfer agent to monitor the number of securities outstanding to prevent
overissuance because the total number of shares reflected in the aggregate on the master
securityholder file should match the number of shares authorized in the control book. 320
Finally, pursuant to Rule 17Ad-6, transfer agents maintain the transfer journal. 321 The
transfer journal can be a useful tool for transfer agents and issuers. For example, when reviewed
in conjunction with the master securityholder file, the transfer journal may provide historical
information regarding the issuance and transfer of a specific security or the holdings of a specific
securityholder. The transfer agent rules do not define transfer journal nor codify requirements
with respect to the transfer journal.

318

See generally, e.g., Del. Code Ann. tit. 8 §§ 170, 173 (authorizing a corporation to pay cash and stock
dividends under certain circumstances); Exchange Act Rule 14c-3, 17 CFR 240.14c-3 (requirement to
furnish an annual report to securityholders); Del. Code Ann. tit. 8 §212 (providing for voting rights of
stockholders and permitting them to vote by proxy); Del. Code Ann. tit. 8 §222 (requirement to send
stockholder notice in advance of stockholder meeting).

319

Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-9(d), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-9(d).

320

When acting in this capacity, a transfer agent may be referred to as a “registrar.” See Exchange Act
Section 3(a)(25), 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(25).

321

Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-6, 17 CFR 240.17Ad-6.

Page 90 of 208

The primary recordkeeping rules that apply to the core records discussed above include
Rules 17Ad-9, 17Ad-10, and 17Ad-11. These recordkeeping requirements are supplemented and
reinforced by the recordkeeping and record retention and preservation requirements found in
Rules 17Ad-6 and 17Ad-7. Rules 17Ad-9 and 17Ad-10 define the term master securityholder
file, provide the specific information regarding a securityholder that must be maintained on the
master securityholder file, defined in the rules as certificate detail, 322 and set specific timing
deadlines for recording this information. 323 In addition, Rule 17Ad-10 imposes obligations on
transfer agents to carry over any existing certificate detail where they succeed to the maintenance
of a master securityholder file that was maintained in an earlier format or by a predecessor
transfer agent. 324
The Commission’s transfer agent rules seek to promote accurate recordkeeping by
transfer agents by establishing specific requirements when a transfer agent identifies a specific
type of discrepancy in its records referred to in Rule 17Ad-9(g) as a record difference. 325 Rule
17Ad-10(b) requires transfer agents to “exercise diligent and continuous attention to resolve all

322

See supra Section IV.A.3. We note that the “certificate detail” requirements in Rule 17Ad-9 apply to both
certificated securities and book-entry positions. Further, while we focus here on Rule 17Ad-9’s certificate
detail requirements, Rule 17Ad-9(a)(4) is relevant to other rules that depend on obtaining securityholders’
address information such as Rules 17Ad-12 and 17Ad-17. We also note that Rule 17Ad-9(b) permits
registered investment companies to maintain multiple, but linked, automated files with respect to bookentry securities.

323

With certain exceptions, certificate details must be posted within five business days, unless a transfer agent
is an “exempt transfer agent” under Rule 17Ad-4(b) or an issuer acting as its own transfer agent for its own
securities. Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-10(a)(2)(i)-(ii), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-10(a)(2)(i)-(ii).

324

See Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-10(h), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-10(h). As discussed below in Section VI.B, the
rule does not require predecessor transfer agents to turn over such information to the issuer or to a
successor transfer agent.

325

Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-9(g), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-9(g). For additional discussion of the goals and
objectives of the Commission’s transfer agent rules, see supra Section IV.

Page 91 of 208

record differences.” Further, Rule 17Ad-10(b) requires that every recordkeeping transfer agent
maintain and keep current an accurate master securityholder file and subsidiary files, and if a
record difference is identified, then both the master securityholder file and subsidiary files must
accurately represent all relevant debits and credits until the record difference is resolved. 326
As discussed above, if a record difference exists for “more than thirty calendar days,” it
becomes an aged record difference under Rule 17Ad-11(a)(2). 327 Depending upon the aggregate
market value of the aged record differences for a particular issuer and the capitalization of the
issuer, Rule 17Ad-11(b) may require the transfer agent to send a monthly report to the affected
issuer. 328 Depending on the total number of issuers serviced and the aggregate market value of
all record differences across all issuers serviced, the transfer agent may also need to make reports
to its ARA pursuant to Rule 17Ad-11(c). 329

326

Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-10(b), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-10(b). We also note that, as part of a transfer agent’s
obligation to monitor against overissuances, Rule 17Ad-10(g) imposes buy-in obligations when an actual
physical overissuance has occurred that was caused by the transfer agent. Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-10(g),
17 CFR 240.17Ad-10(g). There are limited exceptions to this requirement. See Exchange Act Rules
17Ad-10(g)(2)-(3), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-10(g)(2)-(3).

327

Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-11(a)(2), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-11(a)(2).

328

Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-11(b), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-11(b). Rule 17Ad-11(b) also requires, without
imposing any minimum threshold as with the amount of aged record differences, that the transfer agent
report to issuers concerning any securities bought-in pursuant to Rule 17Ad-10(g) or reported as bought-in
pursuant to Rule17Ad-10(c) during the preceding month.

329

Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-11(c), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-11(c). The report to the ARA must also include
information concerning buy-ins required by Rule 17Ad-10 (g) when the aggregate market value of all buyins during a calendar quarter exceeds $100,000. Id.

Securities Transfers, Exchanges, and Conversions: Rules 17Ad-9, 10,
12, and 19

Transfer agents are integrally involved in effecting transfers of ownership of securities, as
well as exchanging and converting securities. 330 For example, an equity sale would usually
involve a transfer. In contrast, a stock-for-stock merger, where the equity security of Company
A is exchanged for an equity security of Company B (and Company B is the disappearing
company) would involve an exchange. Finally, a securityholder’s election to convert a
convertible debt security into an equity security would usually involve a conversion. While
these transfer agent services vary in terms of definition, the transfer agent rules apply to all of
them in substantially similar ways. Therefore, for the purposes of describing all of these services
in the discussion that follows, we will focus on the activities and rules applicable to transfers.
In connection with transfers of certificated securities, the first steps in the transfer process
are to match the certificate detail with the master securityholder file, verify the signature
guarantee, and then cancel the negotiable certificate that has been presented for transfer. With
respect to verifying the signature, presentation by the transferor typically involves providing the
transfer agent an indorsed security certificate bearing a medallion stamp. In some cases, the
indorsement and assignment may be made not on the certificate itself but by an executed power
of attorney authorizing the transfer of ownership on the books of the issuer. 331

330

The terms “exchange” and “conversion” are used in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(25) and in the
Commission’s transfer agent rules but are not defined in the Commission’s transfer agent rules. The term
“exchange” is commonly used to refer to the trading of specific securities for another asset, usually without
an accompanying change in ownership. The term “conversion” is commonly used to refer to the changing
into or substitution of one security for another security or asset under specific conditions, also without an
accompanying change in ownership.

331

See supra note 18 (regarding powers of attorney).

Page 93 of 208

Rule 17Ad-19 governs certificate cancellation and requires that “every transfer agent
involved in the handling, processing, or storage of securities certificates shall establish and
implement written procedures for the cancellation, storage, transportation, destruction, or other
disposition of securities certificates.” 332 The rule grants transfer agents flexibility to develop
their own procedures, but depending on which procedures they adopt (i.e., cancellation,
destruction, or other disposition), they must comply with minimum requirements regarding three
general areas: (i) the manner of cancellation and destruction of certificates; (ii) the storage and
transport of cancelled certificates; and (iii) recordkeeping with respect to cancelled
certificates. 333
Rule 17Ad-12 governs the safeguarding of cancelled certificates. First, certificates that
are cancelled generally must be stamped or perforated with the word “CANCELLED” and, for
any cancelled certificate that is subsequently destroyed, the destruction of certificates must be
witnessed by authorized personnel of the transfer agent or its designee. 334 Second, transfer
agents must control access to the location where cancelled certificates are kept and transport of
cancelled certificates must be made in a “secure manner.” 335 If cancelled certificates are not

333

Id.

334

Exchange Act Rules 17Ad-19(c)(2), (6), 17 CFR 17.24017Ad-19(c)(2), (6). The requirement to stamp or
perforate the certificate as cancelled does not apply where “the transfer agent has procedures adopted
pursuant to this rule for the destruction of cancelled certificates within three business days of their
cancellation.” In addition, a certificate may be marked “cancelled” and stored for a period of time before
being destroyed.

335

Exchange Act Rules 17Ad-19(c)(1), (5), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-19(c)(1), (5).

Page 94 of 208

destroyed, they must be retained for six years pursuant to Rule 17Ad-7(d). 336 Furthermore, Rule
17Ad-12 requires that cancelled certificates be “held in safekeeping and…handled, in light of all
facts and circumstances, in a manner reasonably free from risk of theft, loss or destruction (other
than by a transfer agent's certificate destruction procedures pursuant to § 240.17Ad-19).” Third,
transfer agents must keep a record regarding each cancelled certificate that is in transit and
records for each cancelled certificate and destroyed certificate that in both cases are “indexed and
retrievable by CUSIP and certificate number.” 337 These records must be kept for three years.
Once the old certificate has been cancelled, the next step in the transfer of a certificated
security will generally involve recording the change of record ownership of the relevant
securities on the master securityholder file. In the context of certificated securities, this is done
by debiting the securities account of the transferor. Rule 17Ad-9(f) defines the term “debit” as
“a cancellation of appropriate certificate detail from the master securityholder file.” Because the
cancellation date is one of the defined elements of certificate detail under Rule 17Ad-9, together

336

We note that when the Commission adopted Rule 17Ad-19 in 2003 addressing among other things the
destruction of certificates, it did not amend Rule 17Ad-7(d) to delete the requirement to retain cancelled
security certificates for six years. But concurrently in 2003, the Commission amended Rule 17Ad-7(f) such
that “the records required to be maintained pursuant to § 240.17Ad-6 may be retained using electronic or
micrographic media….” See Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-7(f), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-7(f); Recordkeeping
Requirements for Transfer Agents, supra note 215. We understand that many transfer agents today follow
a practice of destroying certificates after a period of time in accordance with their individual policies and in
compliance with Rule 17Ad-19 but keep electronic copies of the cancelled certificate by imaging it to
comply with Rule 17Ad-7 as well as keeping the records required by Rule 17Ad-19(c)(4) for destroyed
certificates.

337

Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-9(c)(5), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-9(c)(5). The record regarding cancelled
certificates in transit must show the certificate numbers and CUSIP numbers. The records
regarding both cancelled certificates and destroyed certificates must include “the CUSIP number,
certificate number with any prefix or suffix, denomination, registration, issue date, and
cancellation date.” Exchange Act Rules 17Ad-9(c)(3)-(4), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-9(c)(3)-(4).

Page 95 of 208

Rules 17Ad-9(a)(6) and 17Ad-10 have the effect of requiring that the cancellation date be posted
to the master securityholder file, generally within five business days. 338
The final step in the process of completing a transfer for a certificated security is for the
transfer agent to issue (on behalf of the issuer) a new security to the transferee. The transfer
agent’s role in connection with the issuance stage of transfer is discussed in more detail in the
next section below.
For uncertificated securities, transfer agents do not issue or cancel physical securities
certificates when transferring securities. Instead, they effect book-entry transfers by registering
the change in ownership on the master securityholder file, which does not involve the physical
issuance and cancelling of securities certificates. The term “registering” means an official form
of recording by a person charged with that function, which is accomplished under Exchange Act
Rules 17Ad-9(h) and 17Ad-10(e) by updating the master securityholder file, as discussed above.
Book-entry transfer may be accomplished through DTC’s DRS using DTC’s Profile system. 339
Once the transfer has been effected, the investor would receive from the transfer agent a
statement of ownership that acknowledges his or her new DRS position.
3.

Securities Issuance: Rules 17Ad-1 and 2

Transfer agents are also involved in the issuance of securities, which may be one of the
final stages before completing a transfer, as discussed above, or could involve a primary offering

338

Exchange Act Rules 17Ad-9-10, 17 CFR 240.17Ad-9-10. Moreover, Congress in the Dodd-Frank Act has
taken another step to tighten recordkeeping of cancelled securities by adding “cancelled” securities as a
category of securities that must be reported to the Commission or its designee. See Exchange Act Section
17(f)(1), 78 U.S.C. 187(f)(1).

339

See supra note 93.

Page 96 of 208

of securities such as an initial public offering. Generally, from the perspective of the transfer
agent facilitating a transfer, issuance will involve a credit to the transferee’s securities account,
as compared to the cancellation and transfer processes discussed above, which involve debiting
the securities account of the transferor.
The clock for turnaround under Rules 17Ad-1 and 17Ad-2 begins when a transfer agent
receives an item and ends when a transfer agent issues the new security. Thus, from the transfer
agent’s perspective, issuance is what stops the clock. Rule 17Ad-2(a) generally has the effect of
imposing a three day deadline on turnaround of transfer of a routine item. 340 Rule 17Ad-1
provides in general terms that turnaround is achieved “when transfer is accomplished.” 341 In
turn, “transfer is accomplished” when “all acts necessary to cancel the certificate or certificates
presented for transfer and to issue a new certificate or certificates…are completed and the item is
made available to the presentor by the transfer agent…” 342 Thus, with certain exceptions, the
“made available” standard 343 functions similar to a “mailbox” rule because the item is
considered to have been made available when the transfer agent mails the new certificate to the
transferee (or otherwise makes it available).

340

If a transfer agent fails to turnaround 90% of routine items received during a month within three business
days of receipt, certain sanctions apply. See discussion supra Section IV.B for additional details on the
turnaround requirements and requirements in the event of failure to meet the turnaround requirements.

341

Rule 17Ad-1(c)(2) applies a different measurement of when turnaround is achieved when an outside
registrar is involved: instead of the clock stopping when the new certificate is presented to the transferee, it
stops when the item is “made available” to the outside registrar. Thus, turnaround will be accomplished
when the transfer agent “completes all acts necessary to cancel the certificate or certificates presented for
transfer and to issue a new certificate or certificates, and the item is made available to an outside registrar.”
Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-1(c)(2), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-1(c)(2).

342

If the presentor has given special instructions, the timing is measured differently. See Exchange Act Rule
17Ad-1(d), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-1(d).

343

See Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-1(c)(1), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-1(c)(1).

Page 97 of 208

Upon issuing the new security to the transferee, the transfer agent must credit the
securities account of the transferee receiving the new security. This is accomplished by posting
to the master securityholder file all of the certificate detail information set forth in Rule 17Ad9(a), generally within five business days. 344
In the case of an uncertificated security, there is no certificate to cancel and no new
certificate to be issued. Under Rule 17Ad-1(d), posting the new ownership information to the
master securityholder file changes the ownership information of the securities account and
“completes registration of change in ownership of all or a portion of those securities.”
Transfer agents are also responsible for countersigning securities upon issuance, which
provides critical authentication of a security by an independent, outside actor. In general,
“countersigning” means a signature added to a document previously signed by another person for
authentication or confirmation. The second signature confirms the first signature, and the two
signatures together are intended to show the certificate’s legitimacy. In the case of certificated
securities, the first signer is typically an officer of the issuing corporation, and the countersigner
is typically an independent officer of the issuer’s transfer agent. The procedures involved in
countersignature of physical certificates are not mandated by the Exchange Act, 345 but are

344

See Exchange Act Rules 17Ad-9(a), 17Ad-10, 17 CFR 240.17Ad-9(a), 17Ad-10. We note that, in the case
of a cancellation, which involves a “debit” to the master securityholder file under Rule 17Ad-9, the
cancellation date would be the only portion of the “certificate detail” required to be posted to the master
securityholder file. See Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-9, 17 CFR 240.17Ad-9.

345

As discussed in Section IV.A, the Exchange Act, however, includes countersigning certificates as one
element of the definition of transfer agent in Section 3(a)(25).

Page 98 of 208

generally the product of other sources of law that either require them or otherwise address them
in certain respects, such as by permitting them to be made by facsimile. 346
In the case of DRS shares, where no certificate exists, an investor has the option of
having his or her ownership of securities registered in book-entry form on the issuer’s records or
on the books of the issuer’s transfer agent, and in either case the investor receives a “statement of
ownership.” 347 In either event, it is an important verification step in the issuance of a security
and highlights the important role that transfer agents play as intermediaries for the public
interest.
4.

Corporate Actions and Related Services: Rules 17Ad-1, 6, 10, 12, and
13

A corporate action is an event in the life of a security, typically instigated by the issuer,
which affects a position in that security. 348 Examples of common corporate actions include
changes that affect capital structure, such as a merger or acquisition, and distributions to
securityholders, such as a dividend distribution or principal or interest payment on a debt
security. Corporate actions may also include bankruptcy or liquidation proceedings,
conversions, warrants, exchange offers, subscription rights, tender offers, and other events. 349
Generally, corporate actions can be divided into two broad categories: mandatory and voluntary
(sometimes referred to as “elective.”) Mandatory corporate actions usually affect all

registration system could have their securities registered in book-entry form directly on the books of the
issuer and could receive a statement of ownership in lieu of a securities certificate.”).

securityholders equally and the securityholder does not have different options from which to
choose; voluntary corporate actions usually allow securityholders to choose among one or more
different elections they can make.
Transfer agents may perform a variety of roles and provide a variety of services,
depending on the type and nature of the corporate action. For example, a transfer agent may take
on the role of exchange agent in a mandatory corporate action, such as a stock-for-stock merger
or a cash-for-stock merger. In a stock-for-stock merger the exchange agent might facilitate the
surrender of outstanding securities for new securities, and in a cash-for-stock merger the
exchange agent might facilitate the exchange of outstanding securities for cash.
In both of these examples, under Rule 17Ad-10, the transfer agent performing exchange
agent services generally must update the master securityholder file with certificate details within
five business days. But because the transfer associated with some of the most common corporate
actions qualify as non-routine items under Rule 17Ad-1, including transfers “in connection with
a reorganization, tender offer, exchange, redemption, or liquidation,” 350 the general three
business day deadline for turnaround of routine items under Rule 17Ad-2 may not apply.
However, if a transfer agent makes a determination that a transfer does fall within Rule 17Ad1(i)(5) and therefore is non-routine, Rule 17Ad-6(a)(11) requires the transfer agent to maintain
records documenting the basis for this determination. 351 Other aspects of the processing of the

350

Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-1(i)(5), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-1(i)(5).

351

A large portion of specific records that transfer agents are required to maintain under Rule 17Ad-6 and to
retain for different periods of time under Rule 17Ad-7 relate to: (i) the classification of an item as routine or
non-routine; (ii) tracking the compliance of the transfer agent with the performance standards for
turnaround of routine items under Rule 17Ad-2(a); and (iii) the performance standards for processing of all
items pursuant to Rule 17Ad-2(b).

Page 100 of 208

corporate action may cause the corporate action to be classified as non-routine as well. For
example, if a transfer associated with a corporate action involves a need to review “explanations,
or opinions of counsel before transfer may be effected,” requires “review of supporting
documentation” other than routine documentation, or includes a warrant, right, or convertible
security “presented for exercise or conversion” or “presented for transfer...within five business
days” before expiry it will be considered non-routine under Rule 17Ad-1. 352
Voluntary corporate actions, which permit securityholders to choose among different
options, may result in the need for additional tasks and systems for transfer agents to process
them. For example, in addition to the ordinary recordkeeping tasks, the transfer agent may be
responsible for monitoring whether elections have been made by deadlines and for tracking such
elections.
In addition to the examples discussed above, transfer agent roles in connection with
corporate actions may also include serving as: (i) tender agent, when the transfer agent collects
shares surrendered from securityholders and makes payments for the shares at a predetermined
price; (ii) exchange agent, when the transfer agent collects shares surrendered from
securityholders and issues, registers, and/or distributes shares of the bidding company’s
securities as compensation for tendered securities of the subject company; (iii) subscription
agent, when the transfer agent invites existing equity securityholders of an issuer to subscribe to
a new issuance of additional debt or equity of the issuer; (iv) conversion agent, for example
when the transfer agent converts debt securities into equity securities; and (v) escrow agent,

352

Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-1(i), 17 CFR 17Ad-1(i).

Page 101 of 208

when the transfer agent holds an asset on behalf of one party for delivery to another party upon
specified conditions or events.
Finally, transfer agents providing corporate action services may be subject to Rule 17Ad12 and 17Ad-13, regarding safeguarding requirements for funds and securities and an annual
audit of internal control of safeguarding procedures. As discussed above, corporate actions may
involve transfer agents making distributions on behalf of issuers to securityholders of cash and
stock dividends as well as principal and interest payments on debt securities. Rule 17Ad-12(a)
requires that:
Any registered transfer agent that has custody or possession
of any funds or securities related to its transfer agent
activities shall assure that: (1) All such securities are held
in safekeeping and are handled, in light of all facts and
circumstances, in a manner reasonably free from risk of
theft, loss or destruction…; and (2) All such funds are
protected, in light of all facts and circumstances, against
misuse.
Rule 17Ad-13 requires every registered transfer agent to file an annual report with the
Commission and the transfer agent's ARA prepared by an independent accountant concerning the
transfer agent's system of internal accounting controls and procedures for, among other things,
safeguarding of securities and funds. Specifically, Rule 17Ad-13(a)(2)(iii) requires the report to
cover “[t]ransferring record ownership as a result of corporate actions” and Rule 17Ad13(a)(2)(iv) requires the report to cover “[d]ividend disbursement or interest paying-agent
activities.”
B.

Annual Meeting, Proxy-Related Services, and Securityholder Services and
Communications

One of the key rights of securityholders is the right to vote their shares on important
matters that affect the companies they own. Pursuant to state corporate law, registered
Page 102 of 208

securityholders may either attend a meeting to vote shares in person or authorize an agent to act
as their “proxy” at the meeting to vote their shares pursuant to their voting instructions. 353
Because most securityholders do not physically attend public company securityholder meetings,
the corporate proxy is the principal means by which they exercise their voting rights.
The process in the United States for distributing proxy materials and soliciting,
tabulating, and verifying votes by securityholders is complex, especially with respect to
beneficial securityholders. 354 Most corporate issuers and securities intermediaries such as banks
and brokers rely on a proxy service firm to perform these functions, which may include
distributing and forwarding the proxy materials and collecting and tabulating voting instructions.
Alternatively, some issuers choose to engage their transfer agents for certain parts of the proxy
distribution process, such as printing and distributing proxy materials either directly to registered
securityholders or to intermediaries, which will then distribute them to beneficial owners either
through the mail or electronically. 355 Providing these services may be a natural extension of a
transfer agent’s core functions because most transfer agents will already possess and maintain
the master securityholder file listing the issuer’s registered securityholders, will have the
infrastructure in place to communicate with registered securityholders, and will be in a position

353

See Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, §212 (b), (c). A full discussion of the proxy system is beyond the scope. For
more information on the proxy system, see Proxy Concept Release, supra note 112.

354

Beneficial owners holding securities in street name are not technically entitled to vote shares or grant proxy
authority. Rather, the voting rights reside with Cede & Co. as the record owner of all street name shares.
However, because Cede & Co.’s role is only that of nominee for DTC as custodian and it has no beneficial
interest in the shares, mechanisms have been developed in order to pass the legal rights it holds as the
record owner to the beneficial owners, enabling them to vote. For a more comprehensive discussion of
these and other issues relating to the U.S. proxy and indirect holding systems, see Proxy Concept Release,
supra note 112.

to reconcile the identity of registered voters and the number of votes against the official records
of the issuer. 356 Typical transfer agent proxy services might include mailing or electronically
transmitting notices of meetings, 357 proxy statements, and proxy cards 358 to securityholders.
In addition, under many state statutes, an issuer must appoint a vote tabulator (sometimes
referred to as the “inspector of elections” or “proxy tabulator”) to collect and tabulate the proxy
votes as well as ballot votes cast in person by registered owners at a securityholder meeting. 359
As with proxy distribution services, some issuers hire their transfer agent to create sophisticated
voting platforms for securityholders or to act as the vote tabulator. 360 The vote tabulator is
ultimately responsible for determining whether shares are represented at the meeting, the validity
of proxies received, and tallying the votes. 361 The tabulator must determine that the correct

See, e.g., Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, § 222 (2001). See also Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, § 232 (2001).

358

In cases where the issuer is relying upon the notice and access model of proxy statement distribution, the
proxy card must be mailed even if the proxy statement is not mailed by the issuer. See Final Rule: Internet
Availability of Proxy Materials, Exchange Act Release No. 55146, 10 (Jan. 22, 2007), 72 FR 4148 (Jan. 29,
2007).

359

See, e.g., Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, § 231(a)-(c)(2001) (inspectors must be appointed in advance of all
stockholder meetings of publicly held corporations and have responsibility for ascertaining the number of
shares outstanding and the voting power of each, determining the shares represented at the meeting and the
validity of proxies and ballots, counting all votes and ballots, creating and retaining a record of the
disposition of any challenges made to any determination of the inspectors, and certifying their
determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting and the count of all votes and ballots).

360

Sometimes the issuer will hire an independent third party other than the transfer agent to perform the proxy
tabulation function, such as to certify important votes. In such cases, the issuer or its transfer agent
typically will provide the third party vote tabulator with the list of record owners so the vote tabulator can
make this determination. Additionally, in contested votes, the issuer will commonly retain an independent
inspector to count the proxies. See, e.g., www.ivsassociates.com/html/index2.htm.

361

See, e.g., Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, § 231(2001); see also Marcel Kahan & Edward B. Rock, The Hanging
Chads of Corporate Voting, 96 Geo. L.J. 1227, 1235 (2008) (“Where more than one valid proxy is given
for a share, the later proxy revokes the earlier proxy. Determining the validity of proxies and the tally of
votes is the responsibility of the inspector, appointed by the corporation.”), available at

number of votes has been submitted by each registered owner and determine that proxies
submitted by securities intermediaries that are not registered owners are reconciled with DTC’s
securities position listing for that intermediary (i.e., determining that the number of nominee
shares voted equals the number of shares that DTC indicates are held in nominee name). 362
Although the Commission does regulate transfer agents, which often serve as vote tabulators, it
does not regulate the function of tabulating proxies by transfer agents.
All transfer agents also provide some level of securityholder communications services.
The level of services may depend on the type or size of the issuer, but at a minimum, most
transfer agents facilitate the mailing of quarterly and annual statements with details of holdings,
transaction confirmations, and letters or communications confirming other transactions, such as
address-change confirmations. Many transfer agents also provide tax reporting services,
including sending tax forms such as W-9, W-8BEN, 1099-DIV, and 1099-B.
Most transfer agents also receive and respond to inquiries and requests by securityholders
and non-securityholders, 363 often through interactive websites, call centers, and the like.
Requests may involve a transfer (for example, a gift of fund shares from one family member to
another) or a change in the securityholder’s account, such as an address change or different
election regarding dividend reinvestment. For transfer agents to open-end mutual funds,
transfers may involve a purchase (i.e., a “subscription”) or sale (i.e., a “redemption”) of the

362

See Proxy Concept Release, supra note 112. See, e.g.,
http://www.amstock.com/corporate/corporate_proxy.asp.

363

As discussed supra Section IV.A, several Commission rules address securityholder inquiries. See
Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-5, 17 CFR 240.17Ad-5 (written inquiries and requests); Exchange Act Rules
17Ad-6, 7, 17 U.S.C. 240.17Ad-6, 7 (recordkeeping and retention requirements regarding inquiries and
requests).

Page 105 of 208

fund’s shares. 364 Transfer agents may receive inquiries as well, which may not require
processing a transaction or account change, but may involve merely answering questions about
the securityholder’s account or regarding the issuer generally. 365 Requests and inquiries are
transmitted to transfer agents through various methods, including by telephone, mail, facsimile,
email, internet, mobile communication device, and in-person. The predominance of telephone
and other forms of electronic communication as favored methods for securityholders to
communicate with issuers and their transfer agents, including the use of standardized protocols
over the internet, means that managing sizable call centers and other customer service
departments, with many representatives fielding calls and other message-traffic, has become a
critical aspect of the transfer agent-issuer relationship.
One aspect of these securityholder services is lost certificate replacement. If a
securityholder loses a certificate, the old certificate must be cancelled and new shares issued,
either in certificated or book-entry form. Transfer agents facilitate this process by processing the
request and replacing the lost or missing certificate. Generally, the securityholder will be
required to fill out a declaration, affidavit, or other form with identifying information and a
description of the circumstances giving rise to the loss and pay a fee to the transfer agent for
processing the request. Most transfer agents will also require a surety bond to indemnify the
issuer and transfer agent against any potential losses in connection with the missing or
replacement certificate in the event it is later presented for transfer or conversion. The transfer

Inquiries about the securityholder’s account may relate, for example, to matters such as dividend
reinvestment or other account options.

agent will then report the lost or missing certificate to SIC pursuant to Rule 17f-1, as described
above in Section II.B.
C.

Regulatory Compliance and Reporting

Although not addressed directly in the transfer agent rules, most transfer agents today
provide assistance with issuers’ obligations to comply with various state and federal laws,
including the federal securities laws, because many issuer compliance obligations fall directly
into areas in which the transfer agent is already providing services to the issuer. For example,
transfer agents may use their mailing and fulfillment services to help issuers meet their
obligations to deliver certain documents to securityholders. 366 Transfer agents may also use their
existing recordkeeping capabilities to help issuers meet obligations regarding disclosure of
securityholders owning more than a certain threshold of ownership. 367 Further, investment
company issuers subject to anti-money laundering responsibilities under federal law may rely on
transfer agents to assist their compliance since this function is closely related to the new account
processing services and securityholder recordkeeping services transfer agents provide to these
issuers.
Finally, transfer agents spend a much greater amount of time and resources on assisting
issuers with their escheatment obligations under state law than they have done historically.
Escheatment is the process of transferring abandoned property to the state or territory. All 50

366

See, e.g., Exchange Act Rule 14c-3, 17 CFR 240.14c-3 (annual report to be furnished securityholders);
Investment Company Act Rule 30e-1, 17 CFR 270.30e-1 (reports to stockholders of management
companies); Investment Company Act Rule 30e-2, 17 CFR 270.30e-2 (reports to shareholders of unit
investment trusts).

367

See, e.g., SEC Form N-1A, Item 18 (Control Persons and Principal Holders of Securities), SEC Form 10-K,
Item 12 (Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder
Matters).

Page 107 of 208

states, Washington, DC, Puerto Rico, and all U.S. territories have abandoned property laws
which apply to any type of holding, including stock and associated payments made to
securityholders, such as dividend payments. When a property owner fails to demonstrate
ownership of property—for example, by not cashing dividend checks or responding to
mailings—for a period of time, that property is deemed abandoned and is turned over to the state.
The state then converts the property to cash within 30 days to two years. A securityholder who
is holding securities that have been escheated will only be able to reclaim the sale price the state
received, without interest, not the securities themselves. 368
Pursuant to these abandoned property laws, issuers, through their transfer agents, are
required to report when property is deemed to be abandoned based on the applicable abandoned
property statute. Thus, issuers are required to file abandoned property reports annually with the
individual states and U.S. territories, and to turn over abandoned property according to individual
state laws. Failure to file on time can result in significant penalties and interest fees per year.
Transfer agents typically assist issuers with initial escheatment filings with the states in
which securityholders have abandoned property, and then an annual filing every year after that
with those states. In addition to fulfilling reporting requirements, typical activities may include
attempted communications with the securityholder, maintaining up-to-date knowledge of federal
and state escheatment requirements, proper accounting and handling of property prior to
escheatment, and appropriate transfer of property.

368

See, e.g., Cal. Civ. Proc. Code §§ 1500 et. seq. (California’s requirements); Tex. Prop. Code Ann. §§ 72-76
(Texas’ requirements). We note also that Rule 17Ad-17 requires transfer agents to make certain efforts to
locate lost securityholders.

VI.

ADVANCE NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING
An advance notice of proposed rulemaking provides notice to the public that the agency

is considering rulemaking in an area so that the public can participate in the formulation of
potential future rules and can help shape a future notice of proposed rulemaking. Through this
advance notice of proposed rulemaking, the Commission is requesting comment on specific
areas and topics with respect to transfer agent regulation. As noted earlier, the Commission then
intends to review comments and to then propose new rules, as soon as is practicable, either
individually or in groups or phases to expedite the rulemaking process.
In particular, based on our current understanding of transfer agents and their functions,
the Commission intends to propose new or amended rules to: (1) expand the scope of
information collected by Forms TA-1 and TA-2 and capture all such information in a structured,
electronic format as needed to enhance aggregation, comparison, and analysis; (2) require that
any arrangement for transfer agent services between a registered transfer agent and an issuer be
set forth in a written agreement that addresses topics such as the transfer agent services to be
provided, the fee schedule, and requirements for the handing over of transfer agent records to the
successor transfer agent; (3) enhance transfer agents’ requirements for the safeguarding of issuer
and securityholder funds and securities; (4) apply an anti-fraud provision to specific activities of
transfer agents; (5) require transfer agents to establish business continuity and disaster recovery
plans; (6) require transfer agents to establish basic procedures regarding the use of information
technology, including methods of safeguarding personally identifiable information; (7) revise the
recordkeeping requirements to more fully capture the scope of a transfer agent’s business
activities; and (8) conform and update various terms and definitions to reflect modern systems
and usage, as well as the elimination of obsolete rules, such as those addressing Y2K issues.
Page 109 of 208

In addition to the specific requests for comments in each section below, we also seek
comment on the following:
1.

For all regulatory issues discussed below, please comment on the need for
revisions to the current regulatory framework, including the proposals described
above, and the benefits they could provide for transfer agents, investors, issuers,
and the capital markets. In particular, please comment on whether the proposals
will increase the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities
transactions or have other benefits, such as reducing the potential for fraudulent
activity. Please also comment on the potential effects on efficiency, competition,
and capital formation of potential revisions to the current regulatory framework, if
any. If you wish to comment on such potential benefits and effects, please
explain the implications of any impact on competition, economic efficiency,
capital formation, and the behavior of affected market participants, including
transfer agents, issuers, and investors. For each benefit, effect and implication,
provide supporting evidence and/or explain how such evidence may be obtained.
Also please describe the current competitive landscape for each such affected
transfer agent service. For example, to the extent possible, provide evidence on
the identities of current providers, their market shares, their ease or cost of entry
and exit, the cost to issuers of switching transfer agents, and the frequency of any
such switching. Are there any other issues that are not discussed below but that
should be addressed? If so, what are they and how should they be addressed?

2.

For all regulatory issues discussed below, please comment on any potential
interplay between applicable SRO rules and the potential revisions to the current
regulatory framework for transfer agents discussed herein, including any potential
conflicts that should be considered or resolved. Please provide a full explanation.

3.

Are there specific areas where transfer agents need additional guidance or
regulatory clarity regarding the applicability of current rules? How could such
guidance best be provided? Would rule modification, staff guidance, or an
industry roundtable be helpful?

4.

Should the Commission prioritize certain of the proposed rule changes discussed
in this Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking over others? If so, which ones
and why? Are there other rule changes besides those discussed in this Advance
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that the Commission should prioritize? Please
explain.

A.

Registration and Annual Reporting Requirements

As discussed generally above in Section IV.A, Forms TA-1 and TA-2 are used to: (i) help
regulators, issuers, investors, and other interested parties determine whether a transfer agent is
Page 110 of 208

and will continue to be able to perform its functions properly; (ii) help regulators, issuers,
investors, and other interested parties determine the nature of the business conducted by a
particular transfer agent; (iii) permit the Commission to effectively target its transfer agent
inspection program, including assisting examiners in preparing for and conducting transfer agent
examinations; (iv) monitor transfer agent activity generally; (v) enable Commission staff to
evaluate particular burdens and benefits that would be placed on the industry in potential
rulemaking endeavors; and (vi) assist the Commission and Commission staff in assuring that
rules are properly focused and refined. 369 Form TA-1 was developed and first adopted in
1975 370 and Form TA-2 was first adopted in 1986. 371 The information provided by these forms
serves, among others, the vital regulatory goals of informing the Commission’s oversight and
examination programs and informing the public about the nature and scope of transfer agents’
activities. The Commissions believes the usefulness and utility of both forms in serving these
important goals might be enhanced if they captured certain additional information, such as
financial information, potential conflicts of interest, and detailed information about the types of
services being provided and to whom.
To assure that Forms TA-1 and TA-2 continue to serve the regulatory goals described
above, especially in light of the expanded scope of transfer agents’ activities as discussed
throughout this release, the Commission intends to propose amendments to the forms to include

369

See, e.g., Adoption of Revised Transfer Agent Forms and Related Rules, supra note 161.

370

See Notice of Adoption of Rule 17Ac2-1 and Related Form TA-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 Providing for the Registration of Transfer Agents for which the Commission is the Appropriate
Regulatory Agency, Exchange Act Release No. 11759 (Oct. 22, 1975), 40 FR 51181 (Nov. 4, 1975).

371

See Adoption of Revised Transfer Agent Forms and Related Rules, supra note 161.

Page 111 of 208

disclosure requirements with respect to certain financial information, such as the financial
reports discussed below in Section VI.C (e.g., statements of financial condition, income, and
cash flows), all direct or indirect conflicts of interest, the issuers and securities for which a
transfer agent is providing transfer agent and other services, and the specific services being
provided or expected to be provided for each issuer or security, regardless of the nature of those
services. These anticipated amendments are intended to facilitate disclosure that is more closely
targeted at risks associated with contemporary transfer agent activities.
A requirement that transfer agents and their officers and directors disclose any past or
present affiliation with issuers serviced by, or broker-dealers affiliated with, the transfer agent
could reveal instances where a transfer agent or its officers and directors have an ownership
interest in such issuers and broker-dealers, including details about how the interest was
obtained. Such disclosures could provide transparency about the existence of possible financial
interests or other potential conflicts of interest that could incentivize a transfer agent to facilitate
an improper transfer or engage in other improper conduct.
Financial disclosures may include annual financial statements using a data-tagged format,
such as XBRL, broken out by the asset classes serviced by the transfer agent, such as equities,
debt, and investment companies.
The Commission seeks comment on the following:
5.

Should the Commission require any of the registration and disclosure items
discussed above? Why or why not? Should the Commission consider other
requirements? Please explain. What would be the benefits and costs associated
with any such requirements? Please provide empirical data. If the Commission
were to require transfer agents to disclose financial information, what information
should be required, and why? Would requiring such information to be disclosed
on Forms TA-1 and/or TA-2 be an effective and appropriate measure? What
would be the benefits and costs associated with any such requirement?

6.

Should the Commission consider amending the registration process to allow for
Page 112 of 208

the issuance of an order approving a transfer agent’s TA-1 application before that
application becomes effective, rather than having such applications become
effective automatically after 30 days? Should the Commission consider making
certain findings before approving a transfer agent’s application? If so, what
should those findings be? Should the Commission impose threshold requirements
that transfer agents must satisfy before their applications can become effective? If
so, what would they be?
7.

The Commission intends to propose to require transfer agents to submit annual
financial statements. Should these statements be required to be audited? Why or
why not?

8.

Should the Commission require that annual financial statements be submitted
using a data-tagged format such as XML or XBRL? Would such a requirement
require changes to the U.S. GAAP Taxonomy in order to capture the information
included in transfer agents’ financial statements? Why or why not? Should some
other electronic format be required or permitted?

9.

Does the receipt of securities as payment for services create conflicts of interest
for transfer agents, and if so, should the Commission require that such payments
be disclosed? The Commission intends to propose to amend Forms TA-1 and/or
TA-2 to require transfer agents to disclose all actual and potential conflicts of
interest. Should it do so? Why or why not? Should the Commission provide any
guidance as to what constitutes a conflict of interest? Why or why not? Has the
proliferation of the types of services offered by transfer agents in recent years
created new conflicts of interest? How might transfer agents’ conflicts of interest
differ depending upon whether the transfer agent is paid by the issuer, the
shareholder, or some combination thereof? Is disclosure of conflicts of interest a
sufficient safeguard for investors? Should the Commission ban certain conflicts
of interest entirely? For example, should the Commission prohibit transfer agents
from having certain affiliations with issuers or broker-dealers, or from providing
certain services if they have such affiliations? Please provide a full explanation.

10.

Should the Commission amend Forms TA-1 and/or TA-2 to require transfer
agents to disclose information regarding the fees imposed or charged by the
transfer agent for various services or activities? If so, what type of information or
level of detail should be required? Should the Commission require that fee
disclosures be standardized to facilitate comparison? Should fees charged to both
issuers and directly to shareholders be required to be disclosed? Please provide a
full explanation.

11.

To increase the ability of the Commission to monitor trends, gather data and
address emerging regulatory issues, should the Commission require registered
transfer agents to file material contracts with the Commission as exhibits to Form
TA-2? What costs, benefits and burdens, if any, would this create for issuers or
transfer agents? Should the Commission establish a materiality threshold or
Page 113 of 208

provide guidance on materiality were it to propose such a rule? Please provide a
full explanation.
12.

Should the Commission amend Forms TA-1 and/or TA-2 beyond any changes
discussed above? If so, what amendments should the Commission consider in
making that determination and why? Please provide a full explanation.

13.

What costs, benefits, and burdens, if any, would the potential requirements
discussed above create for issuers or transfer agents?

B.

Written Agreements Between Transfer Agents and Issuers

Transfer agency agreements between transfer agents and issuers are mainly governed by
state contract law. 372 It is the Commission staff’s understanding, based on information collected
during examination of registered transfer agents and review of a number of written agreements
between transfer agents and issuers, that many transfer agents enter into written contracts with
their issuers that cover some or all of the following subjects: (1) the services to be provided by
the transfer agent and performance metrics and standards; (2) the responsibilities of the parties;
(3) the duration of the agreement, including termination fees; (4) the fees and terms of payment;
(5) the terms that govern termination of the agreement; (6) the disposition of securityholder
records after the agreement’s termination; (7) the use and protection of data, such as privacy and
business continuity requirements; and (8) indemnification.

372

At present, no UCC or Commission rule requires that transfer agent service agreements with issuers be set
down in writing or governs the terms of such agreements. Rule 17Ad-16 requires a registered transfer
agent to notify an appropriate qualified registered securities depository under certain circumstances,
including when the transfer agent assumes or ceases transfer agent services for an issuer, but does not
address the terms of transfer agent service agreements with issuers nor require that they be set forth in
writing. Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-16, 17 CFR 240.17Ad-16. See also Adopting Release for Rule 17Ad16, supra note 147.

However, some transfer agents, often smaller transfer agents that may primarily service
smaller issuers, may not document their arrangements with issuers in a written agreement or,
even if they do enter into a written agreement, it may not cover all of the subjects identified
above. Based on the Commission staff’s experience administering the Commission’s transfer
agent rules and examination program, it appears that such undocumented or under-documented
arrangements may be more likely than written agreements to lead to protracted disputes,
especially with respect to: (1) the duration of the arrangement; (2) the conditions of the
arrangement’s termination; (3) the disposition of the securityholder records after termination or
notice of termination; and (4) the fees charged by the transfer agent. Such disputes may interfere
with the operations of the markets and the protection of investors by disrupting or otherwise
hindering transfer agent processing, recordkeeping, and safeguarding. For example, it is the
Commission staff’s understanding that some transfer agents, after having been terminated by the
issuer, have substantially delayed the handing over of securityholder records to successor
transfer agents by demanding that the issuer pay a substantial “termination” fee before the
transfer agent would agree to hand over the securityholder records it had been maintaining, even
though the issuer claimed there was no written agreement in place or it had otherwise not agreed
to such a fee. 373 In such cases, the issuer may be unable to retain a new transfer agent if the old
transfer agent will not make the records available to the new transfer agent. The inability to
retain a new transfer agent could lead to inaccuracies in the master securityholder file and other

373

It is the Commission staff’s understanding that typical termination fees may range from about $1,000 to
$5,000, though disputes like those described herein may involve a transfer agent’s demand for fees as high
as $30,000.

records or impede trading in the issuer’s securities. Commission staff is also aware of instances
in which a termination dispute between an issuer and a transfer agent has resulted in two transfer
agents each maintaining separate records, which could be inconsistent with each other.
The Commission believes that the existence of a written agreement that describes the
ongoing relationship under which a transfer agent and an issuer will operate, including the terms
under which the agreement between them may be terminated, could help to avoid such disputes,
including disputes over agreed-upon fees, and could help ensure the timely and appropriate
turnover of an issuer’s shareholder records upon the termination of the written agreements. If the
relationship between an issuer and a transfer agent is terminated and the issuer engages a new
transfer agent, it is essential to the issuer, its securityholders, and the market participants who
may seek to trade the issuer’s securities, that the issuer’s records are promptly delivered to the
new transfer agent to provide an orderly continuity of services.
Among the issuer’s records and related documents typically in the possession of its
transfer agent are: (1) the master securityholder file with the names and addresses of current
securityholders and the amount of securities owned by each holder; 374 (2) the control book
showing the total units outstanding of each securities issue; 375 (3) the logs showing items
transferred and processed for each issue; (4) the records of each issue’s distributions (e.g.,
interest and dividends) to securityholders; (5) an inventory of blank (unissued) securities

374

See Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-9(b), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-9(b).

375

See Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-9(d), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-9(d) (defining “control book”).

Page 116 of 208

certificates for each issue; and (6) the records of cancelled securities certificates for each issue. 376
Such records are critical to issuers’ routine operations as a stock corporation and to ensuring that
investors’ rights are protected. Without these records it would be challenging to: (1) establish
the identities of its own securityholders or the number of units of securities each investor holds;
(2) determine whether the number of its shares outstanding is within the bounds of its corporate
charter or whether there has been an overissuance; (3) distribute interest and dividend payments
to its investors; or (4) provide to investors periodic reports and proxy statements.
The Commission therefore intends to propose amendments to the transfer agent rules to
require that any arrangement for transfer agent services between a registered transfer agent and
an issuer be set forth in a written agreement that covers certain basic topics, such as the transfer
agent services to be provided, the terms of payment and fees to be imposed, particularly any
termination fees, and requirements for the turnover of transfer agent records to the successor
transfer agent. The Commission further intends to propose new or amended rules requiring
transfer agents to pass through certain records to newly appointed or successor transfer agents in
a prompt, complete, and uniform manner.
The Commission seeks comment on the following:
14.

376

Should the Commission require that any arrangement for transfer agent services
between a registered transfer agent and an issuer be set forth in a written
agreement? Why or why not? What are the alternative means of achieving
similar objectives, and are they as effective or efficient? If the Commission were
to require a written agreement, should it cover certain topics? If so, what topics?
For any such provisions or topics, are there asymmetries in information or other

See Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-19, 17 CFR 240.17Ad-19 (cancellation of certificates); Exchange Act Rules
17Ad-6(c), 7(d), 17 C.F.R. 240.17Ad-6(c), 7(d) (requiring that such cancelled certificates “be maintained
for a period of not less than six years.”).

Page 117 of 208

areas between transfer agents and issuers that the Commission should consider in
connection with such contractual provisions? For what types of transfer agents,
or in what types of such relationships, do these asymmetries most frequently arise,
and where are they most acute? Please provide a full explanation and supporting
evidence.
15.

How are fees set out in transfer agent agreements today? Do issuers find it
difficult to fully understand the fee structures offered by transfer agents, and how
do those fee structures work in practice? Should the Commission require that all
fee arrangements between an issuer and a transfer agent be set forth and specified
in a written agreement? Why or why not? Should the Commission require that
transfer agents disclose their fee arrangements in their filings with the
Commission? If so, should transfer agents be required to utilize a standardized
framework or terminology when disclosing their fee structures? Should the
Commission exempt fees which may be negotiated on a case-by-case basis, such
as corporate action fees? Why or why not? Would requiring disclosure of fees
affect competition, or the form of competition, among transfer agents or between
transfer agents and other entities? Please provide a full explanation and
supporting evidence.

16.

Currently, transfer agents are not required by rule to pass through specified
records to successor transfer agents. Are issuers or transfer agents aware of
instances where records have not been passed from one agent to the next, or
agents have not done so in a prompt manner? Are commenters aware of disputes
between transfer agents and their issuer clients or successor transfer agents with
respect to the transfer of records to a successor transfer agent? How was the
situation resolved? Have transfer agents demanded previously undisclosed
termination fees, or fees inconsistent with what those parties previously agreed to,
in exchange for turning over records to a successor? Would the anticipated
proposed rules described above help avoid or resolve any disputes between
transfer agents and issuers or successor-transfer agents with respect to the transfer
of records? Please provide a full explanation and supporting evidence.

17.

What costs, benefits, and burdens, if any, would a written agreement create for
issuers or transfer agents?

C.

Safeguarding Funds and Securities

Because transfer agents already facilitate securities transfers and maintain securityholder
records, approximately one-third of them are engaged by issuers to provide administrative,

Page 118 of 208

recordkeeping, and processing services related to the distribution of cash and stock dividends,
bond principal and interest, mutual fund redemptions, and other payments to securityholders. 377
These services, which are generally referred to in this release as “paying agent” services, 378 often
require the transfer agent to receive and accept funds or securities from issuers or securityholders
and hold them for periods generally ranging from less than one day to 30 days before distributing
the funds or securities to the intended recipients. 379 Transfer agents’ activities with respect to
paying agent services are significant. In 2014, transfer agents distributed over $2.4 trillion in
securityholder dividends, bond principal and interest, and mutual fund redemption payments. 380
Additionally, the Commission’s staff understands that transfer agents may hold residual
funds from thousands to millions of dollars and securities for long periods of time ranging from
over a month to several years, before distributing the funds or securities either to the intended
recipients or escheating the funds or securities to a state or territory. 381 Residual funds or

377

This data is based on transfer agent annual reports filed with the Commission on Form TA-2 on or before
March 31, 2015, which are publicly available once filed. See generally, Exchange Act Rule 17Ac2-2(a), 17
CFR 240.17Ac2-2(a); SEC Form TA-2, 17 CFR 249b.102.

378

Entities other than transfer agents may also provide paying agent services. For example, recently amended
Rule 17Ad-17(c)(2) defines “paying agent” to include “any issuer, transfer agent, broker, dealer,
investment adviser, indenture trustee, custodian, or any other person that accepts payments from the issuer
of a security and distributes the payments to the holders of the security.” 17 CFR 240.17Ad-17(c)(2). See
supra Section IV.A.4 for additional discussion of Rule 17Ad-17.

379

Certain corporate actions may require the transfer agent to hold funds for extended periods of time beyond
30 days. For example, where a tender offer is extended beyond 30 days, the transfer agent may maintain
possession or control over investor funds until the offer expires. The Commission notes that when transfer
agents have custody of funds or securities, they have a duty to safeguard that property. See Exchange Act
Rule 17Ad-12, 17 CFR 240.17Ad-12.

380

This figure is based on transfer agent annual reports filed with the Commission on Form TA-2 under the
Exchange Act on or before Mar. 31, 2015, which are publicly available once filed. See generally,
Exchange Act Rule 17Ac2-2(a), 17 CFR 240.17Ac2-2(a); SEC Form TA-2, 17 CFR 249b.102.

381

As noted above in Section V.C, when a property owner fails to demonstrate ownership of property for a
specified period of time by, for example, cashing a dividend check, that property will likely be deemed by
the relevant state to be abandoned and will be escheated to the state’s unclaimed property administrator

Page 119 of 208

securities include those which cannot be successfully delivered to the intended recipient because
the transfer agent has lost contact with the intended recipient (e.g., lost securityholder funds), 382
as well as those which are transmitted or delivered, but the intended recipient nonetheless does
not demonstrate ownership of the property (e.g., unresponsive payee funds, which may
ultimately be escheated). 383
As demonstrated by the Paperwork Crisis, the financial crisis of 2008, the 2012 flooding
of the DTCC securities vault in New York during Superstorm Sandy, 384 and many other
incidents, the safe, accurate, and efficient delivery of funds and securities, whether in certificated
or uncertificated form, is vital to the integrity and smooth functioning of the National C&S
System. Given their significant role in providing paying agent and custody services for funds
and securities, 385 and the risk of loss from fraud, theft, or other misappropriation, 386 the funds

pursuant to the state’s applicable escheatment laws. See, e.g., Adopting Release for 17Ad-17
Amendments, supra note 274.
382

See Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-17(b)(2), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-17(b)(2) (defining “lost securityholder”). As
noted above in Section IV.A.4, the requirement to conduct database searches for lost securityholders has
been extended to brokers and dealers. See Adopting Release for 17Ad-17 Amendments, supra note 274.

383

See Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-17(c)(3), 17 CFR 240.17ad-17(c)(3) (defining “unresponsive payee”). Rule
17Ad-17(c)(1) generally requires paying agents to provide within certain time periods written notification
to each unresponsive payee that the securityholder has been sent a check (or checks) that has not yet been
negotiated. Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-17(c)(1), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-17(c)(1).

(discussing DTC vault flood and security certificate recovery process after Superstorm Sandy).

385

See supra note 380 (data on distributions made in 2014 by registered transfer agents on behalf of issuers).

386

See, e.g., SEC v. Robert G. Pearson and Illinois Stock Transfer Company, Civ. Action No. 1:14-cv-03875
(N.D. Ill. May 22, 2014); SEC Litigation Release No. 23007 (May 28, 2014) (announcing fraud charges
against Illinois Stock Transfer Company and its owner, alleging misappropriation of money belonging to
their corporate clients and the clients' securityholders in order to fund their own payroll and business); In
the Matter of Securities Transfer Corporation and Kevin Halter, Jr., Exchange Act Release No. 64030
(Mar. 3, 2011) (settled action) (finding that transfer agent and its president failed to ensure that transfer
agent had adequate supervisory procedures and a system for applying such procedures to safeguard client
funds held in its custody or possession from internal employee abuse perpetrated by the transfer agent’s
former bookkeeper).

Page 120 of 208

and securities held in a transfer agent’s custody in either physical or electronic form could
present significant custody or delivery risks to issuers, securityholders, and the financial system
as a whole. In addition, funds and securities in custody of transfer agents could also be subject to
risk of loss from recordkeeping errors (e.g., where the transfer agent is unable to reconcile the
origin and ownership of funds or securities held), attachment (e.g., in the event of a judgment
against the transfer agent), and insolvency (e.g., securityholder or issuer funds could be
commingled with transfer agent funds and therefore, in the event of bankruptcy, treated as
general assets of the transfer agent and not as separately identifiable investor or issuer funds). 387
Further, even routine paying agent activity, such as dividend distribution processing, may
be complex. For example, after determining record date eligibility, the paying agent (who may
be a transfer agent) will calculate and balance the cash dividend amount or, in the case of a stock
dividend, the equivalent number of shares, which the transfer agent will issue, register, and
deliver, either in certificated or book-entry form. The paying agent may then handle the printing,
posting, and distribution 388 of dividend payments to the issuer’s registered securityholders, 389

387

As noted in Section I, a transfer agent’s failure to perform its recordkeeping duties can create significant
risks. These risks may be heightened where a transfer agent maintains the only electronic record of
ownership of an issuer’s securities, such as when facilitating an issuer’s DRS program whereby the transfer
agent, not DTC, maintains electronic book-entry custody and records of shares.

388

Disbursements may be by check, electronic deposit into a securityholder bank account, or reinvestment in
additional shares of the company through a DRIP or a Direct Stock Purchase Plan (“DSPP”). Additionally,
some larger transfer agents may provide currency exchange services to international investors, allowing
them to select the currency in which they want their dividend payments or sale proceeds to be calculated
and paid.

389

Where securities are held in street name registered to DTC’s nominee, Cede & Co., rather than issuing
thousands of individual checks or securities directly to registered securityholders, the paying agent will
deliver funds (or newly issued securities generated by certain corporate actions) to DTC. DTC then
electronically credits the accounts of the appropriate banks and brokers, which in turn credit the payments
and/or securities to the accounts of the beneficial owners. For additional information about DTC’s

Page 121 of 208

either directly or through a third-party service provider. The paying agent may also reconcile all
checks and disbursements from the dividend account, and thereafter may also offer ancillary
payment services to securityholders, such as: (i) corresponding with securityholders regarding
uncashed or stale-dated distribution payments or distribution payments declared lost or stolen;
(ii) placing stops on checks or certificates that are certified to be lost or stolen; (iii) reissuing
replacement checks and securities where necessary; (iv) providing photocopies of paid checks;
and (v) preparing and mailing dividend tax reporting forms required by the Internal Revenue
Service.
Other distributions, like those arising from lawsuits or settlements, may require special
attention. For example, to ensure that only investors who held shares between specific dates or
meet other detailed tests are compensated for a specific settlement, transfer agents who are
engaged to perform distribution activities must carefully review ownership records to determine
who is entitled to receive a payment and in what amount. Any processing errors at any point in
this complex process could present substantial risks for both issuers and securityholders. For
example, if there is a substantial positive adjustment to the share price following the payment
date, a transfer agent’s failure to calculate or distribute the correct amounts to securityholders
could create risk of loss of funds or securities for investors, as well as risk of liability for the
issuer, transfer agent, and others involved in the processing. A transfer agent’s inadvertent
failure to reinvest a dividend payment or an erroneous distribution of a cash payment could
create similar risks.

Page 122 of 208

Despite the amounts involved and risks posed, only one of the existing transfer agent
rules – recently amended Rule 17Ad-17 – specifically refers to and directly addresses certain
limited conduct of paying agents. 390 Other Commission rules indirectly address activity
implicated by the paying agent role, but do not specifically address the complex administrative,
recordkeeping, and processing activities associated with transfer agents’ activities as paying
agents, nor do they provide definitive standards to determine the adequacy of the transfer agent’s
safeguards or prescribe specific requirements for how transfer agents in such instances should
protect funds and securities from misappropriation, theft, or other risk of loss. In particular, Rule
17Ad-12 requires transfer agents to assure that funds and securities in their possession or control
are “protected, in light of all facts and circumstances, against misuse,” and that all such securities
“are held in safekeeping and are handled, in light of all facts and circumstances, in a manner
reasonably free from risk of theft, loss or destruction.” 391 Rule 17Ad-13 requires transfer agents
to file an annual report prepared by an independent accountant concerning the transfer agents’
systems of internal accounting control and related procedures for the safeguarding of related
funds.
More specificity and a more robust set of standards against which paying agent activities
can be measured may be necessary to better protect investors, facilitate the prompt and accurate
clearance and settlement of securities transactions, and keep pace with the evolving roles transfer
agents occupy in this space. We intend to propose new rules or rule amendments to address
transfer agents’ expanded role in handling investor funds and securities, as well as the increase in

the number and types of transactions currently facilitated by transfer agents. In particular, the
Commission intends to propose new rules or amend Rule 17Ad-12 to require transfer agents to
comply with specific minimum best practices requirements related to safeguarding funds and
securities, such as: (i) maintaining secure vaults; (ii) installing theft and fire alarms; (iii)
developing specific written procedures for access and control over securityholder accounts and
information; (iv) enhanced recordkeeping requirements; and (v) specific unclaimed property
procedures. The Commission also intends to propose a rule requiring transfer agents to
segregate client funds to ensure that bank accounts are appropriately designated to protect client
funds from being counted as transfer agent funds in the event of insolvency, and to obtain written
notification from banks holding the funds that the funds are for the exclusive benefit of the
customers, not the transfer agent.
In addition, the Commission intends to propose new rules for transfer agents similar to
those recently adopted for registered broker-dealers regarding amended annual reporting,
independent audit, and notification requirements, which are designed to, among other things,
increase broker-dealers’ focus on compliance and internal controls. 392 In light of the activities
and risks associated with their paying agent activities discussed above, the Commission
preliminarily believes it would be appropriate to implement similar rules for transfer agents,
including rules requiring transfer agents to prepare and file annual financial reports consisting of
a statement of financial condition, a statement of income, a statement of cash flows, and certain
other financial statements, similar to those discussed above in Section VI.A in connection with

392

For a discussion of the recent amendments to the requirements for broker-dealers, see Broker-Dealer
Reports, Exchange Act Release No. 70073 (July 30, 2013), 78 FR 51910 (Aug. 21, 2013).

new registration and annual reporting requirements. The Commission intends to propose new
rules to require transfer agents acting as paying agents or custodians to prepare and maintain
current and detailed policies and procedures reasonably designed to comply with any new or
amended possession and control requirements for the safeguarding of customer funds and
securities. In connection with these proposals, the Commission also intends to propose certain
amendments to Form TA-2 requiring transfer agents to disclose the number and/or dollar value
of residual and unclaimed funds. Finally, the Commission intends to propose amendments to
Rule 17Ad-12 to provide specific requirements for the safeguarding of uncertificated securities,
including appropriate controls and limitations on access to a transfer agent’s electronic records.
The Commission seeks comment on the following:
18.

Would the anticipated proposals described immediately above appropriately
strengthen practices and procedures involving the safeguarding of funds and
securities by transfer agents? Are there other areas that the Commission should
consider? If so, what regulatory or other action to address any areas of weakness
or risk should the Commission consider? Please provide a full explanation.

19.

Should the Commission require transfer agents to file on a periodic basis
information disclosing whether and how a transfer agent maintains custody of
issuer and securityholder funds and securities, similar to the information brokerdealers are required to report quarterly? Why or why not? What benefits, costs,
and burdens would result? Please provide a full explanation.

20.

In addition or as an alternative to the anticipated proposals described above,
should the Commission provide specific guidelines or requirements for transfer
agents’ paying agent and custody services? Why or why not? What should those
guidelines or requirements be? Do commenters believe the lack of such
guidelines or requirements results in varying practices and standards among
transfer agents, or specific areas of weakness or risk? Why or why not? Please
provide a full explanation.

21.

What are the current best practices with respect to the safeguarding of funds and
securities (e.g., segregation of accounts, written procedures, specific internal
controls, limits on employee access to physical items and records, and to
computer systems, as well as other access controls)? Do commenters believe that
Rules 17Ad-12, 17Ad-13, and 17Ad-17 are effective in encouraging those best
practices? Are there differences in how funds are safeguarded between smaller
Page 125 of 208

and larger transfer agent firms? Please provide a full explanation.
22.

What are the current best practices with respect to the creation, maintenance, and
reconciliation (or other use) of financial or other records that might bear upon the
safety of customer funds and securities? Should the Commission require any such
best practices, such as: (i) monitoring the financial position of the transfer agent
by preparing, maintaining, and reconciling financial books and records, including
a statement of financial condition, a statement of income, a statement of cash
flows, and certain other financial statements; and (ii) adopting internal written
procedures or specific internal controls requiring the monthly reconciliation of all
bank accounts used in a transfer agent’s business, and requiring audits of the
effectiveness of these internal controls by independent public accountants? Why
or why not? Please provide a full explanation.

23.

Should the Commission require transfer agents to file certain additional reports
prepared by an independent public accountant on the transfer agent’s compliance
and internal controls? Why or why not? In connection with any such
requirement, should the Commission require transfer agents to allow
representatives of the Commission or other ARA to review the documentation
associated with certain reports of the transfer agent’s independent public
accountant and to allow the accountant to discuss with representatives of the
Commission or ARA the accountant’s findings associated with those reports when
requested in connection with an examination of the transfer agent? Why or why
not? Please provide a full explanation.

24.

Do commenters believe that there are different risks associated with transfer
agents maintaining issuer or securityholder funds at banks that are part of the
same holding company structure as the transfer agent, as opposed to a wholly
unaffiliated bank? Why or why not? If there are distinct risks, should the
Commission act to mitigate those risks, and if so, how? Should the Commission
prohibit a transfer agent from maintaining issuer and securityholder funds at a
bank that is affiliated with the transfer agent? If so, how should “affiliated bank”
be defined? Should transfer agents that are also custodian banks be required to
maintain a segregated special account or accounts at an unaffiliated bank or other
approved location? Why or why not? Please provide a full explanation.

25.

If transfer agents were to be required to deposit or transmit issuer and
securityholder funds into a special bank account, should the Commission also
limit the amount of funds that could be deposited in special accounts at a bank to
reasonably safe amounts, whether the bank is affiliated or non-affiliated? Why or
why not? If so, what amounts should the Commission consider reasonably safe?
Should such amounts be measured against the capitalization of the transfer agent
and/or the bank? Why or why not? Please provide a full explanation.

26.

What are the current insurance requirements and/or practices among transfer
agents, and what is the source of those requirements and/or practices? Would
Page 126 of 208

different or additional insurance requirements address current paying agent risks,
such as loss or misuse of funds? Why or why not? If so, what types and amounts
of insurance would be sufficient to address current paying agent risks? Why? If
the Commission proposes specific insurance requirements for transfer agents,
should it also require transfer agents to establish and maintain written policies and
procedures describing their process for evaluating and procuring insurance (such
as fidelity, professional indemnity, cybersecurity, errors and omissions and surety
coverage) and for determining the coverage amounts? Should the transfer agent’s
annual accountant’s report on internal controls required by Rule 17Ad-13 include
verification that the transfer agent has fulfilled these requirements? Please
provide a full explanation.
27.

What are the industry best practices with respect to safeguarding procedures
specific to residual or unclaimed funds and securities remaining in the transfer
agent’s possession or control post-payment but prior to the successful distribution
to securityholders or escheatment to a state or territory?

28.

If the Commission were to require transfer agents to disclose information
pertaining to residual or unclaimed funds, what type of information and level of
detail should be required, and how frequently should it be required to be reported?
What would be the cost, burdens or benefits, if any, of such disclosure for issuers
or transfer agents?

29.

Currently, Rule 17Ad-5 only requires a transfer agent who has not handled
disbursements or dividends for at least three years to respond to inquiries by
simply indicating the agent is no longer the paying agent. What volume of such
requests do paying agents typically receive annually? Do paying agents typically
know who the current agent is? What would be the costs, burdens or benefits if
paying agents were required to provide such information? Please provide a full
explanation.

30.

What would be the costs, benefits, and burdens, if any, of the proposals described
above?

D.

Restricted Securities and Compliance With Federal Securities Laws

Transfer agents play a particularly important role in the securities industry with respect to
the issuance and transfer of restricted securities. Restricted securities cannot be resold legally
unless there is an effective registration statement for their resale, or there is an available
exemption from registration for the resale. Typically, these securities bear restrictive legends
indicating that their sale or transfer may be subject to a restriction or limitation and
Page 127 of 208

intermediaries will not effectuate their transfer until restrictive legends are removed. Because
transfer agents are often the party responsible for affixing, tracking, and removing restrictive
legends, they play an important role in helping to prevent unregistered securities distributions
that violate Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”). 393 The need to prevent
unregistered securities distributions is particularly acute in the microcap market, where OTC
issuers may not be subject to certain of the Commission’s disclosure requirements and there is an
increased potential for fraud and abuse because potential investors have few, if any, resources for
obtaining meaningful disclosure or conducting independent research on microcap issuers.
The Commission’s experience in investigating abuses in the microcap market and
bringing enforcement actions charging violations of the federal securities laws demonstrates how
the removal of restrictive legends can often be a central element contributing to illegal,
unregistered distributions of securities. While these actions typically involve misconduct by
persons other than the transfer agent, the Commission has charged transfer agents as culpable
participants in a variety of circumstances. Transfer agents may face potential liability for aiding
and abetting or causing a violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act for an act or omission that
contributes to or helps effectuate an illegal unregistered distribution. 394 In some cases, we have
brought an action against the transfer agent for violating Section 5 on the theory that the transfer

394

See, e.g., National Stock Transfer, Inc., A.P. File No. 3-9949, Sec. Act Rel. No. 7924 (Dec. 4, 2000)
(settled proceeding against transfer agent and an officer of the transfer agent for willfully aiding and
abetting and causing Section 5 violations by issuing shares in reliance on an issuer’s representation of an S8 transaction that had been purportedly registered with the Commission when no such registration existed);

desist proceeding against transfer agent and president for, among other charges, willfully aiding and
abetting and causing Section 5 violations by an issuer client).

Page 128 of 208

agent was a “necessary participant” and “substantial factor” in the unregistered distribution or
sale. 395 Depending on the facts and circumstances, a transfer agent also could incur liability
pursuant to the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, 396 such as Section 10(b) of the
Exchange Act, 397 Rule 10b-5 thereunder, 398 and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act. 399
Some transfer agents have expressed concern, however, that they perceive a conflict in
some instances between their obligation to take appropriate steps to forestall an illegal
distribution, and their obligation under state law to comply with a valid request to issue a
security or facilitate a transfer, which may require removal of a restrictive legend. 400
Nonetheless, if a transfer would be unlawful under the federal securities laws, the transfer agent
is not required by state law to comply with a request for transfer. 401 We note that the person or

entity requesting a transfer of restricted securities based on an exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act bears the burden of proving entitlement to that exemption.402
Further, it appears that issuers (and their transfer agents) may reasonably withhold consent to
register a transfer until they can determine that the request “is in fact rightful” under Section 8401(a)(7) of the UCC. 403 Because the relevant determinations can involve the assessment of
legal issues that are fact-dependent, 404 transfer agents typically may seek to rely on
representations or opinions provided by the issuer or securityholder and their counsels, usually in
the form of an “attorney opinion letter,” to determine whether an exemption from registration
under Section 5 of the Securities Act is applicable. As our enforcement experience
demonstrates, however, this process is also susceptible to abuse, as many illegal distributions are
facilitated by the improper issuance of such opinion letters. 405

(S.D.N.Y. 1995) (holding that since the transfer violated the Securities Act, it cannot be considered rightful
under Section 8-401 of the U.C.C. and transfer agent was under no duty to register the transfer); Charter

transfer agent cannot be required by state law to transfer stock in violation of the Securities Act, therefore,
when a transfer agent has reasonable cause to believe that a transfer will be in violation of the Securities
Act, it has the right to refuse to make the transfer until it has received an explanation or showing that the
proposed transfer would not violate the Securities Act).
402

See, e.g., SEC v. Ralston Purina Co., 346 U.S. 119 (1953); Gilligan, Will & Co. v. SEC, 257 F.2d 461 (2d

(1941).

403

If any of the preconditions enumerated in UCC Section 8-401 do not exist, such as where a transfer is
wrongful, the issuer is under no duty to register the transfer. See U.C.C. 8-401, cmt. 1.

404

These issues can include determining a securityholder’s affiliate status with the issuer or identifying the
holding period during which an individual held restricted securities. See Securities Act Rule 144(b)(2), 17
CFR 230.144(b)(2) (providing for different conditions for use of the rule on affiliates than on nonaffiliates); Securities Act Rule 144(d)(1), 17 CFR 230.144(d)(1) (providing for a holding period for

More specificity around transfer agents’ responsibilities with respect to illegal
distributions may help to better protect investors, facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and
settlement of securities transactions, and combat fraud and manipulation in the microcap market.
We therefore intend to propose new rules or rule amendments to address transfer agents’ role in
facilitating transfers of securities that result in illegal distributions of securities. In particular, the
Commission intends to propose a new rule prohibiting any registered transfer agent or any of its
officers, directors, or employees from directly or indirectly taking any action to facilitate a
transfer of securities if such person knows or has reason to know that an illegal distribution of
securities would occur in connection with such transfer.
We also intend to propose a new rule prohibiting any registered transfer agent or any of
its officers, directors, or employees from making any materially false statements or omissions or
engaging in any other fraudulent activity in connection with the transfer agent’s performance of
its duties and obligations under the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder,
including any new or amended rules the Commission may promulgate in the future, such as those
dealing with transfer agents’ safeguarding, paying agent, and other activities discussed above in
Section VI.C and throughout this release. We also intend to propose a new rule requiring each
registered transfer agent to adopt policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve
compliance with applicable securities laws and applicable rules and regulations thereunder, and
to designate and specifically identify to the Commission on Form TA-1 one or more principals to
serve as chief compliance officer.

complaint alleged, among other things, that attorney drafted false opinion letters provided to transfer
agents).

Page 131 of 208

The Commission seeks comment on the following:
31.

Is there a need for Commission rules clarifying transfer agent liability for
participating in or facilitating an unlawful distribution of securities in violation of
Section 5 of the Securities Act? Why or why not? If so, what rules should be
considered?

32.

Currently, there are no specific Commission rules regarding the placement or
removal of restrictive legends by transfer agents. Is there a need for Commission
rules governing the role of transfer agents in placing or removing restrictive
legends? Why or why not? If so, what are the specific issues that should be
addressed by Commission rulemaking?

33.

Should the Commission provide specific guidelines and requirements for
registered transfer agents in connection with removing a restrictive legend and in
connection with issuing any security without a restrictive legend, such as: (1)
obtaining an attorney opinion letter; (2) obtaining approval of the issuer; (3)
requiring evidence of an applicable registration statement or evidence of an
exemption; and/or (4) conducting some level of minimum due diligence (with
respect to the issuer of the securities, the shareholder and/or the attorney
providing a legal opinion)? Why or why not? Should the Commission also
consider specific recordkeeping and retention requirements related to the issuance
of share certificates without restrictive legends? Why or why not? How should
book-entry securities be addressed? Are there other guidelines or requirements
the Commission should consider with respect to the issuance of share certificates
or book-entry securities without restrictive legends?

34.

If the Commission were to issue any standards for restrictive legend removal,
what would be an appropriate level of due diligence? Should any due diligence
requirements be compatible with current state law governing the issuance and
transfer of securities? Should the Commission consider specific guidelines and
requirements for the review of representations that a shareholder is not an affiliate
of the issuer or is not acting in coordination with other shareholders? Why or
why not? If so, what guidelines or requirements should be considered? Should
the Commission consider specific guidelines and requirements regarding transfer
agents’ obligations to review or determine the ultimate beneficial ownership of
shares, identification of control persons of the shareholders, and relationship of
shareholders to the issuer, officers or each other?

35.

Do transfer agents currently possess detailed and accurate information regarding
the ownership history of the securities they process? For example, do transfer
agents know whether the securities they process were ever owned by a control
person or other affiliate of the issuer, and for how long? If so, how do they know
this? If transfer agents possess such information, do they provide it to other
market intermediaries, such as broker-dealers and securities depositories? If not,
should transfer agents be required to do so? Has the inability of broker-dealers
Page 132 of 208

and other market intermediaries to obtain detailed and accurate securities
ownership information facilitated the unlawful distribution of securities? Has it
impaired secondary market liquidity, such as by making other market
intermediaries unwilling or less willing to handle certain securities? If so, how
can the Commission address these issues?
36.

Should transfer agents be permitted to rely on the written legal opinion of an
attorney under certain circumstances? If so, what should those circumstances be?
For example, should there be requirements regarding the attorney’s qualifications
or the attorney’s relation to the issuer or investor? Is it appropriate for transfer
agents to rely on attorney opinion letters to the extent the letters are based on
representations of the issuer or third parties without the attorney’s review of
relevant documentation or independent verification of the representations?

37.

Should the Commission obligate transfer agents to: (i) confirm the existence and
legitimacy of an issuer’s business (for example by reviewing leases for corporate
offices, etc.); (ii) obtain names and signature specimens for persons the issuer
authorizes to give issuance or cancellation instructions, together with any
documents establishing such authorization; (iii) conduct credit and criminal
background checks for issuers’ officers and directors and shareholders requesting
legend removal; (iv) obtain and confirm identifying information for shareholders
requesting legend removal (e.g., legal name, address, citizenship); and/or (v)
obtain and review publicly-available news articles or information on issuers or
principals? Why or why not?

38.

Should the Commission enumerate a non-exhaustive list of “red flags” or other
specific factors which would trigger a duty of inquiry by the transfer agent? Why
or why not? If so, which “red flags” should be included?

39.

Are there types of securities or categories of transactions commenters believe
should require a heightened level of scrutiny or review by transfer agents before
removing a restrictive legend or processing a transfer? If so, which ones and
why? What should any such heightened scrutiny or review entail? For example,
should the Commission require additional diligence requirements for securities
offered by issuers that are not required to file financials with the Commission?
Why or why not?

40.

The Commission is aware that industry participants have suggested that the
Commission provide a safe harbor for transfer agents from direct liability or
secondary liability (e.g. aiding and abetting) in connection with an unregistered
distribution of securities if the transfer agent follows the procedures set out in the

Page 133 of 208

safe harbor concerning legend removal. 406 Should the Commission impose such a
safe harbor? Why or why not? If so, what should be the specific conditions of
the safe harbor?

406

41.

Other than ensuring that the removal of restrictive legends is appropriate and not a
means to sidestepping registration requirements, what requirements or
prohibitions, if any, should the Commission consider as additional protections
against the unlawful distribution of unregistered securities? For example, should
transfer agents be required to deliver securities certificates directly to registered
securityholders or be prohibited from delivering securities certificates to third
parties that are not registered as owners of the certificates on the transfer agents’
books? Why or why not?

42.

In what form (e.g. certificate form or book-entry form) are restricted securities
held and issued today? Please provide specific data and examples and, where
available, breakdowns by asset class. To what extent, if any, do holders of
restricted securities own those securities in street name today? To the extent
restricted securities are held in book-entry form, what practices are used in the
marketplace today with respect to sending securityholders account statements
generally and, specifically, sending account statements bearing restrictive
legends? Are any special issues created by intermediation, such as by brokerdealers, of any restricted securities held in street name? Should the Commission
consider rules governing the display of legends on account statements of
shareholders who hold restricted securities in book-entry form? Are there are any
technological or regulatory barriers to the application of restrictive legends to
securities held in DRS form? Should the Commission regulate transfer agent
processing of securities that are held in DRS form?

43.

The Commission’s staff understands that transfer agents may receive
compensation in-kind in the form of securities of the issuer that hired the agent to
remove restrictive legends. Does this create additional or different risks than if
the transfer agent were paid in cash? If so, should the Commission limit transfer
agents’ acceptance of securities as payment for services related to penny-stock
securities or small issuers, or acquiring shares of the issuers they are servicing
through other means, such as gift or purchase? Why or why not?

44.

What costs, benefits, and burdens, if any, would the potential requirements
discussed above create for issuers or transfer agents?

See Rhodes, supra note 18, at § 6:12 (“Attempts are now being made to persuade the SEC to adopt a
procedure and a form which, when presented to a transfer agent, would free the transfer agent from liability
in making the transfer in reliance on the form.”).

Page 134 of 208

45.

Should the Commission require transfer agents to maintain, implement, and
enforce written compliance and/or supervisory policies and procedures, similar to
those required of broker-dealers? Why or why not? If so, what policies and
procedures should be required? Should the Commission require transfer agents to
disseminate written policies and procedures to all employees of the transfer agent
on an annual or semi-annual basis? Why or why not? Please explain.

46.

Should the Commission adopt rules requiring registered transfer agents to
designate and identify a chief compliance officer? Why or why not? If so, should
the Commission adopt rules governing the reporting lines and relationships of the
chief compliance officer? Should the chief compliance officer be required to file
an annual compliance report with the Commission? Why or why not? If so, what
information should be included in the annual compliance report?

47.

Should the Commission require transfer agents to undertake security checks or
confirm regulatory and employment history for employees, certain third-party
service providers, and associated persons, and to require certain employees of
registered transfer agents to register with the Commission? Why or why not?
What would be the costs, benefits, and burdens associated with such a
requirement? What challenges does the trend toward the outsourcing and
offshoring of certain aspects of transfer agents’ functions pose for ensuring
compliance with such a requirement? Please provide a full explanation.

48.

Should the Commission require transfer agents to obtain certain information
concerning their issuer clients, clients’ securityholders and their accounts, and
securities transactions? Why or why not? Please explain and provide supporting
evidence where applicable. Should transfer agents be required to perform a form
of due diligence on their clients and the transactions they are asked to facilitate,
similar to the know-your-customer requirements applicable to broker-dealers?
Should transfer agents be required to obtain a list of all affiliates of their issuer
clients—including current and former control persons, promoters, and
employees—and to take special precautionary steps whenever they are asked to
process transactions for these affiliates?

49.

Should the Commission require transfer agents to maintain originals of all
communications received and copies of all communications sent (including both
paper and electronic communications) to or from the transfer agent related to its
business? Why or why not? Please explain.

Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Related Issues

Cybersecurity risk is a specific type of operational risk and includes risks related to the
security of data stored on computers, networks, and similar systems, and technology-related
disruptions of operational capacity. Given the increased use of and reliance on computers,
Page 135 of 208

networks, and similar systems throughout society, cybersecurity threats are omnipresent today.
They come from many sources and present a significant risk to a wide range of American
interests, including critical governmental and commercial infrastructures, the national securities
markets, and financial institutions and other entities that are involved in the National C&S
System. In 2012, a single group targeted and attacked more than a dozen financial institutions
with a sustained Distributed Denial of Service attack on those institutions’ public websites. 407
That same year, 89% of global securities exchanges identified cyber-crime as a potential
systemic risk and 53% reported experiencing a cyber-attack in the previous year. 408
Cybersecurity risks faced by the capital markets and Commission-regulated entities are of
particular concern to the Commission. Given the highly-dependent, interconnected nature of the
U.S. capital markets and financial infrastructure, including the National C&S System, as well as
the prevalence of electronic book-entry securities holdings in that system, the Commission has a
significant interest in addressing the substantial risks of market disruptions and investor harm
posed by cybersecurity issues.
Transfer agents are subject to many of the same risks of data system breach or failure that
other market participants face. With advances in technology and the enormous expansion of
book-entry ownership of securities, transfer agents today rely more heavily than ever on
technology and automation for their core recordkeeping, processing, and transfer services,

persistent, and recurring.”

especially the use of computers and networks to store, access, and manipulate data, records, and
other information. As a result, modern transfer agents are vulnerable to a variety of software,
hardware, and information security risks which could threaten the ownership interest of
securityholders or disrupt trading not only among registered securityholders but, because of
transfer agents’ electronic linkages to DTC, also among street name owners. For example, a
software or hardware glitch, technological failure, or processing error by a transfer agent could
result in the corruption or loss of securityholder information, erroneous securities transfers, or
the release of confidential securityholder information to unauthorized individuals. A concerted
cyber-attack or other breach could have the same consequences, or result in the theft of securities
and other crimes. 409
Cybersecurity issues have been analyzed and discussed in detail over the last several
years in a variety of fora. 410 For example, the Commission has adopted a number of rules in
recent years to address cybersecurity and related issues, although most of them either do not
apply to registered transfer agents or do not address transfer agents’ specific activities. In 2015,
the Commission adopted Regulation SDR (“Reg SDR”), which addresses registration
requirements, duties, and core principles for security-based swap data repositories (“SDRs”) and

includes a requirement that every SDR adopt written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to ensure that its core systems provide “adequate levels of capacity, integrity,
resiliency, availability, and security.” 411 However, unless it qualifies as an SDR, a registered
transfer agent would not otherwise be subject to these requirements.
In 2014, the Commission adopted Regulation Systems, Compliance and Integrity (“Reg
SCI”), which requires entities covered by the rule to test their automated systems for
vulnerabilities, test their business continuity and disaster recovery plans, notify the Commission
of cyber intrusions, and recover their clearing and trading operations within specified time
frames. 412 While Reg SCI covers registered clearing agencies and other entities, it does not
apply to transfer agents.

413

To address cybersecurity risk issues faced by financial institutions (as defined in the Fair
Credit Reporting Act) that are registered with the Commission, in 2013 the Commission adopted
Regulation S-ID, which requires these entities to adopt and implement identity theft programs. 414

Unless it meets the definition of a financial institution as defined in the Fair Credit Reporting
Act, a registered transfer agent would not otherwise be required to comply with Regulation SID. 415
Finally, Regulation S-P was adopted in 2000 and requires certain Commission-registered
entities to adopt measures to protect sensitive consumer financial information. 416 Although
Regulation S-P primarily covers registered brokers, dealers, investment companies, and
investment advisers, it also covers transfer agents in a limited way. 417 In addition, Commission
staff has published guidance and other documents addressing cybersecurity risks faced by
specific types of Commission registrants, such as corporate issuers, broker-dealers, investment
advisers, and investment companies. 418

Further, as discussed above, the Commission’s efforts to address transfer agents’
safeguarding obligations, including the adoption and application of Rule 17Ad-12, 419 have
focused primarily on funds and securities rather than information systems or cybersecurity. Rule
17Ad-12 requires transfer agents to exercise reasonable discretion in adopting safeguards
appropriate for their own operations and risks, and a transfer agent can adopt the safeguards and
procedures that are most suitable and cost-effective in light of its potential exposure to risk since
the reasonableness of safeguards and procedures are tested “in light of all facts and
circumstances.” 420 The existing rule, however, prescribes no specific requirements for
safeguarding additional items of potential value in a transfer agent’s possession which potentially
could be used to gain access to funds or securities, such as securityholder and account
information and data in either physical or electronic form. Based on its experience administering
the Commission’s transfer agent examination program, the Commission staff is aware that some
transfer agents have identified risks related to information and data directly or tangentially
related to funds and securities used in their operations, such as securityholder and account
information stored on systems and in records, and as a result, have developed policies,
procedures, controls, or best practices to mitigate risk. However, the Commission is concerned
that widely varying safeguarding procedures and controls among transfer agents could create
uncertainty and risk in the market. The Commission is further concerned that insufficient
safeguarding of information and data, such as securityholder personal and account information

stored in computer systems and in records, could lead to the loss of information, theft of
securities or funds, fraudulent securities transfers, or the misappropriation or release of private
securityholder information to unauthorized individuals.
In light of the foregoing, the Commission intends to propose certain amendments to the
transfer agent rules to address how technology in general and cybersecurity risks in particular
affect transfer agents and their activities, and how transfer agents’ technology and information
systems, including securityholders’ data and personal information, may be related to their
safeguarding activities. In particular, the Commission intends to propose new or amended rules
requiring registered transfer agents to, among other things: (i) create and maintain a written
business continuity plan, tailored to the size and activities of the transfer agent, identifying
procedures relating to an emergency or significant business disruption, including provisions such
as data back-up and recovery protocols; (ii) create and maintain basic procedures and guidelines
governing the transfer agent’s use of information technology, including methods of safeguarding
securityholders’ data and personally identifiable information; and (iii) create and maintain
appropriate procedures and guidelines related to a transfer agent’s operational capacity, such as
IT governance and management, capacity planning, computer operations, development and
acquisition of software and hardware, and information security.
The Commission seeks comment on the following:

How have transfer agents’ data gathering and retention practices evolved in recent
years? Do transfer agents collect more or different types of information than in
the past? What new risks, if any, have arisen as a result of these changes? Are
there some types of information collected by transfer agents that are more
valuable to cyber-attackers than others, or that could cause more harm to investors
Page 141 of 208

or the markets if disclosed? If so, please specify. Do transfer agents currently
have special protocols to protect their most sensitive information? If not, should
the Commission require them to do so?
52.

Have transfer agents experienced internal or external access breaches, internal or
external fraud or abuse, or other issues associated with creating, accessing,
controlling, altering, or securely storing issuer or investor information or data,
including securityholders’ private account information and other private personal
information, whether electronic or otherwise? If so, please describe the nature,
extent, and resolution of such problems.

53.

What are the most significant risks or threats with respect to such information and
data and what challenges do transfer agents face when attempting to assure that it
is created, accessed, altered, controlled, and securely stored and retained in a
manner reasonably free from identified risks? What policies, procedures, or
controls may be employed to mitigate these risks or threats and address these
challenges? What is the evidence on the beneficial impact of these practices and
does it vary across transfer agents? How and why?

54.

Have transfer agents identified risks related to information and data directly or
tangentially related to funds and securities used in their operations, such as
securityholder and account information stored on systems and in records,
electronic or otherwise? Please describe the nature and scope of any such
identified risks, as well as any challenges transfer agents face when attempting to
mitigate them.

55.

Do commenters believe that insufficient safeguarding of information and data,
such as securityholder personal and account information stored in computer
systems and in records, could lead to the loss of information, theft of securities or
funds, fraudulent securities transfers, or the misappropriation or release of private
securityholder information to unauthorized individuals? Why or why not? Are
commenters aware of any such occurrences or incidents resulting from
insufficient safeguarding of information? If so, please describe the nature, extent,
and resolution thereof, including any steps perceived as necessary to be taken to
prevent a reoccurrence.

56.

What are the current industry best practices for protecting issuer or investor
information or data in physical or printable records? What minimum standards, if
any, should the Commission require for the safeguarding of such information or
data?

57.

To ensure that data, records, and other types of information stored on computers,
networks, and similar systems used by various participants in the National C&S
System are safeguarded in a manner that protects investors and promotes the
prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of transactions in securities, should
Commission requirements apply to certain types of data, records, or other
Page 142 of 208

information, rather than to a particular type of entity? For example, should the
Commission impose specific safeguarding, recordkeeping, or other requirements
on registered transfer agents and other entities registered or required to be
registered with the Commission that possess or control securityholder and account
information (electronic or otherwise)? Why or why not? What would be the
costs, benefits, and burdens associated with such an approach? Please provide
empirical data if available.
Operational Risk, Cybersecurity, and Other Technology-Related Issues
58.

Should the Commission impose specific cybersecurity standards for transfer
agents? If so, what should they be, and what standard would be appropriate?
Should these standards vary depending on the size of the transfer agent or the
nature and scope of the services it provides? Do commenters believe Reg SCI or
Reg SDR provide an appropriate model for potential transfer agent rules
addressing cybersecurity issues? Why or why not? If so, which aspects of Reg
SCI or Reg SDR might be most appropriate given the activities of transfer agents?
Are there other models that might be appropriate for the Commission to consider
when developing cybersecurity rules for transfer agents? Regardless of the
framework utilized, should the Commission consider requiring certain minimum
cybersecurity protocols, such as practicing good cyber hygiene, patching critical
software vulnerabilities, and using multi-factor authentication? Should the
Commission require transfer agents to implement heightened security protocols
for their most sensitive data? If so, which data would merit special protection,
and what form should that protection take? Please provide a full explanation.

59.

Should the Commission require transfer agents to demonstrate a certain level of
operational capacity, such as IT governance and management, capacity planning,
computer operations, development and acquisition of software and hardware, and
information security? Why or why not? If so, what requirements should the
Commission consider? For example, would it be appropriate to require transfer
agents to adopt written procedures concerning all business services performed by,
and IT and other systems used by, the transfer agent? Should the requirements be
different depending on whether the transfer agent uses proprietary systems or
contracts with outside parties for some or all of their services or IT and other
systems? Should the requirements be different depending on the size of the
transfer agent or the scope of its activities? Please provide a full explanation.

60.

If the Commission proposes a rule requiring transfer agents to maintain a written
business continuity or disaster recovery plan, what, if any, items should be
required to be included in the plans in order to accomplish business continuity and
disaster recovery objectives? Please provide a full explanation.

61.

What risks do transfer agents face from internal or external cyber attacks? What
costs, challenges, or issues do transfer agents face in dealing with those risks (e.g.,
costs and resources, government and industry cooperation, and information
Page 143 of 208

sharing)? Are there different cybersecurity risks, or different best practices and
procedures for addressing such risks, for transfer agents, depending on the size,
activities, business lines, or technology infrastructure of the transfer agent? How
often do transfer agents review operations and compliance policies and
procedures related to cybersecurity?
62.

What tradeoffs should the Commission consider in addressing cybersecurity
issues with respect to transfer agents? What evidence should it consider in
evaluating those tradeoffs, including any benefits, burdens, or costs of specific
rule proposals? Please provide a full explanation.

63.

Are transfer agents who have offices or do business in multiple jurisdictions
subject to different standards or requirements with respect to cybersecurity, data
privacy or business continuity? Do those standards or requirements conflict with
one another? If so, how and to what extent do those standards conflict?

64.

What are the industry best practices with respect to identifying and addressing
cybersecurity risk? What are the costs associated with any such best practices?
Do commenters believe these costs are reasonable in light of relevant risks?

65.

What are industry best practices with respect to protecting electronic
communications between and among transfer agents and other market participants
using standardized communication protocols and standards? Should the
Commission require standards for message encryption? Why or why not? Please
provide a full explanation.

66.

What consequences for shareholders and issuers could result if the privacy of
transfer agent records is compromised? Are there standards to which transfer
agents should be required to adhere to reduce the possibility or likelihood of such
an occurrence? Similarly, what consequences for shareholders and issuers could
result from actions taken by impersonators due to inadequate authentication
and/or attempts to cancel or repudiate previously executed instructions? Do the
current processes and requirements for signature guarantees apply adequately in
an electronic environment?

67.

How often do transfer agents review operations and compliance policies and
procedures related to cybersecurity? Are third-party vendors utilized and, if so, to
what extent? Where third-party vendors are utilized, how do transfer agents
conduct oversight of such vendors?

68.

Should the Commission require transfer agents to have a minimum level of
cybersecurity protection, and if so, what should those levels be? Should the
Commission prohibit indemnification of transfer agents by issuers for liability for
losses due to the agents’ cybersecurity weaknesses? Why or why not?

Page 144 of 208

69.

Should the Commission require transfer agents to maintain minimum insurance
coverage for operational risks associated with transfer agent operations and
services, including cybersecurity losses? Why or why not? Should the level and
type of coverage be based on the transfer agent’s particular circumstances? If so,
what requirements and level of coverage would be appropriate for what
circumstances?

70.

A new technology, the blockchain or distributed ledger system, is being tested in
a variety of settings, to determine whether it has utility in the securities
industry. 421 What utility, if any, would a distributed public ledger system have for
transfer agents, and how would it be used? What regulatory actions, if any, would
facilitate that utility? How would transfer agents ensure their use of or interaction
with such a system would comply and be consistent with federal securities laws
and regulations, including the transfer agent rules? Please explain.

71.

What costs, benefits, and burdens, if any, would the potential requirements
discussed above create for issuers or transfer agents?

F.

Definitions, Application, and Scope of Current Rules

The Commission intends to propose certain amendments to Rules 17Ad-1 through 17Ad20 designed to modernize, streamline, and simplify the overall regulatory regime for transfer
agents and bring greater clarity, consistency, and regulatory certainty to the area, as well as
mitigate any unnecessary costs or other burdens resulting from now obsolete or outdated
requirements. In particular, the Commission intends to propose to: (i) rescind Rules 17Ad-18
and 17Ad-21T; (ii) consolidate all definitions, including those in Rule 17Ad-1 and 17Ad-9, as
well as specific definitions embedded in Rules 17Ad-5 (written inquiries), 17Ad-15 (signature
guarantees), 17Ad-17 (lost securityholders), and 17Ad-19 (cancellation of securities certificates)

into a single rule; (iii) update various definitions and references throughout the rules to
correspond more accurately to the prevailing industry practices and standards, including
clarifying that Rule 17Ad-2’s turnaround provisions apply with equal force to book-entry
securities and clarifying, where appropriate, that other references to “certificates” include bookentry securities, defining the terms “promptly, “as soon as possible,” and “non-routine” in Rule
17Ad-2, and other clarifications; (iv) update the current turnaround, recordkeeping, and retention
requirements to correspond more closely to the operations and capabilities of modern transfer
agents; (v) amend the recordkeeping and retention requirements in Rules 17Ad-7 (record
retention), 17Ad-10 (prompt posting of certificate detail, etc.), 17Ad-11 (aged record
differences), and 17Ad-16 (notice of assumption and termination) and consolidate them into a
single rule; (vi) update the dollar and share thresholds reflected in Rule 17Ad-11 (aged record
differences); (vii) amend Rule 17Ad-13 to provide additional and more useful information
regarding transfer agents’ internal controls; (viii) amend Rule 17Ad-15 to require transfer agents
to document in writing their procedures and requirements for accepting signature guarantees; and
(ix) propose other new rules and amendments designed to address certain TA activities not
currently addressed by the rules, as discussed throughout this release.
Further, the Commission’s core books and records rules for transfer agents, Exchange
Act Rules 17Ad-6 and 17Ad-7, prescribe minimum recordkeeping requirements with respect to
the records that transfer agents must make and record retention requirements specifying how

Page 146 of 208

long those records and other documents relating to a transfer agent’s business must be kept. 422
These requirements, adopted in 1977, were intended to serve a dual purpose: (1) to assure that
transfer agents are maintaining the minimum records necessary to monitor and keep adequate
control over their own activities and performance; and (2) to permit the appropriate regulatory
authorities to examine transfer agents for compliance with applicable rules. 423 The Commission
is concerned that the scope of the recordkeeping and record retention rules may no longer be
broad enough to serve this dual purpose relative to the expanded scope of the activities and
services that transfer agents provide today as discussed throughout this release. Accordingly, the
Commission intends to propose certain amendments to Rules 17Ad-6 and 17Ad-7 to ensure they
adequately address: (i) any new or amended registration, reporting, and disclosure requirements
adopted by the Commission; (ii) any new or amended contract rules adopted by the Commission;
(iii) any new or amended safeguarding requirements adopted by the Commission, including
amendments to Rule 17Ad-12; (iv) any new or amended business recovery, information security,
operational, or cybersecurity requirements proposed by the Commission; and (v) any conforming
or other changes or additions to the Commission’s transfer agent rules. The Commission seeks
comment on the following:
72.

Are any of the current transfer agent rules outdated or obsolete? If so, which ones
and why? Do commenters believe that any such outdated or obsolete portions of
the transfer agent rules create confusion or inefficiency among transfer agents,
issuers, investors, and other market participants? Why or why not? Please
provide a full explanation.

422

Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-6, 17 CFR 240.17Ad-6; Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-7, 17 CFR 240.17Ad-7. For a
more detailed description of the recordkeeping and record retention requirements for transfer agents, see
supra Section IV.A.2.

423

See Rule 17Ad-1 through 17Ad-7 Adopting Release, supra note 145.

Page 147 of 208

73.

Should the Commission eliminate or amend any of the definitions in the transfer
agent rules? If so, which ones and why? For example, should the Commission
eliminate references to “control book,” “processing,” “process” deadlines, and
“outside registrar”? Are there any other definitions which should be amended?
Why and how? Please provide a full explanation.

74.

Should the Commission eliminate the current exemption in Rule 17Ad-4 for small
transfer agents? Why or why not? Have circumstances in the industry changed
such that the original rationale for this exemption should be reconsidered? Should
the Commission take into account the size of a transfer agent, or any other
measure, in determining whether the current exemption is appropriate? Why or
why not? Please provide a full explanation.

75.

Currently, Rule 17Ad-5 (written inquiries and requests) permits transfer agents to
respond to certain instructions and inquiries “promptly” rather than within a
specified time period unless the requestor provides specific detailed information,
such as a certificate number, number of shares, and name in which the certificate
was received. In commenters’ experience, is the detailed information specified in
Rule 17Ad-5 an accurate description of the minimum information necessary to
permit a transfer agent to identify the subject of an inquiry or instruction and
respond? If not, what other information would allow a transfer agent to identify
the subject of the inquiry and respond?

76.

Does Rule 17Ad-5 address the full scope of inquiries received by transfer agents?
If not, what additional types of inquiries and requests do transfer agents receive,
and in what volume? How are those inquiries received (e.g., letter, email, phone,
fax, internet)? Should the Commission include additional inquiries within the
scope of Rule 17Ad-5? Why or why not? If so, what types of inquiries should be
included and what types should be excluded? Please provide a full explanation.

77.

Should the Commission update Rule 17Ad-6 to expand the categories and types
of records required to be maintained by registered transfer agents? Why or why
not? If so, what requirements should the Commission consider? Please provide a
full explanation.

78.

Should the Commission eliminate or amend the requirement to escrow “source
code” in Rule 17Ad-7 (record retention)? Why or why not? How do transfer
agents comply with this requirement, and what are the benefits, costs, burdens,
and tradeoffs associated with those efforts? If the Commission amends rather
than eliminate the requirement, what amendments should the Commission
consider? Please provide a full explanation.

79.

Rule 17Ad-7(g) requires certain records to be made available to the Commission.
What records do commenters believe should be covered by the rule? Are there
electronic communication standards in use by the industry to transfer such records
and, if so, should the Commission require their use? Why or why not?
Page 148 of 208

424

80.

Are the different record retention requirements in Rules 17Ad-7 (record
retentions), 17Ad-10 (prompt posting of certificate detail, etc.), 17Ad-11 (aged
record differences), and 17Ad-16 (notice of assumption and termination) still
appropriate in light of transfer agents’ operational and technological capabilities?
Why or why not? Particularly in light of the prevalence of electronic records,
should retention periods for all documents be similar? Why or why not? For the
records that transfer agents are required to maintain, should the Commission
require a longer or shorter retention period? Why or why not? Please provide a
full explanation.

81.

Does the current definition of certificate detail in Rule 17Ad-9 (definitions)
reflect current processes? Why or why not? For example, should the
Commission amend the definition to include additional information relevant to
identifying the specific security, such as CUSIP number or a unique product
identifier if available, or additional information relevant to identifying the
investor, such as investor email address and phone number? Why or why not?
Do commenters believe such information would help transfer agents identify lost
securityholders or improve securityholder communications? Please provide a full
explanation.

82.

With respect to Rule 17Ad-11 (aged record differences), which requires reports
for actual overissuances, should the Commission require transfer agents to
provide issuers with information about all aged differences, rather than just
differences that lead to overissuance? Why or why not? Are the current dollar
and share thresholds reflected in Rule 17Ad-11 appropriate indicators of current
or impending problems? Should the thresholds be amended? If so, what
thresholds would be more appropriate? Are commenters aware of instances
where impending problems were not reported because the dollar or share
threshold did not apply to the situation? Please provide a full explanation.

83.

Should the Commission again consider expanding Rule 17Ad-14 (tender agents)
to include reorganization events such as conversions, maturities, redemptions, and
warrants, as it proposed in 1998? 424 Why or why not? Please provide a full
explanation.

84.

What are the current best practices with regard to accepting signature guarantees,
if any? Should the Commission amend Rule 17Ad-15 to require transfer agents to
document in writing their procedures and requirements for accepting signature
guarantees? Why or why not? Should the Commission require transfer agents to
establish and comply with certain minimum procedures and requirements related

to accepting signature guarantees? Why or why not? If so, what procedures and
requirements should be required, and why? Please provide a full explanation.
85.

Should the Commission amend Rule 17Ad-16 (notice of assumption)? Why or
why not? If so, what amendments should be considered, and why? Is the
information required by Rule 17Ad-16 already provided to the industry, including
DTC? If yes, how is that information being provided to the industry? Is there an
industry standard for electronic communications of these changes? Please
provide a full explanation.

86.

Are there other amendments to the rules that commenters believe would be
appropriate or beneficial that the Commission should consider? Please provide a
full explanation.

87.

What costs, benefits, and burdens, if any, would the potential requirements
discussed above create for issuers or transfer agents?

G.

Conforming Amendments

In connection with the potential new rules and rule amendments discussed above, the
Commission also intends to propose rules for conforming and other revisions to Forms TA-1 and
TA-2 and to Rules 17Ad-1 through 17Ad-20, as appropriate. For example, the Commission may
propose to amend Section 8(a)(iv) of Form TA-1 to require disclosure of employees’ actual
percentage ownership of the transfer agent, rather than whether their percentage ownership falls
within a broad range. The Commission also intends to propose defining or clarifying certain
terms and definitions used in the forms, such as “independent, non-issuer” and “control,” which
are not currently defined in Form TA-1, and to clarify the type of disciplinary history required to
be disclosed by Question 10. The Commission preliminarily believes that such clarifications
would help ensure that transfer agents are interpreting, completing, and filing the requisite forms
in a consistent manner. The Commission requests comment on all aspects of the conforming and
other amendments described above.

VII.

CONCEPT RELEASE AND ADDITIONAL REQUEST FOR COMMENT
This section discusses additional regulatory, policy, and other issues associated with

transfer agents beyond those discussed above in Section VI and seeks comment to identify,
where appropriate, possible regulatory actions to address those issues. In particular, we discuss:
(i) the processing of book-entry securities by transfer agents; (ii) differences between transfer
agent recordkeeping for registered securityholders and broker-dealer recordkeeping for
beneficial owners; (iii) characteristics of and issues associated with transfer agents to mutual
funds; (iv) crowdfunding; (v) services provided by transfer agents and other entities that act as
“third party administrators” for issuer-sponsored investment plans; and (vi) issues associated
with outside entities engaged by transfer agents to perform certain services. Throughout, we
seek comment regarding the issues raised, and conclude with a series of requests for comment on
potential broad changes to the overall regulatory regime for transfer agents that may be
appropriate in light of the issues discussed throughout this release.
A.

Processing of Book-Entry Securities

Most municipal and corporate bonds, U.S. government and mortgage-backed securities,
commercial paper, and mutual fund securities, are offered almost exclusively in book-entry form
(i.e., certificates are not available). 425 While equities have lagged behind this trend, they too
have been moving closer to full dematerialization. 426 At the same time, much of the terminology
and definitions found in the Commission’s transfer agent rules were written, and therefore
425

Securities, Eliminating the Cost and Risks They Incur, A White Paper to the Industry, DTCC 1, 3-6 (July
2012), available at

reflect, a time when most securities were certificated. For example, the definitions of “item” and
“transfer” in Rules 17Ad-1, 17Ad-2, and 17Ad-4 primarily reference certificated securities. 427
Likewise, Rule 17Ad-10, which addresses a transfer agent’s buy-in requirement in the event of
physical overissuance of securities, refers only to “certificates.” 428
Although many of the transfer agent rules refer only to certificated securities, it has long
been the Commission’s position that, absent an explicit exemption, all of the transfer agent rules
apply equally to both certificated and uncertificated securities, particularly in cases where the
rules impose time limits within which a transfer agent must turn around or process a transfer.
For example, when adopting Rules 17Ad-9 through 17Ad-13 in 1983, the Commission clarified
in its response to public comments that the definition of certificate detail in Rule 17Ad-9 applies
with equal force to both certificated and uncertificated securities and related account details. 429
In that same adopting release, the Commission noted that exemptions respecting uncertificated
securities are inappropriate in regulations regarding registered transfer agents’ accurate creation
and maintenance of issuer securityholder records and safeguarding of funds and securities in
their operations. 430
At the same time, the Commission is aware that differences of interpretation among
transfer agents may result in widely varying compliance practices, procedures, and controls
among transfer agents. For example, because Rule 17Ad-10(g) refers specifically to

427

See, e.g., Exchange Act Rules 17Ad-1(a)(1)(i), (d), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-1(a)(1)(i), (d).

428

See Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-10(g)(1), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-10(g)(1).

429

See 17Ad-9 through 13 Proposing Release, supra note 2 (noting that the reference to “certificate detail”
does not necessarily require the existence of a “certificated security.” Rather, it reflects the items of
information regarding the registered owner and of the security, regardless of the form of the security.).

430

Id.

Page 152 of 208

certificates, 431 Commission staff have received questions regarding the rule’s applicability to
overissuances that did not involve certificated securities, indicating that, in applying that rule,
some transfer agents may buy-in securities if an overissuance involved certificated securities, but
not if it involved book-entry securities.
The Commission believes it is appropriate to consider possible amendments to address
the applicability of the transfer agent rules to uncertificated or book-entry securities, including
those held in DRS or issued by investment companies such as mutual funds. 432 Accordingly, the
Commission seeks comment on the following:
88.

Should the Commission amend the existing rules in light of the significant
increase in book-entry securities? If so, what approach should the Commission
take? For example, although a significant percentage of transfer instructions are
categorized as non-routine items under the current rules (such as investor requests
for certificates, to close accounts, and to act in certain types of corporate actions),
there are no specific processing requirements for non-routine items. Should the
same processing obligations apply to all instructions, thereby dispensing with the
current routine and non-routine distinctions in Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-1?
Alternatively, or in conjunction with that approach, should the existing rules be
amended to explicitly apply transfer agents’ processing obligations, not only to
“transfers” as defined in Rule 17Ad-1, but also to the entire range of instructions a
transfer agent may receive, including those related to uncertificated securities,
such as purchase and sale orders, balance certificates, establishment and
movement of book-entry positions, corporate actions, and updates of
securityholder book-entry account information? Why or why not? Are there
other approaches that would be appropriate? If so, please describe.

89.

What policies, concerns, factors, and other considerations do commenters believe
should inform any approach the Commission might take to ensure the transfer

431

Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-10(g), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-10(g).

432

Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-4(a) exempts from the application of Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-2, among other
rules from which it provides exemption, securities held in a DRIP, redeemable securities of registered
investment companies (which include open-end investment management companies (i.e., mutual funds))
and limited partnership interests. Consequently, the provisions of Rule 17Ad-2 which are a fundamental
part of Commission regulation of transfer agent processing of securities do not apply to mutual fund shares
or securities held in Issuer Plans that are DRIPs.

Page 153 of 208

agent rules apply appropriately to book-entry securities? For example, in
determining whether a specific rule or requirement is appropriate, should the
focus of the Commission’s consideration be on the physical nature of the security
(whether certificated or uncertificated), or market-based factors, such as whether
there is a potential for backlog to occur based on trading volume in the particular
type of asset, or both and why? Are there other appropriate considerations? If so,
please describe.

433

90.

Given that transfer and other requests now often involve the highly automated
processing of book-entry securities rather than manual processing of certificates,
should the Commission modify or eliminate the turnaround and processing
requirements of Rules 17Ad-1 and 17Ad-2? Why or why not? For example, is
the distinction between items received before noon and items received after noon
still relevant given that the vast majority of requests are now received and
responded to electronically? Should the Commission shorten the timeframe for
fulfilling instructions and/or increase the percentage of transfer instructions that
must be fulfilled within those timeframes each month? Why or why not?

91.

Should the Commission shorten Rule 17Ad-9’s permitted timeframes for posting
credits and debits to the master securityholder file? Should the Commission
require that certificate details be dispatched daily? Why or why not?

92.

Are commenters aware of instances where securityholders or broker-dealers
cannot determine whether their securities have been processed by transfer agents,
despite the requirements of Rule 17Ad-5? If so, please describe any such
instances and indicate what requirements, if any, the Commission should consider
to address such instances. For example, should the Commission expand the
definition of “item” to include presentation by both individual investors and
broker-dealers or other intermediaries acting on behalf of individual investors and
require transfer agents to report to the presentor of an item the status of any item
for transfer not processed within the required timeframes? Why or why not?

93.

It is the Commission staff’s understanding that investors have brought legal
actions against transfer agents under state law to require the transfer agent to
effect a transfer, including when the transfer agent claimed the securityholder’s
instructions were not in good order and therefore the relevant securities were not
transferred, or were delayed for a long period of time. 433 Are commenters aware

See, e.g., Kanton v. United States Plastics, Inc., 248 F. Supp. 353 (D.N.J. 1965) (involving common law
claims); Bender v. Memory Metals, Inc., 514 A.2d 1109 (Del. Ch. 1986) (involving claim under UCC that
transfer was rightful); Mackinder v. Schawk, Inc., No. 00 Civ. 6098 (DAB), 2005 WL 1832385, at *16
(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 2, 2005) (involving shareholder claim under Delaware law to require the removal of
restrictive legend reflecting restrictions imposed by stock purchase agreement).

Page 154 of 208

of these or other problems or issues associated with transfer agents failing to
effect a securityholder’s transfer instructions within a reasonable period of time?
If so, please describe the relevant facts and circumstances. For example, what
factors might have led to such a situation and how was it resolved? What types of
securityholders were directly involved? What were the adverse consequences, if
any?
94.

Do commenters believe there are problems associated with transfer agents failing
to effect or reject transfer instructions within a reasonable time? Should the
Commission amend the rules to define what information or documentation is
required and from whom it must be received to constitute good order? Should the
Commission amend the rules to define the terms “reject” or “rejection” in
connection with transfer instructions? Why or why not? Should transfer agents
be required to communicate the specific reasons why an instruction was not a
good order? Should transfer agents be required to buy-in securities (or take other
corrective action to satisfy transfer instructions that were received in good order
but not completed after a specific period of time)? If so, should the requirement
apply broadly or be limited to specific conditions? Please explain.

95.

Are commenters aware of delays in processing incomplete or improper requests
for DRS transactions? If so, what caused these delays, and would they be
eliminated or reduced if transfer agents were to provide to securityholders the
information the securityholder would need to prepare complete instructions for
shares held in DRS? Please explain.

96.

Given that most securityholders no longer receive paper certificates evidencing
their holdings, should the Commission require transfer agents to provide
securityholders with an account statement with specific details for each
transaction that occurred with respect to each securityholder’s account? If so,
how and how often should such statements be provided and what information
should be included? Please describe.

B.

Bank and Broker-Dealer Recordkeeping For Beneficial Owners

Although transfer agents provide critical recordkeeping and transfer services to registered
owners, they generally do not have visibility beyond the master securityholder file and therefore
rarely provide recordkeeping and transfer services to beneficial owners who hold in street name.
Instead, recordkeeping and transfer services usually are provided to beneficial owners by the

Page 155 of 208

intermediary through whom the beneficial owner purchased the securities, usually a brokerdealer or bank. 434 Because many securityholders elect to hold exchange-traded securities in
street name, many issuers have significantly more beneficial owners than registered owners. As
a result, broker-dealers, banks, and other intermediaries may provide recordkeeping and transfer
services to a larger portion of a given issuer’s shareholder base – the intermediaries’ customers –
than the registered transfer agent for that issuer.
The transfer and recordkeeping services provided to beneficial owners by banks and
brokers are largely identical to the recordkeeping and transfer services provided with respect to
registered owners by registered transfer agents. For example, banks and brokers often maintain
accountholder information details, process transfers and other changes to accounts, provide
securityholder services such as call center support, and provide account statements showing
ownership positions for their beneficial owner customers. Yet although these services may be
nearly identical to the services provided to registered owners by transfer agents, banks and
brokers are typically not required to register as transfer agents under the Exchange Act solely for
providing these services to beneficial owners. This is because the positions serviced are

434

Commission staff understands that some industry participants may refer to the recordkeeping and transfer
services provided to beneficial owners by brokers and banks discussed herein as “sub-accounting” or “subtransfer agent” services. We note that the term sub-transfer agent in this context is not meant to imply a
contractual relationship between the registered transfer agent who provides recordkeeping and transfer
services for registered owners and the broker or bank that provides the same services for their own
beneficial owner customers. Although brokers and banks who act as sub-transfer agents could contract with
registered transfer agents to provide recordkeeping and transfer services for their beneficial owner
customers, they rarely do so, choosing instead to provide these services themselves.

Page 156 of 208

“securities entitlements” under the UCC rather than “Qualifying Securities” that trigger transfer
agent registration. 435
As street name registration has become more prevalent and the number of registered
holders has decreased, more banks and brokers are providing to more investors critical transfer,
processing, and recordkeeping services, but are not required to register with the Commission or
other ARA as a transfer agent. 436 This raises potential issues regarding the Commission’s
regulation of securities processing as it pertains to the processing of equity securities by banks,
brokers, and other intermediaries. 437 Specifically, if a bank or broker providing transfer and
recordkeeping services to beneficial owners is not required to register as a transfer agent with the
Commission or other ARA, it will not be required to comply with the Commission’s transfer
agent rules, including the specific recordkeeping, processing, transfer, and other investor
protection requirements imposed by those rules. While some banks and brokers may be subject
to certain regulatory requirements depending on their specific activities, those regulations may
not specifically address securities processing or provide the same investor protections as do the
Commission’s transfer agent rules. For example, registered broker-dealers are subject to
extensive books and records requirements pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 17a-3, but that rule
does not impose the same ownership and transfer recordkeeping requirements as the transfer
435

See supra note 115 (UCC definition of “securities entitlement”), Section IV.A (discussing provisions of the
Exchange Act regarding Qualifying Securities).

437

There are of course other issues raised by the increasing prevalence of bank and broker recordkeeping for
beneficial owners, including complexity in the proxy distribution and voting systems and barriers to
communication between securityholders and issuers. These issues are beyond the scope of this release but
have been discussed in other Commission releases. See, e.g., Final Street Name Study, supra note 82;
Proxy Concept Release, supra note 112. We discuss certain issues concerning bank and broker processing
of investment company securities below in Section VII.C.4.

Page 157 of 208

agent rules such as Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-10, which imposes detailed information
requirements with respect to every securityholder account position. 438 Further, some third party
administrators 439 and other intermediaries who provide recordkeeping, administrative, and other
services for retirement and issuer plans may not be regulated directly at all by any federal
financial regulator. Any risks or other issues associated with these intermediaries’ activities
become more acute as street name ownership, and the resulting volume of processing of street
name book-entry positions by brokers, banks, and other intermediaries providing transfer and
recordkeeping services to beneficial owners, continues to increase. 440
The Commission seeks comment on the following:
97.

Are there regulatory discrepancies among transfer agents and banks and brokers
who provide similar services for beneficial owners? If so, what are they and do
they present risks or raise competition issues in the market for these services? If
so, what are the competition issues or risks associated with any such
discrepancies, and what approach, if any, should the Commission consider to
address them? Please provide a full explanation.

98.

Are there reasons why the Commission should regulate transfer agent processing
of registered owner securities held in book-entry positions differently than bank
and broker processing of street name positions held in book-entry form? If so,
please describe them. Please provide a full explanation.

438

We note, however, that Rule 17a-3 does contain several requirements related to securityholder accounts,
such as a “blotter” that shows “the account for which each such transaction was effected” as well as other
details, and an “account record” with detailed identifying information for each customer or owner, such as
their name, address, and date of birth, as well as their annual income, net worth, and the account's
investment objectives.

439

Third party administrators are discussed in more detail below in Section VII.E.

440

For example, Professor Egon Guttman identified the lack of regulation of broker-dealer street name
ownership processing as a key regulatory gap and advocated closing it as one of his key recommendations
for regulatory improvement. See Egon Guttman, Federal Regulation of Transfer Agents, 34 Am. U. L.
Rev. 281, 327-8 (1985), available at http://www.americanuniversitylawreview.org/pdfs/34/342/Guttman.pdf.

99.

In light of increased obligations under federal law for certain issuers to ascertain
their securityholders’ identities and the barriers to doing so created by the street
name system, as discussed above in Section III.B, should the Commission require
entities that are regulated by the Commission, including brokers, banks, or others
who provide transfer and recordkeeping services to beneficial owners, to provide
or “pass through” securityholder information to transfer agents? If so, what type
of information should be provided and how should it be transmitted? What would
be the effect on the actions and choices of affected parties, including transfer
agents, banks and brokers, issuers, registered owners, and beneficial owners?
Please provide a full explanation.

100.

If the Commission were to require certain registrants to pass through
securityholder information regarding beneficial owners to transfer agents, should
the Commission prohibit transfer agents from using such information for other
than certain prescribed purposes? If so, for what purposes should such
information be allowed to be used, and why? For example, should the
information be used solely for the transfer agent’s legal/compliance purposes, or
should it be permitted to be used for other purposes, such as securityholder
communications? Should transfer agents’ ability to share information be limited,
particularly where information is shared in return for compensation or where
information sharing is not fully disclosed to parties such as the issuer or the
securityholder? Why or why not? Should such information be permitted to be
shared only with the securityholder’s consent? Please provide a full explanation.

Transfer Agents to Mutual Funds

U.S. registered investment companies managed $18.7 trillion in assets at year-end
2014. 441 This figure is primarily comprised of mutual funds (i.e., open-end management
investment companies or “open-end funds”), but also includes closed-end management
investment companies (“closed-end funds”) of $289 billion, unit investment trusts (“UITs”) 442 of

441

See Testimony of David W. Grim, Director, Division of Investment Management, before the House
subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises (Oct. 23, 2015) (“Grim
Testimony”).

442

UITs are funds that offer a fixed, unmanaged portfolio, generally of stocks and bonds, as redeemable
“units” to investors for a specific period of time, each of which represents an undivided interest in a unit of
specified securities. See Investment Company Act Section 4(2), 15 U.S.C. 80a-4(2).

Page 159 of 208

$101 billion, and exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) 443 of approximately $2 trillion, which have
seen considerable growth in recent years. 444 While the discussion on transfer agents to mutual
funds is focused on open-end funds, the Commission also seeks comment on transfer agents to
other registered investment companies as discussed in Section 5 below.
Open-end funds 445 have become one of the main investment vehicles for retail
investors 446 in the United States and play a major role in the U.S. economy and financial
markets. When the first transfer agent rules were adopted in 1977, there were approximately 477
mutual funds with $48 billion in assets for shareholders in just under 8.7 million accounts. 447 By
the end of 2014, there were approximately 7,900 mutual funds with approximately $16 trillion in
assets 448 held on behalf of hundreds of millions of investors. 449

443

ETFs may be formed as either open-end funds or UITs.

444

See Grim Testimony, supra note 441.

445

Open-end management investment companies are a type of registered investment company under Section 8
of the Investment Company Act that issue redeemable securities. Other types of investment companies
include, but are not limited to, closed-end funds and UITs. See Investment Company Act Sections 4(2), 15
U.S.C. 80a-4(2) (definition of unit investment trust) and 5(a) (definition of open and closed-end 1940 Act
companies). ETFs are typically organized as open-end funds or UITs.

Fact Book, 29 (2015), available at http://www.ici.org/pdf/2015_factbook.pdf (“2015 ICI Factbook”). At
year-end 2014, retail investors (i.e., households) held the vast majority (89 percent) of the nearly $16
trillion in mutual fund assets, whereas institutions held about 11 percent.

By mid-2014, 53.2 million households, approximately 43 percent of all U.S. households,
owned mutual funds. 450 Today, the typical investor has $103,000 invested in mutual funds,
which, for approximately 68 percent of investors, represents more than half of their household
financial assets. 451 For many of these investors, mutual funds are their primary source of
investing for retirement, higher education, and other financial goals. 452 Historically, many
mutual fund investors purchased their shares “direct” from the fund or through the fund’s
transfer agent. 453 However, today many investors engage an investment professional (also
referred to as an “intermediary” for beneficial owners of fund shares), such as a broker-dealer or
investment adviser 454 who provides many services, such as helping them identify their financial
goals, analyzing an existing financial portfolio, determining an appropriate asset allocation, and
(depending on the type of investment professional) providing investment advice or
recommendations. 455 In addition, many intermediaries have arrangements with the mutual fund
or the mutual fund’s transfer agent to perform the underlying shareholder recordkeeping and
servicing for their customers’ mutual fund positions. 456 Under such arrangements, the

Examples of these services include communicating with their customers about their fund holdings;
maintaining their financial records; processing changes in customer accounts and trade orders;
recordkeeping for customers; answering customer inquiries regarding account status and the procedures for

beneficial owner, and in many cases aggregates their customer records into a single or a few
“omnibus” 457 accounts registered in the intermediary’s name on the Mutual Fund Transfer
Agent’s recordkeeping system. 458
We understand that the shift to omnibus account arrangements for mutual fund
shareholders 459 has altered the landscape of recordkeeping and other services provided to fund
investors. This fundamental shift in the roles and responsibilities of traditional shareholder
servicing and recordkeeping, however, has resulted in a lack of transparency of beneficial
owners, their trading activities and related records. 460
The complexity of recordkeeping for mutual fund shares also has increased significantly
over the last several decades. The total number of mutual fund share classes offered increased

the purchase and redemption of fund shares; providing account balances and providing account statements,
tax documents, and confirmations of transactions in a customer’s account; transmitting proxy statements,
annual reports and other communications from a fund; and receiving, tabulating and transmitting proxies
executed by customers.
457

Omnibus accounts are held by and registered in the name of a single intermediary, such as a broker, and the
holdings in the account represent the aggregated positions of multiple beneficial owner customers of the
intermediary. Typically, the issuer will not have information regarding the intermediary’s underlying
beneficial owners. See ICI, Navigating Intermediary Relationships, 3, 6-7 (2009), available at
https://www.ici.org/pdf/ppr_09_nav_relationships.pdf. Regarding omnibus relationships generally, see
also The Stock Market, supra note 8, at 542.

458

The growth in retirement plan assets also has resulted in a significant increase in the number of third party
administrators that perform retirement plan recordkeeping on behalf of mutual fund investors that are plan
participants, whose mutual fund positions are held in omnibus accounts on the fund’s transfer agent
recordkeeping system. Third Party Administrators are discussed further in Section VII.E.

from 1,243 share classes in 1984 to over 24,000 share classes in 2014. 461 Historically, as
products and share classes evolved, shareholders and their investment professionals looked for
diversification by focusing on a mutual fund complex with a broad lineup of funds taking
advantage of breakpoint discounts offered on their suite of mutual fund products. 462 In recent
years, however, many intermediaries are managing clients’ mutual fund investments using
advisory type models, where typically a wide range of mutual fund investments from many
different fund companies are utilized. 463
The Commission understands that the growth in both mutual fund products and share
classes offered has added complexity and requires Mutual Fund Transfer Agents to maintain, in
addition to the master securityholder file, extensive CUSIP databases that define the
characteristics and processing rules for each fund share class to ensure prospectus compliance
and accurate processing and recordkeeping of mutual fund transactions. 464 As a result, Mutual
Fund Transfer Agents have made significant investments in technology advancements to manage

https://www.ici.org/pdf/per20-02.pdf (“Thirty years ago, fund shareholders usually compensated financial
professionals through a front-end load – a one-time, up-front payment for current and future services. That
distribution structure has changed significantly.”). The report notes that there has been a marked reduction
in load fees paid by mutual fund investors, from nearly 4 percent in 1990 to roughly 1 percent in 2013. It
also notes that funds often waive load fees on purchases made through retirement plans, as well as waive or
reduce load fees for large initial or cumulative purchases.

463

Id. In these advisory arrangements, the investment professional who sells mutual funds is assessing an
asset based-fee (a percentage of the net assets managed for an investor), rather than a percentage of the
dollars initially invested (a front-end load), utilizing newer free or low-fee share classes designed for
advisory type programs. The report also notes that because of the recent trend toward asset-based fees the
market share of traditional front-end and back-end load shares has fallen, while the market share of newer
share classes that are no-load has increased substantially.

464

We note that, generally, many of the recordkeeping and processing tasks discussed in this section may be
performed by either the Mutual Fund Transfer Agent or the intermediary, depending on whether the
investor holds his or her mutual fund shares directly with the mutual fund or through an intermediary. We
focus herein primarily on transfer agents.

more frequent and diverse transaction processing and shareholder communications through
different channels. The industry also has relied heavily on the automation developed through
NSCC for processing and settling mutual fund transactions 465 and exchanging and reconciling
customer account information, whether held in direct or omnibus accounts. 466
The growth of the mutual fund industry since 1977, the attendant growth of the portion of
the transfer agent community specifically focused on servicing that industry, the proliferation of
fund share classes, the growth in intermediary omnibus account arrangements and the Mutual
Fund Transfer Agent community, and the complexity of fund processing and reliance on NSCC’s
systems (discussed below), are among the factors informing the Commission’s examination of its
transfer agent rules.
1.

Key Characteristics of Mutual Fund Transfer Agents

If any person performs for a mutual fund any services listed in Exchange Act Section
3(a)(25), such as registering transfers and transferring registered investment company securities,
the person must register with the Commission as a transfer agent pursuant to Exchange Act
Section 17A(c)(1). 467 When mutual funds were first introduced, many transfer agents provided
these services because the traditional services they offered to operating company issuers (i.e.,
issuers whose business is not primarily investing in securities), such as maintaining records of
stock ownership, paying dividends, sending securityholder communications, and transferring

465

See DTCC, 2014 Annual Report (2014), available at http://dtcc.com/annuals/2014/wealth-managementservices/index.php. The value of mutual fund (Fund/SERV) transactions reported was $4.9 trillion.

stock ownership, were easily adapted to the particularities of mutual funds. 468 But as mutual
fund processing and operations came to involve greater numbers of investors and intermediaries,
greater numbers of products, and a broader array of services, some transfer agents evolved with
the industry to specialize in the increasingly unique needs of mutual funds, creating a segment of
the transfer agent industry that focuses, often exclusively, on servicing mutual funds. 469
Today, these specialized Mutual Fund Transfer Agents provide many of the same transfer
and account maintenance services that other transfer agents perform for operating companies,
including the recordkeeping, transfer, and related activities discussed above in Section V. 470
They also commonly provide recordkeeping and other services related to the mutual funds’

470

For example, Mutual Fund Transfer Agents effect transfers in ownership of fund securities, which usually
involves making changes to the master securityholder file but not cancelling or issuing certificates because
almost all mutual fund securities are issued and held in book-entry form. They also facilitate
communications between issuers and securityholders, including by sending to securityholders mutual fund
prospectuses, confirmations, periodic account statements, semi-annual and annual reports, and proxy
statements. See, e.g., Robert Pozen & Theresa Hamacher, The Fund Industry: How Your Money is
Managed, 348 (2nd ed. 2015) (“Pozen & Hamacher”) (discussing transfer agent distribution of such
materials). Mutual Fund Transfer Agents also distribute to securityholders tax information, such as
estimates of fund distributions, Form 1099-DIV and Form 1099B. Id. at 349. They also process cash
distributions by the fund, ensuring that cash from distributions is properly credited to securityholder
accounts. Id. at 348. In addition, where securityholders elect to reinvest cash distributions by the fund by
purchasing additional shares of the fund, Mutual Fund Transfer Agents help facilitate execution of the
purchase and calculate and record the number of additional shares purchased. Id.

recordkeeping obligations under the Investment Company Act. 471 However, instead of
processing exchange or OTC-traded equity or debt securities, like other transfer agents, Mutual
Fund Transfer Agents process redeemable securities of investment companies registered under
Section 8 of the Investment Company Act, 472 which under Rule 17Ad-4, are exempt from: (i) the
turnaround and processing requirements of Rule 17Ad-2; (ii) the limitations on expansion under
Rule 17Ad-3; and (iii) key recordkeeping requirements related to the transfer agent’s processing
and performance obligations under Rules 17Ad-6(a)(1)-(7) and (11). 473 Thus, although they
provide many services identical to those provided by Operating Company Transfer Agents,
Mutual Fund Transfer Agents are exempt from the key turnaround, processing, performance, and
recordkeeping requirements.
Although many of the core services Mutual Fund Transfer Agents provide are similar to
the core services provided by Operating Company Transfer Agents, there are differences. One is
the degree to which the securities typically serviced by Mutual Fund Transfer Agents are
dematerialized. 474 The mutual fund industry was an early adopter of the practice of issuing
shares in book-entry form. By the time the first Commission transfer agent rules were adopted in
1977, registered ownership of mutual fund shares already had been predominantly
dematerialized. 475 In contrast, the trend towards dematerialization of registered ownership

471

See Investment Company Act Rule 31a-1(b)(1), 17 CFR 270.31a-1(b(1) (requiring current journals
detailing sales and redemptions of the investment company’s own securities and the trade date).

472

See supra note 183.

473

Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-4(a), 17 CFR 240.17Ad-4(a).

474

For discussion of dematerialization, see supra note 69 and accompanying text.

475

See 1971 Study of the Securities Industry Hearings, supra note 299 (statements of David Hughey, Senior
Vice President-Operations, Putnam Management Co., Inc. that the percentage of Mutual Fund holders

Page 166 of 208

positions of operating companies evolved over a much longer period of time through some of the
incremental developments discussed in this release, such as DRS and issuer plans (e.g., DRIPs).
And, for beneficial owners, equity securities issued by operating companies have largely been
immobilized in central securities depositories, as discussed above in Sections II and III. Thus,
while both Mutual Fund Transfer Agents and Operating Company Transfer Agents today process
large numbers of dematerialized securities, Mutual Fund Transfer Agents process them in larger
numbers and have been doing so for a longer period of time.
There are also important differences in how Mutual Fund Transfer Agents are organized
and compensated compared to Operating Company Transfer Agents generally. For example,
there are, in general, three types of Mutual Fund Transfer Agent arrangements: (i) internal
(which may also be referred to as “captive,” “affiliated” or “full internalization”), 476 (ii) external
(which may also be referred to as “third party” or “full service”), and (iii) hybrid (which may
also be referred to as “remote vendor”). 477 Mutual funds generally tend not to have employees;
therefore, internal transfer agent services are not actually provided by the fund. “Internal”

owning in certificated form dropped from 72 percent in 1956 to 27.5 percent by 1969). It was estimated in
1978 that less than 10% of registered owners of Mutual Fund shares requested certificates. See, e.g.,
Martin J. Aronstein, The Decline and Fall of the Stock Certificate in America, 1. J. Int’l L. 273, 278 (1978),
available at http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/jil/vol1/iss3/4.
476

Mutual funds generally do not have employees. As a result, the Commission understands that transfer
agent services that are characterized as being provided “internally” are not actually provided by the fund
but are provided by personnel from the investment adviser to the mutual fund or by an affiliate of such
investment adviser.

477

See generally, ICI, The Role and Responsibilities of a Mutual Fund Transfer Agent: Workbook, 4 (2001)
(“Mutual Fund Transfer Agent Workbook”); PWC Evolution of the Mutual fund Transfer Agent, supra
note 460. For a discussion of one mutual fund complex’s evaluation of using the internal (“full
internalization”), hybrid (“remote vendor”), or external (“full service”) Mutual Fund Transfer Agent
models, see In the Matter of Smith Barney Fund Management LLC and Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.,

transfer agents are typically affiliated with the mutual fund complex, or the fund’s investment
adviser. 478 The main advantage of an internal transfer agent arrangement is that it allows a
mutual fund or fund complex to closely monitor the delivery and quality of services provided to
securityholders, which may be important to attracting and retaining investors who value service
quality. 479 Larger mutual funds or mutual fund complexes may be more inclined to use internal
transfer agents than their smaller counterparts because these funds’ sponsors may be better able
to undertake the costs required to develop and maintain the extensive technology systems and
internal workforce needed to provide service to a large number of accounts. 480 External (or
third-party) transfer agents are independent from (as opposed to being affiliated with) the mutual
fund and its fund complex or investment adviser. While there may be variation from firm to
firm, the external model may not require the same capital expenditures by fund sponsors as for
internal transfer agent services, and therefore may be viewed as a cost effective alternative to the
internal model. 481

478

“Independent” and “affiliated” are used generally in connection with this discussion and are not intended to
refer to any particular definition of those terms in any of the provisions of the federal securities laws or
other authorities.

479

See, e.g., Mutual Fund Industry Handbook, supra note 468, at 277 (“In many cases, fund groups that
outsource their transfer agent back-office functions perform investor service from their own, internal
contact centers. This reflects the widespread belief that the quality of this visible service has competitive
implications. The back-office functions, by contrast, must be performed correctly, but they offer little
opportunity for the fund to differentiate itself from the competition.”).

480

481

See generally, Mutual Fund Transfer Agent Workbook, supra note 477. We note, however, even among
larger mutual funds, it is possible for decisions to vary from firm to firm and for similar size firms to come
to different conclusions concerning expected costs and the degree to which the mutual fund should
internalize transfer agent services when faced with similar factors.
It is the understanding of the Commission that these capital expenditures to build and maintain transfer
agent technology and infrastructure systems may be absent or reduced in the case of an external transfer
agent because an external transfer agent may have already made these investments in the past and, to the
extent some or all of the cost of those investments may be passed on to transfer agent issuer clients, the full

Page 168 of 208

External transfer agents have their own business model, processing and procedural
routines, computer systems, and service providers. 482 Because of this independence, the mutual
fund or mutual fund complex may have less input or control over how a fund’s securityholders
are ultimately serviced. For this reason, some mutual funds use a hybrid transfer agent
arrangement, whereby an internal transfer agent performs certain services in an effort to maintain
control over the quality of the securityholder servicing relationship, and other services are subcontracted to an external transfer agent. 483 For example, many mutual funds using a hybrid
arrangement will use an external transfer agent for core record-keeping functions and an internal
transfer agent for securityholder servicing, especially when such servicing involves direct
interaction with mutual fund securityholders. 484 As a result, there may be significant variation in
services provided, technology resources and capability, and corporate structure and organization
among Mutual Fund Transfer Agents.
Mutual Fund Transfer Agents may also have different compensation arrangements than
typical Operating Company Transfer Agents, which generally will be compensated on a per
securityholder account basis. While Mutual Fund Transfer Agents may also be compensated on

extent of the redistributed cost is unlikely to be borne by a single issuer and is more likely to be diffused
across multiple issuers.
482

In contrast to mutual funds, operating companies with a large number of shareholders rarely use the internal
or hybrid models and nearly always use an external transfer agent, although there are exceptions where a
public company serves as its own transfer agent, particularly among local utility companies and local banks
where the administration to service stockholders as a transfer agent is already in place and where the
stockholders are often customers of the company.

483

See, e.g., supra note 479 (discussing internal servicing and quality of service).

See, e.g., Mutual Fund Industry Handbook, supra note 468, at 277 (citing ICI, Mutual Funds and Transfer

securityholder servicing “internally” (i.e., using personnel from the management company or an affiliate of
the management company)).

a per securityholder account basis, many of them instead receive compensation based on a
percentage of a fund’s net assets. 485 Mutual Fund Transfer Agent fees are typically the second
largest expense borne by mutual funds, exceeded only by the investment management fee. 486
2.

Increased Complexity

As a result of the collective effect of the five factors discussed below, transaction
processing for Mutual Fund Transfer Agents may be more complex or involve additional
responsibilities as compared to Operating Company Transfer Agents. First, Mutual Fund
Transfer Agents receive cash and perform calculations as a part of regular processing of
transactions in shares of mutual funds to a greater extent than is involved in the day-to-day work
of Operating Company Transfer Agents. As a general matter, unlike publicly traded equity
securities, mutual fund securities are redeemable, meaning that investors in mutual fund
securities (or their intermediaries) purchase or redeem mutual fund shares directly with the
mutual fund itself rather than on the secondary market. 487 Mutual fund securities must be
purchased and redeemed at their current net asset value (“NAV”) per share next computed after
receipt. 488 Investor orders to purchase mutual fund shares are ultimately received by a Mutual

485

Fee arrangements may vary from Mutual Fund Transfer Agent agreement to agreement and other fee
permutations are possible, for example as an at-cost arrangement between an internal Mutual Fund Transfer
Agent and the fund.

486

See, e.g., Mutual Fund Industry Handbook, supra note 468, at 231 (“Transfer agent service is typically the
largest component of a fund’s expense after investment management.”); H. Kent Baker, Greg Filbeck &
Halil Kiymaz, Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds: Building Blocks to Wealth, 406 (2015)
(analyzing 2014 data of one Mutual Fund and finding $21 million in transfer agent fees to have been the
fund’s second largest expense after $65 million in investment management fees).

487

See Investment Company Act Sections 5(a), 2(a)(32), 15 U.S.C. 80a-5(a), 80a-2(a)(32) (defining open-end
companies and redeemable securities, respectively).

488

See Investment Company Act Rule 22c-1 17 CFR 270.22c-1. Under Rule 22c-1, commonly called the
“forward pricing” rule, an investor who submits an order before the next computed NAV, generally

Page 170 of 208

Fund Transfer Agent, regardless of whether the investor’s order is submitted directly by the
investor or is submitted by an intermediary such as a broker (including where a broker may
submit the order via NSCC’s Fund/SERV system). 489 After receiving a purchase order, Mutual
Fund Transfer Agents calculate the number of shares purchased in some cases (such as where the
investor indicates the dollar amount the investor seeks to purchase rather than the number of
shares). With respect to purchase orders from investors, Mutual Fund Transfer agents collect the
payment for those shares, deposit the payment into the account of the custodian of the mutual
fund, issue on behalf of the mutual fund the shares to be purchased, and record the transaction on
the master securityholder file of the mutual fund. 490 Mutual Fund Transfer Agents engage in a
comparable process when an investor decides to redeem shares in a mutual fund.
Second, Mutual Fund Transfer Agents also play a role that serves to assist in the
determination of the appropriate price for an investor’s purchase or redemption order (which is
based on the NAV per share and any applicable commissions or fees). They do so by
coordinating with mutual fund administrators, who commonly perform the main calculations that

calculated by most funds as of the time when the major U.S. stock exchanges close at 4:00 pm Eastern
Time, receives that day's price, and an investor who submits an order after the pricing time receives the
next day's price. See generally, Amendments to Rules Governing Pricing of Mutual Fund Shares,

deposit into the fund’s bank account.”).

assist a mutual fund in determining its NAV. 491 The coordination with the mutual fund’s
administrator is necessary, not only because Mutual Fund Transfer Agents must process
purchases and redemptions at current NAV as described above, but because current NAV as
calculated by the administrator on behalf of the mutual fund must reflect changes in the number
of shares of the mutual fund outstanding pursuant to Investment Company Act Rule 2a4(a)(3). 492 Because the Mutual Fund Transfer Agent is the entity primarily responsible for
keeping track of this information on behalf of the mutual fund, the administrator typically
receives this record of changes in the capital stock of the mutual fund from the Mutual Fund
Transfer Agent. Because Mutual Fund Transfer Agent transaction processing is price-dependent
as described above, if an error is made and later discovered in connection with some aspect of
this process, the Mutual Fund Transfer Agent may need to reprocess all of the purchases and
redemptions that were affected by the error (“as of” transaction processing). Both the daily NAV
and any corrections are communicated by Mutual Fund Transfer Agents to intermediaries for
transaction processing conducted on behalf of beneficial owners of mutual funds.
Third, some mutual funds may provide their investors with options which may add
additional complexity to the Mutual Fund Transfer Agent’s or intermediary’s processing tasks.
For example, many mutual funds allow investors to exchange a mutual fund within the same

491

The Commission understands that most mutual funds and other investment companies that are required to
register with the Commission contract with one service provider for transfer agent services and a different
provider for fund “administration,” which generally involves services such as calculation of NAV and
management fee accruals. In contrast, it is the understanding of the Commission that many private funds
(i.e., investment funds not registered with the Commission) use a single service provider for both transfer
agent and administration functions.

492

See Investment Company Act Rule 2a-4(a)(3), 17 CFR 270.2a-4(a)(3) (“Changes in the number of
outstanding shares of the registered company resulting from distributions, redemptions, and repurchases
shall be reflected no later than in the first calculation on the first business day following such change.”).

Page 172 of 208

fund complex without having to pay a sales load or other fee for purchasing shares of the new
mutual fund. This arrangement may require Mutual Fund Transfer Agents (or intermediaries) to
determine if the exchange qualifies for a waiver of the sales charge and to track the total time the
investor has been invested in the mutual fund complex. In addition, some mutual funds may
offer other services and options, such as systematic withdrawal plans, that may require Mutual
Fund Transfer Agents and their intermediaries to keep track of a potentially wide range of
securityholder elections, transaction types, and prospectus and business processing rules in
CUSIP databases that are utilized for transaction processing.
Fourth, the use of different sales load structures and distribution methods, particularly
with respect to redemption of mutual fund securities, as well as other fee payments to
intermediaries, also adds complexity in the mutual fund context. For example, for load funds, or
funds that charge a sales load to the investor, Mutual Fund Transfer Agents commonly process
and distribute related commission payments to intermediaries in connection with sales of mutual
fund shares. 493 As part of a distribution strategy, some mutual funds compensate distributors
such as broker-dealers with trail commissions that are processed and distributed by the Mutual
Fund Transfer Agent, even after completion of a sale. 494 A Mutual Fund Transfer Agent may
process redemption fee charges or track relevant information and give effect to sales load
discounts (often referred to as breakpoints) for direct investors, often based on the amount

493

In addition, if the mutual fund has a contingent deferred sales load (often referred to as a “back-end load”),
transfer agents commonly process and distribute these commissions to distributors in connection with a
redemption.

invested or intended to be invested. Mutual Fund Transfer Agents also may process and
distribute ongoing sub-transfer agency fees to intermediaries. 495
Fifth, Mutual Fund Transfer Agents traditionally have functioned in a more central role in
connection with clearing and settlement of securities transactions than have Operating Company
Transfer Agents. With a mutual fund purchase or redemption, there is no clearing corporation
involved that serves to novate trades as a central counterparty as in the case of a brokerfacilitated trade in an equity security on a national securities exchange (as shown in Figure 1 in
Section III.B above) because mutual funds generally are not exchange-traded. 496 As a result of
this clearance and settlement environment, Mutual Fund Transfer Agents interact with subtransfer agents such as broker-dealers, who hold shares on behalf of their beneficial owner
customer, similar to the way in which DTC interacts with Operating Company Transfer
Agents. 497 Mutual Fund Transfer Agents also maintain on the master securityholder file
omnibus positions for intermediaries (on behalf of the intermediaries’ beneficial ownercustomers), which is similar to the way in which DTC maintains securities accounts of
participants, but there is no jumbo Cede & Co. position at DTC in the case of a mutual fund.

495

See supra Section VII.B for a discussion of sub-transfer agents.

496

While as discussed above, there is no clearing corporation that serves as central counterparty in mutual
fund transactions, there are services provided by NSCC, such as Fund/SERV and Networking. This
centralized clearance and settlement platform employs standardized data fields and protocols for mutual
fund transaction processing and daily net settlements, through which intermediaries such as brokers may
transmit and settle orders with Mutual Fund Transfer Agents. For additional details regarding Fund/SERV,
see supra note 489.

Compliance and Other Services

Many Mutual Fund Transfer Agents may assist mutual funds with their compliance
obligations, not only with respect to general recordkeeping obligations, but also to enable mutual
funds to comply with regulations to which operating companies may not be subject in the same
way or at all. 498 One such obligation is that mutual funds have various “client on-boarding”
requirements under federal law 499 and commonly rely upon their Mutual Fund Transfer Agent to
do the work that will enable the mutual fund to meet such obligations. For example, mutual
funds are required to implement anti-money laundering (AML) programs pursuant to an interim
final rule of the Treasury. 500 In addition, mutual funds are required to establish customer
identification programs pursuant to a joint rule of the Commission and Treasury. 501 That rule
requires, at a minimum, that the mutual fund verify an investor’s identity to the extent reasonable
and practicable, maintain records of the information used to verify identity, and determine
whether the investor appears “on any list of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist
organizations issued by any federal government agency and designated as such by Treasury in

498

Regarding general recordkeeping obligations, see Investment Company Act Rule 31a-1(b)(1), 17 CFR
270.31a-1(b)(1) (requiring current journals detailing sales and redemptions of the investment company’s
own securities and the trade date).

499

See, e.g., Bank Secrecy Act Section 5312(a)(2) (including “investment compan[ies]” within the definition
of “financial institution”). Transfer agents may also be subject directly to related federal requirements that
do not apply solely to “financial institutions.” See, e.g., Section 6050I of the Internal Revenue Code,26
U.S.C. 6050I (requirement to report to Internal Revenue Service receipt of cash in excess of $10,000 in a
single or related transaction).

consultation with the federal functional regulators.” 502 While mutual funds bear ultimate
responsibility for compliance, as a practical matter, the customer identification processes
commonly are carried out by Mutual Fund Transfer Agents for direct investors. 503 In addition,
mutual funds are required to report suspicious transactions (“Suspicious Activity Reports”) to the
Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. 504 Mutual Fund Transfer Agents may assist
the mutual fund in filing the Suspicious Activity Reports.
Mutual Fund Transfer Agents may also assist mutual funds in complying with
requirements related to the price-dependent nature of mutual fund transaction processing. First,
Mutual Fund Transfer Agents may be responsible for monitoring, on behalf of the mutual fund,
that intermediaries such as dealers are properly separating orders received from customers before
NAV is next computed from those received afterwards and are sending them in separate batches
to the Mutual Fund Transfer Agent. 505 As another example, mutual funds are entitled to receive

Company Act Rule 22c-2(a)(2) with financial intermediaries who submit orders on behalf of
beneficial owner customers. 506 Mutual Fund Transfer Agents commonly assist the mutual fund’s
review of this taxpayer identification number and related transaction information in order to
monitor against trading practices that may dilute the value of the outstanding securities issued by
the mutual fund. 507

Broker-Dealer Recordkeeping for Beneficial Owners Who Invest In
Mutual Funds

As happens in the operating company space, many securities intermediaries such as
broker-dealers and banks perform recordkeeping and processing services for their customers who
are beneficial owner investors in mutual funds. 508 A key difference is that frequently a mutual
fund will compensate the intermediary pursuant to an agreement with the intermediary for the
provision of those services to fund investors, typically based on the number of shareholder
accounts or a percentage of the net assets of the fund, or some combination thereof. However,
most operating companies do not compensate intermediaries for servicing their beneficial owner

requirements of the new rule. Funds should . . . also take affirmative steps to . . . obtain[] assurances that
those policies and procedures are effectively administered.”).

customers. The oversight and invoicing for these payments is often delegated to the Mutual
Fund Transfer Agent, 509 who will commonly process and distribute ongoing sub-transfer agency
fees to intermediaries.
Because intermediaries are compensated for providing recordkeeping and processing
services for their customers who are beneficial owner investors in mutual funds, many of the
issues discussed above in Section V.D.3 are relevant to Mutual Fund Transfer Agents.
“Networking” of a single investor’s account or position potentially gives Mutual Fund Transfer
Agents more transparency through to beneficial owners than is available to Operating Company
Transfer Agents, because the recordkeeping for such accounts is primarily kept on the Mutual
Fund Transfer Agent’s system. “Networking” is a service provided by NSSC by which Mutual
Fund Transfer Agents can also exchange general shareholder account data with intermediaries
such as brokers that provide sub-transfer agency services. 510 This service provides for different
levels of securityholder account networking between mutual funds and securities

509

See generally, ICI, Financial Intermediary Controls and Compliance Assessment Engagements (2015),
available at https://www.ici.org/pdf/ppr_15_ficca.pdf. The mutual fund industry has developed a
standardized framework, the Financial Intermediary Controls and Compliance Assessment Engagement
(FICCA), for intermediary oversight, where fund sponsors are seeking assurances on the effectiveness of
the intermediary’s control environment. The framework calls for the omnibus account recordkeeper to
engage an independent accounting firm to assess its internal controls related to specified activities the
intermediary performs for fund shareholder accounts. FICCA is performed under attestation standards
issued by the AICPA and the auditor report expresses an opinion on its evaluation of an intermediary’s
assertion that controls were suitably designed and operating effectively. The framework includes 17 areas
of focus, including document retention and recordkeeping, transaction processing, shareholder
communications, privacy protection and anti-money laundering. It is the understanding of the Commission
that FICCA engagements are voluntary and some intermediary reports may not provide an assessment on
all 17 areas of focus.

510

Data communicated via NSSC Networking may include: (i) shareholder elections regarding the settlement
of cash dividends and capital gains distributions (such as by check or direct deposit), (ii) reinvestment
elections, (iii) address changes, (iv) the financial adviser associated with the account, and (v) tax reporting
information. See Mutual Fund Transfer Agent Workbook, supra note 477, at 84.

intermediaries. 511 Networked accounts are in the name of the intermediary on the master
securityholder file but can represent both individual customers and omnibus accounts.
Nevertheless, Networking’s advantages are less utilized today as many beneficial owner
accounts are now held in omnibus accounts that may also be networked. Thus, due in part to the
increasing prominence of the omnibus account, Mutual Fund Transfer Agents’ ability to lookthrough to beneficial owners has decreased.
The use of breakpoints historically highlights some of the issues faced by Mutual Fund
Transfer Agents that are associated with recordkeeping and processing services provided by
intermediaries. 512 A 2003 joint report of the staffs of the Commission, NASD and NYSE, found
that “[t]he dramatic growth in the number of [mutual fund] families, share classes, and, to a
lesser extent, customer account types, has increased the complexity of applying breakpoints
appropriately.” 513 The Staff Report also noted that whereas “in the past, broker-dealers dealt
directly with mutual fund transfer agents and disclosed the customer’s identity to them, the
increasing prominence of omnibus account arrangements and sub-transfer agency services

511

Intermediary accounts can be networked at three levels (0, 3 and 4), providing different information
concerning underlying beneficial owners. In Level 3, the intermediary handles all aspects of the customer
relationship and the customer does not interact with the Mutual Fund Transfer Agent. In Level 4, the
Mutual Fund Transfer Agent handles all client communications, and customers as well as their
intermediary may interact with the Mutual Fund Transfer Agent. Level 0 refers to a bank trust networked
account that functions similar to a Level 3 account, and the term also is used when referencing nonnetworked accounts.

512

Some mutual funds that charge front-end sales loads will charge lower sales loads for larger investments
(i.e., “breakpoints). For addition information on breakpoints, see Final Rule: Disclosure of Breakpoint
Discounts by Mutual Fund, Exchange Act Release No. 49817 (June 7, 2004), 69 FR 33262 (June 14, 2004).

provided to these accounts by intermediaries such as brokers had made the tasks related to the
application of breakpoints more challenging.” 514
Finally, the Commission understands that there has been a movement to omnibus subaccounting arrangements over the years for mutual fund shareholders 515 and that this movement
has resulted in a fundamental shift in the roles and responsibilities of traditional shareholder
servicing and recordkeeping. 516 The Commission is examining the issues or concerns that may
arise in connection with the lack of visibility that issuers and transfer agents acting on their
behalf may have regarding the records maintained by intermediaries for their customers who are
beneficial owners of mutual funds that are being serviced through omnibus and sub-accounting
arrangements.

The first Commission transfer agent rules were adopted in 1977. See generally, supra Section IV.A. The
advent of ETFs occurred more than a decade later. For examples of some of the earliest ETFs authorized
under Commission exemptive orders, see, e.g., SPDR Trust, Series 1, Investment Company Act Release
No. 18959 (Sept. 17, 1992) (notice), 19055 (Oct. 26, 1992) (order); Diamonds Trust, Investment Company

Commission believes it is appropriate to examine the regulation of transfer agents who provide
services to registered investment companies.
In particular, the Commission seeks comment regarding the regulation of transfer agents
to registered investment companies based on the unique trading, market, asset class, and other
relevant characteristics of the registered investment companies they service. Some of the issues
posed by these unique characteristics of these registered investment companies are illustrated by
the potentially different treatment of UITs and closed-end funds with respect to the Rule 17Ad4(a) exemptions, despite the many similarities that have existed historically among the secondary
market trading characteristics of UITs and closed-end funds. Closed-end funds typically trade in
a secondary market and often list on a national securities exchange for trading. By definition
under Section 5 of the Investment Company Act, the securities of closed-end funds are not
redeemable (i.e., the investor does not have a right to require the fund to redeem the investor’s
shares in exchange for a proportionate share of the fund’s underlying asset or cash equivalent
thereof). 519 As a result, transfer agents servicing closed-end funds do not qualify for the Rule
17Ad-4(a) exemption, with respect to closed-end funds. 520 In contrast, transfer agents servicing
UITs qualify for the exemption because UIT units are redeemable. 521 Yet, although UIT units

519

While a closed-end fund investor may not have the right to require the fund to redeem the investor’s shares,
in some cases, a closed-end fund may elect to purchase shares from its investors if they wish to sell their
shares. See also Investment Company Act Rules 23c-1 through 23c-3, 17 CFR 270.23c-1 through 23c-3.

are redeemable, because UITs are static trusts, redemptions of the UIT would require the UIT to
dilute the corpus of the trust in order to meet redemption requests (whether paid out by the UIT
in cash or met by distributions by the UIT of in-kind assets of the UIT). Therefore, just like
closed-end funds, in order to provide liquidity to selling shareholders, historically UITs
commonly have been traded in a secondary market, typically made up of broker-dealers, but
UITs typically do not list their shares on a national securities exchange for trading as closed-end
funds often do. 522 Thus, UITs and closed-end funds are treated differently for purposes of Rule
17Ad-4, despite historically having similar trading characteristics. 523
The Commission also seeks comment with respect to the Rule 17Ad-4(a) exemptions. As
discussed above, although Mutual Fund Transfer Agents provide many of the same
recordkeeping, transfer, account maintenance, and related services that Operating Company
Transfer Agents provide, under Rule 17Ad-4(a) they are exempt from some of the turnaround,
processing, performance, and recordkeeping requirements that make up the foundation of the

fund variable annuity and variable life insurance products, broker-dealers have historically maintained a
secondary market in UIT units. At present, based on Commission staff analysis of data as of December
2014, the Commission understands that approximately 75% of the assets held in UITs serve as separate
account vehicles that are used to fund variable annuity and variable life insurance products, and the
sponsors of these UITs do not typically maintain a secondary market in UIT units. See Open-End Fund

transfer agent rules. 524 One of the primary justifications for the Rule 17Ad-4(a) exemption was
that at the time of adoption most equity securities at that time were issued in certificated form,
while most mutual fund shares were uncertificated. 525 Thus, the Commission viewed the
“redemption of fund shares” as being “significantly different from the transfer of ownership of
stocks and bonds on the issuer’s records.” 526 However, today most equity securities are either
immobilized at DTC or completely dematerialized and issued in book-entry form, potentially
making the processing of securities issued by mutual funds and equity securities issued by
operating companies more alike than different and raising the question of whether the
Commission should consider amending or eliminating the Rule 17Ad-4 exemption.
Based on these and the other issues and developments discussed in this section and
throughout this release, the Commission believes it is appropriate to consider whether new or
amended rules governing transfer agents’ services and activities with respect to mutual funds and
other registered investment companies could be appropriate. Accordingly, the Commission
seeks comment on the following:
101.

What are the similarities and differences among transfer agents that service equity
securities, debt securities, and registered investment company securities? Please
explain.

524

As noted above, Rule 17Ad-4(a) creates an exemption from Rules 17Ad-2, 17Ad-3, and 17Ad-6(a)(1)-(7)
and (11) for interests in limited partnerships, DRIPs, and redeemable securities issued by investment
companies registered under Section 8 of the Investment Company Act. See supra Section IV.A.2 for
additional information regarding Rule 17Ad-4.

525

See supra Section IV.A.2.

526

Rule 17Ad-1 through 17Ad-7 Adopting Release, supra note 145, at 32408; see also id. at n.13 (“[t]he
amount of certificated fund shares is relatively small, and the amount of transfer agent activity in
connection with transferring ownership of certificated shares represents a very small part of a transfer
agent’s activity with regard to an open-end investment company.”).

Page 183 of 208

102.

Do transfer agents face different risks and challenges depending on the industry
segment or asset class they service? Does the level of complexity associated with
transaction processing by Mutual Fund Transfer Agents create risks or challenges
the Commission should consider addressing? Why or why not? Please explain.

103.

Should the Commission address specific issues related to Mutual Fund Transfer
Agents and transfer agents that service other registered investment companies?
Should the Commission, in regulating transfer agents to registered investment
companies, take into account the trading, market, asset class, or other
characteristics of the securities or issuers being serviced? What other factors, if
any, should be considered and why? Alternatively, should the Commission
regulate all transfer agents uniformly, regardless of the industry segment or asset
class they service? Why or why not? What data should the Commission consider
in making that determination? Please explain.

104.

Should the Commission impose additional recordkeeping and disaster recovery
requirements for Mutual Fund Transfer Agents? Why or why not?

105.

Should the Commission require that transfer agents provide more detailed
information on Form TA-2 about the type of issuers they are servicing and the
types of work they are performing for those issuers? Why or why not? For
example, should Form TA-2 include information regarding whether a transfer
agent is servicing investment companies or pension plans? Why or why not?
Would this information be helpful to issuers who seek specific skills or
experience from their transfer agent? Should Form TA-2 require the disclosure of
the name of each issuer serviced during the reporting period? Why or why not?
What would be the benefits, costs, or burdens associated with any such
requirements? Are there already freely available sources for this information?
Please provide empirical data, if any.

106.

As noted, transfer agent services for interests in limited partnerships, DRIPS, and
redeemable securities of registered investment companies are exempt from certain
turnaround rules under Rule 17Ad-4(a). In light of the expanded role of transfer
agents in these areas, should the Commission eliminate these exemptions? If so,
what costs, burdens, or benefits would accrue to investors, issuers, or the transfer
agent industry? If these exemptions are not eliminated, should the Commission
add other book-entry forms of ownership to the list of exemptions, including
direct registration system positions, direct purchase plan positions, and employee
purchase plans? Why or why not?

107.

Are limited partnerships traded today in greater volumes than they were in 1977?
Please provide empirical data. If so, do commenters believe the Commission
should consider this as a potential basis for eliminating the exemption for transfer
agents to limited partnerships in Rule 17Ad-4(a)? Why or why not?

Page 184 of 208

108.

In light of increased dematerialization, do commenters believe transfer agent
processing of DRIP transactions today is largely similar to the processing of
equity and debt securities? Why or why not? If so, do commenters believe the
Commission should consider this as a potential basis for eliminating the
exemption for transfer agents to DRIPs in Rule 17Ad-4(a)? Why or why not?

109.

Transfer agents that service UITs are currently exempt under Rule 17Ad-4(a), but
transfer agents that service closed-end funds are not. Should the Commission
continue this distinction? Should the Commission apply transfer agent rules to
transfer agents that service UITs in the same manner as the rules apply to transfer
agents that service closed-end funds on the basis of historical similarities in the
secondary market trading of both types of funds? Why or why not? Please
explain.

110.

Should the Commission amend the current transfer agent rules to explicitly
address transfer agents for ETFs? Why or why not? How do transfer agent
functions in connection with ETFs differ, if at all, from services transfer agents
provide to other types of investment companies? Are there any particular issues
unique to transfer agent service of ETFs that raise risks not present with respect to
other types of investment companies? Please explain. If Rule 17Ad-4(a) is
retained by the Commission in some form and is not proposed to be eliminated,
should the Commission amend Rule 17Ad-4(a) to specify explicitly the
applicability of its exemption to transfer agents to ETFs? If so, should transfer
agents to ETFs be able to avail themselves of the exemption or should the
exemption not apply to transfer agents to ETFs similar to the way in which the
exemption today does not apply to transfer agents to closed-end funds, which in
some cases are traded on national securities exchanges as are ETFs? Why or why
not?

111.

How are Mutual Fund Transfer Agents compensated today? Do any aspects of
the structure or terms of their compensation raise regulatory concerns? Do
Mutual Fund Transfer Agent fees based upon the fund’s net assets create any
conflicts of interest? Why or why not? If so, are there alternative fee structures
that would not create conflicts of interest? Do Mutual Fund Transfer Agents
provide fee rebates to issuers and, if so, do these raise any issues of regulatory
concern? Do the internal and hybrid transfer agent models discussed above raise
any special regulatory concerns? Why or why not? Please explain.

112.

Should the Commission adjust its regulatory oversight of Mutual Fund Transfer
Agents and, if so, how? Should any aspects of the Commission’s regulatory
regime for registered clearing agencies, including those that act as central
securities depositories, apply to Mutual Fund Transfer Agents? Why or why not?

113.

Given the increasing volume of transactions and activities facilitated through
NSCC as the central clearance and settlement utility for mutual funds and
intermediaries, what issues or concerns, if any, should the Commission consider
Page 185 of 208

with respect to the various activities conducted through NSCC for mutual fund
investors? Please describe.
114.

How often do Mutual Fund Transfer Agents serve as fund administrators for the
same mutual fund? Does this dual role create conflicts of interest for either the
mutual fund or the Mutual Fund Transfer Agent? Does this dual role raise other
concerns? If so, please describe.

115.

What ancillary information or systems do Mutual Fund Transfer Agents or
intermediaries rely on to ensure accurate processing and recordkeeping of mutual
fund shares (e.g., master security/CUSIP databases, systems for tracking the age
of fund shares for fee processing, cost basis systems for tax reporting)? Should
the recordkeeping rules be modified or expanded to address such records? Please
explain.

116.

Transfer agents currently engage in the processing of “as of” transactions, or
transactions which correct errors in the purchase or sale of mutual fund shares.
What, if anything, differentiates, the “as of” transactions from an initial purchase
or sale? Should the Commission specifically address “as of” transactions in
transfer agent rules? Why or why not? Should the Commission adopt rules that
govern which party, the mutual fund issuer or the Mutual Fund Transfer Agent,
loses or retains profits resulting from processing errors when these errors are
corrected by later “as of” transactions?

117.

Mutual fund transfer agents facilitate the delivery of critical information (e.g.,
daily fund NAVs, dividend accrual information) to intermediaries for overnight
batch processing of beneficial owner transactions. What issues or concerns, if
any, should the Commission consider with respect to the timely delivery of such
information, and the impacts of potential processing delays and downstream
effects, including to investors? Please describe.

118.

Should the Commission require that the number of “as of” transactions be
reported by Mutual Fund Transfer Agents on Form TA-2? Why or why not? Are
greater numbers of “as of” transactions indicative of potential processing
problems at a Mutual Fund Transfer Agent, such as a turnaround backlog or
problems with accuracy? Why or why not? Do greater numbers of “as of”
transactions indicate potentially risky mutual fund trading practices that may
dilute the interests of long-term investors in the mutual fund? Why or why not?

119.

Does mutual funds’ use of intermediaries who act as sub-transfer agents introduce
new or additional risks to the prompt and accurate settlement of securities
transactions? If so, what are those risks, should the Commission consider
addressing those risks, and if so, how? Please explain.

120.

Should the Commission propose rules governing how Mutual Fund Transfer
Agents oversee sub-transfer agents to mutual funds? Why or why not? If so,
Page 186 of 208

what rules should the Commission consider? Why, and what would be the
benefits, costs, or other consequences of such rules? Please explain.
121.

What oversight functions, if any, do Mutual Fund Transfer Agents typically
perform for intermediaries performing sub-transfer agent or sub-accounting
services to beneficial owners of mutual fund shares? What are the types of initial
versus ongoing due diligence performed? What types of obstacles do Mutual
Fund Transfer Agents face in performing the oversight function?

122.

What problems, if any, are created by transfer agents’ lack of visibility into the
identity of beneficial owners and products serviced by intermediaries acting as
sub-transfer agents? Please describe. If appropriate, could these issues be
addressed solely by the Commission through revisions to the rules governing
transfer agents? Would other regulatory changes be necessary, such as changes to
the rules under the Investment Company Act or rules for broker-dealers under the
1934 Act (and 1933 Act)? Would other regulators also need to enact rule changes
(for example, banking regulators and the Department of Labor for retirement plan
recordkeepers) to assist with transparency?

D.

Crowdfunding

Pursuant to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act (“JOBS Act”), the
Commission adopted Regulation Crowdfunding on October 30, 2015. 527 These rules permit an
issuer to raise up to $1,000,000 in a crowdfunding offering that is not registered under the
Securities Act, subject to, among other things, certain caps on amounts individual investors may
invest. 528 Crowdfunding offerings are offerings that are conducted primarily over the internet

527

See Crowdfunding, Securities Act Release No. 9974 (Oct. 30, 2015), 80 FR 71388 (Nov. 16, 2015)
(“Crowdfunding Adopting Release”). In addition, pursuant to Section 401 of the JOBS Act, the
Commission adopted amendments to Regulation A in March 2015. These amendments included a
conditional exemption for securities issued in a Tier 2 offering under Regulation A from the mandatory
registration requirements of Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. One of the conditions of the exemption is
that the issuer “[h]as engaged a transfer agent registered pursuant to Section 17A(c) of the Act to perform
the function of a transfer agent with respect to…securities” issued in a Tier 2 offering pursuant to
Regulation A. Amendments for Small and Additional Issues Exemptions under the Securities Act

See Regulation Crowdfunding Rule 100(a); Crowdfunding Adopting Release, supra note 527, at 71389.

Page 187 of 208

through registered brokers or a new class of intermediaries, called “funding portals.” The JOBS
Act and Regulation Crowdfunding contain provisions that relate directly to transfer agents.
First, Regulation Crowdfunding created an exemption from the record holder count under
Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act provided that certain conditions are met. One of these
conditions is that “the issuer… has engaged the services of a transfer agent registered with the
Commission pursuant to Section 17A of the Exchange Act.” 529
Second, under the JOBS Act and new Rule 501 of Regulation Crowdfunding, securities
issued in crowdfunding offerings are subject to restrictions on resale for a period of one year,
with the exception that they may be resold to other investors under specific conditions prior to
the expiration of the holding period. 530 Regulation Crowdfunding does not mandate the use of a
restrictive legend on crowdfunding securities certificates or book-entry security positions, but it
does require the placement of a legend in the offering statement used in the offering. 531 Because
of their experience in handling restricted securities, transfer agents retained by issuers in
connection with crowdfunding offerings may be asked to track securities that were issued in

529

The other conditions are that the issuer is current in its ongoing annual reports required pursuant to Rule
202 of Regulation Crowdfunding and has total assets as of the end of its last fiscal year not in excess of $25
million. See Crowdfunding Adopting Release, supra note 527, at 330, 662.

530

Securities Act Section 4A(e) provides that “Securities issued pursuant to a transaction described in section
4(6) may not be transferred by the purchaser of such securities during the 1-year period beginning on the
date of purchase, unless such securities are transferred” under certain specified conditions. Rule 501(a) of
Regulation Crowdfunding provides “Securities issued in a transaction exempt from registration pursuant to
section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act . . . and in accordance with section 4A of the Securities Act . . . and this
part may not be transferred by any purchaser of such securities during the one-year period beginning when
the securities were issued in a transaction exempt from registration pursuant to section 4(a)(6) of the
Securities Act . . . unless such securities are transferred” under certain specified conditions, including that
the transfer is to the original issuer, to an accredited investor, is part of a registered offering, or to a family
member.

Release, supra note 527, at 68-69.

crowdfunding offerings and handle issues related to the restrictions on transfer and exemptions
thereto.
Third, Rule 301(b) of Regulation Crowdfunding requires intermediaries to have a
“reasonable basis” for believing that an issuer has established means to keep accurate records of
the holders of the securities it would offer and sell through the intermediary’s platform. 532
Intermediaries may rely on the representations of the issuer concerning its means of
recordkeeping unless the intermediary has reason to question the reliability of those
representations. 533 Rule 301(b), however, also provides a safe harbor for compliance for those
issuers that use a registered transfer agent. 534
As a result of these new provisions, transfer agents are likely to be involved in at least
some crowdfunding offerings. Accordingly, the Commission seeks comment on the following:
123.

What services, if any, do commenters anticipate transfer agents providing for
crowdfunding issuers? How do commenters anticipate transfer agents will
comply with their recordkeeping, safeguarding, and other requirements in the
context of crowdfunding securities? Does the entry of transfer agents into the
crowdfunding space pose new or additional risks for the prompt and accurate
settlement of securities transactions? What are these risks, should the
Commission address them, and, if so, how?

124.

Transfer agents have traditionally assessed fees on a per shareholder basis. Do
commenters believe transfer agents are likely to impose a per shareholder fee in
connection with crowdfunding issuances? If so, is a per-shareholder fee
appropriate? If not, what other kinds of fees are likely to be charged, and would
they be appropriate?

Administration of Issuer Plans

Many transfer agents provide transfer, recordkeeping, administrative, and other services
related to certain types of issuer-sponsored plans that provide incentives to the issuer or
securityholders in the form of reduced fees and commissions, as well as other benefits. These
plans include DRIPs, DSPPs, 535 employee stock purchase plans (“ESPPs”), 536 equity-based
incentive compensation plans, 537 odd lot programs, 538 and subscription rights programs
(collectively, “Issuer Plans”). 539 Many transfer agents also help administer employer-sponsored
retirement plans (“Retirement Plans).” The specific services provided will vary depending on
the nature of the plan or mutual fund and the agreement between the issuer and agent, but many
are similar and can be thought of broadly as “Plan Administration” 540 services. Depending on
the transfer agent and the specific services provided, some of these activities may raise brokerdealer registration issues. This section discusses these and other issues associated with transfer

535

DSPPs allow individuals to purchase stock directly from the issuer or its transfer agent, again without going
through a broker. Unlike DRIPs, investors do not need to be existing securityholders to participate in
DSPPs.

536

ESPPs allow employees to invest in their employer’s securities by purchasing shares directly from the
employer (issuer) or its transfer agent, frequently at a discount to the market price.

537

Equity-based incentive compensation plans for example include plans regarding stock options, restricted
stock units, and stock appreciation rights.

538

Odd-lot program are used by issuers to purchase shares of their own stock back from owners of less than
100 shares (a 100 share block is considered to be a “round lot”), which may reduce the issuer’s transfer
agent and other fees by reducing the number of registered stockholders and/or allow small investors to sell
their stock without a broker. The Commission staff has provided no-action relief to a transfer agent in
connection with its participation in an odd-lot program and charging of fees to investors (that were
estimated to be lower than standard broker commissions) without requiring registration of the transfer agent
as a broker-dealer. See American Transtech Inc., SEC Staff No-Action Letter (Sept. 22, 1985).

539

Subscription rights programs allow existing stockholders to avoid dilution of their percentage ownership by
purchasing enough shares in the issuance to retain at least the same level of percentage ownership.

540

“Plan Administration” and “Administration,” as used in this release are not terms of art with a fixed
definition. We use them broadly as simplified shorthand to refer to some of the services discussed herein.

Page 190 of 208

agents’ Plan Administration activities and seeks comment regarding possible regulatory actions
regarding those issues.
1.

Third Party Administrators

The majority of Plan Administrators that provide services for Retirement Plans (and some
Issuer Plans and mutual funds) do not perform statutory transfer agent functions,541 and therefore
may not be required to register as a transfer agent with the Commission or other ARA. Because
they are generally hired by the Retirement Plan or other plans rather than the issuer, in this
context, Plan Administrators may be referred to as Third-Party Administrators (“TPAs”).542 It is
the Commission staff’s understanding that the majority of TPAs are not registered as transfer
agents, although some do so voluntarily.
One of the TPA’s main responsibilities is acting as an intermediary between benefit plan
participants and the plan. For example, TPAs provide various services when enrolling new
employees in a company’s benefit plan, including recording and processing their enrollment and
collecting information about their funding and investing preferences (e.g., fund allocations).
TPAs use this information to generate payroll deduction instructions and transmit these
instructions to the participant’s payroll or human resources department for processing.
TPAs continue to act as intermediaries between the benefit plan participants and plans
after participants enroll in the plan. For example, if participants wish to transfer or reallocate
mutual funds within their plan, they submit their request to the TPA, which will process and

541

See supra note 139 and Section IV.A for a description of the specific activities which require registration as
a transfer agent under the Exchange Act.

542

The term “TPA” is used here to refer generally to a broad category of “administrators” who provide the
types of services described herein.

Page 191 of 208

record these requests and provide the transactional details to the plan trustee or investment
manager. Similarly, when participants request a payment, the TPA may send the transaction
details to the NSCC, plan trustee, and investment manager, and provide payment instructions to
the mutual fund and Mutual Fund Transfer Agent. In addition to processing transactions, TPAs
may provide participants with customer service support, activity statements, and other
communications.
TPAs may also provide sub-transfer agent services for plans that offer, as investment
options of the plan, investment in the shares of mutual funds. 543 In this arrangement, TPAs take
orders from investors and perform record consolidation services as sub-transfer agents to the
plan. Instead of submitting to mutual funds (and their Mutual Fund Transfer Agents) hundreds
or thousands of individual purchase and redemption orders each day in the shares of those
mutual funds that have been submitted to the plan (and its TPA) by individual plan participants,
TPAs may aggregate and, in some instances, net orders on behalf of the plan to be submitted to a
mutual fund. 544 Orders are aggregated by adding all of the purchase and redemption orders for a
particular mutual fund and submitting the total purchase order and the total redemption order to
the mutual fund.
Once aggregated, TPAs may go a step further and create a single net order by offsetting
the purchase and redemption orders against each other. These services allow TPAs to
complement the administrative and recordkeeping services they already provide to plans and

543

For additional discussion of sub-transfer agent services, see supra Section VII.B

544

See, e.g., comment letters to Investment Company Act Release No. 26288 (Dec. 11, 2003), 68 FR 70388,

possibly earn additional fees from mutual fund complexes. They also reduce the amount of
transactions that mutual fund complexes (and their Mutual Fund Transfer Agents) need to
process. Under this arrangement, the mutual fund often does not know the identity of the plan
participants since TPAs, not the mutual funds, are taking the orders directly from the plan
participants and submitting orders to the mutual funds on behalf of and generally in the name of
the plan. 545 In these situations, the Mutual Fund Transfer Agent would know only the plan,
which is the legal owner of the shares of the mutual fund held by the plan for the benefit of its
participants.
2.

Issuer Plans

Issuers commonly appoint Plan Administrators to administer their Issuer Plans.
Depending on the type of security being serviced and the scope of the activities performed, Plan
Administrators may be required to register with the Commission or other ARA as a transfer
agent. 546 For simplicity and because of the pre-existing relationship, issuers may simply hire
their existing transfer agent.
Plan Administrators perform primarily four tasks for these plans. First, they handle
communications with investors, including their initial plan registration, 547 often by operating a
website that allows investors to sign up for and manage their account.

545

See supra note 506 and accompanying text for a discussion of Investment Company Act Rule 22c-2, the
provision of taxpayer identification numbers to assist mutual funds in complying with rules related to
“forward pricing,” and transfer agent services that assist mutual funds in complying with Rule 22c-2.

546

For additional discussion of transfer agent registration requirements, see supra Section IV.A.

547

Many DRIPs require investors to own at least one share registered in their name (as opposed to being held
in street name) before they will be allowed to participate in the DRIP.

Page 193 of 208

Second, they purchase company shares for the plan, 548 typically on the secondary market,
although purchases can also be made through negotiated transactions or from the company itself,
for example by using authorized but unissued shares of common stock or shares held in the
company’s treasury. 549 Some issuers offer investors who participate in their plans discounts on
the share price, but there is wide variation in how this is offered.
Third, Plan Administrators maintain custody of purchased shares on the participants’
behalf, 550 with the purchased shares typically being registered in the name of the transfer agent’s
nominee. This could lead to plan participants holding the issuer’s shares in two places: their
bank or brokerage firm for the original registered shares, and the Plan Administrator for shares
purchased through a plan. To address this, many Plan Administrators allow Plan participants to
deposit their original registered shares into the participant’s DRIP account for safekeeping at no
charge or for a modest fee. Once deposited with the transfer agent, the shares are treated the
same way as the other shares in the participant’s account.
Finally, Plan Administrators maintain Plan records and send regular account statements
and other communications to plan participants. These typically include quarterly account
statements and transactional statements after each cash investment, transfer, deposit, withdrawal,

548

When investors join a plan, they are typically required to sign a document authorizing the agent to make
purchases on their behalf.

549

Plan Administrators typically purchase shares on or around the dividend payment date, but they may spread
out large purchases made on the secondary market over a longer period of time to avoid affecting the share
price. When purchasing shares on the secondary markets, the share price is generally determined by
averaging the price of all shares purchased for that investment period; when purchased directly from the
company, it is based on an average of the high and low or the closing price for the stock as reported by a
specified source.

550

Paper certificates for shares of the company’s common stock purchased under the plans will generally not
be issued unless requested by the participant. Paper certificates are also issued when a participant no
longer wants to participate in the plan.

Page 194 of 208

or sale. These statements generally show cash dividends and optional cash payments received,
the number of shares purchased, the purchase price for the shares, the total number of shares held
for the participant, and an accumulation of the transactions for the calendar year to date. In
addition, Plan Administrators send plan participants the same communications that are sent to
every other securityholder of the company’s common stock, including the company’s annual
report, annual meeting notices, proxy statements, and income tax information for reporting
dividends paid by the company.
3.

Potential Broker-Dealer Registration Issues

As described above, Plan Administrators, TPAs, and Mutual Fund Transfer Agents all
provide some level of transaction execution and order routing services. The specific services
may vary depending on the plan or firm, but in general, administrators that provide transaction
execution services will handle customer funds and securities and may provide some level of
netting, which is the process of offsetting expected deliveries and payments against expected
receipts in order to reduce the amount of cash and securities to be moved. For example, some
administrators for employer-sponsored retirement plans offset purchase and sale transactions in
the same target mutual fund by different participants in the plan and submit a net order to the
transfer agent of the mutual fund. Netting is a function commonly performed by clearing
agencies and may also be performed by broker-dealers for customers holding in street name, but
is not among the core functions enumerated in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(25) performed by
registered transfer agents. Hence, netting and other execution services may not themselves
implicate transfer agent requirements, but nonetheless may trigger broker-dealer regulatory
requirements.

Page 195 of 208

The Exchange Act defines a “broker” as “any person engaged in the business of effecting
transactions in securities for the account of others” 551 and requires non-exempt brokers to
register with the Commission. 552 “Effecting securities transactions” includes, among other
things, identifying potential purchasers of securities, soliciting securities transactions, routing or
matching orders, handling customer funds or securities, and preparing and sending transaction
confirmations (other than on behalf of a broker-dealer that executes the trades). 553 Receiving
transaction-based compensation may also indicate that a person is effecting securities
transactions for the account of other. 554
The Commission has brought enforcement actions against transfer agents operating as
broker-dealers without registering as such with the Commission. For example, the Commission
found that a transfer agent was acting as an unregistered broker-dealer in violation of Exchange
Act Section 15(a) when it, among other things: opened accounts for individual retirement
account (“IRA”) customers; established an interest bearing depository account to receive IRA
customer monies; had a power of attorney to withdraw, deposit and transfer IRA customer funds
held by custodial banks, and to purchase assets in the name of the custodian; charged IRA
customers a transaction fee when IRA customers made a purchase or sale of securities through a

broker-dealer or issuer; prepared periodic account statements for IRA customers; and physically
held certain IRA customers’ securities in its office vault. 555 Furthermore, a transfer agent that
effects securities transactions for investors in connection with administering certain types of
Issuer Plans may be engaging in broker activity. 556
The Commission staff has stated its view that it will not recommend enforcement action
where a TPA performs some “clerical and ministerial” activities without registering as a broker,
subject to the conditions that, among things, the TPA refrain from netting or matching orders. 557
This guidance is consistent with long-standing views on what constitutes broker activity. 558 The
Commission also notes that its staff has taken the position in connection with no-action relief
that, depending on the facts and circumstances, the performance of some or all of the
administrative activities discussed in this section are also performed by entities that have
registered with the Commission as brokers for such purposes. 559 Transfer agents that solicit

Discussion and Request for Comment

The Commission is generally requesting comment on whether new rules may be
appropriate to bring greater clarity, consistency, and regulatory certainty to Plan Administration
and similar activities by entities registered with the Commission solely as transfer agents as well
as by entities that may not be registered with the Commission in any capacity. 561 Specifically,
the Commission requests comment on the following:
125.

Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-9(m) describes various transfer agent functions that are
broader than the five statutory functions defined in Exchange Act Section
3(a)(25). Likewise, as discussed in this and other sections, modern transfer agents
perform a wide array of services and functions that do not fall within the confines
of Section 3(a)(25) and are not otherwise identified or contemplated in the
existing transfer agent rules. Should the Commission update the transfer agent
rules to address additional transfer agent services and functions that do not fall
within the confines of Section 3(a)(25)? Why or why not?

126.

Should the Commission impose supervisory obligations on entities engaged in
transfer agent activities, such as transfer agents and plan administrators, such as
requiring that employees be properly trained, comply with continuing education
requirements, and adhere to regulations and company policies? Why or why not?

127.

Definitions in Rules 17Ad-1 and 17Ad-9 do not explicitly apply to all types of
transactions and functions related to Issuer Plans, investment company securities,

560

See, e.g., SEC v. Deyon, 977 F. Supp. 510 (D. Me. Aug. 27, 1997) (two unregistered defendants violated
Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act by, among other things, soliciting investors by phone and in person);
SEC v. Century Inv. Transfer Corp., Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) 93,232 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 5, 1971) (defendant
was engaged in the broker-dealer business by, among other things, advertising in the Wall Street Journal to
solicit customers); SEC v. Corporate Relations Group, Inc., 2003 WL 25570113 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 28, 2003)
(defendant acted as an unregistered broker when it actively sought investors, recommended securities to
investors through registered representatives, and provided its broker relations executives with transactionbased compensation for stock sales).

561

As noted, depending on the type of securities being administered and the scope of administration services
being performed, an entity may or may not be required to register with the Commission in the capacity of a
transfer agent and/or a broker-dealer.

Page 198 of 208

restricted securities, and corporate actions, or to all transactions relating to bookentry activity and DRS transactions. For example, the rule does not specify that
“credit” and “debit” include Issuer Plan transactions and book-entry accounts as
well as investment company securities transactions. Does the lack of specificity
cause difficulties in providing services relating to those areas not specifically
enumerated? Why or why not?
128.

Does Rule 17Ad-2 create uncertainty concerning the applicability of the rule to
activities related to Issuer Plans, investment company securities, restricted
securities, and corporate actions? If there is such uncertainty, how does it impact
transfer agents’ functionality? Are issuers concerned about impacts on service
levels? If so, please describe.

129.

The recordkeeping requirements in Rule 17Ad-6 do not specifically include
activities associated with investment company securities, Issuer Plans, DRS
transactions, paying agent activities, or corporate actions. Are transfer agents
applying the rule’s recordkeeping requirements to these activities? If not, what
would be the additional cost, benefits and/or burdens, if any, in doing so? Please
describe.

130.

Rule 17Ad-10 does not specifically address activities performed by many transfer
agents, such as Plan Administration, paying agent activities, or corporate action
recordkeeping. Does this create any obstacles to complying with the rule, such as
by creating confusion or uncertainty? Why or why not? Please explain.

131.

There are no Commission regulations addressing plan enrollment practices, such
as negative consents or automatic enrollments. What risks, if any, arise from
these enrollment methods? Should the Commission address any such risks? Why
or why not? If, so how?

132.

To ensure that transfer agents make and keep comprehensive records relating to
all of their activities, should the Commission address records related to Issuer
Plan and mutual fund activities? Why or why not? For example, should transfer
agents be required to make and maintain records of orders for the purchase or sale
of Plan or mutual fund securities in a manner similar to that required of brokerdealers? Why or why not? Should they be required to create and maintain
records relating to reconciliations with custodial accounts and order-submitting
entities? Should they be required to make and maintain specific records relating
to plan participants? Why or why not? Please explain and provide supporting
evidence regarding any potential effects. To the extent that any data, records,
and/or other information that such rules might require to be made and preserved
are prepared and maintained by an outside party on the transfer agent’s behalf,
should the Commission require that the outside entity file a signed, written
undertaking with the Commission to the effect that such records are the property
of the transfer agent and will be surrendered promptly on request of the transfer
agent and subject to examination by the Commission or other ARA? Why or why
Page 199 of 208

not? Please explain and provide supporting evidence regarding any potential
effects.
133.

Should the Commission amend the rules so that transfer agents performing
specific activities are exempt from broker-dealer registration only if they are (i)
registered with the Commission as a transfer agent, (ii) limit their activities to
those specified in the general rule, and/or (iii) agree to abide by certain other
conditions designed to protect investors and limit the risks associated with those
activities? Why or why not? Should the Commission require broker-dealer
registration for any activities beyond what is permitted or conducted by an entity
that is not registered with the Commission as a transfer agent under such an
exemption? Why or why not? Please explain and provide supporting evidence
regarding any potential effects.

134.

Do commenters have any concerns about TPAs who voluntarily register with the
Commission as transfer agents, but do not provide statutory transfer agent
services as defined by Exchange Act Section 3(a)(25)? Why or why not? Should
the Commission prohibit TPAs who do not perform statutory transfer agent
functions as defined by Exchange Act Section 3(a)(25) from voluntarily
registering with the Commission as transfer agents? Alternatively, should the
Commission deny transfer agent registration applications or revoke registrations
of TPAs that do not provide statutory transfer agent services as defined by
Exchange Act Section 3(a)(25)? Why or why not? Please explain and provide
supporting evidence regarding any potential effects.

135.

Do commenters have any concerns regarding the activities or business practices
of TPAs that are not registered with any federal financial regulator? If so, what
actions, if any, should the Commission consider taking to address these concerns?
Please explain and provide supporting evidence regarding any potential effects.

136.

What risks, if any, do commenters believe are posed by the enrollment and
purchase and sale activities of transfer agents with respect to Issuer Plans and
registered investment companies? What, if anything, should the Commission do
to address such risks and why? For example, would rules focusing on risk
management address any risks associated with transfer agents’ current role in the
purchase and sale of securities? Please explain and provide supporting evidence
regarding any potential effects. Are there additional Issuer Plan activities or
services provided by transfer agents, Plan Administrators, or other entities that are
not described in the release? If so, what are they?

137.

Should the Commission conditionally exempt from broker-dealer registration
transfer agents that effect orders to purchase or sell securities in connection with
their servicing of Issuer Plans? If so, what conditions, if any, should apply to that
exemption? Should they be subject to net capital or customer protection
requirements to guard against the risks of mishandling investors’ funds or
securities? What regulations, if any, should the Commission propose to safeguard
Page 200 of 208

investor privacy? Does the Issuer Plan business necessitate different books and
recordkeeping requirements? If so, how should the Commission amend its books
and recordkeeping requirements? Should the Commission’s rules require the
personnel of Issuer Plan transfer agents who interact with Issuer Plan investors,
such as call center representatives, to be subject to registration, licensing, training,
or continuing education requirements? Should transfer agents for Issuer Plans be
permitted to net customer buy and sell orders? Why or why not, and if so, under
what conditions? Should transfer agents be required to hold the funds of Issuer
Plan securities in a bank account for the exclusive benefit of investors? Why or
why not? Under what circumstances should a transfer agent or its personnel be
disqualified from effecting transactions on behalf of Issuer Plans? Should transfer
agents be permitted to receive payment for order flow in connection with Issuer
Plan transactions? Why or why not? What rules might help to ensure the
integrity of the master securityholder file in cases where a transfer agent servicing
the Issuer Plan is not the recordkeeping transfer agent?
138.

What fees are being charged today by transfer agents directly to investors or
indirectly to investors (such as through transaction fees in connection with Plan
Administration activities that are comparable to broker commissions or dealer
markups)? Should the Commission require transfer agents to clearly and
concisely disclose fees charged to the investor? Do fees charged to investors by
transfer agents or by sub-transfer agents encourage or deter investor decisions
regarding their form of ownership (e.g. the investor decision to hold in DRS, the
investor decision to request a certificate, or the investor decision to hold in
registered versus street name)? If these fees influence investor decision-making,
is the aggregate effect on this influence good or bad for: (i) the protection of
investors and (ii) continued improvement in the promptness and efficiency of the
National C&S System? What is the available evidence?

139.

Investors who transact with or through a broker-dealer receive confirmations
pursuant to Rule 10b-10. However, investors holding securities positions directly
with a transfer agent in DRS, in an Issuer Plan or other program administered by a
transfer agent, or in a mutual fund that attracts self-directed investors, do not
always receive comparable information from the transfer agent. Should the
Commission require transfer agents to provide written communication to a
securityholder with details about a transaction within a set time period? Why or
why not? Are there other approaches the Commission could consider to ensure
that investors are informed about their transactions on a timely basis? If so,
please describe.

140.

While transfer agents may be authorized by an issuer to assist with the enrollment
process for plan participants, it may not be clear whether investors have initiated
the enrollment or whether the transfer agent solicited the transaction. Similarly,
while transfer agents may assist with securityholder inquiries, it may not be clear
whether agents in so doing may, inadvertently or not, solicit securityholders for
purchase or sale activities. What controls, if any, do transfer agents put in place
Page 201 of 208

to prevent solicitation? Do commenters believe those controls are effective?
Why or why not? Should the Commission impose additional or different
controls? Why or why not? Please explain.
F.

Outsourcing Activities and Non-Qualifying Securities Serviced by a Registered
Transfer Agent

As noted, the transfer agent rules established by the Commission are designed not only to
ensure that transfer agents meet prescribed performance standards for their core recordkeeping
and transfer activities, but to ensure they are regulated appropriately in the context of the
National C&S System 562 and that any problems meeting these performance standards do not
negatively impact individual investors or the National C&S System as a whole. 563 Today, some
transfer agents maintain offices and provide services outside the United States, and almost all
transfer agents provide an array of services, including for non-Qualifying Securities. Other
transfer agents may outsource some of their activities or operations to outside entities. For
example, some registered transfer agents rely on outside entities to provide data hosting or
specific IT services, perform data entry, or provide call center services. While the Commission
believes the consistent application of the transfer agent rules to all activities of registered transfer
agents is critical to protect investors and promote the safe and efficient functioning of the
National C&S System, we also are mindful that applying the transfer agent rules uniformly to all

562

See Rule 17Ad-1 through 17Ad-7 Adopting Release, supra note 145 (noting the importance of avoiding
impediments to “the Commission’s efforts to provide necessary or appropriate regulations for transfer
agents in the broader context of the establishment of a national system for the prompt and accurate
clearance and settlement of securities transactions.”).

563

Id. (Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-3 prohibits transfer agents from taking on new or additional business in
certain circumstances where they fail to meet their performance standards over certain time periods, in part,
because “it is not in the public interest or consistent with the protection of investors for a transfer agent
which is unable to perform its current obligations in a timely manner to take on additional
responsibilities.”)

Page 202 of 208

securities serviced by those transfer agents could: (i) increase costs above those that would be
incurred if the transfer agent rules applied only to Qualifying Securities; (ii) create conflicts with
the laws of the other jurisdictions in which a transfer agent operates; 564 or (iii) impact transfer
agents in other ways.
Accordingly, the Commission seeks comment on the following:

564

141.

What activities do transfer agents outsource, domestically or foreign, and why?
Does the outsourcing of these activities present risks or raise other issues? What
is the empirical evidence? What regulations, if any, should the Commission
impose to address these risks? For example, should the Commission require
outsourcing arrangements to be memorialized in a written agreement detailing the
allocation of responsibilities? Why or why not? If such a written agreement were
required, should the Commission require some or all records associated with the
performance of the agreement to be considered records of the registered transfer
agent and therefore subject to inspection by the Commission? Why or why not?
Should outsourcing arrangements be disclosed in Form TA-2? Why or why not?
Should the Commission apply different standards or different rules to transfer
agents who use or engage in outsourcing activities? If so, what standards should
apply, and why? Please identify any tradeoffs, including any costs and benefits
that the Commission should consider. Please also provide supporting empirical
evidence, if available.

142.

Are there non-U.S. regulations governing transfer agents operating outside the
United States that commenters believe the Commission could use as a model for
similar regulations in the United States? If so, why, and how do these regulations
serve the public interest in the jurisdictions in which they apply? If the
Commission were to consider similar regulations, in what ways should such
regulations be tailored to operations in the U.S. securities markets? What
tradeoffs should the Commission consider in evaluating the alternatives?

143.

Should the Commission’s transfer agent rules apply with equal force to U.S. and
non-U.S. transfer agents (or non-U.S. subsidiaries of U.S.-based transfer agents)
that provide transfer-related services for Qualifying Securities? Why or why not?

144.

Should the Commission codify existing staff interpretations stating that registered
transfer agents that service at least one Qualifying Security must apply all of the

For example, the privacy laws of some foreign jurisdictions may not permit the fingerprinting required
under Rule 17f-1.

Page 203 of 208

transfer agent rules to all securities serviced by that transfer agent, including nonQualifying Securities? Alternatively, should the Commission provide exemptions
regarding non-Qualifying Securities from one or more or from all of the
Commission’s transfer agent rules? Why or why not? If so, what exemptions
would be appropriate, and why? How would any such exemptions protect
investor funds and securities, ensure the safe and efficient functioning of the
National C&S System, and ensure appropriate oversight by regulators of transfer
agents and the entities that perform services on their behalf?

565

145.

Are there technological, legal, policy, or other reasons why a registered transfer
agent would not be able to apply the transfer agent rules to all securities serviced
by the transfer agent? Why or why not? If so, should the Commission provide
exemptions to address such issues, and what should such exemptions provide?

146.

Do transfer agents typically have access to or control over records created or held
by sub-contractors? 565 If so, are those records part of the records that transfer
agents provide to the Commission in response to requests? Why or why not?

147.

Do other transfer agent activities, such as operating call centers, present investor
protection or other concerns? How are call center employees supervised? How
are call center employees trained on applicable federal securities law and legal
documents that may govern or affect the issuer, for example policies and
procedures of the issuer and, for certain types of issuers, prospectus limitations?
Are risks greater if these securityholder services are conducted by offshore call
centers?

148.

Should the Commission impose additional recordkeeping, processing, and transfer
rules on outside entities retained by transfer agents to address concerns that thirdparty firms may pose a risk to investors and the National C&S System? If so,
should those rules apply to foreign firms that are engaged in services for U.S.
issuers? Why or why not?

149.

As noted, both Reg SDR and Reg SBSR may permit, in certain circumstances,
substituted compliance for foreign participants and registrants. Should the
Commission take a similar approach to regulating non-U.S. transfer agents? Why
or why not?

Regarding sub-contractor relationships, see generally, Section VII.C.1.

Additional Request for Comment

We are also interested in more generalized concerns related to transfer agents and any
other issues that commenters may wish to address relating to transfer agents. For example, we
seek comment on how the role of transfer agents may continue to evolve, and what regulatory
challenges these changes may pose. Please be as specific as possible in your discussion and
analysis of any additional issues. In connection with comments, we also welcome comments that
respond to requests for comment or of their own accord, and/or suggest specific amendments or
new additions to the transfer agent rules including draft rule text. We also request commenters
to provide any specific, detailed data and information related to potential or actual costs and
benefits associated with any of the suggested reforms, changes, or amendments discussed
throughout this release. Accordingly, the Commission seeks comment on the following:
150.

Do the transfer agent rules accomplish the Commission’s regulatory objectives of
protecting investors, promoting the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement
of securities transactions, and evaluating transfer agents’ ability to perform their
functions properly? Why or why not? Please provide a full explanation.

151.

Do the current transfer agent rules adequately address the interests of issuers? If
not, in what ways do they not address issuers’ interests and should they? Why
and in what way?

152.

Do the current transfer agent rules adequately address the interests of other market
participants? If not, in what ways do they not address those interests and should
they? Why and in what way?

153.

Some of the original transfer agent rules established metrics-based performance
standards designed to measure the transfer and processing of paper certificates.
Given the prevalence of electronic transactions, do those metrics-based
performance standards adequately address transfer agents’ operational
capabilities, which now largely depend on systems and technology that did not
exist when the original rules were adopted in 1977? Should the Commission rely
on a different or additional approach to regulating transfer agents, such as a riskbased approach focused on the risks associated with specific activities or conduct?
Please provide a full explanation.

Page 205 of 208

154.

In what ways do the activities performed and services provided by transfer agents
differ depending on the type of issuer, asset class, product category, market
segment, or other factors the transfer agent is servicing? For example, are there
differences in activities, services, or other areas between issuers that act as their
own transfer agent and independent transfer agents? If so, what are those
differences? Do a transfer agent’s processes differ if the transfer agent is
servicing debt securities instead of equity securities? If a transfer agent primarily
services debt securities, do the transfer agent’s processes differ depending on the
specific type of debt security being serviced (e.g., corporate, asset-backed, etc.)?
Are there differences in services provided, compensation arrangements, or other
areas between or among different types of transfer agents? If so, what factors
influence or affect those differences? Do transfer agents tend to service one type
of issuer, asset class, or market segment to the exclusion of others? If so, what
factors influence that focus and why? Please explain.

155.

Do commenters believe that transfer agent servicing of debt securities raises
different issues or concerns than those raised by servicing of equity securities?
Do commenters believe there are specific risks or issues related to transfer agents’
servicing of debt issues that are not addressed by existing Commission transfer
agent rules? Are there differences in agreements that equity transfer agents enter
into with issuers as compared to transfer agency agreements between debt transfer
agents and issuers, including differences in services to be provided, methods of
compensation, or any other topics?

156.

Should the Commission propose different rules for different types of transfer
agents depending on the particular issuer type, asset class, or market segment
serviced by the transfer agent? Why or why not?

157.

What fees do transfer agents assess with respect to processing DRS instructions?
How and to whom are such fees assessed? Do commenters believe the
Commission should consider regulating such fees in some manner? If so, why
and how? Please explain.

158.

Do transfer agent fees vary, depending upon the asset class of the security
serviced by the transfer agent? If so, how do they vary? To what extent does
competition among transfer agents constrain such fees, and what is the evidence?
Should the Commission require that any such fees be fair and reasonable? Why
or why not? Please provide a full explanation.

159.

To what extent are co-transfer agents used in securities processing today? Should
the Commission amend its rules with respect to co-transfer agents?

160.

What, if any, are the problems in the marketplace today with respect to the role of
transfer agents and corporate actions? Should the Commission propose rules
governing transfer agent services provided in connection with corporate actions?
Why or why not? If so, which types of services provided in connection with
Page 206 of 208

corporate actions should the Commission consider regulating?
161.

Should the Commission propose rules requiring standardized corporate actions
processing as a method to facilitate communications among market
participants? Why or why not? If so, what are the primary market issues that
such a standardization program is likely to address? Would there be any market
issues that such a standardized program would not be able to address? Please
explain.

162.

What, if any, are the risks posed by transfer agents’ role when they serve as: (i)
tender agent; (ii) subscription agent; (iii) conversion agent; or (iv) escrow agent?
Do commenters believe rules governing transfer agent services provided in
connection with these services would be appropriate? Why or why not? If so,
what regulatory action should the Commission consider to address those concerns
and why?

163.

Do commenters believe there are any concerns that might arise from regulation of
the proxy tabulation process generally and the transfer agents’ role in the proxy
process in particular? If so, what regulatory action, if any, should the
Commission consider to address those concerns and why?

164.

Is the role that transfer agents play in the proxy process useful for efficient,
accurate, and timely communications between issuers and their securityholders?
In light of comments previously received by the Commission in connection with
its concept release concerning the proxy process, are there additional concerns
regarding consolidation in the market? If so, please describe any such concerns.

165.

In connection with considerations of transfer agents’ role within the National
C&S System, do commenters believe the creation of an SRO for transfer agents
would be useful or appropriate? Why or why not? If so, what should the scope of
the purview of such an SRO be, and what should the SRO be tasked with? Please
explain.

166.

Do commenters believe the introduction of certain alternatives to the current
central securities depository model, such as a modified transfer agent depository,
could be beneficial to issuers, securityholders, and/or the National C&S System?
Why or why not? Could it co-exist with the current central depository system?
Why or why not? What would such a modified depository entail or look like?

167.

Some observers have commented that current DTC requirements, such as those
related to DRS and FAST, operate as so-called de facto regulation of transfer

Page 207 of 208

agents by DTC. 566 Is this accurate? If so, do such DTC requirements create
inconsistencies and/or conflicts for transfer agents to comply with all rules and
requirements? Why or why not? If yes, please describe the inconsistencies
and/or conflicts. Should the Commission adopt any of DTC’s current
requirements or standards that apply to transfer agents who conduct business with
DTC as rules? Why or why not? If so, what requirements or standards should be
considered, and why?
168.

Should the Commission propose any other amendments to the transfer agent rules
that are not discussed above? If so, please describe what amendments should be
considered and why, including any information on the benefits, risks, and/or
burdens of any suggested approach.

169.

How might the transfer agent industry continue to evolve in the future, and what
challenges might that evolution pose for the regulatory structure? What
regulatory issues and other challenges are posed by the industry’s increasing
concentration and specialization? What does the decline in the number of
registered securityholders mean for the industry, and for the regulatory regime?
Do commenters believe that, as dematerialization progresses, the role of transfer
agents to operating companies will change? If so, will it converge with that of
Mutual Fund Transfer Agents? If so, what are the possible implications of this?

170.

Are there any other issues that commenters may wish to address relating to
transfer agents? Please provide a full explanation.

By the Commission.
