ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-15545
In the Matter of
CHINA RUITAI
INTERNATIONAL
HOLDINGS CO., LTD.,

ORDER INSTITUTING ADMINISTRATIVE
PROCEEDINGS AND NOTICE OF HEARING
PURSUANT TO SECTION 12(j) OF THE
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it necessary and
appropriate for the protection of investors that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby
are, instituted pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”),
against China Ruitai International Holdings Co., Ltd., (“China Ruitai” or “Respondent”).
II.
After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement alleges that:
A.

Respondent

1.
China Ruitai International Holdings Co., Ltd. (CIK No. 0000076348) is a
Delaware corporation located in Shandong in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) with a class
of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act.
China Ruitai has not filed any current or periodic reports since it filed its September 30, 2011 Form
10-Q on November 14, 2011. The common stock of China Ruitai (symbol “CRUI”) is quoted on
OTC Link operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. and formerly known as the Pink Sheets (“OTC
Link”).

B.

Illegal Activity and Delinquent Current and Periodic Filings

1.
Marcum Bernstein & Pinchuk LLP (“Marcum”), a New York Certified Public
Accounting firm with offices in the PRC was engaged as China Ruitai’s independent registered
public accounting firm and completed quarterly reviews for each of the first three quarters of 2011.
Marcum also performed audit procedures in preparation for filing China Ruitai’s December 31,
2011 Form 10-K.
2.
As part of the December 31, 2011 audit procedures, Marcum discovered activity in
possible violation of PRC law, in which China Ruitai used forged documents to obtain financing
from third-party banks. The conduct resulted in the mischaracterization of a material amount of
liabilities in China Ruitai’s public filings as related-party obligations, while the liabilities were
actually to unrelated third parties. Marcum reported the matter to China Ruitai’s board on May 21,
2012, pursuant to Section 10A(b)(1) of the Exchange Act, which requires a public company’s
auditor to inform management that it has information indicating an illegal act has or may have
occurred.
3.
China Ruitai failed to take remedial actions, so Marcum issued a notice to China
Ruitai pursuant to Section 10A(b)(2) of the Exchange Act. That notice indicated an illegal act had
occurred and that failure of the company to take remedial action would warrant resignation of
Marcum as China Ruitai’s independent public accountants. The notice further informed China
Ruitai that China Ruitai was required to notify the Commission no later than one business day after
it received Marcum’s report, pursuant to Section 10A(b)(3) of the Exchange Act.
4.
China Ruitai failed to report the matter to the Commission. On July 27, 2012,
Marcum issued notice pursuant to Section 10A(b)(3) of the Exchange Act to both China Ruitai and
the Commission. The notice contained Marcum’s immediate resignation from the audit
engagement. The letter further requested that the company file a Form 8-K disclosing Marcum’s
resignation, as required by Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Item 4.01 to Form 8-K. China
Ruitai did not file a Form 8-K regarding Marcum’s resignation.
5.
Since Marcum resigned as China Ruitai’s auditor, China Ruitai has failed to file its
required periodic reports. China Ruitai’s last filing was a Form NT 10-K, filed on March 30, 2012.
As a result, China Ruitai is delinquent with at least its December 31, 2011 Form 10-K, March 31,
2012 Form 10-Q, June 30, 2012 Form 10-Q, September 30, 2012 Form 10-Q, December 31, 2012
Form 10-K, March 31, 2013 Form 10-Q, and June 30, 2013 Form 10-Q.
6.
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and the rules promulgated thereunder require issuers of
securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 to file with the Commission current and
accurate information in current and periodic reports, even if the registration is voluntary under
Section 12(g). Specifically, Rule 13a-1 requires issuers to file annual reports, Rule 13a-11 requires
issuers to file current reports, and Rule 13a-13 requires issuers to file quarterly reports.
8.
As a result of the foregoing, Respondent failed to comply with Exchange Act
Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.

III.
In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission deems it
necessary and appropriate in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be instituted
to determine:
A.
Whether the allegations contained in Section II are true and, in connection
therewith, to afford Respondent an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations; and
B.
Whether it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to suspend
for a period not exceeding twelve months, or revoke the registration of each class of securities
registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act of the Respondent identified in Section II
hereof, and any successor under Exchange Act Rules 12b-2 or 12g-3, and any new corporate
names of Respondent.
IV.
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on the
questions set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a time and place to be fixed, and
before an Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 of
the Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.110].
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent shall file an Answer to the allegations
contained in this Order within ten (10) days after service of this Order, as provided by Rule 220(b)
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b)].
If Respondent fails to file the directed answer, or fail to appear at a hearing after being duly
notified, the Respondent, and any successor under Exchange Act Rules 12b-2 or 12g-3, and any
new corporate names of Respondent, may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be
determined against it upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be deemed to
be true as provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f), and 310 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice
[17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f), and 201.310].
This Order shall be served forthwith upon Respondent personally or by certified, registered
or Express Mail, or by other means permitted by the Commission’s Rules of Practice.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an initial
decision no later than 120 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2) of
the Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.360(a)(2)]. In the absence of an appropriate
waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission engaged in the performance of investigative or
prosecuting functions in this or any factually related proceeding will be permitted to participate or
advise in the decision of this matter, except as witness or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to
notice. Since this proceeding is not “rule making” within the meaning of Section 551 of the
3

Administrative Procedure Act, it is not deemed subject to the provisions of Section 553 delaying
the effective date of any final Commission action
By the Commission.
