David H. Disraeli,
Petitioner
v.
Securities and Exchange Commission,
Respondent

PETITION FOR REVIEW OF AN ORDER OF THE
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
BEFORE:

Garland, Griffith, and Kavanaugh, Circuit Judges
JUDGMENT

This petition for review of an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission
was considered on the briefs and appendices filed by the parties. See Fed. R. App. P.
34(a)(2); D.C. Cir. Rule 34(j). It is
ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Securities and Exchange Commission
order filed December 21, 2007, be affirmed. This court will “uphold the SEC’s legal
conclusions unless they are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise
not in accordance with law,” and its factual findings as long as they are “supported by
substantial evidence.” Seghers v. SEC, 548 F.3d 129, 132 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (citations
omitted).
The court “accord[s] great deference to the SEC’s decisions as to a choice of
sanction, inquiring only whether a sanction ‘was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of
discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.’” WHX Corp. v. SEC, 362 F.3d 854,
859 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (quoting KPMG, LLP v. SEC, 289 F.3d 109, 121 (D.C. Cir. 2002)).
To adequately justify a decision to bar an individual from the industry, the SEC must
consider “‘the egregiousness of the defendant’s actions, the isolated or recurrent nature
of the infraction, the degree of scienter involved, the sincerity of the defendant’s

assurances against future violations, the defendant’s recognition of the wrongfulness of
his conduct, and the likelihood that the defendant’s occupation will present
opportunities for future violations’ in determining a sanction that protects the public
interest.” Seghers, 548 F.3d at 135 (quoting Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d 1126, 1140
(5th Cir. 1979)).
The court has considered petitioner’s arguments and concluded that he has not
demonstrated error in the SEC’s decision that his conduct in connection with the
Lifeplan offering violated Securities Act Section 17(a), Exchange Act Section 10(b),
Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, Advisers Act Sections 206(1), (2), and (4), and Advisers Act
Rule 206(4)-4(a)(1); his registration with the Commission violated Advisers Act Sections
203A and 207; his failure to make, keep, and furnish necessary records violated
Advisers Act Section 204 and Advisers Act Rules 204-2(a)(1), (2), and (6); and the
sanctions against him were warranted. To the extent petitioner can establish that he
has repaid the funds he transferred from Lifeplan’s bank account to his own, such
payments will offset his disgorgement obligation. S.E.C. v. Palmisano, 135 F.3d 860,
863-64 (2d Cir. 1998).
Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk
is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution
of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. See Fed. R. App.
P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. Rule 41.
