ORDER DIRECTING
DISBURSEMENT OF FAIR FUND

On November 8, 2010, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
(“Commission”) published a “Notice of Proposed Plan of Distribution and Opportunity for
Comment” (“Notice”) in connection with this proceeding pursuant to Rule 1103 of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1103 (Exchange
Act Rel. No. 63269). The Notice advised parties that they could obtain a copy of the
Proposed Plan of Distribution (“Plan”) at www.sec.gov. The Notice also advised that all
persons desiring to comment on the Plan could submit their comments, in writing, within 30
days of the date of the Notice. No comments were received by the Commission in response to
the Notice. On January 4, 2011, the Commission issued an Order Approving Distribution
Plan (Exchange Act Rel. No. 63640).
The Plan provides that a portion of the Fair Fund consisting of disgorgement,
prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, plus any accrued interest less a reserve for expenses
and taxes, be transferred by the Commission to The Huntington National Bank for distribution
by the Fund Administrator when a validated list of payees with the identification information
required to make the distribution has been received and accepted by the staff. The validated
list of payees, which is for a total disbursement amount of $21,053,635.14, has been received
and accepted.

Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the Commission staff shall transfer $21,053,635.14 of
the Fair Fund to The Huntington National Bank, and the Fund Administrator shall distribute
such monies to investors, as provided for in the Plan.
By the Commission.
