INTRODUCTION
A.

Background

Crowdfunding is a relatively new and evolving method of using the Internet to raise capital
to support a wide range of ideas and ventures. An entity or individual raising funds through
crowdfunding typically seeks small individual contributions from a large number of people.
Individuals interested in the crowdfunding campaign – members of the “crowd” – may share
information about the project, cause, idea or business with each other and use the information to
decide whether to fund the campaign based on the collective “wisdom of the crowd.”
The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”), 1 enacted on April 5, 2012,
establishes a regulatory structure for startups and small businesses to raise capital through
securities offerings using the Internet through crowdfunding. The crowdfunding provisions of the
JOBS Act were intended to help provide startups and small businesses with capital by making
relatively low dollar offerings of securities, featuring relatively low dollar investments by the
“crowd,” less costly. 2 Congress included a number of provisions intended to protect investors
who engage in these transactions, 3 including investment limits, required disclosures by issuers,

Pub. L. No. 112-106, 126 Stat. 306 (2012).

See, e.g., congressional statements regarding crowdfunding bills that were precursors to the JOBS Act: 157
CONG. REC. S8458-02 (daily ed. Dec. 8, 2011) (statement of Sen. Jeff Merkley) (“Low-dollar investments
from ordinary Americans may help fill the void, providing a new avenue of funding to the small businesses
that are the engine of job creation. The CROWDFUND Act would provide startup companies and other
small businesses with a new way to raise capital from ordinary investors in a more transparent and regulated
marketplace.”); 157 CONG. REC. H7295-01 (daily ed. Nov. 3, 2011) (statement of Rep. Patrick McHenry)
(“[H]igh net worth individuals can invest in businesses before the average family can. And that small
business is limited on the amount of equity stakes they can provide investors and limited in the number of
investors they can get. So, clearly, something has to be done to open these capital markets to the average
investor[.]”).

3

See, e.g., congressional statements regarding crowdfunding bills that were precursors to the JOBS Act: 158
CONG. REC. S1781 (daily ed. Mar. 19, 2012) (statement of Sen. Carl Levin) (“Our bill creates new
opportunities for crowdfunding but establishes basic regulatory oversight, liability, and disclosure rules that
will give investors the confidence to participate in this promising emerging source of money for growing
companies.”).

and a requirement to use regulated intermediaries. The provisions also permit Internet-based
platforms to facilitate the offer and sale of securities in crowdfunding transactions without having
to register with the Commission as brokers.
In the United States, crowdfunding generally has not involved the offer of a share in any
financial returns or profits that the fundraiser may expect to generate from business activities
financed through crowdfunding. Such a profit or revenue-sharing model – sometimes referred to
as the “equity model” of crowdfunding – could trigger the application of the federal securities
laws because it likely would involve the offer and sale of a security. Under the Securities Act of
1933 (“Securities Act”), the offer and sale of securities is required to be registered unless an
exemption is available. Some observers have stated that registered offerings are not feasible for
raising smaller amounts of capital, as is done in a typical crowdfunding transaction, because of the
costs of conducting a registered offering and the resulting ongoing reporting obligations under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) that may arise as a result of the offering.
Limitations under existing regulations, including purchaser qualification requirements for offering
exemptions that permit general solicitation and general advertising, have made private placement
exemptions generally unavailable for crowdfunding transactions, which are intended to involve a
large number of investors 4 and not be limited to investors that meet specific qualifications. 5

In this release, “investors” includes investors and potential investors, as the context requires. See Rule
100(d) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

5

See Eliminating the Prohibition Against General Solicitation and General Advertising in Rule 506 and Rule
144A Offerings, Release No. 33-9415 (July 10, 2013) [78 FR 44771 (July 24, 2013)] (adopting rules to
implement Title II of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act) (“Rule 506(c) Adopting Release”). Title II of
the JOBS Act directed the Commission to amend Rule 506 of Regulation D to permit general solicitation or
general advertising in offerings made under Rule 506, provided that all purchasers of the securities are
accredited investors. Accredited investors include natural persons who meet certain income or net worth
thresholds. Although this rule facilitates the type of broad solicitation emblematic of crowdfunding,
crowdfunding is premised on permitting sales of securities to any interested person, not just to investors who
meet specific qualifications, such as accredited investors.

7

Moreover, someone who operates a website to effect the purchase and sale of securities for
the account of others generally would, under pre-existing regulations, be required to register with
the Commission as a broker-dealer and comply with the laws and regulations applicable to brokerdealers. 6 A person that operates such a website only for the purchase of securities of startups and
small businesses, however, may find it impractical in view of the limited nature of that person’s
activities and business to register as a broker-dealer and operate under the full set of regulatory
obligations that apply to broker-dealers.
B.

Title III of the JOBS Act

Title III of the JOBS Act (“Title III”) added new Securities Act Section 4(a)(6), 7 which
provides an exemption from the registration requirements of Securities Act Section 5 8 for certain
crowdfunding transactions. To qualify for the exemption under Section 4(a)(6), crowdfunding
transactions by an issuer (including all entities controlled by or under common control with the
issuer) must meet specified requirements, including the following:
•

the amount raised must not exceed $1 million in a 12-month period;

•

individual investments in all crowdfunding issuers in a 12-month period are limited to:
o the greater of $2,000 or 5 percent of annual income or net worth, if annual income
or net worth of the investor is less than $100,000; and
o 10 percent of annual income or net worth (not to exceed an amount sold of
$100,000), if annual income or net worth of the investor is $100,000 or more; and

6

Exchange Act Section 15(a)(1) generally makes it unlawful for a broker or dealer to effect any transactions
in, or induce the purchase or sale of, any security unless that broker or dealer is registered with the
Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 15(b). 15 U.S.C. 78o(a). See discussion in Section II.D.2.
Because brokers and dealers both register as broker-dealers (i.e., there is no separate “broker” or “dealer”
registration under Exchange Act Section 15(b)), we use the term “broker-dealer” in this release.

•

transactions must be conducted through an intermediary that either is registered as a
broker-dealer or is registered as a new type of entity called a “funding portal.”

In addition, Title III:
•

adds Securities Act Section 4A, 9 which requires, among other things, that issuers and
intermediaries that facilitate transactions between issuers and investors in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6) provide certain information to investors and potential investors, take other
actions and provide notices and other information to the Commission;

•

adds Exchange Act Section 3(h), 10 which requires the Commission to adopt rules to
exempt, either conditionally or unconditionally, “funding portals” from having to register
as a broker-dealer pursuant to Exchange Act Section 15(a)(1); 11

•

mandates that the Commission establish disqualification provisions under which an issuer
would not be able to avail itself of the Section 4(a)(6) exemption if the issuer or an
intermediary was subject to a disqualifying event; and

•

adds Exchange Act Section 12(g)(6), 12 which requires the Commission to adopt rules to
exempt from the registration requirements of Section 12(g), 13 either conditionally or
unconditionally, securities acquired pursuant to an offering made in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6).

On October 23, 2013, we proposed new rules and forms to implement Title III of the JOBS
Act. 14 We received over 485 comment letters on the Proposing Release, including from
professional and trade associations, investor organizations, law firms, investment companies and
investment advisers, broker-dealers, potential funding portals, members of Congress, the
Commission’s Investor Advisory Committee, 15 state securities regulators, government agencies,
potential issuers, accountants, individuals and other interested parties. We have reviewed and
considered all of the comments that we received on the Proposing Release and on Title III of the
JOBS Act. 16 In this release, we are adopting new rules and forms to implement Sections 4(a)(6)
and 4A and Exchange Act Sections 3(h) and 12(g)(6). The rules are described in detail below.
II.

Final Rules Implementing Regulation Crowdfunding
Regulation Crowdfunding, among other things, permits individuals to invest in securities-

based crowdfunding transactions subject to certain thresholds, limits the amount of money an
issuer can raise under the crowdfunding exemption, requires issuers to disclose certain
information about their offers, and creates a regulatory framework for the intermediaries that
facilitate the crowdfunding transactions. As an overview, under the final rules:

14

See Rel. No. 33-9470 (Oct. 23, 2013) [78 FR 66427 (Nov. 5, 2013)] (the “Proposing Release”), available at:
http://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2013/33-9470.pdf.

15

The SEC Investor Advisory Committee (“Investor Advisory Committee”) was established in April 2012
pursuant to Section 911 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act [Pub. L. No.
111-203, sec. 911, 124 Stat. 1376, 1822 (July 21, 2010)] (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) to advise the Commission
on regulatory priorities, the regulation of securities products, trading strategies, fee structures, the
effectiveness of disclosure, initiatives to protect investor interests and to promote investor confidence and the
integrity of the securities marketplace. The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the Investor Advisory Committee to
submit findings and recommendations for review and consideration by the Commission.

16

To facilitate public input on JOBS Act rulemaking before the issuance of rule proposals, the Commission
invited members of the public to make their views known on various JOBS Act initiatives in advance of any
rulemaking by submitting comment letters to the Commission’s website at
http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/jobsactcomments.shtml. The comment letters relating to Title III of the JOBS
Act submitted in response to this invitation are located at http://www.sec.gov/comments/jobs-title-ii/jobstitle-iii.shtml.

10

•

An issuer is permitted to raise a maximum aggregate amount of $1 million through
crowdfunding offerings in a 12-month period;

•

Individual investors, over the course of a 12-month period, are permitted to invest in the
aggregate across all crowdfunding offerings up to:
o If either their annual income or net worth is less than $100,000, then the greater of:


$2,000 or



5 percent of the lesser of their annual income or net worth.

o If both their annual income and net worth are equal to or more than $100,000, then
10 percent of the lesser of their annual income or net worth; and
•

During the 12-month period, the aggregate amount of securities sold to an investor through
all crowdfunding offerings may not exceed $100,000.
Certain companies are not eligible to use the Regulation Crowdfunding

exemption. Ineligible companies include non-U.S. companies, companies that already are
Exchange Act reporting companies, certain investment companies, companies that are disqualified
under Regulation Crowdfunding’s disqualification rules, companies that have failed to comply
with the annual reporting requirements under Regulation Crowdfunding during the two years
immediately preceding the filing of the offering statement, and companies that have no specific
business plan or have indicated their business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition with an
unidentified company or companies.
Securities purchased in a crowdfunding transaction generally cannot be resold for a period
of one year. Holders of these securities do not count toward the threshold that requires an issuer
to register its securities with the Commission under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act if the

11

issuer is current in its annual reporting obligation, retains the services of a registered transfer agent
and has less than $25 million in assets.
Disclosure by Issuers. The final rules require issuers conducting an offering pursuant to
Regulation Crowdfunding to file certain information with the Commission and provide this
information to investors and the relevant intermediary facilitating the crowdfunding offering.
Among other things, in its offering documents, the issuer is required to disclose:
•

Information about officers and directors as well as owners of 20 percent or more of the
issuer;

•

A description of the issuer’s business and the use of proceeds from the offering;

•

The price to the public of the securities or the method for determining the price, the target
offering amount, the deadline to reach the target offering amount, and whether the issuer
will accept investments in excess of the target offering amount;

•

Certain related-party transactions;

•

A discussion of the issuer’s financial condition; and

•

Financial statements of the issuer that are, depending on the amount offered and sold
during a 12-month period, accompanied by information from the issuer’s tax returns,
reviewed by an independent public accountant, or audited by an independent auditor. An
issuer relying on these rules for the first time would be permitted to provide reviewed
rather than audited financial statements, unless financial statements of the issuer are
available that have been audited by an independent auditor.
Issuers are required to amend the offering document during the offering period to reflect

material changes and provide updates on the issuer’s progress toward reaching the target offering
amount.
12

In addition, issuers relying on the Regulation Crowdfunding exemption are required to file
an annual report with the Commission and provide it to investors.
Crowdfunding Platforms. One of the key investor protections of Title III of the JOBS
Act is the requirement that Regulation Crowdfunding transactions take place through an SECregistered intermediary, either a broker-dealer or a funding portal. Under Regulation
Crowdfunding, offerings must be conducted exclusively through a platform operated by a
registered broker or a funding portal, which is a new type of SEC registrant. The rules require
these intermediaries to:
•

Provide investors with educational materials;

•

Take measures to reduce the risk of fraud;

•

Make available information about the issuer and the offering;

•

Provide communication channels to permit discussions about offerings on the platform;
and

•

Facilitate the offer and sale of crowdfunded securities.

The rules prohibit funding portals from:
•

Offering investment advice or making recommendations;

•

Soliciting purchases, sales or offers to buy securities offered or displayed on its platform;

•

Compensating promoters and others for solicitations or based on the sale of securities; and

•

Holding, possessing, or handling investor funds or securities.

The rules provide a safe harbor under which funding portals can engage in certain activities
consistent with these restrictions.
The staff will undertake to study and submit a report to the Commission no later than three
years following the effective date of Regulation Crowdfunding on the impact of the regulation on
13

capital formation and investor protection. The report will include, but not be limited to, a review
of: (1) issuer and intermediary compliance; (2) issuer offering limits and investor investment
limits; (3) incidence of fraud, investor losses, and compliance with investor aggregates; (4)
intermediary fee and compensation structures; (5) measures intermediaries have taken to reduce
the risk of fraud, including reliance on issuer and investor representations; (6) the concept of a
centralized database of investor contributions; (7) intermediary policies and procedures; (8)
intermediary recordkeeping practices; and (9) secondary market trading practices.
A.

Crowdfunding Exemption

Section 4(a)(6) provides an exemption from the registration requirements of Securities Act
Section 5 for certain crowdfunding transactions. To qualify for this exemption, crowdfunding
transactions by an issuer must meet specified requirements, including limits on the dollar amount
of the securities that may be sold by an issuer and the dollar amount that may be invested by an
individual in a 12-month period. The crowdfunding transaction also must be conducted through a
registered intermediary that complies with specified requirements. 17 Title III also provides
limitations on who may rely on the exemption and establishes specific liability provisions for
material misstatements or omissions in connection with Section 4(a)(6) exempt transactions. As
discussed below, the rules we are adopting are designed to aid issuers, investors and
intermediaries in complying with these various limitations and requirements.
1.

Limit on Capital Raised
a.

Proposed Rules

The exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(6) is available to a U.S. issuer
provided that “the aggregate amount sold to all investors by the issuer, including any amount sold
17

See Section II.C for a discussion of the intermediary requirements. See also Section II.D for a discussion of
the additional funding portal requirements.

14

in reliance on the exemption provided under [Section 4(a)(6)] during the 12-month period
preceding the date of such transaction, is not more than $1,000,000.” Under Securities Act
Section 4A(h), the Commission is required to adjust the dollar amounts in Section 4(a)(6) “not
less frequently than once every five years, by notice published in the Federal Register, to reflect
any change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics.”
Consistent with the statute, we proposed in Rule 100(a) of Regulation Crowdfunding to
limit the aggregate amount sold to all investors by the issuer in reliance on the new exemption to
$1 million during a 12-month period. Capital raised through other exempt transactions would not
be counted in determining the aggregate amount sold in reliance on Section 4(a)(6).
We also provided guidance clarifying our view that offerings made in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6) will not be integrated 18 with other exempt offerings made by the issuer, provided
that each offering complies with the requirements of the applicable exemption that is being relied
upon for the particular offering.
Under Section 4(a)(6), the amount of securities sold in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) by
entities controlled by or under common control with the issuer must be aggregated with the
amount to be sold by the issuer in the current offering to determine the aggregate amount sold in
reliance on Section 4(a)(6) during the preceding 12-month period. Under the proposed rules, for
purposes of determining whether an entity is “controlled by or under common control with” the
issuer, an issuer would be required to consider whether it has “control” based on the definition in

18

The integration doctrine seeks to prevent an issuer from improperly avoiding registration by artificially
dividing a single offering into multiple offerings such that Securities Act exemptions would apply to multiple
offerings that would not be available for the combined offering. See, e.g., Final Rule: Nonpublic Offering
Exemption, Release No. 33-4552 (Nov. 6, 1962).

15

Securities Act Rule 405. 19 As proposed, the amount of securities sold in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6) also would include securities sold by any predecessor of the issuer in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6) during the preceding 12-month period.
b.

Comments on the Proposed Rules

A few commenters supported a $1 million limit on capital raised by an issuer in reliance
on Section 4(a)(6), 20 while many other commenters believed that the proposed $1 million limit
was too low and, in some instances, recommended higher limits. 21 Several commenters urged that
the $1 million limit be net of fees charged by the intermediary to host the offering on the
intermediary’s platform, 22 while other commenters generally opposed this idea. 23
Commenters were divided on the proposed guidance that other exempt offerings should
not be integrated when determining the amount sold during the preceding 12-month period for
purposes of the $1 million limit, with some supporting this approach, 24 and others opposing it. 25

See 17 CFR 230.405 (“The term control (including the terms controlling, controlled by and under common
control with) means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the
management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or
otherwise.”). Exchange Act Rule 12b-2 contains the same definition. See 17 CFR 240.12b-2.

Final Rules

We are adopting as proposed rules that limit to $1 million the aggregate amount that may
be sold to all investors by the issuer in a 12-month period in reliance on the new exemption. 26 We
continue to believe this approach is consistent with the statute and will provide for a meaningful
addition to the existing capital formation options for smaller companies while maintaining
important investor protections. Moreover, Regulation Crowdfunding is a novel method of raising
capital for smaller companies, and we are concerned about expanding the offering limit of the
exemption beyond the level specified in Section 4(a)(6) at the outset of the adoption of final rules.
Some commenters suggested that the $1 million limit be net of fees charged by the intermediary to
host the offering on the intermediary’s platform, 27 which would be an indirect way of increasing
the $1 million limit. We are concerned that expanding the offering limit in this way would
provide less certainty and could raise interpretive questions, which would make the exemption
more costly for issuers to comply with. If a funding portal’s fees are not known in advance, for
example, this may create uncertainty for issuers about how much capital they would be able to
raise. Therefore, we are adopting as proposed the limit on the aggregate amount sold.
Title III provides that the $1 million limit applies to the “aggregate amount sold to all
investors by the issuer, including any amount sold in reliance on the exemption provided under
25

See, e.g., AFL-CIO Letter (not integrating other exempt offerings will make crowdfunding available to larger
companies and “crowd out” smaller companies that lack other options for raising capital); AFR Letter;
Brown J. Letter; Consumer Federation Letter (not integrating other exempt offerings will allow issuers to
evade regulatory requirements); Fund Democracy Letter (not integrating other exempt offerings will give
issuers an incentive to engage in advertising in concurrent private offerings to indirectly publicly advertise
their crowdfunding offering); IAC Recommendation; MCS Letter; NASAA Letter.

26

See Rule 100(a)(1) of Regulation Crowdfunding. There is a technical change to the rule text (“offer and sell
securities” is changed to “offer or sell securities”) to clarify that an issuer does not have to complete a sale in
order to rely on the Section 4(a)(6) exemption for an offering.

[Section 4(a)(6)].” Securities Act Section 4A(g), however, provides that “[n]othing in the
exemption shall be construed as preventing an issuer from raising capital through means other
than [S]ection 4[(a)](6).” Considered together, these two provisions create statutory ambiguity
because the first provision could be read to provide for the aggregation of amounts raised in all
exempt transactions, even those that do not involve crowdfunding, while the second provision
could be read to provide that nothing in the Section 4(a)(6) exemption should limit an issuer’s
capital raising through other methods. We believe that the overall intent of providing the
exemption under Section 4(a)(6) was to provide an additional mechanism for capital raising for
startup and small businesses and not to affect the amount an issuer could raise outside of that
exemption. Thus, we believe that only the capital raised in reliance on the exemption provided by
Section 4(a)(6) should be counted toward the limit. Capital raised through other means should not
be counted in determining the aggregate amount sold in reliance on Section 4(a)(6). The opposite
approach – requiring aggregation of amounts raised in any exempt transaction – would be
inconsistent with the goal of alleviating the funding gap for startups and small businesses because,
by electing crowdfunding, such issuers would be placing a cap on the amount of capital they could
raise. An issuer that already sold $1 million in reliance on the exemption provided under Section
4(a)(6), for example, would be prevented from raising capital through other exempt methods and,
conversely, an issuer that sold $1 million through other exempt methods would be prevented from
raising capital under Section 4(a)(6).
In determining the amount that may be sold in reliance on Section 4(a)(6), an issuer should
aggregate amounts it sold (including amounts sold by entities controlled by, or under common
control with, the issuer, as well as any amounts sold by any predecessor of the issuer) in reliance
on Section 4(a)(6) during the 12-month period preceding the expected date of sale and the amount
18

the issuer intends to raise in reliance on the exemption. An issuer should not include amounts sold
in other exempt offerings during the preceding 12-month period.
Further, in light of Section 4A(g) and for the reasons discussed above, we continue to
believe that an offering made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) should not be integrated with another
exempt offering made by the issuer, provided that each offering complies with the requirements of
the applicable exemption that is being relied upon for the particular offering. For example, an
issuer conducting a concurrent exempt offering for which general solicitation is not permitted will
need to be satisfied that purchasers in that offering were not solicited by means of the offering
made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6). 28 As another example, an issuer conducting a concurrent
exempt offering for which general solicitation is permitted, for example, under Securities Act
Rule 506(c), could not include in any such general solicitation an advertisement of the terms of an
offering made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6), unless that advertisement otherwise complied with
Section 4(a)(6) and the final rules. As such, a concurrent offering would be bound by the more
restrictive solicitation requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding, unless the issuer can conclude
that the purchasers in the Regulation Crowdfunding offering were not solicited by means of the
offering made in reliance on Rule 506(c).
The amount of securities sold in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) by entities controlled by or
under common control with the issuer must be aggregated with the amount to be sold by the issuer
in the current offering to determine the aggregate amount sold in reliance on Section 4(a)(6)
during the preceding 12-month period. The statute does not define the term “controlled by or

28

For a concurrent offering under Rule 506(b), an issuer will have to conclude that purchasers in the
Rule 506(b) offering were not solicited by means of the offering made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6). For
example, the issuer may have had a preexisting substantive relationship with such purchasers. Otherwise,
the solicitation conducted in connection with the crowdfunding offering may preclude reliance on
Rule 506(b). See also Rel. No. 33-8828 (Aug. 3, 2007) [72 FR 45116].

19

under common control with” the issuer; however, the term “control” is defined in Securities Act
Rule 405. 29 Under the final rules, for purposes of determining whether an entity is “controlled by
or under common control with” the issuer, an issuer will be required to consider whether it
possesses, directly or indirectly, the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and
policies of the entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or
otherwise, consistent with the definition of “control” in Securities Act Rule 405. 30
Under the final rules, the amount of securities sold in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) also
includes securities sold by any predecessor of the issuer in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) during the
preceding 12-month period. 31 We believe this approach is necessary to prevent an issuer from
exceeding the $1 million limit by reorganizing into a new entity that would otherwise not be
limited by previous sales made by its predecessor.
2.

Investment Limits
a.

Proposed Rules

Under the exemption from registration set forth in Securities Act Section 4(a)(6)(B), the
aggregate amount of securities sold to any investor by an issuer, including any amount sold in
reliance on the exemption during the 12-month period preceding the date of such transaction,
cannot exceed: “(i) the greater of $2,000 or 5 percent of the annual income or net worth of such
investor, as applicable, if either the annual income or the net worth of the investor is less than
$100,000; and (ii) 10 percent of the annual income or net worth of such investor, as applicable,

29

See note 19.

30

See Instruction to paragraph (c) of Rule 100 of Regulation Crowdfunding.

31

See Rule 100(c) of Regulation Crowdfunding (defining issuer, in certain circumstances, to include all entities
controlled by or under common control with the issuer and any predecessor of the issuer).

20

not to exceed a maximum aggregate amount sold of $100,000, if either the annual income or net
worth of the investor is equal to or more than $100,000.”
In the Proposing Release, we noted that this statutory language may present ambiguity in
some cases about which of the two investment limits governs, because paragraph (i) applies if
“either” annual income or net worth is less than $100,000 and paragraph (ii) applies if “either”
annual income or net worth is equal to or more than $100,000. Accordingly, in a situation in
which annual income is less than $100,000 and net worth is equal to or more than $100,000 (or
vice versa), the language of the statute may be read to cause both paragraphs to apply. Paragraph
(i) also fixes the maximum annual investment by an investor at 5 percent of “the annual income or
net worth of such investor, as applicable” and paragraph (ii) fixes the maximum annual
investment by an investor at 10 percent of “the annual income or net worth of such investor, as
applicable,” but neither states when that percentage should be applied against the investor’s
annual income and when it should be applied against the investor’s net worth.
Under proposed Rule 100(a) of Regulation Crowdfunding, the aggregate amount of
securities sold to any investor by any issuer in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) during the 12-month
period preceding the date of such transaction, including the securities sold to such investor in such
transaction, could not exceed the greater of: (i) $2,000 or 5 percent of the annual income or net
worth of the investor, whichever is greater, if both annual income and net worth are less than
$100,000; or (ii) 10 percent of the annual income or net worth of the investor, whichever is
greater, not to exceed an amount sold of $100,000, if either annual income or net worth is equal to
or more than $100,000.
We did not propose to alter these investment limits for any particular type of investor or
create a different exemption based on different investment limits. Under the proposal, the annual
21

income and net worth of a natural person would be calculated in accordance with the
Commission’s rules for the calculation of annual income and net worth of an accredited investor,
and an investor’s annual income or net worth could be calculated jointly with the annual income
or net worth of the investor’s spouse. An issuer would be able to rely on the efforts of an
intermediary to determine that the aggregate amount of securities purchased by an investor will
not cause the investor to exceed the investment limits, provided the issuer does not have
knowledge to the contrary.
b.

Comments on the Proposed Rules

Commenters were divided on the proposed investment limits. Many commenters
supported some type of investment limit without necessarily expressing a specific opinion on the
proposed investment limits, 32 while many others generally opposed any type of investment limit.33
A number of commenters recommended changes to the proposed limits. 34
While some commenters supported the proposal to apply the higher investment limit (10
percent, as set forth in Section 4(a)(6)(B)(ii)) if only one of the annual income or net worth of the
investor is equal to or more than $100,000, 35 some commenters also supported the lower
investment limit ($2,000 or 5 percent, as set forth in Section 4(a)(6)(B)(i)) unless both the annual
income and net worth of the investor are equal to or more than $100,000. 36

A number of commenters supported the proposal that within each of the two levels of
investment limits, the limits would be calculated based on the “greater of” an investor’s annual
income or net worth, 37 while a number of other commenters preferred a “lesser of” approach. 38 A
few commenters suggested a combination of the approaches (e.g., if either annual income or net
worth is below $100,000, the lower investment limit level ($2,000 or 5 percent) would apply, but
within that level, the limit would be based on the greater of annual income or net worth). 39
Many commenters supported the proposal that an issuer may rely on the efforts of an
intermediary to determine that the aggregate amount of securities purchased by an investor will
not cause the investor to exceed the investment limits, provided that the issuer does not have
knowledge that the investor had exceeded, or would exceed, the investment limits as a result of
purchasing securities in the issuer’s offering. 40 A few commenters recommended that an issuer be
required to obtain a written representation from the investor that the investor has not and will not
exceed the limits by purchasing from the issuer. 41
Commenters were divided about the joint calculation of annual income and net worth with
the investor’s spouse. Several commenters supported the proposal that an investor’s annual

income and net worth be calculated jointly with that of the investor’s spouse, 42 while other
commenters generally opposed that aspect of the proposal. 43 Several commenters recommended
that if an investor’s annual income and net worth are to be calculated jointly, the Commission
should establish higher thresholds or an aggregate investment limit applicable to both spouses. 44
A number of commenters favored different or no investment limits for accredited and
institutional investors. Many commenters supported exempting accredited and institutional
investors from the investment limits, 45 although a number of other commenters opposed such an
exemption.46 A few commenters recommended allowing higher investment limits for accredited
and institutional investors. 47 One commenter stated that applying the investment limits to
accredited and institutional investors would deter those investors from participating, but noted that
allowing concurrent offerings under Securities Act Rule 506(c) 48 may mitigate this problem. 49

Final Rules

Consistent with the statute, we are adopting investment limits for securities-based
crowdfunding transactions, but with some modifications from the proposed rules. We have
modified the final rules from the proposal to clarify that the investment limit reflects the aggregate

amount an investor may invest in all offerings under Section 4(a)(6) in a 12-month period across
all issuers. In addition, as noted above, some commenters supported a “greater of” approach to
implementing the two statutory investment limits, while others supported a “lesser of” approach.
After considering the comments received, we have decided to adopt a “lesser of” approach. Thus,
under the final rules, an investor will be limited to investing: (1) the greater of: $2,000 or 5
percent of the lesser of the investor’s annual income or net worth if either annual income or net
worth is less than $100,000; or (2) 10 percent of the lesser of the investor’s annual income or net
worth, not to exceed an amount sold of $100,000, if both annual income and net worth are
$100,000 or more. 50
Under this approach, an investor with annual income of $50,000 a year and $105,000 in
net worth would be subject to an investment limit of $2,500, in contrast to the proposed rules in
which that same investor would have been eligible for an investment limit of $10,500. 51 We
recognize that this change from the proposed rules could place constraints on capital formation.
Nevertheless, we believe that the investment limits in the final rules appropriately take into
consideration the need to give issuers access to capital while minimizing an investor’s exposure to
risk in a crowdfunding transaction.

A number of commenters expressed concerns about investors potentially incurring
unaffordable losses under the proposed rule, 53 and we find these comments persuasive given the
risks involved. The startups and small businesses that we expect will rely on the crowdfunding
exemption are likely to experience a higher failure rate than more seasoned companies. 54
Applying the lower limit ($2,000 or 5%, rather than 10%) for investors whose annual income or
net worth is below $100,000 and applying that formula to the lesser of annual income or net worth
will potentially limit investment losses in crowdfunding offerings for investors who may be less
able to bear the risk of loss. We are concerned about the number of households where there is a
sizeable gap between net worth and annual income, and the ability of these households to
withstand the risk of loss. According to Commission staff analysis of the data in the 2013 Survey
of Consumer Finances, approximately 20% of U.S. households with net worth over $100,000 have
annual income under $50,000.

Consistent with the proposed rules, the final rules allow an issuer to rely on efforts that an
intermediary is required to undertake in order to determine that the aggregate amount of securities
purchased by an investor does not cause the investor to exceed the investment limits, provided that
the issuer does not have knowledge that the investor had exceeded, or would exceed, the
investment limits as a result of purchasing securities in the issuer’s offering. 55
We are adopting, as proposed, final rules that allow an investor’s annual income and net
worth to be calculated as those values are calculated for purposes of determining accredited
investor status. 56 Securities Act Rule 501 specifies the manner in which annual income and net
worth are calculated for purposes of determining accredited investor status. 57 As in the proposal,
the final rules allow spouses to calculate their net worth or annual income jointly. Although some
commenters opposed permitting net worth or annual income to be calculated jointly, we believe
this approach is appropriate in light of the stricter investment limits being adopted in the final
rules. Several commenters recommended that, if the final rules permit net worth and annual
income to be calculated jointly, we should establish an aggregate investment limit applicable to
both spouses. 58 Consistent with this recommendation, the final rules add an instruction to explain
that when such a joint calculation is used, the aggregate investment of the spouses may not exceed
the limit that would apply to an individual investor at that income and net worth level. 59 We
believe this approach is necessary to preserve the intended protections of the investment limits.

For example, if each spouse’s annual income is $30,000, the spouses jointly may invest up to an aggregate of
5% of their joint income of $60,000. If one spouse’s annual income is $120,000 and the other’s is $30,000,
the spouses jointly may invest up to an aggregate of 10% of their joint income of $150,000, the same

27

While a number of commenters supported the creation of a different investment limit for
accredited or institutional investors, or exempting them altogether, we are not making such a
change. As noted above, crowdfunding is an innovative approach to raising capital in which the
entity or individual raising capital typically seeks small individual contributions from a large
number of people. As such, we believe that crowdfunding transactions were intended under
Section 4(a)(6) to be available equally to all types of investors. 60 The statute provides specific
investment limits, and the only reference in the statute to changing those investment limits is the
requirement that we update the investment limits not less frequently than every five years based
on the Consumer Price Index. Further, issuers can rely on other exemptions to offer and sell
securities to accredited investors and institutional investors. As discussed above, concurrent
offerings to these types of investors are possible if the conditions of each applicable exemption are
met. 61 Therefore, we are not altering the investment limits for any particular type of investor or to
create a different exemption based on different investment limits. Thus, as proposed, the
investment limits will apply equally to all investors, including retail, institutional and accredited
investors.

Transaction Conducted Through an Intermediary
a.

Proposed Rules

Section 4(a)(6)(C) requires that a transaction in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) be conducted
through a broker or funding portal that complies with the requirements of Securities Act Section
investment limit that would apply for an individual investor with income of $150,000. See Instruction 2 to
paragraph (a)(2) of Rule 100 of Regulation Crowdfunding.
60

See 158 CONG. REC. S1689 (daily ed. Mar. 15, 2012) (statement of Sen. Mark Warner (“There is now the
ability to use the Internet as a way for small investors to get the same kind of deals that up to this point only
select investors have gotten that have been customers of some of the best known investment banking firms,
where we can now use the power of the Internet, through a term called crowdfunding.”).

61

For a discussion of integration, see Section II.A.1.c.

28

4A(a). To implement this provision, we proposed in Rule 100(a)(3) of Regulation Crowdfunding
that for any transaction conducted in reliance on Section 4(a)(6), an issuer use only one
intermediary (that complies with the requirements of Section 4A(a) and the related requirements
in Regulation Crowdfunding) and that the transaction be conducted exclusively on the
intermediary’s platform. We also proposed to permit the intermediary to engage in back office 62
or other administrative functions other than on the intermediary’s platform, and to define
“platform” as “an Internet website or other similar electronic medium through which a registered
broker or a registered funding portal acts as an intermediary in a transaction involving the offer or
sale of securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6).”
b.

Comments on the Proposed Rules

Commenters were divided about the proposed prohibition on an issuer using more than
one intermediary for any transaction conducted pursuant to Section 4(a)(6). Supporters of the
proposed prohibition expressed the view that the prohibition would benefit communication
between issuers and investors. 63 One commenter stated that the prohibition also would assist in
assessing whether investors are within their investment limits.64 Commenters who opposed the
proposed prohibition noted that increasing the number of platforms used per transaction would
both increase the likelihood of investors becoming informed that a transaction is taking place, as
well as elicit information from a more diverse crowd. 65
Commenters were generally divided about the proposed requirement that transactions
made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) be conducted exclusively through the intermediary’s platform.
62

Back office personnel typically perform functions such as, but not limited to, recordkeeping, trade
confirmations, internal accounting, and account maintenance.

65

See, e.g., Graves Letter.

29

Commenters who supported 66 the proposed requirement cited concerns that allowing the
transactions to be effected through means other than the intermediary’s platform could increase
the potential for fraudulent activity67 and prevent the leveraging of information sharing and
crowdsourced review that are intended through crowdfunding. 68 Commenters who opposed 69 the
proposed requirement expressed their view that permitting other means would allow persons who
lack Internet access to invest through crowdfunding, 70 and also would foster different types of inperson communication that are not possible to achieve online. 71 One commenter expressed a
preference for issuers to be able to host their own offerings subject to certain conditions. 72 One
commenter also suggested that intermediaries should be able to engage in certain activities other
than on their platforms, such as physically meeting with representatives of issuers and investors,
and hosting launch parties. 73
A few commenters supported, but suggested technical revisions to, our proposed definition
of “platform.” 74 One commenter suggested deleting the phrase “an Internet website or other

online because some investors that may rely on the website to educate themselves may not be inclined to
contribute to the ‘crowd intelligence’ online, yet would be vocal in a community gathering.”).

72

See Public Startup Letter 2. We note that Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act requires that, as a condition of

similar electronic medium” and replacing the phrase with “a software program accessible via
TCP/IP enabled applications” or to more commonly define “platform” as “a software program
accessible via the Internet.” 75
c.

Final Rules

After considering the comments, we are adopting as proposed Rule 100(a)(3). We also are
adopting the definition of “platform” with one clarifying amendment and with a change in
location to Rule 300(c).
As stated in the Proposing Release, we believe that requiring an issuer to use only one
intermediary to conduct an offering or concurrent offerings in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) would
help foster the creation of a “crowd” and better accomplish the purpose of the statute. In order for
a crowd to effectively share information, we believe it would be most beneficial to have one
meeting place for the crowd to obtain and share information, thus avoiding dilution or
dispersement of the “crowd.” We also believe that limiting a crowdfunding transaction to a single
intermediary’s online platform helps to minimize the risk that issuers and intermediaries would
circumvent the requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding. For example, allowing an issuer to
conduct an offering using more than one intermediary would make it more difficult for
intermediaries to determine whether an issuer is exceeding the $1 million aggregate offering limit.
We continue to believe that crowdfunding transactions made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6)
and activities associated with these transactions should occur over the Internet or other similar
electronic medium that is accessible to the public. Such an “online-only” requirement enables the
public to access offering information and share information publicly in a way that will allow
75

See Arctic Island Letter 1; Arctic Island Letter 4 (noting that a “platform” is actually a software program that
is accessible via the Internet and that a “website or other electronic medium” is merely a way to access the
platform, not the platform itself).

31

members of the crowd to share their views on whether to participate in the offering and fund the
business or idea. While we acknowledge, as one commenter observed, that there are forms of
communication that cannot be achieved online, 76 we nevertheless believe that the requirement that
the transaction be conducted exclusively through the intermediary’s platform will help to ensure
transparency, provide for ready availability of information in one place to all investors, and
promote greater uniformity in the distribution of information among investors. We also do not
believe that funding portals should be permitted to physically meet with investors to solicit
investments and offerings on its platform, or host launch parties, as one commenter recommended,
because these activities likely violate the statutory prohibition on funding portals soliciting and
providing investment advice and recommendations. However, we continue to believe that
intermediaries should be able to engage in back office and other administrative functions other
than on their platforms.
In a change from the proposed rules, and consistent with the suggestions of commenters,
the final rules define “platform” as “a program or application accessible via the Internet or other
similar electronic communication medium through which a registered broker or a registered
funding portal acts as an intermediary in a transaction involving the offer or sale of securities in
reliance on Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6))” [emphasis added]. 77 We
believe that this definition is more technically accurate and also will accommodate innovation in
the event of technological advancements. We are moving the definition of “platform” from Rule
100 to Rule 300(c) so that it will be located alongside the other Regulation Crowdfunding
definitions related to intermediaries. Also, in a change from the proposed rule, we are moving to

Rule 300(c) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

the definition of platform an instruction stating that an intermediary through which a
crowdfunding transaction is conducted may engage in back office or other administrative
functions other than on the intermediary’s platform. 78

Exclusion of Certain Issuers from Eligibility under Section 4(a)(6)

Securities Act Section 4A(f) excludes certain categories of issuers from eligibility to rely
on Section 4(a)(6) to engage in crowdfunding transactions. These are: (1) issuers that are not
organized under the laws of a state or territory of the United States or the District of Columbia; (2)
issuers that are subject to Exchange Act reporting requirements; 79 (3) investment companies as
defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”) 80 or companies
that are excluded from the definition of investment company under Section 3(b) or 3(c) of the
Investment Company Act; 81 and (4) any other issuer that the Commission, by rule or regulation,
determines appropriate.
a.

Proposed Rules

Rule 100(b) of Regulation Crowdfunding, as proposed, would exclude the categories of
issuers specifically identified in Section 4A(f). In addition, the proposed rules would exclude:
(1) issuers that are disqualified from relying on Section 4(a)(6) pursuant to the disqualification
provision in Rule 503(a) of Regulation Crowdfunding; (2) issuers that have sold securities in
reliance on Section 4(a)(6) if they have not filed with the Commission and provided to investors,
to the extent required, the ongoing annual reports required by Regulation Crowdfunding during
78

In the final rule, this is an instruction to Rule 300(c)(4). The instruction was proposed under proposed Rule
100(a)(3), but we believe it is more appropriate under the definition of platform because the instruction
explains that back office activities can happen off the platform.

79

These are issuers who are required to file reports with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Sections
13(a) (15 U.S.C. 78m(a)) or 15(d) (15 U.S.C. 78o(d)).

Comments on the Proposed Rules

Foreign Issuers, Exchange Act Reporting Companies, and Investment Companies. Several
commenters opposed the exclusion of foreign issuers, Exchange Act reporting companies, and
investment companies. 82 Other commenters, however, supported the exclusion of investment
companies or companies that are excluded from the definition of investment company under
Section 3(b) or 3(c) of the Investment Company Act. 83 Some commenters recommended that,
despite the exclusion of investment companies, the Commission allow a single purpose fund,
including LLCs and LPs, to conduct an offering in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) if such fund were
organized to invest in, or lend money to, a single company. 84
Delinquent in Ongoing Reporting. A number of commenters supported the exclusion of
issuers that are delinquent in their reporting obligations, 85 although others opposed the exclusion

4(a)(6)); Ritter Letter (asking for clarification regarding companies that are excluded from the definition of

of foreign issuers over concerns that investors would not have Title III protections when investing in foreign
issuers and that investors’ ability to invest in early opportunities would be reduced).

of delinquent issuers. 86 Some commenters suggested options such as disclosure of the issuer’s
reporting delinquency in its offering documents or on its website or a cure provision. 87
We also received comments about whether the exclusion should extend to issuers that are
delinquent in other reporting requirements (e.g., updates on the progress of the issuer in meeting
the target offering amount, issuers whose affiliates have failed to comply with the ongoing
reporting requirements, and issuers with an officer, director, or controlling shareholder who
served in a similar capacity with another issuer that failed to file its ongoing reports).
Commenters generally opposed extending the exclusion beyond issuers delinquent in their
ongoing annual reports during the two years immediately preceding the filing of the required new
offering statement. 88 Further, two commenters opposed the idea of excluding an issuer whose
officer, director, or controlling shareholder served in a similar capacity with another issuer that
failed to file its annual reports. 89
Business Plans. Commenters were divided on excluding issuers that have no specific
business plan from eligibility to rely on Section 4(a)(6). 90 Commenters, however, supported the

requirements as a condition to the Section 4(a)(6) exemption and create a notice and cure provision in the

Final Rules

We are adopting the issuer eligibility requirements as proposed, with the addition of two
clarifications. As noted above, Section 4A(f) expressly excludes foreign issuers, Exchange Act
reporting companies and companies that are investment companies as defined in the Investment
Company Act or companies that are excluded from the definition of investment company under
Section 3(b) or 3(c) of the Investment Company Act from the exemption for crowdfunding
transactions provided by Section 4(a)(6). Although some commenters expressed concerns about
these statutory exclusions, including that such exclusions could limit the investment choices of
crowdfunding investors, we are not creating additional exemptions for these categories of issuers.
In reaching this determination, we have considered that the primary purpose of Section 4(a)(6), as
we understand it, is to facilitate capital formation by early stage companies that might not
otherwise have access to capital. 92 As a general matter, we do not believe that Exchange Act
reporting companies, investment companies and foreign issuers accessing the U.S. capital markets
constitute the types of issuers that Section 4(a)(6) and Regulation Crowdfunding are intended to
benefit. Moreover, we believe that certain of these issuers, such as foreign issuers or investment
companies, may present unique risks that would make them unsuitable for the scaled regulatory
might be deemed after-the-fact to be too non-specific to have permitted reliance on Section 4(a)(6), thus
exposing that issuer to a potential Section 5 violation); FundHub Letter 1; Projectheureka Letter; Public

(“Crowdfunding is the best of microfinancing and crowdsourcing. You use a wide network of individuals
and you can raise capital for your new business, your start-up, or your small business.”).

regime associated with securities-based crowdfunding transactions. Accordingly, the final rules
exclude these categories of issuers from Regulation Crowdfunding. 93
We are not creating, as suggested by some commenters, 94 an exception to this exclusion
for a single purpose fund organized to invest in, or lend money to, a single company. The statute
specifically excludes investment funds from eligibility to rely on Section 4(a)(6) and investment
fund issuers present considerations different from those for non-fund issuers.
In addition to these statutorily excluded categories of issuers, the final rules also exclude,
as proposed, several additional categories of issuers. Below we discuss each of these additional
categories:
Disqualification Provisions. As discussed further in Section II.E.6 below, the final rules
also exclude issuers that are disqualified from relying on Section 4(a)(6). 95
Delinquent in Ongoing Reporting. Consistent with the proposed rules and the views of a
number of commenters, 96 the final rules exclude an issuer that has sold securities in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6) if the issuer has not filed with the Commission and provided to investors, to the
extent required, the ongoing annual reports required by Regulation Crowdfunding 97 during the
two years immediately preceding the filing of the required new offering statement. 98 As discussed
further in Section II.B.2 below, we believe that the annual ongoing reporting requirement will

benefit investors by enabling them to consider updated information about the issuer, thereby
allowing them to make more informed investment decisions. If issuers fail to comply with this
requirement, we do not believe that they should have the benefit of relying on the exemption
under Section 4(a)(6) again until they file, to the extent required, the two most recent annual
reports. 99 In addition, as discussed further in Section II.B.1 below, in a modification to the
proposed rules, the final rules require an issuer to disclose in its offering statement and annual
report if it, or any of its predecessors, previously failed to comply with the ongoing reporting
requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding.
We note that some commenters read the provision requiring issuers to have filed their two
most recent annual reports to mean that the disqualification would be triggered only after the
issuer was delinquent for two consecutive years or that an issuer would be disqualified for two
years. 100 Instead, the final rule requires that any ongoing annual report that was due during the
two years immediately preceding the currently contemplated offering must be filed before an
issuer may rely on the Section 4(a)(6) exemption. For example, if more than 120 days have
passed since the issuer’s fiscal year end and the issuer has not filed the required annual report for
that most recently ended fiscal year, the issuer will not be able to conduct a new offering of
securities in reliance on the Section 4(a)(6) exemption until the delinquent annual report has been
filed. Similarly, if an issuer did file an annual report for the most recently ended fiscal year but
did not file an annual report for the fiscal year prior to that, the issuer will not be able to rely on

99

We note that even if an issuer has regained eligibility to rely on Regulation Crowdfunding, the Commission
could still bring an enforcement action under the federal securities laws based on the issuer’s failure to make
the required filings. In addition, as discussed in Section II.E.4., new Rule 12g-6 provides an exemption from
Section 12(g) conditioned, among other things, on the issuer’s compliance with the annual reporting
requirements of Rule 202 of Regulation Crowdfunding.

100

See, e.g., Consumer Federation Letter; Fund Democracy Letter; NASAA Letter.

38

the Section 4(a)(6) exemption until the missing report has been filed. In both cases, as soon as the
issuer has filed with the Commission and provided to investors both of the annual reports required
during the two years immediately preceding the filing of the required offering statement, the
issuer will be able to rely on the Section 4(a)(6) exemption. The final rule text includes an
instruction to clarify this requirement. 101
Consistent with the proposal and the recommendations of commenters, 102 we are not
extending the exclusion to issuers that are delinquent in the progress update or termination of
reporting requirements, nor are we excluding issuers whose officer, director, or controlling
shareholder served in a similar capacity with another issuer that failed to file its annual reports.
Extending the exclusion to those issuers would impose more stringent requirements than those
faced by current reporting companies and issuers under Regulation A.
Business Plans. The final rules also exclude an issuer that has no specific business plan or
has indicated that its business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified
company or companies. 103 We believe that the exemption under Section 4(a)(6) is intended to
provide an issuer with an early stage project, idea or business an opportunity to share it publicly
with a wider range of investors. Those investors may then share information with each other
about the opportunity and use that information to decide whether or not to invest. Thus, we
believe that an issuer engaging in crowdfunding under the exemption should give the public

103

See Rule 101(b)(6) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

39

sufficient information about a particular proposed project or business to allow investors to make
an informed investment decision. 104
As discussed in the proposal, we are cognizant of the challenges noted by some
commenters 105 in distinguishing between early-stage proposals that have information sufficient to
support the crowdfunding mechanism and those that cannot by their terms do so. After
considering the comments received, 106 we continue to believe that the rules should exclude issuers
that have no specific business plan or whose business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition
with an unidentified company or companies. We understand that issuers engaging in
crowdfunding transactions may have businesses at various stages of development in differing
industries, and therefore, we believe that a specific “business plan” for such issuers could
encompass a wide range of project descriptions, articulated ideas, and business models.
Overall, we believe that the exclusions in the final rules appropriately consider the need to
limit the potential risks to investors that could result from extending issuer eligibility to certain
types of entities without unduly limiting the benefits of the exemption as a tool for capital
formation.

These disclosures include:
•

the name, legal status, physical address and website address of the issuer; 107

•

the names of the directors and officers (and any persons occupying a similar
status or performing a similar function), and each person holding more than
20 percent of the shares of the issuer; 108

•

a description of the business of the issuer and the anticipated business plan
of the issuer; 109

•

a description of the stated purpose and intended use of the proceeds of the
offering sought by the issuer with respect to the target offering amount; 111

•

and regular updates about the progress of the issuer in meeting the target

In addition, Section 4A(b)(1)(I) specifies that the Commission may require additional
disclosures for the protection of investors and in the public interest.
As discussed further in Section II.B.3 below, we are requiring issuers to file these
disclosures with the Commission on Form C. 115 Unless otherwise indicated in the form,
Form C must be filed in the standard format of eXtensible Markup Language (XML). The
XML-based fillable portion of Form C will enable issuers to provide information in a
convenient medium without requiring the issuer to purchase or maintain additional
software or technology. This will provide the Commission and the public with readily
available data about offerings made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6). Other required
disclosure that is not required to be provided in the XML-based text boxes will be filed as
attachments to Form C. We are not mandating a specific presentation format for the
attachments to Form C; however, the final Form C does include an optional Q&A format
that crowdfunding issuers may use to provide disclosures that are not required to be filed
in XML format. 116 We believe that this optional format should help reduce the burden on
crowdfunding issuers of preparing disclosures.
By filing Form C with the Commission and providing it to the relevant
intermediary, issuers will satisfy the requirement of Securities Act Section 4A(b) that

114

Section 4A(b)(1)(H). Specifically, Section 4A(b)(1)(H) requires a description of: “(i) terms of the securities
of the issuer being offered and each other class of security of the issuer…; (ii) a description of how the
exercise of the rights held by the principal shareholders of the issuer could negatively impact the purchasers
of the securities being offered; (iii) the name and ownership level of each existing shareholder who owns
more than 20 percent of any class of the securities of the issuer; (iv) how the securities being offered are
being valued…; and (v) the risks to purchasers of the securities relating to minority ownership in the issuer,
the risks associated with corporate actions, including additional issuances of shares, a sale of the issuer or of
assets of the issuer, or transactions with related parties.”

115

Issuers will use Form C to provide the required disclosures about the crowdfunding transaction and the
information required to be filed annually. See Section II.B.3.

See Item 1 of General Instruction III to Form C of Regulation Crowdfunding.

42

issuers relying on Section 4(a)(6) must “file with the Commission and provide to investors
and the relevant broker of funding portal, and make available to potential investors”
certain information. In a clarifying change from the proposal, we have moved the
definition of “investor” from proposed Rule 300(c)(4) to Rule 100(d) to clarify that for
purposes of all of Regulation Crowdfunding, “investor” includes any investor or any
potential investor, as the context requires. 117 In connection with this clarifying move we
have deleted the phrase “and make available to potential investors” each time it appeared
in the proposed Rules 201 and 203 to avoid redundancy. 118
Additionally, as we clarify in the final rules, to the extent that some of the required
disclosures overlap, issuers are not required to duplicate disclosures.

General Information about the Issuer, Officers
and Directors, and Certain Shareholders
(i)

Proposed Rules

To implement Sections 4A(b)(1)(A) and (B), we proposed in Rule 201 of Regulation
Crowdfunding to require an issuer to disclose information about its legal status, directors, officers
and certain shareholders and how interested parties may contact the issuer. Specifically, we
proposed to require that an issuer disclose:
•

its name and legal status, including its form of organization, jurisdiction in which it
is organized and date of organization;

•

its physical address and its website address; and

117

See Rule 100(d) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

118

See Rules 201 and 203(a) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

43

•

the names of the directors and officers, including any persons occupying a similar
status or performing a similar function, all positions and offices with the issuer held
by such persons, the period of time in which such persons served in the positions or
offices and their business experience during the past three years, including:
o each person’s principal occupation and employment, including whether any
officer is employed by another employer; and
o the name and principal business of any corporation or other organization in
which such occupation and employment took place.

We proposed to define “officer” consistent with the definition in Securities Act Rule 405
and in Exchange Act Rule 3b-2. We further proposed to require disclosure of the business
experience of directors and officers of the issuer during the past three years.
Section 4A(b)(1)(B) requires disclosure of “the names of . . . each person holding more
than 20 percent of the shares of the issuer.” In contrast, Section 4A(b)(1)(H)(iii) requires
disclosure of the “name and ownership level of each existing shareholder who owns more than 20
percent of any class of the securities of the issuer” (emphasis added). We proposed in Rule 201(c)
to require disclosure of the names of persons, as of the most recent practicable date, who are the
beneficial owners of 20 percent or more of the issuer’s outstanding voting equity securities,
calculated on the basis of voting power (“20 Percent Beneficial Owners”). Neither
Section 4A(b)(1)(B) nor Section 4A(b)(1)(H)(iii) states as of what date the beneficial ownership
should be calculated. We proposed in Rule 201(c) to require issuers to calculate beneficial
ownership as of the most recent practicable date.

44

(ii)

Comments on the Proposed Rules

Of the commenters that addressed the proposed issuer, officer and director disclosure
rules, some generally supported them, 119 while others opposed specific disclosure requirements.
For example, one commenter opposed requiring issuers to disclose a website address. 120 Other
commenters opposed requiring issuers to disclose the business experience of their officers and
directors, 121 while one commenter suggested narrowing the definition of the term “officer.” 122
Some commenters expressed opposition to any revision to the proposed rules that would require
disclosure of any court orders, judgments or civil litigation involving any directors and officers. 123
Some commenters supported the proposed three-year time period to be covered by the
officer and director disclosure rules, 124 while others recommended that officer and director
disclosure cover the previous five years. 125 Some commenters recommended we require
additional disclosures about an issuer’s officers, directors and persons occupying a similar status
or performing a similar function. 126

officers and directors or their family members, as well as any 10 percent beneficial holdings they may have

45

A few commenters commented on the proposed 20 Percent Beneficial Owner rules. One
commenter supported the requirement to disclose the names of persons who are the 20 Percent
Beneficial Owners, 127 while one commenter opposed the requirement. 128 One commenter
recommended that, to provide greater certainty for investors and more guidance for issuers, the
beneficial ownership be calculated as of a specific date, rather than the most recent practicable
date, and that the disclosure be updated when there are significant changes in beneficial
ownership. 129 Finally, one commenter recommended that the Commission keep the requirement
as simple as possible. 130
(iii)

Final Rules

We are adopting the issuer, officer and director, and 20 Percent Beneficial Owners
disclosure requirements largely as proposed. 131 An issuer will be required to disclose information
about its president, vice president, secretary, treasurer or principal financial officer, comptroller or
principal accounting officer and any person routinely performing similar functions. As noted by
at least one commenter, 132 an issuer may not have officers serving in each of these roles.
Accordingly, the final rules require the disclosure only to the extent an issuer has individuals
serving in these capacities or performing similar functions. 133 The required information includes
all positions and offices held with the issuer, the period of time in which such persons served in

the position or office and their prior business experience. 134 Contrary to the views of some
commenters, 135 we believe that additional disclosures about an issuer’s officers, directors and
persons occupying a similar status or performing a similar function would be unduly burdensome
and generally not necessary for investors to be in a position to make an informed investment
decision. Given the diverse nature of the startups and small businesses that we anticipate will
seek to raise capital in reliance on Section 4(a)(6), additional disclosures such as those
recommended by some commenters may not be relevant in all instances.
The required disclosure about the business experience of the directors and officers (and
any persons occupying a similar status or performing a similar function) must cover the past three
years, 136 which, as some commenters noted, 137 is shorter than the five-year period that applies to
issuers conducting registered offerings 138 or exempt offerings pursuant to Regulation A. 139 We
believe that startups and small businesses that may seek to raise capital in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6) generally will be smaller than the issuers conducting registered offerings or
exempt offerings pursuant to Regulation A, and generally are likely to have a more limited
operating history. 140 Therefore, in comparison to registered offerings and Regulation A, we
believe the three-year period is more relevant given the stage of development of these issuers and

should help to reduce compliance costs for issuers conducting offerings pursuant to Section
4(a)(6) while still providing investors with sufficient information about the business experience of
directors and officers of the issuer to make an informed investment decision.
Notwithstanding the suggestion of one commenter, and consistent with the statute, the
final rules require disclosure of an issuer’s website. 141 Given the Internet-based nature of
Crowdfunding, we anticipate that every issuer will have a website or be able to create one at a
minimal cost.
We also are adopting the 20 Percent Beneficial Owner disclosure requirement as proposed
with one modification. 142 Instead of requiring issuers to disclose the name of each 20 Percent
Beneficial Owner as of the most recent practicable date, we are requiring such disclosure as of the
most recent practicable date, but no earlier than 120 days prior to the date the offering statement
or report is filed. We believe that this change should address commenter concerns 143 about the
discretion afforded by the proposed “most recent practicable date.” While we are not adding to
Rule 201(c) a specific requirement that the disclosure be updated when there are significant
changes in beneficial ownership, as requested by one commenter, 144 to the extent a material
change in beneficial ownership takes place during the offering, an issuer would be required to file
an amended offering statement on Form C/A: Amendment.
As stated in the Proposing Release, we believe that the universe of 20 Percent Beneficial
Owners should be the same for the disclosure requirements and the disqualification provisions 145

because this would ease the burden on issuers by requiring them to identify only one set of
persons who would be the subject of these rules. We continue to believe that assessing beneficial
ownership based on total outstanding voting securities is consistent with Section 4A(b)(1)(B).
Section 4A(b)(1)(B) is not limited to voting equity securities, but we believe the limitation is
necessary to clarify how beneficial ownership should be calculated since issuers could potentially
have multiple classes of securities with different voting powers.
(b)

Description of the Business
(i)

Proposed Rules

Consistent with Section 4A(b)(1)(C), we proposed in Rule 201(d) of Regulation
Crowdfunding to require an issuer to disclose information about its business and business plan.
The proposed rules did not specify the disclosures that an issuer would need to include in the
description of the business and the business plan.
(ii)

Comments on the Proposed Rules

While several commenters expressed concerns about requiring an issuer to disclose a
description of its business and business plan, 146 most commenters supported this proposed
requirement. 147 Some commenters recommended that the disclosure include specific items, such
as disclosure of any material contracts of the issuer, any material litigation or any outstanding
court order or judgment affecting the issuer or its property; 148 the issuer’s business value
proposition, revenue model, team, regulatory issues and executive compensation; 149 how the

outside recommendations about the validity of the business, backgrounds of the individuals
involved and prototypes or concept drawings. 151 One commenter recommended that the
disclosure requirement be scaled to match the size of the offering. 152
Some commenters recommended that the Commission provide a non-exclusive list of the
types of information an issuer should consider disclosing, templates, examples or other guidance
to assist the issuer in complying with this disclosure requirement. 153 One commenter
recommended that the Commission not specify the information to be included in the description of
the business or the business plan. 154 Commenters also opposed revising the proposed business
description requirement to require the description to include the information requirements of Items
101(a)(2) and 101(h) 155 of Regulation S-K. 156
(iii)

Final Rules

Consistent with the proposal, Rule 201(d) requires an issuer to disclose information about
its business and business plan. We are not modifying the proposed rule, as some commenters
recommended, 157 to specify the disclosures that an issuer must include in the description of the
business and the business plan or to provide a non-exclusive list of the types of information an

issuer should consider disclosing. We anticipate that issuers engaging in crowdfunding
transactions may have businesses at various stages of development in different industries, and
therefore, we believe that the rules should provide flexibility for these issuers regarding what
information they disclose about their businesses. This flexible approach is consistent with the
suggestion of one commenter that the business plan requirements be scaled to match the size of
the offering. 158 We also are concerned that a non-exclusive list of the types of information an
issuer should consider providing would be viewed as a de facto disclosure requirement that all
issuers would feel compelled to meet and would, therefore, undermine the intended flexibility of
the final rules.
(c)

Use of Proceeds
(i)

Proposed Rules

Consistent with Section 4A(b)(1)(E), we proposed in Rule 201(i) of Regulation
Crowdfunding to require an issuer to provide a description of the purpose of the offering and
intended use of the offering proceeds. We expected that such disclosure would provide a
sufficiently detailed description of the intended use of proceeds to permit investors to evaluate the
investment. Under the proposed rules, if an issuer did not have definitive plans for the proceeds,
but instead had identified a range of possible uses, then the issuer would be required to identify
and describe each probable use and factors affecting the selection of each particular use. In
addition, if an issuer indicated that it would accept proceeds in excess of the target offering
amount, 159 the issuer would be required to provide a separate, reasonably detailed description of
the purpose and intended use of any excess proceeds with similar specificity.
158

See Consumer Federation Letter.

159

See Section II.B(1)(d) below for a description of the final rule’s disclosure requirements with respect to
target amounts.

51

(ii)

Comments on the Proposed Rules

Most commenters supported the requirement that issuers disclose the intended use of the
offering proceeds. 160 One commenter recommended that we prescribe the use of proceeds
disclosure or provide a list of examples that issuers should consider when providing such
disclosures. 161 Others recommended a variety of circumstances under which an issuer should be
required to update the use of proceeds disclosure. 162
(iii)

Final Rules

We are adopting the use of proceeds disclosure requirement substantially as proposed in
Rule 201(i). An issuer will be required to provide a reasonably detailed description of the purpose
of the offering, such that investors are provided with enough information to understand how the
offering proceeds will be used. 163 While one commenter 164 recommended that we prescribe this
disclosure or provide a list of examples, we believe a more prescriptive rule would not best
accommodate a diverse range of issuers. Instead, below we provide several examples of the
disclosures issuers should consider making with respect to various uses of proceeds.
The disclosure requirement is designed to provide investors with sufficient information to
evaluate the investment. For example, an issuer may intend to use the proceeds of an offering to
acquire assets or businesses, compensate the intermediary or its own employees or repurchase

deviations); Whitaker Chalk Letter (material change); Wilson Letter (any deviation). See also Section II.B.3

outstanding securities of the issuer. In providing its description, an issuer would need to consider
the appropriate level of detail to provide investors about the assets or businesses that the issuer
anticipates acquiring, based on its particular facts and circumstances, so that the investors could
make informed decisions. If the proceeds will be used to compensate existing employees or to
hire new employees, the issuer should consider disclosing whether the proceeds will be used for
salaries or bonuses and how many employees it plans to hire, as applicable. If the issuer will
repurchase outstanding issuer securities, it should consider disclosing its plans, terms and purpose
for repurchasing the securities. An issuer also should consider disclosing how long the proceeds
will satisfy the operational needs of the business. If an issuer does not have definitive plans for
the proceeds, but instead has identified a range of possible uses, then the issuer should identify
and describe each probable use and the factors the issuer may consider in allocating proceeds
among the potential uses. 165 If an issuer indicates that it will accept proceeds in excess of the
target offering amount, the issuer must provide a reasonably detailed description of the purpose,
method for allocating oversubscriptions, and intended use of any excess proceeds with similar
specificity. 166
(d)

Target Offering Amount and Deadline
(i)

Proposed Rules

Consistent with Section 4A(b)(1)(F), we proposed in Rule 201(g) of Regulation
Crowdfunding to require issuers to disclose the target offering amount and the deadline to reach
the target offering amount. In addition, we proposed in Rule 201(h) to require an issuer to
disclose whether it would accept investments in excess of the target offering amount, and, if it

165

See Instruction to paragraph (i) of Rule 201 of Regulation Crowdfunding.

166

See Instruction to paragraph (i) of Rule 201 of Regulation Crowdfunding.

53

would, we proposed to require the issuer to disclose, at the commencement of the offering, the
maximum amount it would accept. The issuer also, under proposed Rule 201(h), would be
required to disclose, at the commencement of the offering, how shares in oversubscribed offerings
would be allocated. We further proposed in Rule 201(j) to require issuers to describe the process
to cancel an investment commitment or to complete the transaction once the target amount is met,
including a statement that:
•

investors may cancel an investment commitment until 48 hours prior to the
deadline identified in the issuer’s offering materials; 167

•

the intermediary will notify investors when the target offering amount has been
met;

•

if an issuer reaches the target offering amount prior to the deadline identified in its
offering materials, it may close the offering early if it provides at least five
business days’ notice prior to that new deadline (absent a material change that
would require an extension of the offering and reconfirmation of the investment
commitment); 168 and

•

if an investor does not cancel an investment commitment before the 48-hour period
prior to the offering deadline, the funds will be released to the issuer upon closing
of the offering and the investor will receive securities in exchange for his or her
investment.

In addition, proposed Rule 201(k) would require issuers to disclose that if an investor does
not reconfirm his or her investment commitment after a material change is made to the offering,
167

Section II.C.6 further discusses the cancellation provisions.

168

Id.

54

the investor’s investment commitment will be cancelled and committed funds will be returned.
Proposed Rule 201(g) also would require issuers to disclose that if the sum of the investment
commitments does not equal or exceed the target offering amount at the time of the offering
deadline, no securities will be sold in the offering, investment commitments will be cancelled and
committed funds will be returned. 169
(ii)

Final Rules

Commenters were supportive of the proposed rules, and we are adopting the target offering
amount and deadline disclosure rules as proposed. 170 As an example of how the final rules will
apply, if an issuer sets a target offering amount of $80,000 but is willing to accept up to $650,000,
the issuer will be required to disclose both the $80,000 target offering amount and the $650,000
maximum offering amount that it will accept. 171 In an instance where an issuer reaches the target
offering amount prior to the deadline identified in its offering materials, it may close the offering
early if it provides at least five business days’ notice about the new offering deadline as set forth
in Rules 201(j) and 302(d) of Regulation Crowdfunding. Accelerating the deadline would not
require an extension of the offering and reconfirmation of the investment commitment; however,
issuers would need to consider whether any material change occurred that would require an
extension and reconfirmation from investors. 172
169

See Section 4A(a)(7) (requiring intermediaries to “ensure that all offering proceeds are only provided to the
issuer when the aggregate capital raised from all investors is equal to or greater than a target offering
amount….”) and discussion in Section II.C.6.

170

See Rules 201(g), 201(h), 201(j) and 201(k) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

171

The issuer in this case also will need to disclose the intended use of the additional proceeds. See Instruction
to paragraph (i) of Rule 201 of Regulation Crowdfunding. See also Section II.B.1.a.i(c) above. In addition,
the issuer in this case will be required to provide financial statements reviewed by an independent public
accountant (rather than certain tax return information for the most recently completed fiscal year and
financial statements certified by the principal executive officer). See Section II.B.1.a.ii for a discussion of
the financial statement requirements.

172

Section II.B.1.c discusses the amendment and reconfirmation requirements.

55

We do not believe it is necessary for us to prescribe how oversubscribed offerings must be
allocated if the issuer is required to disclose, at the commencement of the offering, how shares in
oversubscribed offerings will be allocated. Commenters were supportive of this approach, 173 and
we believe this disclosure should provide investors with important information while maintaining
flexibility for issuers to structure the offering as they believe appropriate.
We believe that investors in a crowdfunding transaction will benefit from clear disclosure
about their right to cancel, the circumstances under which an issuer may close an offering early
and the need to reconfirm the investment commitment under certain circumstances, as they will be
more aware of their rights to rescind an investment commitment. Therefore, we are adopting
disclosure requirements covering these points, as proposed.
(e)

Offering Price

Consistent with Section 4A(b)(1)(G), we proposed in Rule 201(l) of Regulation
Crowdfunding to require an issuer to disclose the offering price of the securities or, in the
alternative, the method for determining the price, so long as before the sale each investor is
provided in writing the final price and all required disclosures.
Commenters were supportive of the proposed disclosure 174 and we are adopting the
offering price disclosure rules as proposed. 175 We believe that disclosure of the price or the
methods used for determining the price, coupled with investors’ rights to cancel their investment
upon determination of the final price, provide sufficient opportunity for investors to evaluate the
price.
173

See, e.g., CFA Institute Letter; RoC Letter; RocketHub Letter; Wilson Letter.

174

See, e.g., CFA Institute Letter; Wilson Letter. As discussed below, however, a few commenters
recommended that the Commission require a fixed price at the commencement of an offering. See, e.g.,
Joinvestor Letter; RocketHub Letter. We address those comments in Section II.B.6.

175

See Rule 201(l) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

56

(f)

Ownership and Capital Structure
(i)

Proposed Rules

Consistent with Section 4A(b)(1)(H), we proposed in Rule 201(m) of Regulation
Crowdfunding to require an issuer to provide a description of its ownership and capital structure.
This disclosure would include:
•

the terms of the securities being offered and each other class of security of the
issuer, including the number of securities being offered and those outstanding,
whether or not such securities have voting rights, any limitations on such voting
rights, how the terms of the securities being offered may be modified and a
summary of the differences between such securities and each other class of security
of the issuer, and how the rights of the securities being offered may be materially
limited, diluted or qualified by the rights of any other class of security of the issuer;

•

a description of how the exercise of the rights held by the principal shareholders of
the issuer could affect the purchasers of the securities;

•

the name and ownership level of persons who are 20 Percent Beneficial Owners;

•

how the securities being offered are being valued, and examples of methods for
how such securities may be valued by the issuer in the future, including during
subsequent corporate actions;

•

the risks to purchasers of the securities relating to minority ownership in the issuer
and the risks associated with corporate actions including additional issuances of
securities, issuer repurchases of securities, a sale of the issuer or of assets of the
issuer or transactions with related parties; and

•

a description of the restrictions on the transfer of the securities.
57

As proposed, the rules would require disclosure of the number of securities being offered
and those outstanding, whether or not such securities have voting rights, any limitations on such
voting rights and a description of the restrictions on the transfer of the securities.
(ii)

Comments on the Proposed Rules

A number of commenters supported the proposed ownership and capital structure
disclosure rules, 176 while two commenters opposed them as burdensome. 177 One of these
commenters suggested that issuers should only be required to disclose the price of a share and the
percentage ownership represented by a share, and noted that the principals of an issuer conducting
a crowdfunding offering may not consider the issuer’s capital structure or whether its
shareholders will have voting rights. 178
(iii)

Final Rules

We are adopting the ownership and capital structure disclosure rules as proposed, with the
addition of language specifying that beneficial ownership must be calculated no earlier than 120
days prior to the date of the filing of the offering statement or report, 179 consistent with the
treatment of beneficial ownership elsewhere in the rule. 180 Investors in crowdfunding transactions
will benefit from clear disclosure about the terms of the securities being offered and each other
class of security of the issuer. The final rules require disclosure of the number of securities being
offered and those outstanding, whether or not such securities have voting rights, any limitations on

such voting rights 181 and a description of the restrictions on the transfer of securities. 182 Although
Section 4A(b)(1)(H) does not specifically call for all aspects of this disclosure, we believe that
such disclosure is necessary to provide investors with a more complete picture of the issuer’s
capital structure than would be obtained solely pursuant to the statutory requirements. This
should help investors better evaluate the terms of the offer before making an investment decision.
(g)

Additional Disclosure Requirements
(i)

Proposed Rules

We also proposed to require the following additional disclosures: 183
•

disclosure of the name, SEC file number and Central Registration Depository
number (“CRD number”) (as applicable) 184 of the intermediary through which the
offering is being conducted;

•

disclosure of the amount of compensation paid to the intermediary for conducting
the offering, including the amount of any referral or other fees associated with the
offering;

•

certain legends in the offering statement;

•

disclosure of the current number of employees of the issuer;

•

a discussion of the material factors that make an investment in the issuer
speculative or risky;

59

•

a description of the material terms of any indebtedness of the issuer, including the
amount, interest rate, maturity date and any other material terms;

•

disclosure of any exempt offerings conducted within the past three years; and

•

disclosure of related-party transactions since the beginning of the issuer’s last fiscal
year in excess of five percent of the aggregate amount of capital raised by the
issuer in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) during the preceding 12-month period,
inclusive of the amount the issuer seeks to raise in the current offering.
(ii)

Comments on the Proposed Rules

Identity of the Intermediary. Several commenters supported the proposed requirement that
issuers identify the intermediary through which the offering is being conducted. 185 Two
commenters opposed such a requirement as unnecessary. 186
Compensation Paid to the Intermediary. Some commenters supported the proposed
requirement that issuers disclose the amount of compensation paid to the intermediary for
conducting the offering, including the amount of any referral or other fees associated with the
offering. 187 One commenter noted that to the extent components of the intermediary’s fee are
percentage based, the exact amount of the compensation may not be calculable at the onset of an

offering. 188 A few commenters recommended that issuers also should disclose all payments and
fees, if any, they make to the intermediary. 189
Legends. Comments were mixed as to the proposed requirement that issuers include
specified legends in the offering statement about the risks of investing in a crowdfunding
transaction and the required ongoing reports. Some commenters supported such a requirement, 190
while others opposed the requirement. 191
Current Number of Employees. While several commenters supported the proposed
requirement that issuers disclose their current number of employees, 192 two commenters opposed
such a requirement. 193 One commenter opposed this requirement, noting that the number of
employees is not useful for investors in evaluating early-stage startups, and is likely to increase
during the course of a crowdfunding offering conducted concurrently with an offering pursuant to
Rule 506(c). 194 This commenter also noted that many early-stage startups spend the majority of
their initial funds on consultants. 195 Another commenter noted that it may be unreasonably costly,
relative to the benefit gained, to accurately count the number of employees in instances where

provide examples of risks associated with crowdfunding offerings); Public Startup Letter 2; Startup Valley

needed because it is the responsibility of the intermediary to educate the public about this information).

or “half-time.” 196
Risk Factors. Commenters were divided as to the proposed requirement that issuers
discuss the material factors that make an investment in the issuer speculative or risky. A number
of commenters supported this proposed requirement, 197 while a number of others opposed it. 198
Some commenters recommended that we provide examples of, or develop standard disclosures
for, issuer risk factor discussions. 199
Indebtedness. Commenters supported the proposed requirement that issuers describe the
material terms of any indebtedness of the issuer. 200 Two commenters recommended that we
clarify that this disclosure requirement could be satisfied if the issuer includes such disclosure in
its financial statements. 201 Another recommended that we require issuers to disclose the identities
of their creditors. 202
Prior Exempt Offerings. Commenters supported the proposed requirement that issuers
disclose their prior exempt offerings. 203 One commenter recommended that we require additional

disclosure to help non-accredited investors understand how well aligned their interests are with
earlier accredited investors, 204 while other commenters suggested scaling back this disclosure in
order to contain costs. 205
Related-Party Transactions. Commenters generally supported our proposal to require
disclosure of certain related-party transactions between the issuer and any director or officer of the
issuer, any person who is a 20 Percent Beneficial Owner, any promoter of the issuer (if the issuer
was incorporated or organized within the past three years) or immediate family members of the
foregoing persons. 206 Rather than using the definition of “immediate family member” contained
in Item 404 of Regulation S-K, 207 one commenter recommended that we use a common definition
for “immediate family member” in the related-party transactions context and “member of the
family of the purchaser or the equivalent” in the resale restrictions context. 208

to transactions since the beginning of the issuer’s last fiscal year. 209 Other commenters

of related-party transactions based on the size of the offering, 211 while a few commenters
suggested alternatives to such proposal. 212
Other Disclosures. Several commenters specifically recommended that we not require any
additional disclosures. 213 One commenter pointed out that there was no “catch-all” clause
requiring any other material information not specifically enumerated in Rule 201 of Regulation
Crowdfunding. 214
Other commenters recommended that we require issuers to disclose general
information; 215 executive compensation; 216 zoning issues and issues with the Environmental
Protection Agency or Food and Drug Administration; 217 a copy of their articles of
incorporation; 218 the extent to which they are affected by market risk, material contracts, business

of commenters recommended ways to make it easier for investors to locate an issuer’s annual
reports. 221
(iii)

Final Rules

We are adopting the additional disclosure requirements as proposed in Rule 201 with
several modifications. As discussed below, we have added a requirement to disclose any material
information necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. 222 We also have modified the rule to require disclosure of
the compensation to be paid to the intermediary so that it could be disclosed either as a dollar
amount or percentage of the offering amount or as a good faith estimate if the exact amount is not
available at the time of the filing. 223 We also have added a requirement to disclose the location on
the issuer’s website where investors will be able to find the issuer’s annual report and the date by
which such report will be available on the issuer’s website. 224 In addition, we have added a
requirement to disclose whether the issuer or any of its predecessors previously has failed to
comply with the ongoing reporting requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding. 225

We agree with the suggestion by some commenters that issuers should not be required to
disclose in multiple places the information required to be provided to investors. 226 As a result, to
avoid duplicative disclosure, an issuer will not be required to repeat what is already provided
elsewhere in the issuer’s disclosure, including the financial statements. 227 Issuers may crossreference within the offering statement or report, including to the location of the information in
the financial statements. 228
Identity of the Intermediary. Despite the suggestion of one commenter that this disclosure
is unnecessary, 229 we believe requiring an issuer to identify the name, SEC file number and CRD
number (as applicable) of the intermediary through which the offering is being conducted should
assist investors and regulators in obtaining information about the offering and use of the
exemption.230 It also could help investors obtain background information on the intermediary, for
instance, through filings made by the intermediary with the Commission, as well as through the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority’s (“FINRA”) BrokerCheck system for broker-dealers 231
or a similar system, if created, for funding portals.
Compensation Paid to the Intermediary. Requiring an issuer to disclose the amount of
compensation paid to the intermediary for conducting the offering, including the amount of any
referral or other fees associated with the offering, will permit investors and regulators to
determine how much of the proceeds of the offering is used to compensate the intermediary.

Based on a comment received, 232 we understand that in some instances the exact amount of
compensation and fees to be paid to the intermediary will not be known at the time the Form C is
filed, and we have modified the rule from the proposal to address this issue. Consistent with this
understanding, and to avoid suggesting that only amounts certain and paid to date must be
disclosed, the final rules require disclosure of all compensation paid or to be paid to the
intermediary for conducting the offering, which may be disclosed as a dollar amount or as a
percentage of the offering amount. If the exact amount of the compensation paid or to be paid is
not available at the time of the filing, issuers are permitted to provide a good faith estimate. 233
In addition, we are modifying the rule text from the proposal to require issuers to disclose
any other direct or indirect interest in the issuer held by the intermediary, or any arrangement for
the intermediary to acquire such an interest. 234 The proposed rules would have prohibited an
intermediary from holding any financial interest in the issuers conducting offerings on its
platforms. However, as discussed in Section II.C.2.b below, the final rules permit intermediaries
to hold such interests. We believe that, similar to the amount of compensation paid to the
intermediary, an intermediary’s interests in an issuer and the issuer’s transaction could be material
to an investment decision in the issuer. Therefore, we believe that issuers should disclose such
interests to investors.
Legends. We are adopting this requirement as proposed. 235 The requirement for an issuer
to include in the offering statement specified legends about the risks of investing in a
crowdfunding transaction is intended to help investors understand the general risks of investing in
232

See RocketHub Letter.

67

a crowdfunding transaction. We continue to believe, despite the suggestions of some
commenters, 236 that requiring legends in each issuer’s offering statement, regardless of any
general warnings available on an intermediary’s platform, will provide additional investor
protection with minimal costs. For example, the requirement that an issuer include in the offering
statement certain legends about the required ongoing reports, including how those reports will be
made available to investors and how an issuer may terminate its ongoing reporting obligations,
will help investors understand an issuer’s ongoing reporting obligations and how they will be able
to access those reports.
Current Number of Employees. Consistent with the proposal and the recommendation of
several commenters, 237 the final rules require disclosure of the current number of employees. 238
We believe this disclosure is important to investors in evaluating a crowdfunding transaction
because it will give investors a sense of the size of the issuers using the exemption. We expect
that the early-stage issuers who are likely to use securities-based crowdfunding will not have
many employees, so we do not believe this requirement will be unreasonably burdensome.
Risk Factors. We are adopting this disclosure requirement as proposed. 239 While some
commenters expressed concerns about potential expenses or confusion associated with risk
disclosure, 240 we agree with those commenters who indicated that disclosure of the material
factors that make an investment in the issuer speculative or risky is important to help investors

understand the risks of investing in a specific issuer’s offering. 241 To help investors to better
understand these risks, we believe that risk factor disclosure should be tailored to the issuer’s
business and the offering and should not repeat the factors addressed in the required legends. 242
For similar reasons, we are not providing examples of, or developing standard disclosure for,
issuer risk factor discussions, as we believe issuers will be in the best positions to articulate the
risks associated with their business and offerings in light of their particular facts and
circumstances.
Indebtedness. Consistent with the proposal, we are adopting the requirement to provide a
description of the material terms of any indebtedness of the issuer. 243 We believe disclosure of
the material terms of any indebtedness of the issuer, including, among other items, the amount,
interest rate and maturity date of the indebtedness, is important to investors because servicing debt
could place additional pressures on an issuer in the early stages of development. We expect that
for many issuers this information will be included in the financial statements, which will satisfy
this reporting requirement. 244
While one commenter recommended that we require issuers to disclose the identities of
their creditors, 245 we do not believe, as a general matter, that such disclosure would provide

69

meaningful information to investors. Accordingly, under the final rules, such disclosure is
required only to the extent the creditor’s identity is a material aspect of the indebtedness. 246
Prior Exempt Offerings. Consistent with the proposal and with commenters’
recommendations, we are requiring issuers to provide disclosure about the exempt offerings that
they conducted within the past three years. 247 For each exempt offering within the past three
years, issuers must describe the date of the offering, the offering exemption relied upon, the type
of securities offered and the amount of securities sold and the use of proceeds. 248 We believe that
information about prior offerings will better inform investors about the capital structure of the
issuer and will provide information about how prior offerings were valued.
Related-Party Transactions. We are adopting this disclosure requirement substantially as
proposed. 249 Related-party transactions create potential conflicts of interest that may result in
actions that benefit the related parties at the expense of the issuer or the investors. After
considering the comments received, we continue to believe the related-party transactions
disclosure will assist investors in obtaining a more complete picture of the financial relationships
between certain related parties and the issuer and provide additional insight as to potential uses of
the issuer’s resources, including the proceeds of the offering. The final rule differs from the
proposal in that an issuer is required to disclose transactions with any person who is, as of the
most recent practicable date but no earlier than 120 days prior to the date the offering statement or
report is filed, the beneficial owner of 20 percent or more of the issuer’s outstanding voting equity
securities. Limiting the relevant period to 120 days prior to the date of the offering statement or

report is consistent with the treatment of beneficial ownership elsewhere in Regulation
Crowdfunding. 250 We also believe this limitation and the consistency it provides will help limit
compliance costs for issuers.
The final rule also includes an instruction to clarify that, for purposes of Rule 201(r), a
transaction includes, but is not limited to, any financial transaction, arrangement or relationship
(including any indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness) or any series of similar transactions,
arrangements or relationships. 251 This instruction is consistent with Item 404 of Regulation SK. 252
Given the early stage of development of the small businesses and startups that we expect
will seek to raise capital pursuant to Section 4(a)(6), as well as the investment limits prescribed by
the rules, we believe that limiting the disclosure of related-party transactions to transactions
occurring since the beginning of the issuer’s last fiscal year, as proposed, will help to limit
compliance costs for issuers while still providing investors with sufficient information to evaluate
the relationship between related parties and the issuer. 253 In addition, we are requiring issuers to
disclose only related-party transactions that, in the aggregate, are in excess of five percent of the
aggregate amount of capital raised by the issuer in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) during the
preceding 12-month period, inclusive of the amount the issuer seeks to raise in the current offering
under Section 4(a)(6). We also have added an instruction to clarify that any series of similar
transactions, arrangements or relationships should be aggregated for purposes of determining

250

See, e.g., Rules 201(c) and 201(m) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

251

See Instruction 2 to Rule 201(r) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

252

See Instruction 2 to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K [17 CFR 229.404(a)].

253

We note, however, that financial statements covering the two most recently completed fiscal years will
include disclosure of related-party transactions, as required by U.S. GAAP, for each of the years presented.

71

whether related-party transactions should be disclosed. 254 For example, an issuer seeking to raise
$1 million will be required to disclose related-party transactions that, in the aggregate, are in
excess of $50,000, which is the same dollar threshold required in Form 1-A 255 for offerings of any
size made pursuant to Tier 1 of Regulation A, 256 and an issuer that raises $250,000 will be
required to disclose such transactions in excess of $12,500. We believe that, in light of the sizes
and varieties of issuers that may make offerings in reliance on Section 4(a)(6), this approach could
mitigate the potential for the requirement to be disproportionate to the size of certain offerings and
issuers. While one commenter suggested we use a percentage threshold less than five percent, we
believe this threshold appropriately takes into consideration the need to provide investors with
relevant information about the issuer’s activities involving related parties during this crucial early
stage of development.
As suggested by one commenter, 257 in a change from the proposal, we are adopting a
definition for “member of the family” in the related-party transactions context that is consistent
with the definition of “member of the family of the purchaser or the equivalent” in the resale
restrictions context. 258 The final rule defines “member of the family” as a “child, stepchild,
grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse or spousal equivalent, sibling, mother-in-law,
father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, [including] adoptive
relationships” of any of the persons identified in Rules 201(r)(1), (r)(2) or (r)(3). 259 This

definition tracks the definition of “immediate family” in Exchange Act Rule 16a-1(e), 260 but with
the addition of “spousal equivalent,” which the final rule defines to mean “a cohabitant occupying
a relationship generally equivalent to that of a spouse.” 261 We believe a common definition of
“member of the family” that is consistent with our disclosure rules in other contexts 262 will
provide certainty for issuers in identifying the persons covered by the rule.
Other Disclosures. We are adopting this provision as proposed but with the addition of
three issuer disclosure requirements in response to comments received.
The first is a requirement that an issuer disclose the location on its website where investors
will be able to find the issuer’s annual report and the date by which such report will be available
on its website. 263 We believe this requirement addresses the concern expressed by commenters
that investors may not know where to find an issuer’s annual report. We do not believe physical
delivery of the annual report is necessary due to the electronic nature of the crowdfunding
marketplace, nor do we believe that e-mail delivery of the annual report is practical because the
issuer may not have access to e-mail addresses of its investors. Instead, we are requiring issuers
to disclose this information in the offering statement, which will assist investors in locating the
information while limiting the compliance costs for issuers.
The second additional disclosure requirement, as suggested by a commenter, 264 is a
requirement that the disclosure include any material information necessary in order to make the

73

statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 265
This provision should help ensure that investors have all of the material information they need on
which to base their investment decisions.
The third additional requirement, similar to suggestions from some commenters, 266
requires the issuer to disclose whether it or any of its predecessors previously failed to comply
with the ongoing reporting requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding. 267 While we continue to
believe, and the final rules provide, that only those issuers that have failed to file their two most
recent annual reports should be prohibited from relying on the exemption available under Section
4A(6), we also believe that any history of non-compliance with ongoing reporting obligations
would provide important information to investors about the issuer.
Although we appreciate that commenters made various suggestions for additional issuer
disclosure requirements, such as those relating to executive compensation, market risk and
material contracts, we are not mandating further disclosures. In adopting issuer requirements for
Regulation Crowdfunding, we have been mindful of the limited resources and start-up operations
of issuers likely to use security-based crowdfunding and have sought to consider the need to
provide investors with relevant information to make an informed investment decision while
limiting the compliance costs for issuers. We believe the issuer disclosure requirements we are
adopting along with other protections, such as investment limits, achieve this goal.

Financial Disclosure

Section 4A(b)(1)(D) requires “a description of the financial condition of the issuer.” It
also establishes a framework of tiered financial disclosure requirements based on aggregate target

the preceding 12-month period.
(a)

Financial Condition Discussion
(i)

Proposed Rules

Consistent with Section 4A(b)(1)(D), we proposed in Rule 201(s) of Regulation
Crowdfunding to require an issuer to provide a narrative discussion of its financial condition.
(ii)

Comments on the Proposed Rules

Commenters generally supported the proposed requirement that issuers provide a narrative
discussion of their financial condition. 268 One commenter expressed concern that the requirement
could be challenging for issuers at an early stage of development and result in duplicative
disclosure. 269 The same commenter suggested that issuers be encouraged, rather than mandated,
to discuss material historical operating results. 270
(iii)

Final Rules

We are adopting this requirement as proposed, with a few technical modifications. 271
Rule 201(s) clarifies that the description must include, to the extent material, a discussion of
liquidity, capital resources and historical results of operations. Rule 201(s) also includes an
instruction noting that issuers will be required to include a discussion of each period for which
financial statements are provided and a discussion of any material changes or trends known to
management in the financial condition and results of operations of the issuer subsequent to the

75

period for which financial statements are provided. 272 In connection with this instruction, an
issuer will need to consider whether more recent financial information is necessary to make the
disclosure in the offering document not misleading. The instruction in final Rule 201(s) was
included in proposed Rule 201(t) as an instruction to the financial statement requirements, but we
have moved this instruction to Rule 201(s) because it elicits narrative disclosure that we believe is
more appropriately presented as part of the discussion of the issuer’s financial condition. In
addition, another instruction clarifies that references to the issuer in Rule 201(s) refer to the issuer
and its predecessors, if any. 273
We expect that the discussion required by the final rule and instructions will inform
investors about the financial condition and results of operations of the issuer by providing
management’s perspective on the issuer’s operations and financial results, including information
about the issuer’s liquidity and capital resources and any known trends or uncertainties that could
materially affect the company’s results. Because issuers seeking to engage in crowdfunding
transactions will likely be smaller, less complex and at an earlier stage of development than
issuers conducting registered offerings or Exchange Act reporting companies, we expect that the
discussion generally will not, contrary to the concern of at least one commenter, 274 need to be as
lengthy or detailed as the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations of those issuers. Accordingly, we are not prescribing a specific content or format for
this information, but instead set forth general principles for making this disclosure. 275 The
discussion should address, to the extent material, the issuer’s historical results of operations in

76

addition to its liquidity and capital resources. If an issuer does not have a prior operating history,
the discussion should focus on financial milestones and operational, liquidity and other
challenges. If an issuer has a prior operating history, the discussion should focus on whether
historical earnings and cash flows are representative of what investors should expect in the future.
An issuer’s discussion of its financial condition should take into account the proceeds of the
offering and any other known or pending sources of capital. Issuers also should discuss how the
proceeds from the offering will affect their liquidity, whether these funds and any other additional
funds are necessary to the viability of the business and how quickly the issuer anticipates using its
available cash. In addition, issuers should describe the other available sources of capital to the
business, such as lines of credit or required contributions by principal shareholders. To the extent
these items of disclosure overlap with the issuer’s discussion of its business or business plan,
issuers are not required to make duplicate disclosures. 276 While we are not mandating a specific
presentation, we expect issuers to present the required disclosures, including any other
information that is material to an investor, in a clear and understandable manner.
(b)

Financial Disclosures
(i)

Proposed Rules

Proposed Rule 201(t) of Regulation Crowdfunding would have established financial
statement disclosure requirements that are based on aggregate target offering amounts within the
preceding 12-month period:
•

issuers offering $100,000 or less would be required to file with the Commission and
provide to investors and the relevant intermediary income tax returns filed by the issuer for

276

See Instruction to Rule 201 of Regulation Crowdfunding.

77

the most recently completed year (if any) and financial statements that are certified by the
principal executive officer to be true and complete in all material respects;
•

issuers offering more than $100,000, but not more than $500,000, would be required to file
with the Commission and provide to investors and the relevant intermediary financial
statements reviewed by a public accountant that is independent of the issuer; and

•

issuers offering more than $500,000 would be required to file with the Commission and
provide to investors and the relevant intermediary financial statements audited by a public
accountant that is independent of the issuer.
Under proposed Rule 201(t), issuers would be permitted to voluntarily provide financial

statements that meet the requirements for a higher aggregate target offering amount.
The proposed rules also would have set forth the following requirements for the financial
statements:
•

Basis of Accounting. All issuers would be required to file with the Commission and
provide to investors and the relevant intermediary a complete set of their financial
statements (balance sheets, income statements, statements of cash flows and statements of
changes in owners’ equity), prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”).

•

Public Accountant Requirements. To qualify as independent of the issuer, a public
accountant would be required to comply with the Commission’s independence rules,
which are set forth in Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X. 277

277

17 CFR 210.2-01.

78

•

Periods Covered in the Financial Statements. The financial statements would be required
to cover the shorter of the two most recently completed fiscal years or the period since
inception of the business.

•

Age of Financial Statements. During the first 120 days of the issuer’s fiscal year, an issuer
would be able to conduct an offering in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) and the related rules
using financial statements for the fiscal year prior to the most recently completed fiscal
year if the financial statements for the most recently completed fiscal year are not
otherwise available or required to be filed.

•

Review and Audit Standards. Reviewed financial statements would be required to be
reviewed in accordance with the Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review
Services (“SSARS”) issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
(“AICPA”). Audited financial statements would be required to be audited in accordance
with the auditing standards issued by either the AICPA or the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (“PCAOB”).

•

Review and Audit Reports. Issuers would be required to file with the Commission and
provide to investors and the relevant intermediary a copy of the public accountant’s review
or audit report. An issuer that received an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion in its
audit report would not be in compliance with the audited financial statement requirements.

•

Exemptions from the Financial Statement Requirements. The proposed rules would not
exempt any issuers from the financial statement requirements.

79

(ii)

Comments on the Proposed Rules

Commenters were divided on the proposed financial statement requirements, 278 although
commenters generally supported allowing issuers to voluntarily provide financial statements that
meet the requirements for a higher aggregate target offering amount. 279
Offerings of $100,000 or less. In general, commenters supported requiring issuers to
provide financial statements certified by the principal executive officer to be true and complete in
all material respects. 280 Further, several recommended that all issuers relying on the
Section 4(a)(6) exemption be required to provide such certification. 281
Commenters were divided on the requirement that issuers offering $100,000 or less file
and provide to investors their federal income tax returns. Supporters of the tax return requirement
noted that income tax returns would be a source of credible information for investors that should
be readily available without requiring issuers to bear significant additional preparation
expenses. 282 On the other hand, opponents of the tax return requirement raised concerns about

privacy, 283 identity theft and tax fraud. 284 One commenter expressed concern that small issuers
may not be adequately prepared to consider the patchwork of state and federal privacy laws that
might apply to the disclosure of tax returns. 285
Several commenters suggested approaches to allow access by investors to the information
available from a tax return, 286 including permitting issuers to digitally submit the data from their
tax return in a standardized format. 287 Supporters of digital submission suggested that approach
would provide a standardized format and protect issuers from accidental disclosure of confidential
information. Commenters generally supported the proposal to require issuers to redact personally
identifiable information from their tax returns, 288 although some requested clarifications. 289
Two commenters recommended that the timing of financial statement disclosures
correspond to any extended tax filing deadlines, 290 while two other commenters opposed such

yet filed its tax return for the most recently completed fiscal year to use the tax return filed for the
prior year and update the information after filing the tax return for the most recently completed
fiscal year. 292 One commenter recommended that at least one tax return be available, 293 and
another recommended that the Commission provide guidance for issuers who have not filed a U.S.
tax return. 294 One commenter supported requiring issuers to describe any material changes that
are expected in the tax returns for the most recently completed fiscal year, 295 while another
recommended that such disclosure be permitted, but not required. 296
A number of commenters recommended raising the maximum offering amount for issuers
that provide this level of financial information. 297
Offerings of more than $100,000 but not more than $500,000. Some commenters
supported the requirement in the proposed rules that offerings of more than $100,000 but not more
than $500,000 include financial statements reviewed by an independent public accountant, 298
while other commenters opposed such requirement. 299 A number of commenters recommended a

Offerings of more than $500,000. We received extensive comments on our proposal that
issuers offering more than $500,000 be required to file with the Commission and provide to
investors and the relevant intermediary financial statements audited by an independent public
accountant. A significant number of those commenters opposed the proposed requirement, 301
although some commenters expressed support. 302 Some commenters recommended the
elimination of the audit requirement, 303 and others recommended that we consider additional

statements. 304 A number of commenters opposed the proposed $500,000 threshold as being too

that funding the upfront cost of an audit would be particularly difficult for issuers raising capital

impediment for small business when many will have limited financial resources to absorb the expense prior
to raising capital using crowdfunding); CfPA Letter (suggesting the Commission determine an alternate audit
threshold because “the costs of an audit must necessarily be incurred prior to an offering, and in the
numerous expected cases of unsuccessful offerings, would lead to substantial net losses to the businesses that

Basis of Accounting. Commenters generally were divided on whether issuers relying on
Section 4(a)(6) should be required to prepare financial statements in accordance with U.S.
GAAP. 310 Commenters in support of requiring U.S. GAAP noted the benefit to investors of
having a single standard to facilitate comparison of different issuers, 311 and also that U.S. GAAP
would be more likely to provide investors with a fair representation of an issuer’s financial
position and results of operations than financial statements using a comprehensive basis of
accounting other than U.S. GAAP. 312
A number of commenters recommended that, as a less expensive alternative to requiring
U.S. GAAP, the Commission allow financial statements prepared in accordance with a

309

See, e.g., CCA Letter (analyzing regulatory costs borne by Title II issuers); CrowdFranchise Letter 1;
CrowdFunding Network (stating that projected costs are already decreasing through market forces);
D’Amore Letter; ddbmckennon Letter (noting that the majority of issuers will be newly formed with limited
historical operations and that an audit for such companies may range from $4,000-$9,000 in year one);
Denlinger Letter 1 (citing a study that found that about half of the cost of an audit is made up for in interest
rate savings on bank loans); Denlinger Letter 2 (the market will evolve for small issuers such that audit costs
may be in the range of $2,000-$4,000); FundHub Letter 2 (noting the emergence of CPA firms willing to do
a complete audit for a startup business for $2,500 or less); Holm Letter (stating that new providers are
offering compliance services at much lower costs than anticipated); JumperCard Letter; Kemp Letter;
Leverage PR Letter; Sfinarolakis Letter; StartEngine Letter 1 (noting that reviews and audits will be in the

For supporters, see, e.g., AICPA Letter (for offerings over $100,000); CFA Institute Letter; EY Letter (for
offerings over $100,000 for only the most recent year); Hackers/Founders Letter; Heritage Letter
(recommending for issuers with assets over $100,000, that if financial statements are not prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP, the issuer be required to note any variance from U.S. GAAP and state the
reason for such variance); NASAA Letter; RocketHub Letter; Whitaker Chalk Letter (for offerings over
$500,000 until such time as the Commission accepts IFRS for U.S. domestic issuers).
For opponents, see, e.g., ABA Letter (noting that the benefits associated with GAAP-compliant financial
statements do not outweigh the burdens that mandatory application of GAAP would impose); CrowdCheck

comprehensive basis of accounting other than U.S. GAAP. 313 Other commenters recommended
that if financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP are required, they only be
required in certain circumstances. 314
A few commenters recommended that issuers relying on Section 4(a)(6) be permitted to
take advantage of the extended transition period applicable to private companies for complying
with new or revised accounting standards. 315 A few commenters expressed concern that
Section 4(a)(6) issuers may be viewed as “public business entities” by FASB. 316 One commenter
recommended that the Commission provide an exemption from this definition for such issuers. 317
Periods Covered in the Financial Statements. While two commenters generally supported
requiring two years of financial statements, 318 a number of commenters generally opposed the

Letter; StartupValley Letter; Tiny Cat Letter (for offerings of less than $500,000); Whitaker Chalk Letter
(for offerings of less than $500,000 if the issuer has an asset or income level below a certain level).

314

See, e.g., ABA Letter (suggesting that: (i) in offerings of $100,000 or less, the certifying principal executive
officer could be required to represent that the issuer is unable to prepare financial statements in accordance
with U.S. GAAP without unreasonable effort or expense; (ii) in offerings of more than $100,000, but not
more than $500,000, the exception could also require the principal executive officer representation and be
limited to issuers that have not prepared U.S. GAAP-compliant financial statements for any other purpose
and who have no operating history, no revenues and/or a minimal amount of assets (e.g., $500,000); and (iii)
in offerings of more than $500,000, the exception could require the principal executive officer
representation, including a representation that the other comprehensive basis of accounting methodology
selected is acceptable under AICPA standards, and be limited to issuers with no operating history or revenue
and minimal assets).

requiring interim financial statements, 320 while several supported such a requirement. 321 Several
commenters recommended that if interim financial statements are required, they not be subject to
audit or review, 322 while another commenter recommended that they not be filed with the
Commission, but only be provided to investors. 323
Age of Financial Statements. Several commenters opposed our proposal that financial
statements be dated within 120 days of the start of the offering, 324 while one commenter supported
it. 325 Some commenters opposed our proposal to permit an issuer, during the first 120 days of the
issuer’s fiscal year, to conduct an offering in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) using financial statements
for the fiscal year prior to the most recently completed fiscal year, 326 while two others supported

this time period be extended to 180 days if an issuer presents interim financial statements certified by the
principal executive officer that cover the first six months of the issuer’s most recently completed fiscal year);

such accommodation. 327 One commenter recommended that, to provide “truly current financials”
for large offerings, the Commission could require unaudited financial statements through the end
of the month that ends no more than two months before the month in which the offering begins
(e.g., an offering any day in March would require financials up to January 31); for smaller
offerings, the commenter indicated a modified standard for providing current information might
be appropriate. 328
Public Accountant Requirements. We received several comments on standards for audit
firms. 329 Commenters supported not requiring audits to be conducted by a PCAOB-registered
firm. 330 Some commenters supported our proposal to require the public accountant reviewing or
auditing an issuer’s financial statements to comply with the independence requirements set forth
in Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X, 331 while other commenters recommended allowing the public
accountant to comply by meeting the independence requirements of the AICPA. 332 Some
commenters noted that many startups and early-stage small businesses require assistance in the
preparation of financial statements, and that complying with the independence standards of

Regulation S-X would require such issuers to engage two external accountants – one to assist in
preparing the financial statements and another to audit or review them. 333 One commenter asked
the Commission not to create new independence standards. 334
Review and Audit Standards. With respect to review standards, commenters supported
requiring reviewed financial statements to be reviewed in accordance with the SSARS issued by
the AICPA. 335 Commenters also opposed creating a new set of review standards. 336
With respect to audit standards, several commenters supported our proposal to require that
financial statements be audited in accordance with the auditing standards issued by either the
AICPA or the PCAOB, 337 while several others opposed it. 338 Two commenters recommended that
audits be required to be conducted in accordance with the auditing standards issued by the
PCAOB. 339 Commenters generally opposed creating a new set of audit standards, 340 although one
commenter recommended that if the Commission were to create a new set of audit standards, it
“should be designed as an ultra-low-cost procedure.” 341

Review and Audit Reports. With respect to review reports, two commenters supported our
proposal that a review report that includes modifications would satisfy the reviewed financial
statement requirement, 342 while one commenter opposed it. 343 With respect to audit reports,
commenters supported our proposal that a qualified audit opinion would satisfy the audited
financial statement requirements, 344 although one commenter opposed it. 345 One commenter
requested clarification as to the requirements that may be applicable to the issuer and the public
accountant when an issuer intends to include a previously issued audit or review report in an
offering statement. 346
Exemptions from Financial Statement Requirements. While the proposed rules did not
exempt any issuers from the financial statement requirements, a number of commenters
recommended exempting issuers with no operating history or issuers that have been in existence
for fewer than 12 months from the requirement to provide financial statements, 347 although a few
commenters opposed such a concept. 348 A number of commenters recommended that if an
exemption for such issuers is allowed, the exempted issuers should provide certain basic

Final Rules

We are adopting financial disclosure requirements for Title III issuers in Rule 201(t) with a
number of changes from the proposal. As described in more detail below, the final requirements
are based on the amount offered and sold in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) within the preceding 12month period, as follows:
•

For issuers offering $100,000 or less: disclosure of the amount of total income, taxable
income and total tax as reflected in the issuer’s federal income tax returns certified by the
principal executive officer to reflect accurately the information in the issuer’s federal
income tax returns (in lieu of filing a copy of the tax returns), and financial statements
certified by the principal executive officer to be true and complete in all material
respects. 351 If, however, financial statements of the issuer are available that have either
been reviewed or audited by a public accountant that is independent of the issuer, the
issuer must provide those financial statements instead and need not include the information
reported on the federal income tax returns or the certification of the principal executive
officer.

Issuers offering more than $500,000:
o For issuers offering more than $500,000 but not more than $1 million of securities
in reliance on Regulation Crowdfunding for the first time: financial statements
reviewed by a public accountant that is independent of the issuer. If, however,
financial statements of the issuer are available that have been audited by a public
accountant that is independent of the issuer, the issuer must provide those financial
statements instead and need not include the reviewed financial statements.
o For issuers that have previously sold securities in reliance on Regulation
Crowdfunding: financial statements audited by a public accountant that is
independent of the issuer. 353
Content of Financial Statements. We are adopting substantially as proposed the

requirement that all issuers file with the Commission and provide to investors and the relevant
intermediary a complete set of their financial statements, which includes balance sheets,
statements of comprehensive income, statements of cash flows, statements of changes in
stockholders’ equity and notes to the financial statements. 354 In order to avoid potential confusion
as to the presentation of financial statements, and consistent with Tier 1 offerings under
Regulation A, 355 the final rule adds an instruction that financial statements that are not audited

$500,000.”

must be labeled as unaudited. 356 Consistent with the proposal, the final rules do not exempt any
issuers from the financial statement requirements. Although some commenters expressed
concerns about the costs of the financial statement requirements for issuers with no operating
history or issuers that have been in existence for fewer than 12 months, 357 we believe that
financial statements are important information for investors and that the changes from the
proposed rules described below will help reduce the costs associated with preparing financial
statements for many of those issuers.
The final rule also includes an instruction to clarify that references to the issuer in
Rule 201(t) refer to the issuer and its predecessors, if any.
Offerings of $100,000 or less. Consistent with Securities Act Section 4A(b)(1)(D)(i), we
are adopting as proposed the requirement in Rule 201(t)(1) that an issuer offering $100,000 or less
provide financial statements of the issuer that are certified by the principal executive officer of the
issuer to be true and complete in all material respects. 358 While we believe it will be beneficial for
investors to have an independent accountant review financial statements in offerings over
$100,000, we believe that for offerings of $100,000 or less this certification is sufficient and will
contribute to the integrity of the issuer’s financial reporting process. It will affirm for investors
that, although the financial statements have not been reviewed or audited by an independent
public accountant, there has been senior executive attention paid to the financial statements. We
are not requiring this certification for reviewed or audited financial statements, as some

commenters suggested, because we believe the certification is intended as an added measure of
assurance that is not needed in offerings of this size when an independent accountant reviews or
audits the financial statements. We also are adopting the form of the certification that must be
provided by the issuer’s principal executive officer as proposed with one change relating to the
information from the issuer’s tax return. 359
Instead of mandating that issuers offering $100,000 or less provide copies of their federal
income tax returns as proposed, the final rules require an issuer to disclose the amount of total
income, taxable income and total tax, or the equivalent line items from the applicable form,
exactly as reflected in its filed federal income tax returns, and to have the principal executive
officer certify that those amounts reflect accurately the information in the issuer’s federal income
tax returns. 360 As noted by commenters, 361 requiring that issuers provide tax returns may present
a significant risk of disclosure of private information. While the proposed rule would require
personally identifiable information to be redacted, we are persuaded by commenters that such a
requirement might not provide an adequate safeguard against inadvertent disclosure of this type of
information in some instances. The consequences for an issuer and an intermediary of such
disclosure, including the potential violation of applicable privacy laws, could be severe.
Specifying the information from the tax return that is required without requiring submission of the
tax return itself will provide standardized disclosure for investors and help protect against the
accidental disclosure of personally identifiable or confidential information. Requiring that these
amounts be certified by the principal executive officer will provide investors additional assurance

of the accuracy of those amounts in lieu of providing the underlying tax returns. 362 At the same
time, because the principal executive officer will be certifying only that the amounts are as
reported on the applicable income tax return, we do not expect this requirement to impose any
significant new burdens on principal executive officers, who will already be certifying as to the
truth and completeness of the financial statements themselves. We believe the alternative
approach we are adopting provides a similar benefit to investors as the proposal while addressing
the privacy concerns raised by commenters.
As we stated in the Proposing Release, it remains unclear to us to what extent all of the
information presented in a tax return would be useful for an investor evaluating whether to
purchase securities from the issuer. We believe, however, that certain information such as total
income, taxable income and total tax could be informative and would likely be available to the
issuer in tax documentation. The final rules, therefore, provide that an issuer must disclose its
total income, taxable income and total tax, or the equivalent line items from its federal income tax
documentation and have the principal executive officer certify that those amounts reflect
accurately the information in the issuer’s federal income tax returns. 363
Under the final rules, an issuer that offers securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) before
filing its tax return for the most recently completed fiscal year will be allowed to use information
from the tax return filed for the prior year. An issuer that uses information from the prior year’s
tax return will be required to provide tax return information for the most recently completed fiscal
year when filed with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (if the tax return is filed during the
offering period). An issuer that has requested an extension from the U.S. Internal Revenue

95

Service would not be required to provide the information until the date when the return is filed,
which is consistent with the concept of not requiring tax information until that information has
been filed with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. If an issuer has not yet filed a tax return and is
not required to file a tax return before the end of the offering period, then the tax return
information does not need to be provided. 364
We are adding to Rule 201(t)(1) a requirement that if financial statements of the issuer are
available that have either been reviewed or audited by a public accountant that is independent of
the issuer, the issuer must provide those financial statements instead, and need not include the
information reported on the federal income tax returns or the certification of the principal
executive officer. 365 This approach was suggested by two commenters, 366 and we believe it will
benefit investors by providing access to audited or reviewed financial statements that were already
prepared for other purposes. Unlike audit reports in a registered offering, 367 we are not requiring
that review or audit reports be accompanied by a formal consent or acknowledgment letter.
Rather, the final rules clarify that review and audit reports must be signed and that the issuers
must notify the public accountants of their intended use in an offering in reliance on Section
4(a)(6). 368
Offerings of more than $100,000 but not more than $500,000. Consistent with Section
4A(b)(1)(D)(iii) and the proposed rules, issuers must file and provide reviewed financial

statements when offering more than $100,000 but not more than $500,000. 369 Similar to the
addition to Rule 201(t)(1) discussed above, we have added to Rule 201(t)(2) a requirement that if
financial statements of the issuer are available that have been audited by a public accountant that
is independent of the issuer, the issuer must provide those financial statements instead. 370 The
approach of providing audited financial statements that are otherwise available is consistent with
what the Commission adopted for issuers undertaking Tier 1 offerings under Regulation A. 371 We
believe the benefits to investors of having access to these audited financial statements justify any
additional burden imposed on issuers to provide these statements, which were already prepared for
other purposes.
Offerings of more than $500,000. As proposed, Rule 201(t)(3) provides that issuers
offering more than $500,000 are required to provide audited financial statements. In a change
from the proposal, the final rule includes an accommodation for issuers offering more than
$500,000 but not more than $1 million that have not previously sold securities in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6). 372 Under Rule 201(t)(3), those first-time issuers are permitted to provide
reviewed rather than audited financial statements, unless audited financial statements are
otherwise available.

369

See Rule 201(t)(2) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

Id.

371

See Paragraph (b) of Part F/S of Form 1-A. While Regulation Crowdfunding incorporates a number of
requirements that are consistent with Regulation A, it is important to note that Regulation Crowdfunding and
Regulation A are different exemptions with distinct requirements. For example, unlike offerings under
Regulation Crowdfunding, Tier 1 offerings under Regulation A are subject to state registration requirements
and are required to be “qualified” by Commission staff.

372

For purposes of determining whether an issuer has previously sold securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6),
“issuer” includes all entities controlled by or under common control with the issuer and any predecessors of
the issuer. See Rule 100(c) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

97

We are adding this accommodation for first-time issuers in response to commenters’
concerns about the expense of obtaining audited financial statements. While some commenters
expressed support for the proposed audit requirement, 373 many others noted that the proposed
audit requirement would be too costly and burdensome for issuers in comparison to the size of the
offering proceeds. 374 A number of commenters expressed particular concern that issuers would
need to incur the expense of an audit before having proceeds or even an assurance of proceeds
from the offering. 375 After considering the comments, we are persuaded that for issuers
undertaking a first-time crowdfunding offering of more than $500,000 but not more than $1
million, the benefits of requiring audited financial statements are not likely to justify the costs.
Accordingly, consistent with applicable standards, 376 for these first-time issuers, we are adopting
instead a requirement that those selling securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) in these
circumstances provide reviewed financial statements. Commenters stated that reviewed financial

statements would cost less than audited financial statements, 377 and one commenter noted that the
cost of an accounting review is approximately 60% of the cost of an audit. 378
Basis of Accounting. We are adopting as proposed the requirement that all issuers provide
financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 379 As discussed in the Proposing
Release, financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP are generally self-scaling to
the size and complexity of the issuer, which we believe can reduce the costs of preparing financial
statements for many early stage issuers. We would not expect that the required financial
statements would be long or complicated for issuers that are recently formed and have limited
operating histories. Although we acknowledge, as some commenters observed, that other bases of
accounting may be less expensive than U.S. GAAP, we believe the benefit of a single standard
that will facilitate comparison among issuers relying on Section 4(a)(6) justifies any incremental
expenses associated with U.S. GAAP. In addition, we are concerned that it may be difficult for
investors to determine whether the issuer complied with another comprehensive basis of
accounting. For these reasons, we continue to believe that financial statements prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP will be the most useful for investors in securities-based
crowdfunding transactions, particularly when presented along with the required description of the
issuer’s financial condition. 380

See, e.g., Crowdcheck Letter 4; CfPA Letter (noting that many offerings made in reliance on Rule 506 that

between reviewed and audited financial statements); NFIB Letter; Traklight Letter.

Additionally, as suggested by one commenter, 381 in order to be consistent with the
treatment of emerging growth companies 382 and offerings relying on Regulation A, 383 Rule 201(t)
permits issuers, where applicable, to delay the implementation of new accounting standards to the
extent such standards provide for delayed implementation by non-public business entities. 384 In
this regard, if the issuer chooses to take advantage of this extended transition period, the issuer:
•

Must disclose such choice at the time the issuer files the offering statement; and

•

May not take advantage of the extended transition period for some standards and not
others, but must apply the same choice to all standards.
However, consistent with the treatment of emerging growth companies and offerings

relying on Regulation A, 385 issuers electing not to use this accommodation must forgo this
accommodation for all financial accounting standards and may not elect to rely on this
accommodation in any future filings. 386
On December 23, 2013, after we proposed rules for Regulation Crowdfunding, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and Private Company Council (PCC) issued a
guide for evaluating financial accounting and reporting for non-public business entities. 387 The
PCC was created in 2012 by the FASB and the Financial Accounting Foundation to improve the
standard-setting process, and provide for accounting and reporting alternatives, for non-public

business entities under U.S. GAAP. 388 As the standards for non-public business entities are new,
there are currently very few distinctions between U.S. GAAP for public and non-public business
entities. Over time, however, more distinctions between non-public business entity and public
company accounting standards could develop.
Issuers that offer securities pursuant to Regulation Crowdfunding will be considered
“public business entities” as defined by the FASB 389 and, therefore, ineligible to rely on any
alternative accounting or reporting standards for non-public business entities. 390 Even though
issuers of securities in a Regulation Crowdfunding offering fit within the definition of “public
business entity,” the Commission retains the authority to determine whether or not such issuers
would be permitted to rely on the developing non-public business entity standards. 391
Commenters generally expressed concern about the costs associated with requiring issuers relying
on Section 4(a)(6) to follow public company U.S. GAAP accounting standards. 392
The final rules do not allow Regulation Crowdfunding issuers to use the alternatives
available to non-public business entities under U.S. GAAP in the preparation of their financial
statements. One of the significant factors considered by the FASB in developing its definition of
“public business entity” was the number of primary users of the financial statements and their

Criterion (a) of FASB’s Accounting Standards Update 2013-12, Definition of a Public Business Entity, states
that an entity that “is required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to file or furnish
financial statements, or does file or furnish financial statements (including voluntary filers), with the SEC
(including other entities whose financial statements or financial information are required to be or are
included in a filing)” is a Public Business Entity.

access to management. 393 As the FASB noted, “users of private company financial statements
have continuous access to management and the ability to obtain financial information throughout
the year.” 394 As the number of investors increases and their ability individually to influence
management decreases, it is important that all investors receive or have timely access to
comprehensive financial information. As a result, although commenters generally expressed
concern about the costs associated with requiring issuers relying on Section 4(a)(6) to follow
public company U.S. GAAP accounting standards, 395 because crowdfunding investors will likely
not have the access to management that the FASB envisions, the Commission believes that
investor protection will be enhanced by requiring Regulation Crowdfunding issuers to provide
financial statements prepared in the same manner as other entities meeting the FASB’s definition
of “public business entity.”
Periods Covered in the Financial Statements. We are adopting substantially as proposed
the requirement that financial statements cover the shorter of the two most recently completed
fiscal years or the period since the issuer’s inception. 396 While a number of commenters
recommended only one year of financial statements, 397 we believe that requiring a second year
will provide investors with a basis for comparison against the most recently completed period,
without substantially increasing the costs for the issuer.

102

In addition, consistent with the proposal and with the views of many commenters, 398 the
final rules do not require interim financial statements. While we recognize the needs of investors
for current financial information, we are also cognizant of the anticipated costs of obtaining
interim financial statements. We believe that the required discussion of any material changes or
trends known to management in the financial condition and results of operations of the issuer
since the period for which financial statements are provided will help provide investors with the
necessary information. 399
Age of Financial Statements. We are adopting substantially as proposed rules providing
that during the first 120 days of the issuer’s fiscal year, an issuer may conduct an offering in
reliance on Section 4(a)(6) using financial statements for the fiscal year prior to the most recently
completed fiscal year if the financial statements for the most recently completed fiscal year are not
otherwise available. 400 For example, if an issuer that has a calendar fiscal year end conducts an
offering in April 2016, it would be permitted to include financial statements for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2014 if the financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015
are not yet available. Once more than 120 days have passed since the end of the issuer’s most
recently completed fiscal year, the issuer would be required to include financial statements for its
most recently completed fiscal year. 401 Regardless of the age of the financial statements, an issuer
would be required to include in the narrative discussion of its financial condition a discussion of
any material changes or trends known to management in the financial condition and results of

operations of the issuer during any time period subsequent to the period for which financial
statements are provided to inform investors of more recent developments. 402
While some commenters expressed concern that this accommodation would not provide
investors with sufficiently current financial information, 403 we believe that this risk will be
mitigated by the requirement that the issuer include a narrative discussion of any material changes
or trends known to management in the financial condition and results of operations during any
time period subsequent to the period for which financial statements are provided. 404 Further, we
believe this accommodation is needed because otherwise issuers would not be able to conduct
offerings for a period of time between the end of their fiscal year and the date when the financial
statements for that period are available.
We are not adopting the alternative proposed by one commenter to require unaudited
financial statements through the end of the month that ends no more than two months before the
month in which the offering began. 405 Such a requirement would require an issuer to prepare a set
of financial statements at a time when it would not otherwise be doing so and would be a more
onerous requirement than applies to registered or Regulation A offerings. 406
Public Accountant Requirements. In a change from proposed Rule 201(t), in response to
commenters’ suggestions, the final rules provide that to qualify as independent of the issuer, a

public accountant would be required to either: (1) comply with the Commission’s independence
rules, which are set forth in Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X, 407 or (2) comply with the independence
standards of the AICPA. 408 Allowing the AICPA independence standards as an alternative to the
Commission’s independence standards is consistent with the recommendations of a number of
commenters 409 and the treatment of Tier 1 issuers under Regulation A. 410 We believe that
providing issuers with this flexibility is appropriate in light of the potential costs to issuers that
would otherwise be required to engage an accountant who was independent under Rule 2-01 of
Regulation S-X.
Consistent with the recommendation of one commenter, 411 in addition to meeting the
independence standards of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X or the AICPA, we are requiring that a
public accountant that audits or reviews the financial statements provided by an issuer must meet
the standards for public accountants of Rule 2-01(a) of Regulation S-X. The Commission will not
recognize as a public accountant any person who: (1) is not duly registered and in good standing
as a certified public accountant under the laws of the place of his residence or principal office; or
(2) is not in good standing and entitled to practice as a public accountant under the laws of the
place of his residence or principal office. 412 We believe these standards will promote the use of
qualified accountants that are in compliance with the requirements for their profession for the
review or audit of the financial statements with respect to all offerings, including offerings in
reliance on Section 4(a)(6).

Consistent with the proposal and recommendations in response to our request for
comments, we are not requiring audits to be conducted by a PCAOB-registered firm. We believe
the final rules will result in a greater number of public accountants being eligible to audit the
issuers’ financial statements, which may reduce issuers’ costs.
Review and Audit Standards. In line with the general support received from
commenters, 413 we are adopting as proposed the requirement that reviewed financial statements be
reviewed in accordance with the SSARS issued by the AICPA. 414 We also are adopting as
proposed the requirement that audited financial statements, to the extent they are otherwise
available, be audited in accordance with either the auditing standards of the AICPA (referred to as
U.S. Generally Accepted Auditing Standards or GAAS) or the standards of the PCAOB. 415 We
expect that this provision will provide issuers with more flexibility to file audited financial
statements that may have been prepared for other purposes.
We believe that audits conducted in accordance with U.S. GAAS will provide sufficient
protection for investors in these offerings, especially in light of the requirement that auditors must
be independent under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X or AICPA independence standards. Moreover,
we believe that the flexibility adopted in the final rules is appropriately tailored for the different
types of issuers that are likely to conduct offerings under Regulation Crowdfunding.
Because issuers under Regulation Crowdfunding are not “issuers” as defined by
Section 2(a)(7) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 nor broker-dealers registered with the
Commission under Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, AICPA rules would
require the audit to be compliant with U.S. GAAS even if the auditor has conducted the audit in

accordance with PCAOB standards. Staff of the Commission consulted with the AICPA on this
issue and has been advised that an audit performed by its members of an issuer conducting an
offering under Regulation Crowdfunding would be required to comply with U.S. GAAS in
accordance with the AICPA’s Code of Professional Conduct. 416 As a result, an auditor for such
an issuer who is conducting its audit in accordance with PCAOB standards also will be required to
comply with U.S. GAAS, and the auditor will be required to comply with the reporting
requirements of both the AICPA standards and the PCAOB standards. Commission staff also
consulted with the AICPA on whether an auditor can currently comply with both sets of standards
when issuing its auditor’s report. In August 2015, the Auditing Standards Board of the AICPA
proposed an amendment 417 to its auditing standards for situations when the auditor plans to refer
to the standards of the PCAOB in addition to U.S. GAAS in the auditor’s report. To comply with
the reporting requirements of both sets of standards in those situations, the proposed amendment
would require the auditor to use the report layout and wording specified by the auditing standards
of the PCAOB, amended to indicate that the audit was also conducted in accordance with U.S.
GAAS.
Review and Audit Reports. We are adopting, with changes from the proposal, the
requirement that issuers file with the Commission and provide to investors and the relevant
intermediary a signed review or audit report on the issuer’s financial statements by an independent

public accountant. 418 The issuer must notify the public accountant of the issuer’s intended use of
the report in the offering. 419
We are adopting as proposed the provision that an audit report that includes an adverse
opinion or disclaimer of opinion will not be in compliance with the audited financial statement
requirements. 420 In a change from the proposal, as suggested by one commenter, 421 the final rules
do not permit a qualified audit report. 422 As noted above, under the final rules an issuer is not
required to provide audited financial statements for first-time crowdfunding offerings of more
than $500,000 but not more than $1 million unless otherwise available. We believe that this
change reduces the cost and burden for issuers generally of providing audited financial statements,
and that an accommodation to permit qualified audit reports is not necessary.
The final rules also provide that a review report that includes modifications will not satisfy
the requirement for reviewed financial statements. 423 Although two commenters expressed that a
review report with modifications should be sufficient to satisfy the reviewed financial statement
requirement, 424 one commenter opposed permitting modifications to review reports, noting that it
considers certain departures from U.S. GAAP to be “unacceptable” and that it would not be
feasible to develop a model of all allowable and disallowable modifications. 425 After considering

the comments, we are persuaded that permitting modifications could result in financial statements
that depart materially from U.S. GAAP, and, therefore, are not permitting modifications to review
reports under the final rules. In response to concerns expressed by some commenters, however,
we note that a review report or audit opinion that includes explanatory language pertaining to the
entity’s ability to continue as a going concern is not, under current auditing standards, a modified
report or a qualified opinion. 426
Exemptions from Financial Statement Requirements. Consistent with the proposal, the
final rules do not exempt any issuers from the financial statement requirements. While we
appreciate the concerns identified by commenters about the costs of the financial statement
requirements for issuers with no operating history or issuers that have been in existence for fewer
than 12 months, 427 we believe that financial statements are important information for all issuers
and that other changes from the proposed rules such as raising the threshold at which audited
financial statements are required will help reduce those costs.
b.

Progress Updates
(1)

Proposed Rules

Consistent with Securities Act Section 4A(b)(1)(F), proposed Rule 201(v) and Rule
203(a)(3) of Regulation Crowdfunding would require an issuer to file with the Commission and
provide investors and the relevant intermediary regular updates on the issuer’s progress in meeting
the target offering amount no later than five business days after each of the dates that the issuer
reaches particular intervals – i.e., 50 percent and 100 percent – of the target offering amount. If

Letter; PeoplePowerFund Letter; RocketHub Letter; StartupValley Letter; Wefunder Letter; Whitaker Chalk
Letter.

the issuer will accept proceeds in excess of the target offering amount, the issuer also would be
required to file with the Commission and provide investors and the relevant intermediary a final
progress update, no later than five business days after the offering deadline, disclosing the total
amount of securities sold in the offering. If, however, multiple progress updates are triggered
within the same five business-day period (e.g., the issuer reaches 50 percent of the target offering
amount on November 5, 100 percent of the target offering amount on November 7, and the
maximum amount of proceeds it will accept in excess of the target offering amount on November
9), the issuer could consolidate such progress updates into one Form C-U, so long as the Form CU discloses the most recent threshold that was met and the Form C-U is filed with the
Commission and provided to investors and the relevant intermediary by the day on which the first
progress update would be due. The proposed rules also would require the intermediary to make
these updates available to investors through the intermediary’s platform.
(2)

Comments on the Proposed Rules

Commenters were generally opposed to the progress update requirements, noting that
progress updates filed with the Commission would be duplicative of what is available from the
intermediary’s website and generate unnecessary costs. 428 Based on that same rationale, a number
of commenters supported the concept of exempting issuers from the requirement to file progress
updates with the Commission so long as the intermediary publicly displays the progress of the
issuer in meeting the target offering amount. 429

(3)

Final Rules

The final rules maintain the proposed progress update requirements, with a significant
modification. Based on concerns expressed by commenters, the final rules permit issuers to
satisfy the progress update requirement by relying on the relevant intermediary to make publicly
available on the intermediary’s platform frequent updates about the issuer’s progress toward
meeting the target offering amount. 430 However, if the intermediary does not provide such an
update, the issuer would be required to file the interim progress updates. In addition, as described
in more detail below, an issuer relying on the intermediary’s reports of progress must still file a
Form C-U at the end of the offering to disclose the total amount of securities sold in the
offering. 431
As stated in the proposal, we continue to believe that the information available in progress
updates will be important to investors by allowing them to gauge whether interest in the offer has
increased gradually or whether it was concentrated at the beginning or at the end of the offering
period. We believe that these same benefits can be achieved through information available on the
intermediary’s platform about the progress toward the target offering amount. Whether an issuer
provides the required progress update report or relies on the intermediary’s reporting, we believe
investors will benefit by being able to stay informed during the offering of an issuer’s progress.
Under the final rules, all issuers must file a Form C-U to report the total amount of
securities sold in the offering. For issuers that are offering only up to a certain target offering
amount, this requirement will be triggered five business days from the date they reach the target

progress updates with the Commission on a regular basis to allow for consistency across all issuers and
intermediaries.).

offering amount. 432 For issuers accepting proceeds in excess of the target offering amount, this
requirement will be triggered five days after the offering deadline. 433 We believe that requiring a
report of the total amount of securities sold in the offering is necessary to inform investors about
the ultimate size of the offering, especially in cases where an issuer may have sold more than the
target offering amount. Further, this requirement will result in a central repository of this
information at the Commission – information that otherwise might no longer be available on the
intermediary’s platform after the offering terminated. Finally, we note that requiring a final report
will make data available to the Commission and the general public that could be used to evaluate
the effects of the Section 4(a)(6) exemption on capital formation.
c.

Amendments to the Offering Statement
(1)

Proposed Rules

Proposed Rule 203(a)(2) of Regulation Crowdfunding would require that an issuer amend
its disclosure for any material change in the offer terms or disclosure previously provided to
investors. The amended disclosure would be filed with the Commission on Form C-A:
Amendment and provided to investors and the relevant intermediary. Material changes would
require reconfirmation by investors of their investment commitments within five business days.
In addition, an issuer would be permitted, but not required, to file amendments for changes that
are not material.

Comments Received on Proposed Rules

Commenters were mixed on the proposed rules relating to amendments to the offering
statement, with those opposed citing the burden on issuers. 434 Some commenters recommended
that the Commission specify a filing deadline for amendments reflecting a material change, 435 and
some recommended we require that investors be notified of the amendment. 436 Two commenters
supported our view that the establishment of the final price should be considered a material
change that would always require an amendment to Form C, 437 while one commenter opposed
such an approach. 438 One commenter recommended that the Commission define “material
change” in this context.439
(3)

Final Rules

We are adopting requirements for the amendment to the offering statement as proposed.
The final rules require that an issuer amend its disclosure for any material change in the offer
terms or disclosure previously provided to investors. 440 While we recognize commenters’
concerns about the costs that requiring one or more additional filings may impose on issuers, we

that only a final amendment prior to the offering deadline be required, provided there is a five day

For commenters generally opposed, see, e.g., ASSOB Letter (suggesting a supplement could suffice in
certain instances); Public Startup Letter 2; RocketHub Letter (suggesting that not all amendments be filed
with the Commission so long as the information was made available through the intermediary).

113

note that an amendment will be required only in instances in which there was a material change.
In such circumstances, we believe the additional efforts required of an issuer to file an amendment
will be justified in order to provide investors with the information they need to make an informed
investment decision.
The amended disclosure must be filed with the Commission on Form C and provided to
investors and the relevant intermediary. Under the final rules, the issuer is required to check the
box for “Form C/A: Amendment” on the cover of the Form C and explain, in summary manner,
the nature of the changes, additions or updates in the space provided. 441
With respect to what constitutes a “material change,” as we stated in the Proposing
Release, information is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor
would consider it important in deciding whether or not to purchase the securities. 442 For example,
we believe that a material change in the financial condition or the intended use of proceeds
requires an amendment to an issuer’s disclosure. Also, in those instances in which an issuer has
previously disclosed only the method for determining the price, and not the final price, of the
securities offered, we believe that determination of the final price is a material change to the terms
of the offer and must be disclosed. These are not, however, the only possible material changes
that require amended disclosure. We are not providing additional guidance on what constitutes a
“material change,” as requested by one commenter, 443 because, consistent with our historical
approach to materiality determinations, we believe that an issuer should determine whether
changes in the offer terms or disclosure are material based on the facts and circumstances.

See ODS Letter.

114

In addition, as discussed further in Section II.C.6 below, if any change, addition or update
constitutes a material change to information previously disclosed, the issuer must check the box
on the cover of Form C indicating that investors must reconfirm their investment commitments.
A number of commenters recommended that we specify a filing deadline for amendments
reflecting a material change, 444 and that we require investors be notified in some manner of the
amendment. 445 We are not, however, amending the requirement as suggested by those
commenters. We appreciate the need for investors to know this information in a timely fashion,
but we believe that with the requirement that investors reconfirm their commitments, it will be in
an issuer’s interest to file an amendment as soon as practicable and to notify investors so that it
will be in a position to close the offering. Therefore, we do not believe further procedural
requirements are necessary.
Issuers will be permitted, but not required, to amend the Form C to provide information
with respect to other changes that are made to the information presented on the intermediary’s
platform and provided to investors. 446 If an issuer amends the Form C to provide such
information, it is not required to check the box indicating that investors must reconfirm their
investment commitments.

Ongoing Reporting Requirements
a.

Proposed Rules

Securities Act Section 4A(b)(4) requires, “not less than annually, [the issuer to] file with
the Commission and provide to investors reports of the results of operations and financial
444

See, e.g., Commonwealth of Massachusetts Letter; Grassi Letter; Hackers/Founders Letter; RocketHub
Letter.

115

statements of the issuer, as the Commission shall, by rule, determine appropriate, subject to such
exceptions and termination dates as the Commission may establish, by rule.”
To implement the ongoing reporting requirement in Section 4A(b)(4), we proposed in
Rules 202 and 203 of Regulation Crowdfunding to require an issuer that sold securities in reliance
on Section 4(a)(6) to file a report annually, no later than 120 days after the end of the most
recently completed fiscal year covered by the report. To implement the requirement that issuers
provide the report to investors, we proposed in Rule 202(a) to require issuers to post the annual
report on their websites. Under proposed Rule 202(a), the issuer would be required to disclose
information similar to that required in the offering statement, including disclosure about its
financial condition that meets the highest financial statement requirements that were applicable to
its offering statement.
We also proposed in Rule 202(b) to require issuers to file the annual report until one of the
following events occurs: (1) the issuer becomes a reporting company required to file reports
under Exchange Act Sections 13(a) or 15(d); (2) the issuer or another party purchases or
repurchases all of the securities issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(6), including any payment in full
of debt securities or any complete redemption of redeemable securities; or (3) the issuer liquidates
or dissolves in accordance with state law.

Frequency. With respect to frequency, a number of commenters supported the proposed
requirement of annual reporting, 448 while a few recommended quarterly reporting. 449 Some
commenters supported requiring issuers to file reports to disclose the occurrence of material
events on an ongoing basis, 450 and several recommended that the Commission provide a list of
events that would trigger such disclosure. 451 Two other commenters opposed such a
requirement. 452
Provision of Reports. Generally, commenters supported requiring issuers to post the
annual report on their websites, 453 although some commenters favored a more limited

some commenters supported requiring direct delivery in some form 458 or directly notifying
investors of the availability of the annual report. 459
Financial Statements. Commenters expressed differing views about the proposed ongoing
financial statements requirements, particularly the level of public accountant involvement
required. While a few supported requiring certain issuers to provide audited or reviewed financial
statements on an ongoing basis, 460 a substantial number opposed an ongoing audit or review
requirement. 461 Further, a number of commenters recommended that if ongoing financial
statements are to be required for some issuers, the level of review be based on a higher offering
amount threshold than the threshold used to determine the level of involvement of the accountant
in the offering. 462
Other Content. A number of commenters recommended that the ongoing annual reports
require a more limited set of disclosure than the information required in the offering statement. 463

We also received a range of comments about when the ongoing reporting requirements
should terminate, with two supporting requiring issuers to file an annual report until one of the
enumerated events occurs, 467 and others suggesting alternatives to such requirement. 468
Some commenters recommended that the ongoing reporting requirements be a condition to
the Section 4(a)(6) exemption 469 while several others generally opposed such concept. 470

After considering the comments received, we are adopting the ongoing reporting
requirements generally as proposed, with a substantial modification to the level of public

See, e.g., Heritage Letter (issuers raising $100,000 or less); RocketHub Letter (issuers raising $250,000 or
less, although recommending that intermediaries be permitted to require ongoing reports on their platform

reporting when: (1) raising less than $350,000; (2) securities are structured such that there can be no
investment decisions; (3) an institutional investor, venture capitalist, or angel investor is leading the deal for
investors; or (4) all investors have contractually waived the right to receive ongoing reports with informed
consent); SeedInvest Letter 4. See also form letters designated as Type A (supporting SeedInvest Letter 1).

the option to escrow their shares for up to 24 months, with certain penalties for failure to file the annual
report).

119

accountant involvement required and another modification to provide for termination of the
ongoing reporting obligation in two additional circumstances.
Frequency. The final rules require an issuer that sold securities in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6) to file an annual report with the Commission, no later than 120 days after the end
of the fiscal year covered by the report. 471 We believe that this ongoing reporting requirement
should benefit investors by enabling them to consider updated information about the issuer,
thereby allowing them to make more informed investment decisions.
We recognize the view of some commenters 472 that there may be major events that occur
between annual reports about which investors would want to be updated, and we note that some
commenters also recommended quarterly reporting. 473 However, we agree with those
commenters 474 who said an annual requirement is sufficient. We believe a more frequent filing
requirement would require an allocation of resources to the reporting function of Regulation
Crowdfunding issuers that we do not believe is justified in light of the smaller amounts that will
be raised pursuant to the exemption. We note that under Tier 1 of Regulation A, issuers can raise
significantly more money – up to $20 million – without any ongoing reporting requirement other
than to file a Form 1-Z exit report upon completion or termination of the offering. While not
required, nothing in the rules prevents an issuer from updating investors when major events occur.
Nor do our rules prevent intermediaries from requiring more frequent reporting. However, we do

not believe that it is necessary in the final rules to require reporting on a more frequent basis than
the annual ongoing reporting directly contemplated by the statute.
Provision of Reports. We also are adopting as proposed the requirement that an issuer post
the annual report on its website. 475 Consistent with the proposal, the final rules do not require
delivery of a physical copy of the annual report. As discussed in the Proposing Release and as
supported by a number of commenters, we believe that investors in this type of Internet-based
offering will be familiar with obtaining information on the Internet and that providing information
in this manner will be cost efficient. While some commenters 476 suggested that limiting
distribution of the annual report to investors through use of a password-protected website would
help protect an issuer’s commercially-sensitive information, we believe such a requirement would
add complexity for issuers and investors without providing significant protection of
commercially-sensitive information since the reports could still be accessed by the public on
EDGAR.
Consistent with the proposal, the final rule does not require an issuer to provide direct
notification via e-mail or otherwise of the posting of the report, as was suggested by some
commenters. 477 As discussed above in Section II.B.1.a.(i)(g), however, we are revising the final
rules to require an issuer to disclose in the offering statement where on the issuer’s website
investors will be able to find the issuer’s annual report and the date by which the annual report
will be available on the issuer’s website. 478 We believe these changes will help investors to locate
the annual report. As discussed in the Proposing Release, we believe that many issuers may not

have e-mail addresses for investors, especially after the shares issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(6)
are traded by the original purchasers. Nonetheless, to the extent e-mail addresses for investors are
available, an issuer could refer investors to the posted report via e-mail.
Financial Statements. After considering the comments, we are persuaded by the
commenters that opposed requiring that an audit or review of the financial statements be included
in the annual report. 479 Therefore, instead of requiring financial statements in the annual report
that meet the highest standard previously provided, the final rules require financial statements of
the issuer certified by the principal executive officer of the issuer to be true and complete in all
material respects. 480 However, issuers that have available financial statements that have been
reviewed or audited by an independent certified public accountant because they prepare them for
other purposes must provide them and will not be required to have the principal executive officer
certification. 481
Many commenters expressed concerns with the costs associated with preparing reviewed
and audited financial statements on an ongoing basis. Commenters also noted the absence of
comparable ongoing reporting requirements under Tier 1 of Regulation A and other offering
exemptions.482 While we recognize that Regulation Crowdfunding is different in many respects
from Regulation A, we believe that crowdfunding issuers should not have more onerous ongoing

479

See, e.g., AEO Letter; Arctic Island Letter 5; AWBC Letter; CrowdCheck Letter 4 (“ongoing audit
requirement will create an unpredictable on-going burden”); EarlyShares Letter; EMKF Letter (“audited
financial statements, particularly for ongoing reporting requirements, are so cost-prohibitive for startups that
they make absolutely no sense as an appropriate use of funds.”); Frutkin Letter; Graves Letter; Guzik Letter

reporting compliance costs than issuers that use another public offering exemption that permits
higher maximum offering amounts. The changes to the ongoing reporting requirements in the
rules we are adopting today will alleviate some of the costs on crowdfunding issuers. At the same
time, we also believe, consistent with the views of at least one commenter, 483 that investors still
will be provided with sufficient ongoing financial information about the issuer under the final
rules.
Other Content. With the exception of the financial statement requirement described above,
the final rule adopts as proposed the requirement that the annual report include the information
required in the offering statement. Although an issuer will not be required to provide the offeringspecific information that it filed at the time of the offering (because the issuer will not be offering or

selling securities), 484 it will be required to disclose information about the company and its
financial condition, as required in connection with the offer and sale of the securities. 485 While
we appreciate the recommendations of commenters for a more limited set of disclosure in the
annual report, we believe that the disclosure costs of ongoing reporting for issuers will be less
than in the initial offering statement, because they will be able to use the offering materials as a
483

See CrowdCheck Letter 4 (“While the on-going audit requirement is designed to provide investors and
potential secondary purchasers of the company’s securities with updated information about the company, it is
unnecessary given the other, less burdensome, on-going disclosure requirements contained in the statute and
proposed regulation.”).

484

See Rule 202(a) of Regulation Crowdfunding. An issuer will not be required to provide information about:
(1) the stated purpose and intended use of the proceeds of the offering; (2) the target offering amount and the
deadline to reach the target offering amount; (3) whether the issuer will accept investments in excess of the
target offering amount; (4) whether, in the event that the offer is oversubscribed, shares will be allocated on a
pro-rata basis, first come-first served basis, or other basis; (5) the process to complete the transaction or
cancel an investment commitment once the target amount is met; (6) the price to the public of the securities
being offered; (7) the terms of the securities being offered; (8) the name, SEC file number and CRD number
(as applicable) of the intermediary through which the offering is being conducted; and (9) the amount of
compensation paid to the intermediary.

485

See Rule 202(a) of Regulation Crowdfunding. Issuers will be required to provide disclosure about its
directors and officers, business, current number of employees, financial condition (including financial
statements), capital structure, significant factors that make an investment in the issuer speculative or risky,
material indebtedness and certain related-party transactions.

123

basis to prepare the annual reports. We believe investors will benefit from the availability of
annual updates to the information they received when making the decision to invest in the issuer’s
securities, since these updates will allow them to be informed about issuer developments as they
decide whether to continue to hold or sell, or how to vote, the securities. Under the statute and the
final rules, the securities will be freely tradable after one year. Therefore, this information also
will benefit potential future holders of the issuer’s securities and help them to make more
informed investment decisions.
Exceptions/Termination of Ongoing Reporting Requirement. After considering the
comments, we are providing for termination of the ongoing reporting obligation in the three
circumstances that we proposed as well as the following two additional circumstances: (1) when
the issuer has filed at least one annual report and has fewer than 300 holders of record; and
(2) when the issuer has filed at least three annual reports and has total assets that do not exceed
$10 million. Accordingly, under Rule 202(b), issuers will be required to file the annual report
until the earliest of the following events occurs:
(1) the issuer is required to file reports under Exchange Act Sections 13(a) or 15(d);
(2) the issuer has filed at least one annual report and has fewer than 300 holders of record;
(3) the issuer has filed at least three annual reports and has total assets that do not exceed
$10 million;
(4) the issuer or another party purchases or repurchases all of the securities issued pursuant
to Section 4(a)(6), including any payment in full of debt securities or any complete redemption of
redeemable securities; or
(5) the issuer liquidates or dissolves in accordance with state law.

124

We believe the addition of the two termination events, which are generally consistent with
the suggestions of commenters, 486 should help alleviate commenters’ concerns about related costs
for certain issuers that may not have achieved a level of financial success that would sustain an
ongoing reporting obligation. The 300 shareholder threshold reflected in Rule 202(b)(2) is
consistent with the threshold used to determine whether an Exchange Act reporting company is
eligible to suspend its Section 15(d) 487 or terminate its Section 13 488 reporting obligations. The
option for an issuer to conclude ongoing reporting after three annual reports as reflected in
Rule 202(b)(3) should help address concerns raised by some commenters that the reporting
obligation could potentially extend indefinitely, while still requiring larger issuers with more than
$10 million in total assets to continue reporting. We chose the $10 million threshold in order to
be consistent with the total asset threshold in Section 12(g)(1) of the Exchange Act. 489 Under that
provision, a company that has total assets exceeding $10 million and a class of securities held of
record by a certain number of persons must register that class of securities with the Commission.
As proposed, Rule 203(b)(3) provides that any issuer terminating its annual reporting
obligations will be required to file with the Commission, within five business days from the date
on which the issuer becomes eligible to terminate its reporting obligation, a notice that it will no
longer file and provide annual reports pursuant to the requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding.

486

See, e.g., ABA Letter; EY Letter (recommending the reporting obligations terminate after a certain amount
of time if the issuer has 300 or fewer security holders); PBA Letter; RocketHub Letter (recommending the
reporting obligations terminate after three consecutive annual reports).

125

The issuer also must check the box for “Form C-TR: Termination of Reporting” on the cover of
Form C. 490
We are not persuaded by the suggestion of one commenter 491 that ongoing reports should
be a condition to the Section 4(a)(6) exemption. As two commenters noted at the pre-proposal
stage, under such an approach, compliance with the exemption would not be known at the time of
the transaction. 492 This, in turn, would create substantial uncertainty for issuers because there
would be an indefinite possibility of a potential future violation of the exemption. We have
modified the final rules from the proposal to clarify that the availability of the crowdfunding
exemption is not conditioned on compliance with the annual reporting, progress update or
termination of reporting obligations. 493 Nevertheless, issuers offering and selling securities in
reliance on Section 4(a)(6) remain obligated to comply with these reporting requirements.
Moreover, as discussed in Section II.A.4 above, the final rules deny issuers the benefit of relying
on the exemption under Section 4(a)(6) for future offerings until they file, to the extent required,
the two most recently required annual reports. 494 In addition, the final rules require the issuer to
disclose in its offering statement and annual report if it, or any of its predecessors, previously
failed to comply with the ongoing reporting requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding.

Form C and Filing Requirements
a.

Proposed Rules

Securities Act Section 4A(b)(1) requires issuers who offer or sell securities in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6) to “file with the Commission and provide to investors and the relevant broker or
funding portal, and make available to potential investors” certain disclosures. The statute does not
specify a format that issuers must use to present the required disclosures and file these disclosures
with the Commission. We proposed in Rule 203 of Regulation Crowdfunding to require issuers to
file the mandated disclosure using new Form C, which would require certain disclosures to be
presented in a specified format, while allowing the issuer to customize the presentation of other
disclosures required by Section 4A(b)(1) and the related rules.
We proposed to require issuers to use an XML-based fillable form to input certain
information. Information not required to be provided in text boxes in the XML-based fillable
form would be filed as attachments to Form C.
Under the proposed rules, Form C would be used for all of an issuer’s filings with the
Commission related to the offering made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6). The issuer would check
one of the following boxes on the cover of the Form C to indicate the purpose of the Form C
filing:
•

“Form C: Offering Statement” for issuers filing the initial disclosures required for
an offering made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6);

•

“Form C-A: Amendment” for issuers seeking to amend a previously-filed Form C
for an offering;

•

“Form C-U: Progress Update” for issuers filing a progress update required by
Section 4A(b)(1)(H) and the related rules;
127

•

“Form C-AR: Annual Report” for issuers filing the annual report required by
Section 4A(b)(4) and the related rules; and

•

“Form C-TR: Termination of Reporting” for issuers terminating their reporting
obligations pursuant to Section 4A(b)(4) and the related rules.

EDGAR would automatically provide each filing with an appropriate tag depending on which box
the issuer checks so that investors could distinguish among the different filings. 495
Section 4A(b)(1) requires issuers to file the offering information with the Commission,
provide it to investors and the relevant intermediary and make it available to potential investors. 496
Under the proposed rules, issuers would satisfy the requirement to file the information with the
Commission by filing the Form C: Offering Statement, including any amendments and progress
updates, on EDGAR. To satisfy the requirement to provide the disclosures to the relevant
intermediary, we proposed that issuers provide to the relevant intermediary a copy of the
disclosures filed with the Commission. To satisfy the requirement to provide the disclosures, or
make them available, as applicable, to investors, we proposed that issuers provide the information
to investors electronically by referring investors, such as through a posting on the issuer’s website
or by e-mail, to the information on the intermediary’s platform. The proposed rules would not
require issuers to provide physical copies of the information to investors.

495

EDGAR would tag the offering statement as “Form C,” any amendments to the offering statement as “Form
C-A,” progress updates as “Form C-U,” annual reports as “Form C-AR” and termination reports as “Form CTR.”

496

Section 4A(b)(4) requires issuers to file with the Commission and provide to investors, not less than
annually, reports of the results of operations and financial statements of the issuer. As discussed above in
Section II.B.2, to satisfy this requirement, the rules require an issuer to post the annual report on its website
and file it with the Commission.

128

b.

Comments on the Proposed Rules

Commenters generally supported the proposed Form C requirement. 497 Two commenters
supported the proposal to use one form with different EDGAR tags for each type of filing, 498
while another commenter recommended creating multiple forms in order to minimize the length
of the form. 499 Two commenters recommended that the Commission modify Form C and its
variants to require an issuer to indicate the jurisdictions in which the securities will be or are sold,
with one of those commenters recommending ongoing disclosure of the amount sold in each
state. 500
Commenters were divided on the EDGAR filing requirement. Some commenters
supported the filing requirement, with a few of those specifically supporting the proposal that
issuers file the Form C in electronic format only. 501 Some commenters generally opposed the
filing requirements or opposed specific aspects of the requirements. 502
A few commenters requested clarification whether all offering material made available on
the intermediary’s platform must be filed on Form C. 503 Two commenters recommended that not

all materials be required to be filed as exhibits. 504 A number of commenters noted that issuers
would likely use various types of media for their offerings, some of which cannot be filed on
EDGAR. 505 A number of commenters recommended that the Commission adopt other disclosure
formats, such as a question-and-answer format. 506
A number of commenters generally supported the proposal to refer investors to
information on the intermediary’s platform. 507 With respect to the proposed methods (website
posting or e-mail), one commenter stated that issuers would not have investors’ e-mail
addresses, 508 and another commenter noted that maintaining investors’ email addresses would
require significant resources. 509
504

See, e.g., CFIRA Letter 1 (recommending that only “those documents most suited to police against fraud” be
filed with the Commission because the intermediary serves as the primary repository of the offering
materials); CrowdCheck Letter 1 (recommending the Commission permit issuers to use “free writing”
disclosure materials in certain circumstances without having to file them with the Commission).

information); Hamilton Letter (suggesting the Commission provide prototypes of Form C and sample
disclosures); RocketHub (seeking a simple, standardized general form other than U-7 or A-1 to provide legal
certainty); Saunders Letter (proposing that Form C be completed by selecting from a database of stock
responses); SBA Office of Advocacy Letter (describing recommendations from its roundtable attendees to
adopt a simple question and answer format similar to that previously used in Regulation A or to provide
“standard boilerplate disclosures for some of the more complicated nonfinancial disclosures, such as risk
factors,” that are not required by the JOBS Act).
We also received several comments prior to the Proposing Release on whether the Commission should
require a specific format for the required disclosure. Several commenters recommended that the
Commission require the disclosure on a form modeled after, or require the use of NASAA’s Small Company
Offering Registration Form (U-7). See, e.g., Coan Letter; Liles Letter 1; Vim Funding Letter; NASAA
Letter. One commenter suggested modeling the required disclosure format after then-current Form 1-A,
which is used for securities offerings made pursuant to Regulation A, but which has since been modified as a
result of recently adopted amendments to Regulation A. See 17 CFR 230.251 et seq.; Amendments to

c.

Final Rules

We are adopting Form C and the related filing requirements 510 with a few modifications
from the proposed rules. 511
First, the final rules will amend Regulation S-T to permit an issuer to submit exhibits to
Form C in Portable Document Format (“PDF”) as official filings. 512 We appreciate the views of
commenters that issuers would likely use various types of media for their offerings, 513 and believe
that permitting these materials to be filed in PDF format will allow for more diverse presentations
of information to be reasonably available to investors through a standardized, commonly available
media. Under the final rules, issuers may customize the presentation of their non-XML
disclosures and file those disclosures as exhibits to the Form C. For example, an issuer may
provide the required disclosures by uploading to EDGAR, as an exhibit to Form C, a PDF version
of the relevant information presented on the intermediary’s platform, including charts, graphs, and
a transcript or description of any video presentation or any other media not reflected in the PDF.

510

An issuer that does not already have EDGAR filing codes, and to which the Commission has not previously
assigned a user identification number, which we call a “Central Index Key (CIK)” code, will need to obtain
the codes by filing electronically a Form ID [17 CFR 239.63; 249.446; 269.7 and 274.402] at
https://www.filermanagement.edgarfiling.sec.gov. The applicant also will be required to submit a notarized
authenticating document as a Portable Document Format (PDF) attachment to the electronic filing. The
authenticating document will need to be manually signed by the applicant over the applicant’s typed
signature, to include the information contained in the Form ID and to confirm the authenticity of the Form
ID. See 17 CFR 232.10(b)(2).

511

See Rule 203 of Regulation Crowdfunding. We have made some technical changes in the final rules that do
not affect their substantive requirements. To maintain consistency with other Commission rules and to keep
electronic filing requirements consolidated in Regulation S-T, we have deleted from proposed Rules 201,
202 and 203 the phrase “on EDGAR” where it appeared after “file with the Commission.” We also have
deleted the instruction to proposed Rule 203(a)(1) as the list of information set forth in that instruction was
duplicative of the XML-based portion of Form C itself.

512

See Rule 101(a)(1)(xvii) of Regulation S-T. Regulation S-T generally allows PDF documents to be filed
only as unofficial copies. See Rule 104 of Regulation S-T. However, Rule 101 provides for certain
exceptions to this restriction. See, e.g., Rule 101(ix)(allowing a PDF attachment to Form ID); Rule
101(a)(xiv)(requiring the filing of Form NRSRO and related exhibits in PDF as official filings).

513

See, e.g., CFIRA Letter 6; CFIRA Letter 7; CrowdCheck Letter 1; Grassi Letter; Hackers/Founders Letter;
RocketHub Letter; Wefunder Letter; Wilson Letter.

131

This approach should provide key offering information in a standardized format and give issuers
flexibility in the presentation of other required disclosures. We believe this flexibility is important
given that we expect that issuers engaged in offerings in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) would
encompass a wide variety of industries at different stages of business development.
We are adopting the XML-based fillable form as proposed with a few modifications. 514
As suggested by some commenters, 515 the XML-based portion of Form C will require issuers to
indicate by checkbox the jurisdictions in which securities are intended to be offered. We also are
changing the name of proposed Form C-A to Form C/A to be consistent with the naming
convention of our other amendment forms and adding Form C-AR/A to allow, and facilitate
identification of, the amendment of an issuer’s Form C-AR annual report. In addition, we are
adding an instruction to clarify that the issuer should mark the appropriate box on the cover of
Form C to indicate which form it is filing. We also are splitting the “Form, jurisdiction and date
of organization” field into three fields to facilitate more accurate tracking of this data. We also
inserted the statement required by paragraph (g) of Rule 201 immediately following the data
required by that paragraph, so that statement appears together with the relevant data. Finally, we
are modifying certain other field names and the General Instructions to Form C to clarify them or
to reflect applicable changes to the disclosure requirements discussed above.

514

As discussed in Section II.B.1, issuers will input in the proposed XML-based filing the following
information: name, legal status and contact information of the issuer; name, SEC file number and CRD
number (as applicable) of the intermediary through which the offering will be conducted; the amount of
compensation paid to the intermediary to conduct the offering, including the amount of referral and other
fees associated with the offering; any other direct or indirect interest in the issuer held by the intermediary, or
any arrangement for the intermediary to acquire such an interest; number of securities offered; offering price;
target offering amount; whether oversubscriptions will be accepted and, if so, how they will be allocated;
maximum offering amount (if different from the target offering amount); deadline to reach the target offering
amount; current number of employees of the issuer; selected financial data for the prior two fiscal years; and
the jurisdictions in which the issuer intends to offer the securities.

515

See, e.g., Commonwealth of Massachusetts Letter; NASAA Letter.

132

We believe that requiring certain information to be submitted in XML format will support
the assembly and transmission of those required disclosures to EDGAR on Form C. 516 It also will
make certain key information about each offering available to investors and market observers in
electronic format and allow the Commission to observe the implementation of the crowdfunding
exemption under Section 4(a)(6). Information will be available about the types of issuers using
the exemption, including the issuers’ size, location, securities offered and offering amounts and
the intermediaries through which the offerings are taking place. We believe the addition of the
requirement to indicate the jurisdictions in which the issuer intends to offer the securities, as
suggested by several commenters, will facilitate oversight by state regulators, who retain antifraud
authority over crowdfunding transactions, while imposing only minimal costs on issuers.
In addition, in a change from the proposed rules, the final Form C includes an optional
Question and Answer (“Q&A”) format that issuers may elect to use to provide the disclosures that
are not required to be filed in XML format. 517 Issuers opting to use this format would prepare
their disclosures by answering the questions provided and filing that disclosure as an exhibit to the
Form C. A number of commenters noted that an optional format such as this would be less
burdensome for small issuers while still providing the Commission and investors with the required
information. 518 We believe that this option may help to facilitate compliance and ease burdens on
by providing a mechanism by which issuers can easily confirm that they have provided all
required information.
516

The Commission will make the information available via EDGAR both in a traditional text-based format for
reading and as downloadable XML-tagged data for analysis.

.

133

Consistent with the proposal, we are adopting a single Form C for all filings under
Regulation Crowdfunding. 519 We believe that the use of one form will be more efficient than
requiring multiple forms, will not result in unduly lengthy forms, and will simplify the filing
process for issuers and their preparers. EDGAR will automatically provide each filing with an
appropriate tag depending on which box the issuer checks so that investors can distinguish
among the different filings.
We also are adopting, largely as proposed, the requirements to provide the offering
information to investors and the relevant intermediary and make it available to potential investors
under Section 4A(b)(1). 520 In addition, as discussed above in Section II.B., we moved the
definition of “investor” from proposed Rule 300(c)(4) to Rule 100(d) to clarify that for purposes
of all of Regulation Crowdfunding, “investor” includes any investor or any potential investor, as
the context requires. 521 In connection with this clarifying change, we have deleted the phrase
“and make available to potential investors” each time it appeared in the rule text to avoid
redundancy. 522
The final rules provide that issuers will satisfy the requirement to file the offering
information with the Commission and provide it to the relevant intermediary by filing the Form C:
Offering Statement and any amendments and progress updates and providing to the relevant
intermediary a copy of the disclosures filed with the Commission. 523 The initial offering

134

statement should include all of the information that is provided on the intermediary’s website. 524
We also are adopting as proposed the requirements to file with the Commission and provide, or
make available, as applicable, to investors and the relevant intermediary an amendment to the
offering statement to disclose any material changes, additions or updates to information provided to
investors through the intermediary’s platform. 525 Issuers may, but are not required to, file an
amendment to reflect other changes, additions or updates to information provided to investors
through the intermediary’s platform that it considers not material.
To satisfy the requirement to provide the disclosures, or make them available, as
applicable, to investors, the final rules allow issuers to provide the information to investors
electronically by referring investors to the information on the intermediary’s platform through a
posting on the issuer’s website or by e-mail. 526 As discussed in the proposal and noted by
commenters, many issuers may not have e-mail addresses for investors. Accordingly, the final
rules permit issuers to provide this information to investors through a website posting. 527
However, to the extent e-mail addresses for investors are available to issuers, issuers may
contact investors via e-mail to direct them to the posted information. We continue to believe
that investors in this type of Internet-based offering will be familiar with obtaining information
on the Internet and that providing the information in this manner will be cost-effective for
issuers. As discussed in the Proposing Release, we believe Congress contemplated that
crowdfunding would, by its very nature, occur over the Internet or other similar electronic media

In some cases, intermediaries may offer, as part of their service, to file the disclosure with the Commission
on behalf of the issuer.

that is accessible to the public. 528 Therefore, consistent with the proposed rules, the final rules
do not require issuers to provide physical copies of the information to investors.

Prohibition on Advertising Terms of the Offering
a.

Proposed Rules

Securities Act Section 4A(b)(2) provides that an issuer shall “not advertise the terms of the
offering, except for notices which direct investors to the funding portal or broker.” Consistent
with the statute, proposed Rule 204 of Regulation Crowdfunding would allow an issuer to publish
a notice advertising the terms of an offering in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) so long as the notice
includes the address of the intermediary’s platform on which additional information about the
issuer and the offering may be found. The proposal did not impose limitations on how the issuer
distributes the notices. As proposed, the notice could include no more than: (1) a statement that
the issuer is conducting an offering, the name of the intermediary through which the offering is
being conducted and a link directing the investor to the intermediary’s platform; (2) the terms of
the offering; and (3) factual information about the legal identity and business location of the
issuer, limited to the name of the issuer of the security, the address, phone number and website of
the issuer, the e-mail address of a representative of the issuer and a brief description of the
business of the issuer. Under the proposed rules, “terms of the offering” would include: (1) the
amount of securities offered; (2) the nature of the securities; (3) the price of the securities; and (4)

528

We note that Section 301 of the JOBS Act states that “[Title III] may be cited as the ‘Capital Raising Online
While Deterring Fraud and Unethical Non-Disclosure Act of 2012’.” See Section 301 of the JOBS Act. See
also 158 Cong. Rec. S1689 (daily ed. March 15, 2012) (statement of Sen. Mark Warner) (“There is now the
ability to use the Internet as a way for small investors to get the same kind of deals that up to this point only
select investors have gotten…, where we can now use the power of the Internet, through a term called
crowdfunding.”); id. at S1717 (Statement of Sen. Mary Landrieu) (“this crowdfunding bill—which is, in
essence, a way for the Internet to be used to raise capital…”).

the closing date of the offering period. The proposed rules would not, however, restrict an
issuer’s ability to communicate other information that does not refer to the terms of the offering.
The proposed rules also would allow an issuer to communicate with investors about the
terms of the offering through communication channels provided by the intermediary on the
intermediary’s platform, so long as the issuer identifies itself as the issuer in all communications.
b.

Comments Received

Commenters were mostly supportive of these provisions. Several commenters expressed
support for the proposed content of advertising notices 529 and the definition of “terms of the
offering.” 530 A number of commenters also supported the proposal’s absence of a restriction on
an issuer’s ability to communicate information that does not refer to the terms of the offering. 531
Several commenters requested clarification on various aspects of the proposal. 532
Several commenters recommended that, consistent with the proposal, the Commission not
restrict the media or format that may be used for advertising notices, 533 with some pointing to the
changing nature of social media and potential new user interfaces. 534 Two commenters, however,
stated that communications about the offering should always be conducted through the
intermediary. 535 A number of commenters also supported allowing an issuer to communicate with

intermediary on the intermediary’s platform, so long as the issuer identifies itself in all
communications. 536
Some commenters opposed the proposed advertising rules, with some stating that the
advertising restrictions are unnecessary because sales must occur through an intermediary’s
platform, which would contain all of the relevant disclosures and investor acknowledgments. 537
One commenter asked that an issuer be given broader leeway to publicize its business or offering
on its own website or social media platform so long as the specific terms of the offering can be
found only through the intermediary’s platform. 538 One commenter recommended allowing
advertising notices to have a section for supplemental information highlighting certain intangible
purposes such as a particular social cause. 539
Two other commenters recommended that any advertising notices be filed with the
Commission and/or the relevant intermediary. 540 Several other commenters supported the
proposed approach of not having advertising notices filed with the Commission or the
intermediary, citing concerns about various formats of the communications, inability to capture all
third-party communications, and the costs associated with trying to capture the data. 541

Final Rules

We are adopting the prohibition on advertising terms of the offering substantially as
proposed, with minor changes to the rule text for clarity. 542 Under the final rules, an advertising
notice that includes the terms of the offering can include no more than: (1) a statement that the
issuer is conducting an offering, the name of the intermediary through which the offering is being
conducted and a link directing the investor to the intermediary’s platform; (2) the terms of the
offering; and (3) factual information about the legal identity and business location of the issuer,
limited to the name of the issuer of the security, the address, phone number and website of the
issuer, the e-mail address of a representative of the issuer and a brief description of the business of
the issuer. Consistent with the proposal, the final rules define “terms of the offering” to include:
(1) the amount of securities offered; (2) the nature of the securities; (3) the price of the securities;
and (4) the closing date of the offering period. 543
The permitted notices will be similar to “tombstone ads” under Securities Act Rule 134, 544
except that the notices will be required to direct an investor to the intermediary’s platform through
which the offering is being conducted, such as through a link directing the investor to the
platform.
Although at least one commenter recommended allowing advertising notices to have a
section for supplemental information highlighting certain intangible purposes such as a particular
social cause, 545 we do not believe a separate section is necessary. Instead, this type of information
may be included as part of the “brief description of the business.”

139

Two commenters 546 expressed concern that the proposed rule would not allow enough
flexibility for brief, informal social media communications, but we disagree. A notice cannot
include more than the enumerated matters, but an issuer has the flexibility not to include each of
the enumerated matters in the notice, which may facilitate certain types of social media
communications. For example, an issuer would be able to note on its own website or on social
media that it is conducting an offering and direct readers to the materials on the intermediary’s
platform. There is no requirement for legends on these notices because the issuer will be directing
investors to the materials on the intermediary’s platform that will include those required legends.
We believe that this approach will provide flexibility for issuers while protecting investors
by limiting the advertising of the terms of the offering to the information permitted in the notice
and directing them to the intermediary’s platform where they can access the disclosures necessary
for them to make informed investment decisions.
Consistent with the recommendation of several commenters, 547 the final rules do not
impose limitations on how the issuer distributes the notices. For example, an issuer could place
notices in newspapers or post notices on social media sites or the issuer’s own website. We
believe the final rules will allow issuers to leverage social media to attract investors, while at the
same time protecting investors by limiting the ability of issuers to advertise the terms of the
offering without directing them to the required disclosure. We are not adopting a requirement that
all notices be filed with the Commission or relevant intermediary, as requested by some
commenters. 548 Other commenters expressed concerns about the costs that would be associated

informality of modern social media communication tools.”)

548

See, e.g., Hackers/Founders Letter; Joinvestor Letter.

140

with such a requirement, and given that investors will be directed to the required disclosure on the
intermediary’s platform, we believe the final rules appropriately take these factors into account. 549
Further, the final rules allow an issuer to communicate with investors about the terms of
the offering through communication channels provided by the intermediary on the intermediary’s
platform, so long as the issuer identifies itself as the issuer in all communications. We believe
that one of the central tenets of the concept of crowdfunding is that the members of the crowd
decide whether or not to fund an idea or business after sharing information with each other. As
part of those communications, we believe it is important for the issuer to be able to respond to
questions about the terms of the offering or even challenge or refute statements made through the
communication channels provided by the intermediary. Therefore, the final rules do not restrict
issuers from participating in those communications so long as the issuer identifies itself as the
issuer in all communications.
Based on the suggestion of a few commenters, 550 we are clarifying in the final rules that
the prohibition on advertising the terms of the offering and related requirements apply to persons
acting on behalf of the issuer. 551 For example, persons acting on behalf of the issuer are required
under Rule 204(c) to identify their affiliation with the issuer in all communications on the
intermediary’s platform. 552
In addition, the final rules do not restrict an issuer’s ability to communicate other
information that might occur in the ordinary course of its operations and that does not refer to the
terms of the offering. As stated in the Proposing Release, we believe that this is consistent with
549

the statute because Section 4A(b)(2) restricts the advertising of the terms of the offer. The
Commission has interpreted the term “offer” broadly, however, and has explained that “the
publication of information and publicity efforts, made in advance of a proposed financing which
have the effect of conditioning the public mind or arousing public interest in the issuer or in its
securities constitutes an offer…” 553 In this regard, we also note that Securities Act Rule 169 554
permits non-Exchange Act reporting issuers engaged in an initial public offering to continue to
publish, subject to certain exclusions and conditions, regularly released factual business
information that is intended for use by persons other than in their capacity as investors.
While one commenter requested a safe harbor for regularly released factual business
information so long as it does not refer to the terms of the offering, 555 we do not believe that a safe
harbor is necessary. Ultimately, whether or not a communication is limited to factual business
information depends on the facts and circumstances of that particular communication. However,
issuers may generally look to the provisions of Rule 169 for guidance in making this
determination in the Regulation Crowdfunding context.
5.

Compensation of Persons Promoting the Offering
a.

Proposed Rules

Consistent with Securities Act Section 4A(b)(3), proposed Rule 205 of Regulation
Crowdfunding would prohibit an issuer from compensating, or committing to compensate,
directly or indirectly, any person to promote the issuer’s offering through communication
channels provided by the intermediary, unless the issuer takes reasonable steps to ensure that the

The term “offer” has been interpreted broadly and goes beyond the common law concept of an offer. See,
e.g., Diskin v. Lomasney & Co., 452 F.2d 871 (2d. Cir. 1971).

554

142

person clearly discloses the receipt (both past and prospective) of compensation each time the
person makes a promotional communication. Further, a founder or an employee of the issuer that
engages in promotional activities on behalf of the issuer through the communication channels
provided by the intermediary would be required to disclose, with each posting, that he or she is
engaging in those activities on behalf of the issuer.
Under the proposed rules, an issuer would not be able to compensate or commit to
compensate, directly or indirectly, any person to promote its offerings outside of the
communication channels provided by the intermediary, unless the promotion is limited to notices
that comply with the proposed advertising rules.
b.

Comments Received

Commenters were generally supportive of promoter disclosure and the proposed rule. 556 A
number of commenters supported the broad applicability of the proposed rules to persons acting
on behalf of the issuer. 557 Some commenters recommended that the issuer or intermediary bear
more responsibility for ensuring that the identity of the promoters be prominently disclosed. 558
A number of commenters also supported the requirement in the proposal that an issuer not
compensate or commit to compensate, directly or indirectly, any person to promote its offerings
outside of the communication channels provided by the intermediary, unless the promotion is
limited to notices that comply with the proposed advertising rules. 559

c.

Final Rules

We are adopting, as proposed, final rules about the compensation of persons promoting the
offering, with one clarifying change. 560 We anticipate that communication channels provided by
the intermediary will provide a forum through which investors could share information to help the
members of the crowd decide whether or not to fund the issuer. We believe that it will be
important for investors to know whether persons using those communication channels are persons
acting on behalf of the issuer or persons receiving compensation from the issuer (or from persons
acting on behalf of the issuer), to promote the issuer’s offering because of the potential for selfinterest or bias in communications by these persons.
A number of commenters supported the broad applicability of the proposed rules to
persons acting on behalf of the issuer. 561 The text of the proposed rule included a sentence stating
that the disclosure obligation would apply to “a founder or an employee of the issuer that engages
in promotional activities on behalf of the issuer through the communication channels.” Based on
comments received, we are removing that sentence and adding an instruction to clarify that the
requirement applies broadly to all persons acting on behalf of the issuer, regardless of whether or
not the compensation they receive is specifically for the promotional activities. The change is
intended to clarify that the disclosure requirement applies to persons hired specifically to promote
the offering as well as to persons (including, but not limited to, founders, employees and directors)
who are otherwise employed by the issuer or who undertake promotional activities on behalf of
the issuer.

144

While we appreciate the views of commenters who suggested that we impose additional
requirements on issuers or intermediaries to ensure that the identity of promoters is prominently
disclosed, we believe the requirement that the issuer take reasonable steps to ensure that
promoters clearly disclose the receipt of compensation for communications is sufficient to achieve
the objectives of this provision without being overly prescriptive. There are a number of
reasonable steps the issuer can take to ensure compliance. An issuer could, for example,
contractually require any promoter to include the required statement about receipt of
compensation, confirm that the promoter is adhering to the intermediary’s terms of use that
require promoters to affirm whether or not they are compensated by the issuer, monitor
communications made by such persons and take the necessary steps to have any communications
that do not have the required statement removed promptly from the communication channels, or
retain a person specifically identified by the intermediary to promote all issuers on its platform.
As proposed, the final rules also specify that the issuer shall not compensate or commit to
compensate, directly or indirectly, any person to promote its offerings outside of the
communication channels provided by the intermediary, unless the promotion is limited to notices
that comply with the advertising rules discussed above in Section II.B.4. 562 This prohibition
should prevent issuers from circumventing the restrictions on advertising by compensating a third
party to do what the issuer cannot do directly.

Other Issuer Requirements
a.

Oversubscriptions

The proposed rules would not limit an issuer’s ability to accept investments in excess of
the target offering amount, subject to the $1 million annual limit. 563 Issuers would be required to
disclose how much they would be willing to accept in oversubscriptions, how the
oversubscriptions would be allocated, and the intended purpose of those additional funds.
Commenters were generally supportive of this approach to oversubscriptions. 564 Some
commenters supported the proposed flexibility to allow issuers to determine how to allocate
oversubscribed offerings, 565 while other commenters recommended that the Commission require
issuers to allocate oversubscriptions using a prescribed method. 566 Two commenters
recommended that the Commission limit the maximum oversubscription amount to a certain
percentage of the target offering amount, 567 while two other commenters opposed such a limit. 568
One commenter recommended that the Commission revise the proposed rules to clarify that
issuers would be required to disclose the “other” basis upon which oversubscriptions would be
allocated. 569

568

See Jacobson Letter; Public Startup Letter 2.

See Fund Democracy Letter.

146

We are adopting the rule relating to oversubscriptions as proposed, with one clarifying
change. 570 We do not believe, as some commenters suggested, that it is necessary to limit the
maximum oversubscription amount. Nor do we believe it is necessary to prescribe how to allocate
oversubscribed offerings so long as the issuer discloses, at the commencement of the offering,
how securities in such offerings will be allocated, and the intended purpose of those additional
funds. This disclosure should provide investors with information they need to make informed
investment decisions while providing issuers flexibility to structure the offering as they believe
appropriate. In response to a comment received, 571 we are clarifying in the final rules that,
regardless of the structure, the issuer must describe how securities in oversubscribed offerings will
be allocated.
b.

Offering Price

As discussed above in Section II.B.1.a.i.(e), proposed Rule 201(l) would require an issuer
to disclose the offering price of the securities or, in the alternative, the method for determining the
price, provided that prior to any sale of securities, each investor is provided in writing the final
price and all required disclosure. The proposed rules would not require issuers to set a fixed price
or prohibit dynamic pricing.
We received a few comments supporting the proposed approach or expressing opposition
to requiring a fixed price, 572 while another commenter suggested the Commission require issuers
to set a fixed price. 573

along with investors’ rights to cancel their investment commitments, provide reasonable safeguards); Wilson
Letter; Public Startup Letter 2.

573

See RocketHub Letter.

147

We are adopting the final rules as proposed. 574 While we appreciate the view of at least
one commenter 575 that a fixed price may be simpler for investors to understand, we believe that
the statute contemplated flexible pricing by providing that issuers may disclose the method for
determining the price, provided that the final price and required disclosures are provided to each
investor prior to any sales. We also believe the cancellation rights in the final rules 576 will provide
investors a reasonable opportunity to cancel their investment commitment if they wish to do so
after the price is fixed.
c.

Types of Securities Offered and Valuation

The proposed rules would not limit the type of securities that may be offered in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6) nor prescribe a method for valuing the securities. Issuers would be required to
describe the terms of the securities and the valuation method in their offering materials.
A number of commenters generally supported not limiting the types of securities that may
be offered and sold in reliance of Section 4(a)(6). 577 Comments were more varied on valuation
methodology. Some commenters recommended that the Commission neither require nor prohibit
a specific valuation methodology, 578 while others recommended that the Commission prescribe a
set of valuation standards that have universal application for startups. 579 Two commenters
recommended that the Commission require issuers to base the valuation of their securities on the

provisions.

price at which the issuer previously sold securities, 580 and another commenter recommended that
the Commission consider whether additional standards are needed to ensure that securities are
fairly valued and that approaches to valuation that put investors at a disadvantage be prohibited. 581
One commenter generally supported requiring issuers to describe how securities being offered are
being valued, 582 while another commenter generally opposed such requirement. 583
We are adopting, as proposed, final rules that neither limit the type of securities that may
be offered in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) nor prescribe a method for valuing the securities. 584 We
noted in the proposal that the statute refers to “securities” and does not limit the type of securities
that could be offered pursuant to the exemption. Issuers are required to describe the terms of the
securities and the valuation method in their offering materials. 585 We believe this approach is
consistent with the statute and will provide flexibility to issuers to determine the types of
securities that they offer to investors and how those securities are valued, while providing
investors with the information they need to make an informed investment decision.
While some commenters suggested that the Commission should provide specific valuation
methods or standards for securities-based crowdfunding transactions, we are not persuaded that
there would be sufficient benefits to being prescriptive in this regard. Methods and valuations of
early stage companies vary significantly, and any attempt to choose a particular valuation
methodology could limit flexibility and have the result of endorsing one approach over another

585

See Rule 201(m)(1) and (4) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

without necessarily having a sound basis for doing so. We believe the requirement that issuers
describe the methods they use to value their securities in their offering materials, including the
requirement that they describe examples of methods for how such securities may be valued by the
issuer in the future, will provide investors with the information they need to make an informed
investment decision.
The final rules do not limit the types of securities that may be offered in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6), and thus debt securities may be offered and sold in crowdfunding transactions.
As we stated in the Proposing Release, in general, the issuance of a debt security raises questions
about the applicability of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (“Trust Indenture Act”). 586 Although
the Trust Indenture Act applies to any debt security sold through the use of the mails or interstate
commerce, including debt securities sold in transactions that are exempt from Securities Act
registration, Trust Indenture Act Section 304(b) provides an exemption for any transaction that is
exempted by Securities Act Section 4 from the provisions of Section 5 of the Act. 587 An issuer
offering debt securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6), therefore, would be able to rely on this
exemption.588 Based on the availability of this exemption, we are not adopting a specific
exemption from the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act for offerings of debt securities made
in reliance on Section 4(a)(6).

period.

C.

Intermediary Requirements
1.

Definitions of Funding Portals and Associated Persons
a.

Proposed Rules

Securities Act Section 4(a)(6)(C) requires a crowdfunding transaction to be conducted
through a broker or funding portal that complies with the requirements of Securities Act Section
4A(a). The term “broker” is generally defined in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(4) as any person that
effects transactions in securities for the account of others. Exchange Act Section 3(a)(80) defines
the term “funding portal” as any person acting as an intermediary in a transaction involving the
offer or sale of securities for the account of others, solely pursuant to Securities Act Section
4(a)(6), that does not: (1) offer investment advice or recommendations; (2) solicit purchases, sales
or offers to buy the securities offered or displayed on its website or portal; (3) compensate
employees, agents or other persons for such solicitation or based on the sale of securities
displayed or referenced on its website or portal; (4) hold, manage, possess or otherwise handle
investor funds or securities; or (5) engage in such other activities as the Commission, by rule,
determines appropriate. 589
In the Proposing Release, we explained that because a funding portal would be engaged in
the business of effecting securities transactions for the accounts of others through crowdfunding, it
would be a “broker” within the meaning of Section 3(a)(4) of the Exchange Act. 590 Accordingly,
proposed Rule 300(c)(2) of Regulation Crowdfunding would define “funding portal” consistent
with the statutory definition of “funding portal,” with the substitution of the word “broker” for the
word “person.”
589

Congress in the JOBS Act inadvertently created two Sections 3(a)(80) in the Exchange Act, the other being
the definition of “emerging growth company” (added by Section 101(b) of Title I of the JOBS Act).

590

See Proposing Release at 78 FR 66458. See also discussion in Section II.D.2.

151

We also stated in the Proposing Release that the proposed rules would apply not only to
funding portals, but also to their associated persons in many instances. The terms “person
associated with a broker or dealer” and “associated person of a broker or dealer” are defined in
Exchange Act Section 3(a)(18). 591 Proposed Rule 300(c)(1) of Regulation Crowdfunding would
similarly define the term “person associated with a funding portal or associated person of a
funding portal” to mean any partner, officer, director or manager of a funding portal (or any
person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions), any person directly or
indirectly controlling or controlled by a funding portal, or any employee of a funding portal, other
than persons whose functions are solely clerical or ministerial. The proposed rules would provide,
however, that persons who are excluded from the definition of associated person of a funding
portal because their functions are solely clerical or ministerial would remain subject to our
sanctioning authority under Exchange Act Sections 15(b)(4) and 15(b)(6). 592 This definition is
consistent with, and modeled on, the language of Exchange Act Section 3(a)(18). 593
In proposed Rule 300(c)(4), we also defined “investor” as any investor or any potential
investor, as the context requires.
b.

Comments on the Proposed Rules

The Proposing Release requested comments on whether there were funding portal
activities, other than those in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(80), that we should prohibit, and whether
591

15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(18).

592

Section 15(b)(4) (15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(4)) authorizes the Commission to bring administrative proceedings for
the imposition of sanctions, up to and including the revocation of a broker’s registration, when the broker
violates the federal securities laws (and for other misconduct). Section 15(b)(6) (15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(6))
provides similar sanctioning authority with respect to persons associated with a broker, including the ability
to bar such persons from associating with any Commission registrant.

593

We note, however, that the definition in proposed Rule 300(c)(1) does not include persons under common
control with the funding portal, unlike the definition in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(18) which includes such
persons as associated persons of broker-dealers.

152

any prohibitions should be modified or removed. We also requested comments about whether
further guidance was necessary on the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder that would apply to funding portals.
Some commenters stated that the Commission should not provide any further guidance or
prohibitions on funding portal activity in addition to those required by statute. 594 One of these
commenters stated that the proposed regulations for funding portal activities are “sufficient for
investor protection and proper regulatory oversight.” 595 Another commenter opposed removing or
modifying the statutory limitations on funding portal activities, stating that if funding portals wish
to engage in the prohibited activities, they could do so by registering, and being appropriately
regulated as, broker-dealers. 596
c.

Final Rules

After considering the comments, we are adopting, as proposed, the definitions of
“associated person of a funding portal or person associated with a funding portal” and “funding
portal” in Rules 300(c)(1) and(2), respectively. In particular, we believe that, at the present time,
the statutory prohibitions on a funding portal in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(80), as reflected in the
final rule definition of a funding portal, provide appropriate investor protections.
We also are adopting the definition of “investor” from the proposed rules but have moved
the definition to Rule 100(d), and made a modification to clarify that the definition applies to all
594

See, e.g., RocketHub Letter; Tiny Cat Letter (stating that the proposed regulations provide a “healthy level of
investor protection, but are not overly burdensome and we wholeheartedly appreciate the [C]ommission’s
general attitude of restraint”). Another commenter also opposed additional prohibitions, stating that “to add
prohibitions would be an illegal Rule not authorized by the JOBS Act legislation.” See Public Startup Letter
2. This commenter made a similar argument with respect to various aspects of the rule. We note, however,
that the JOBS Act provides the Commission the authority to provide other requirements for the protection of
investors and in the public interest. See, e.g., Securities Act Section 4A(a)(12); 4A(b)(5).

595

of Regulation Crowdfunding. 597 Although commenters did not address the definition of
“investor,” we are making this change to address any potential confusion about whether the
definition is applicable to all of Regulation Crowdfunding.

General Requirements for Intermediaries
a.

Registration and SRO Membership
(1)

Proposed Rules

Securities Act Section 4A(a)(1) requires that a person acting as an intermediary in a
crowdfunding transaction register with the Commission as a broker or as a funding portal. 598
Proposed Rule 300(a)(1) of Regulation Crowdfunding would implement this requirement by
providing that a person acting as an intermediary in a transaction involving the offer or sale of
securities made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) must be registered with the Commission as a broker
under Exchange Act Section 15(b), or as a funding portal pursuant to Section 4A(a)(1) and
proposed Rule 400 of Regulation Crowdfunding. As discussed below, we also proposed to make
the information that a funding portal provides on the proposed registration form (i.e., Form
Funding Portal), other than personally identifiable information or other information with a
significant potential for misuse, accessible to the public. 599
Securities Act Section 4A(a)(2) requires an intermediary to register with any applicable
self-regulatory organization (“SRO”), as defined in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(26). 600 Exchange
597

See Section II.B.1.

598

As we noted in the Proposing Release, facilitating crowdfunded transactions (which involve the offer or sale
of securities by an issuer and not secondary market activity) alone would not require an intermediary to
register as an exchange or as an alternative trading system (i.e., registration as a broker-dealer subject to
Regulation ATS). See Proposing Release at 78 FR 66459 (discussing secondary market activity and
exchange or ATS registration).

599

See Section II.D.1 (discussing registration requirements).

600

15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26). Exchange Act Section 3(a)(26) defines an “SRO” to include, among other things, a
“registered securities association.” Id.

154

Act Section 3(h)(1)(B) separately requires, as a condition of the exemption from broker
registration, that a funding portal be a member of a national securities association that is registered
with the Commission under Exchange Act Section 15A. Proposed Rule 300(a)(2) would
implement these provisions by requiring an intermediary in a transaction involving the offer or
sale of securities made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) to be a member of FINRA or any other
national securities association registered under Exchange Act Section 15A. Currently, FINRA is
the only registered national securities association.
We also proposed definitions for the terms “intermediary” and “SRO” in proposed Rules
300(c)(3) and 300(c)(5) of Regulation Crowdfunding, respectively. As proposed, intermediary
would mean a broker registered under Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act or a funding portal
registered under proposed Rule 400 of Regulation Crowdfunding and would include, where
relevant, an associated person of the registered broker or registered funding portal. SRO was
proposed to have the same meaning as in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act.
(2)

Comments on the Proposed Rules

Commenters generally supported FINRA being the appropriate SRO and national
securities association for intermediaries. 601 In the Proposing Release, we asked if we were to
approve the registration of another national securities association under Exchange Act Section 15A
in the future, in addition to FINRA, whether it would it be appropriate for us to require
membership in both the existing and new association. Commenters urged that intermediaries be
required to register with only one such national securities association. 602
601

See, e.g., Joinvestor Letter; RocketHub Letter. One commenter stated that funding portals should not be
required to register with the Commission or become FINRA members because, unlike brokers, they serve
only as an “information delivery service.” See Perfect Circle Letter. We note, however, that registration is a
statutory requirement under Securities Act Section 4A(a)(1).

602

See, e.g., Joinvestor Letter; Public Startup Letter 2; RocketHub Letter; Vann Letter.

155

Certain commenters expressed concern about potential competitive advantages of
registered broker-dealers over funding portals, suggesting that the Commission should prohibit
brokers from engaging in transactions conducted pursuant to Section 4(a)(6) until funding portals
can become registered, 603 or provide funding portals a grace period so they may be able to operate
before their registration becomes effective. 604 Another commenter, however, suggested that
licensed broker-dealers should be immediately authorized to provide services associated with a
“registered crowdfunding portal” to any issuer looking to self-host or to an issuer that has “an
offline mechanism available for crowdfunding.” 605
In response to our requests for comment in the Proposing Release, commenters were also
divided on whether the Commission should require minimum qualification, testing and licensure
requirements for funding portals and their associated persons. 606
(3)

Final Rules

After considering the comments, we are adopting Rule 300(a) generally as proposed but
deleting specific references to FINRA in the final rule, as well as the rest of Regulation
Crowdfunding and Form Funding Portal, when referring to a registered national securities
association. Although we recognize that FINRA is currently the only registered national
securities, we believe it is redundant to specifically include its name when referring to registered
national securities associations in the rule text and Form Funding Portal.

603

See, e.g., RocketHub Letter.

604

See, e.g., Joinvestor Letter.

605

Public Startup Letter 2.

606

Comments in support included Hakanson Letter; Reichman Letter; RocketHub Letter. See also CrowdCorp
Letter (stating that the Commission should establish a separate licensing scheme for persons who help
prepare issuer disclosure documents and advise issuers, but who are not brokers or funding portals).
Comments opposed included Public Startup Letter 2; Startup Valley Letter.

156

We are cognizant of the fact that funding portals must register with the Commission and
become compliant with an entirely new set of rules. The effective date for the final rules (which
is 180 days after publication in the Federal Register, except for § 227.400, Form Funding Portal,
and the amendments to Form ID, which are effective January 29, 2016) is designed to provide a
sufficient amount of time for funding portals to register and establish the necessary infrastructure
to comply with other requirements being imposed in Regulation Crowdfunding before any
intermediaries – either broker-dealers or funding portals – may engage in crowdfunding activities.
We believe this should address commenters’ concerns that broker-dealers otherwise may gain a
competitive advantage if they were able to engage in crowdfunding activities before funding
portals are able to comply with the requirements needed to begin operation. 607
While FINRA is the only registered national securities association at present, we
recognize that a new national securities association or associations could register with us in the
future. At that time, a funding portal could choose to become a member of the new association(s)
instead of, or in addition to, its FINRA membership. As we noted above, we requested comment
on whether we should require membership in both the existing national securities association
(FINRA) and a new national securities association, if we were to approve another national
securities association in the future. We have considered commenters’ views and have determined
not to require that funding portals be members of multiple securities associations (should new
associations be registered in the future). Because all registered national securities associations
must satisfy the same statutory standards set forth in Exchange Act Section 15A, we do not

607

We note that broker-dealers may nonetheless have a competitive advantage to the extent that they are able to
provide a wider range of services than those permitted funding portals under the statute. However, we
believe this competitive advantage is balanced to a significant degree by a strong regulatory regime tailored
to that wider range of services.

157

believe at this time that requiring membership in additional associations would add significant
investor protections.
After considering comments, we have determined not to impose any licensing, testing or
qualification requirements for associated persons of funding portals. We believe that a registered
national securities association is well-positioned, given the requirements for registration as a
national securities association, as well as the statutory and regulatory requirements that apply to
such a registered entity, to determine whether to propose additional requirements such as
licensing, testing or qualification requirements for associated persons of funding portals. 608
We also are adopting as proposed the definitions for the terms “intermediary” in Rule
300(c)(3). However, we are removing the definition of “self-regulatory organization” and “SRO”
from the final rules because the term is already defined in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(26).
b.

Financial Interests
(1)

Proposed Rules

Securities Act Section 4A(a)(11) requires an intermediary to prohibit its directors, officers
or partners (or any person occupying a similar status or performing a similar function) from
having any financial interest in an issuer using its services. In the Proposing Release, we
proposed to use our discretion to extend the prohibition to the intermediary itself. Thus, proposed
Rule 300(b) of Regulation Crowdfunding would prohibit the intermediary, as well as its directors,
officers or partners (or any person occupying a similar status or performing a similar function),
from having: (1) a financial interest in an issuer using its services; and (2) from receiving a
financial interest in the issuer as compensation for services provided to, or for the benefit of, the
608

All SROs are required to file proposed rules and rule changes with us under Exchange Act Section 19(b) and
Rule 19b–4. In general, the Commission reviews proposed SRO rules and rule changes and publishes them
for comment. The Commission then approves or disapproves them, or the rules become effective
immediately or by operation of law.

issuer, in connection with the offer and sale of its securities. Proposed Rule 300(b) defined “a
financial interest in an issuer” to mean a direct or indirect ownership of, or economic interest in,
any class of the issuer’s securities.
(2)

Comments on the Proposed Rules

In general, commenters supported the Commission’s proposed financial interest
prohibition as it applies to an intermediary’s directors, officers or partners (or any person
occupying a similar status or performing a similar function), 609 as well as the proposed definition
of financial interest. 610 In contrast, however, many commenters opposed the Commission’s
proposed prohibition on an intermediary itself having or receiving a financial interest in the
issuer, 611 while some supported this proposed prohibition. 612
Commenters who supported our proposal to extend the prohibition on financial interests to
the intermediary suggested that such prohibitions may help to mitigate conflicts of interests. 613
One commenter stated that an intermediary having a financial interest in the issuer would skew

the incentives of the intermediary toward its own interests rather than the integrity of the
transaction, and also stated its view that disclosure of this interest could not cure this problem. 614
Several commenters who opposed the prohibition on an intermediary having a financial
interest in the issuer suggested that the prohibition would reduce the number and types of
intermediaries that might otherwise participate in crowdfunding activities. 615 These commenters
asserted that allowing an intermediary to take this financial interest would provide an option
through which issuers could provide payment to the intermediary for its services, and also permit
co-investments, which would ultimately benefit investors. 616 These commenters also asserted that
such a financial interest could align the interests of intermediaries with those of investors. 617 One
commenter suggested that “by removing an upfront cost and incentivizing an ongoing relationship
between the intermediary and the issuer, equity compensation for intermediaries fulfils the
Commission’s twin aims of efficient capital markets and investor protection.” 618 Another
commenter noted that permitting the intermediary to take a financial interest in the issuer would
encourage the development of funding portals that are sponsored by or affiliated with Community

Development Financial Institutions (“CDFIs”). 619 Yet another commenter suggested that
permitting the intermediary to take a financial interest in the issuer would incentivize
intermediaries to screen potential issuers for possible fraud or wrongdoing. 620 Other commenters
supported permitting the intermediary to take a financial interest in the issuer so long as the terms
of the financial interests taken by the intermediary are the same as or not more favorable than
those taken by investors in the offering. 621 Commenters suggested additional measures, such as
adequate disclosure, 622 a five percent interest limitation, 623 and restrictions on the ability of an
intermediary to transfer its interests in the issuer, could help to address any conflicts of interest
concerns. 624

Final Rules

After considering the comments, we are adopting Rule 300(b), as proposed, with respect to
an intermediary’s directors, officers or partners (or any person occupying a similar status or
619

See Concerned Capital Letter (suggesting the Commission broaden the definition of intermediaries to
encourage portals sponsored by and/or affiliated with U.S. Treasury-recognized CDFIs and exempt such
portals from the prohibitions against having a financial interest in issuers). See also City First Letter
(suggesting that the Commission allow CDFIs to act as co-lenders).
The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, which was established by the Riegle Community
Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994, is a government program that promoted access to

risk capital for needed community facilities, and technical assistance, commercial loans and investments to
small start-up or expanding businesses in low-income areas. CDFIs include regulated institutions such as

performing a similar function). Rule 300(b), as adopted, prohibits an intermediary’s directors,
officers or partners (or any person occupying a similar status or performing a similar function)
from having any financial interest in an issuer using its services. Rule 300(b) also specifically
prohibits these persons from receiving a financial interest in the issuer as compensation for
services provided to, or for the benefit of, the issuer, in connection with the offer and sale of its
securities. Consistent with the proposal, Rule 300(b), as adopted, defines “a financial interest in
an issuer” to mean a direct or indirect ownership of, or economic interest in, any class of the
issuer’s securities. 625
We are not adopting, however, the proposed complete prohibition on the intermediary
itself having or receiving a financial interest in an issuer using its services. Although
intermediaries are generally prohibited under the rule as adopted from having such a financial
interest, as discussed below, in response to comments, we have amended the rule to permit an
intermediary to have a financial interest in an issuer that is offering or selling securities in reliance
on Section 4(a)(6) through the intermediary’s platform, provided that: (1) the intermediary
receives the financial interest from the issuer as compensation for the services provided to, or for
the benefit of, the issuer in connection with the offer or sale of such securities being offered or
sold in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) through the intermediary’s platform; and (2) the financial
interest consists of securities of the same class and having the same terms, conditions and rights as
625

As we explained in the Proposing Release, the prohibition is intended to protect investors from the conflicts
of interest that may arise when the persons facilitating a crowdfunding transaction have a financial stake in
the outcome. 78 FR at 66461. The prohibition extends to “any person occupying a similar status or
performing a similar function,” and applies with respect to both direct or indirect ownership of, or economic
interest in, any class of the issuer’s securities. In addition, we note that Section 15(b) of the Securities Act
creates liability for persons who aid and abet violations of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations
thereunder, such as would occur if a third person knowingly or recklessly provided substantial assistance to a
director, officer or partner (or any person occupying a similar status or position), for example, by accepting
and holding, on the officer’s behalf, a financial interest in the issuer in circumvention of the prohibition.

162

the securities being offered or sold in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) through the intermediary’s
platform.
We are mindful of concerns raised by commenters that a prohibition could have a chilling
effect on the ability of small issuers to use the crowdfunding exemption. These issuers may be
small businesses or neighborhood establishments that may not have the liquid capital to
compensate intermediaries for services. As commenters noted, allowing an intermediary to have
or receive a financial interest in the issuer could provide a method for the issuer to pay an
intermediary for its services, which may facilitate capital formation. This may, in turn, encourage
the development of funding portals that are, for example, affiliated with CDFIs, as one commenter
suggested. 626 As commenters further noted, permitting such a financial interest may also help to
align the interests of intermediaries and investors, and provide an additional incentive to screen
for fraud. We believe at this time the interest of promoting capital formation for small businesses,
and developing a workable framework for securities-based crowdfunding, counsels against
extending the prohibition on financial interests to the intermediary itself.
However, we are cognizant of the potential conflicts of interest that may arise, and
therefore we are placing certain conditions on the ability of intermediaries to have a financial
interest in an issuer that is offering or selling securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) through the
intermediary’s platform. 627 First, the intermediary must receive the financial interest from the
issuer as compensation for the services provided to, or for the benefit of, the issuer in connection
with the offer or sale of such securities being offered or sold in reliance on Section 4(a)(6). 628 We

626

See Concerned Capital Letter.

627

See notes 613-614 and accompanying text.

628

As noted above in Section II.C.2, an intermediary must be either a registered funding portal or a registered
broker-dealer, and must be a member of a registered national securities association. FINRA rules currently

163

believe that this limitation, which will allow intermediaries to receive securities as payment for
services but not otherwise permit them to invest in the offering, addresses commenters’ concerns
that a prohibition could have a “chilling effect” on the ability of small issuers to use the
crowdfunding exemption, while serving to mitigate concerns relating to intermediaries taking
steps to “artificially inflate” the value of securities in the offerings. 629 Second, we have
considered the comments in support of limiting an intermediary’s financial interest by requiring
that such interest be the same as or not more favorable than those taken by investors in the
offering, 630 and have determined to prohibit intermediaries from receiving a financial interest
unless it is in securities that are of the same class, and that have the same terms, conditions and
rights as the securities in the offering. We believe that this limitation will further serve to mitigate
any potential conflicts by helping to align the interests of the intermediary with those of the
investors in the offering. 631
We are persuaded that the disclosures otherwise required by Regulation Crowdfunding
also will help to address any potential conflicts of interest arising from an intermediary having or
receiving a financial interest in an issuer. Among other things, Rule 302(d) requires an
intermediary to clearly disclose the manner in which it will be compensated in connection with

require that its broker-dealer members charge reasonable fees for their services and observe just and
equitable principles of trade in the conduct of their business. FINRA has also filed a proposed rule change
with the Commission to apply certain rules to funding portals, including requiring them to observe high
standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade in the conduct of their businesses.
See Proposed Rule Change to Adopt the Funding Portal Rules and Related Forms and FINRA Rule 4518,
SR-FINRA-2015-040 (Oct. 9, 2015).
629

See Consumer Federation Letter.

630

See note 621.

631

The rule does not preclude an intermediary from receiving securities as compensation for services from the
same issuer for a subsequent offering conducted by the issuer in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) as long as the
securities received are compensation for services provided during the subsequent offering and are of the
same class and have the same terms, conditions and rights as the securities being offered in the subsequent
offering.

164

offerings and sales of securities made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) at account opening and Rule
303(f) requires disclosure of remuneration received by an intermediary (including securities
received as remuneration) on confirmations. 632 We believe that these disclosures will provide
investors with relevant information concerning any intermediary’s financial interests (including
whether such interest was acquired on the same terms that are available to investors), which, in
turn, will help investors to make better informed investment decisions. In addition, the
intermediary must comply with all other applicable requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding,
including the statutory limitations on a funding portal’s activities. 633
Commission staff expects to review the compensation structure of intermediaries during
the study of the federal crowdfunding exemption it plans to undertake no later than three years
following the effective date of Regulation Crowdfunding. 634

632

See Sections II.C.4.d and II.C.5.f. See also Rule 302(c) of Regulation Crowdfunding (requiring
intermediaries to inform investors, at the time of account opening, that promoters must clearly disclose in all
communications on the platform the receipt of compensation and the fact that he or she is engaging in
promotional activities on behalf of the issuer).

633

See Exchange Act Section 3(a)(80) (defining “funding portal” and establishing certain limitations on their
activities consistent with the statute, such as prohibiting a funding portal from offering investment advice or
recommendation; soliciting purchases, sales or offers to buy securities offered or displayed on its website or
portal; or holding, managing, possessing, or otherwise handling investor funds or securities). In this regard,
compliance with disclosures required by Regulation Crowdfunding generally would not cause a funding
portal to provide investment advice or recommendations. Nonetheless, a funding portal should seek to
ensure that disclosure of its financial interest(s) in an issuer is not inconsistent with the statutory prohibition
on providing investment advice or recommendations. For example, a funding portal must not present its
financial interest in an issuer as a recommendation or endorsement of that issuer. See Section II.D.3. We
also note that if a funding portal holds, owns or proposes to acquire securities issued by an issuer, or multiple
issuers, that individually or in aggregate exceed more than 40% of the value of the funding portal’s total
assets (excluding government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis, the funding portal may
fall within the definition of investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company
Act. We generally would expect, however, that such funding portal would seek to rely on the exclusion from
the definition of investment company in Section 3(c)(2) of the Investment Company Act for (among other
things) a person primarily engaged in the business of acting as a broker.

634

See Section II.

Measures to Reduce Risk of Fraud

Securities Act Section 4A(a)(5) requires an intermediary to “take such measures to reduce
the risk of fraud with respect to [transactions made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6)], as established
by the Commission, by rule, including obtaining a background and securities enforcement
regulatory history check on each officer, director, and person holding more than 20 percent of the
outstanding equity of every issuer whose securities are offered by such person.” As discussed
below, after considering the comments, we are adopting Rule 301 of Regulation Crowdfunding
substantially as proposed, with a few changes to Rule 301(c)(2).
a.

Issuer compliance
(1)

Proposed Rule

We proposed in Rule 301(a) of Regulation Crowdfunding to require that an intermediary
have a reasonable basis for believing that an issuer seeking to offer or sell securities though the
intermediary’s platform complies with the requirements of Section 4(a)(6) and the related
requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding. For this requirement, we proposed that an
intermediary may reasonably rely on an issuer’s representations about compliance unless the
intermediary has reason to question the reliability of those representations.
(2)

Comments on Proposed Rule

Commenters generally agreed that intermediaries play a significant role in preventing and
detecting fraud and should take measures to reduce potential fraud. Some commenters, however,
expressed concerns about the proposed “reasonable basis” standard for an intermediary’s belief

166

about an issuer’s compliance with applicable laws stating that the standard should be higher. 635
Others commenters supported the standard. 636
A number of commenters expressed concern about the proposed reliance on issuer
representations. 637 Some commenters suggested an intermediary should be required to conduct
some type of due diligence on the issuer, as opposed to relying on issuer representations. 638
Another commenter went further by suggesting that an intermediary should also have an ongoing
obligation to monitor communications by issuers during the course of the offering to detect and
prevent violations of the securities laws and the regulations thereunder. 639 Another commenter
stated that an issuer’s representation should not suffice unless it is detailed enough to evidence a
reasonable awareness by the issuer of its key obligations and the ability to comply with those
obligations. 640
One commenter argued that the language of the proposed rule was contradictory because
relying on representations made by the issuer is not the same as establishing a reasonable basis for
believing the issuer is in compliance. 641

One commenter recommended that the Commission “consider a tiered approach to
compliance obligations” where, as the size of the offering or other risk factors increased,
intermediaries would be required to conduct more rigorous compliance reviews. 642 Under such an
approach, this commenter stated that for small offerings that cap investments at a low level, $500
for example, and where there is no participation by individuals with a history of security law
violations, the intermediary would be permitted to rely on representations by issuers to satisfy its
obligation to ensure compliance. As the size of the offering, the size of permitted investments, or
other risk factors increase, the commenter stated that the Commission should consider requiring
intermediaries to conduct more rigorous compliance reviews.
(3)

Final Rule

Rule 301(a), as adopted, requires that an intermediary have a reasonable basis for
believing that an issuer seeking to offer and sell securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) through
the intermediary’s platform complies with the requirements in Securities Act Section 4A(b) and
the related requirements in Regulation Crowdfunding. While some commenters argued for higher
or different standards, such as requiring intermediaries to conduct due diligence on issuers or
monitor communications by issuers during the course of the offering, we believe that a reasonable
basis standard is appropriate, particularly in view of the issuer’s own obligation to comply with
the requirements in Section 4A(b) and the related requirements in Regulation Crowdfunding. We
are mindful as well of the associated costs of a potentially higher standard. Consistent with the
proposal, Rule 301(a) also permits intermediaries to reasonably rely on representations of the
issuer, unless the intermediary has reason to question the reliability of those representations.

642

See IAC Recommendation; see also BetterInvesting Letter.

168

In satisfying the requirements of Rule 301(a), we emphasize that an intermediary has a
responsibility to assess whether it may reasonably rely on an issuer’s representation of compliance
through the course of its interactions with potential issuers. 643 We agree with comments that an
intermediary seeking to rely on an issuer representation should consider whether the
representation is detailed enough to evidence a reasonable awareness by the issuer of its
obligations and its ability to comply with those obligations. The specific steps an intermediary
should take to determine whether it can rely on an issuer representation may vary, but should be
influenced by and tailored according to the intermediary’s knowledge and comfort with each
particular issuer. We believe this approach is generally consistent with the view of one
commenter that suggested a tiered approach to compliance obligations where intermediaries
should conduct more rigorous compliance reviews and background checks as risk factors
increase. 644

Records of Securities Holders
(1)

Proposed Rule

We proposed in Rule 301(b) of Regulation Crowdfunding a requirement that an
intermediary have a reasonable basis for believing that an issuer has established means to keep
accurate records of the holders of the securities it would offer and sell through the intermediary’s
platform. We proposed that an intermediary may reasonably rely on an issuer’s representations
643

In addition, an intermediary’s potential liability under Securities Act Section 4A(c), as added by the JOBS
Act, may encourage intermediaries to develop adequate procedures to fully assess whether reliance on an
issuer’s representation is reasonable. We also note that Congress provided a defense to any such liability if
an intermediary did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the untruth or
omission. Therefore, and as identified in the Proposing Release, we continue to believe that there are
appropriate steps that intermediaries might take in exercising reasonable care in light of this liability
provision. See Section II.E.5 (discussing scope of statutory liability).

644

We also emphasize that when an intermediary seeks to rely on the representations of others to form a
reasonable basis, the intermediary should have policies and procedures regarding under what circumstances
it can reasonably rely on such representations and when additional investigative steps may be appropriate.
See Section II.D.4.

169

about compliance unless the intermediary has reason to question the reliability of those
representations. We did not propose a particular form or method of recordkeeping of securities,
nor did we propose to require that an issuer use a transfer agent or other third party. 645 We noted,
however, that requiring a registered transfer agent to be involved after the offering could introduce
a regulated entity with experience in maintaining accurate shareholder records, 646 and we asked in
the Proposing Release whether we should require an issuer to use a regulated transfer agent to
keep such records and whether there were less costly means by which an issuer could rely on a
third party to assist with the recordkeeping. 647

Comments on Proposed Rule

Commenters agreed that an intermediary should have a basis for believing that an issuer
has established a means to keep accurate records. 648 Commenters were divided, however,
between those who supported 649 and those who opposed 650 any requirement mandating the use of
a registered transfer agent. Commenters supporting the required use of registered transfer agents
cited potential benefits, including reducing internal costs and providing corporate transparency; 651
having the transfer agent serve as the issuer’s paying agent, proxy agent, exchange agent, tender

records; 653 and conducting internal audits to protect against theft. 654 Some commenters also
highlighted potential problems when non-registered transfer agents or the issuer maintains
records, including improper registration of multiple owners, duplicate records, missing certificate
numbers, inability to trace ownership, and inability to maintain records; 655 and incorrect handling
of corporate actions, failure to observe restrictions on transfers, and failure to follow abandoned
property reporting requirements. 656 One commenter suggested that the Commission should
identify specific areas for an intermediary to consider about an issuer’s recordkeeping capabilities
when determining whether or not to provide access to that issuer. 657 This commenter also urged
the Commission to create a safe harbor whereby an intermediary would be deemed to have met
the recordkeeping requirement if the issuer has retained a registered transfer agent or registered
broker-dealer. 658
Commenters that opposed the mandatory use of a registered transfer agent pointed to cost
concerns. 659 Some of these commenters stated that alternatives to transfer agents will develop,

experience. See also Computershare Letter (stating that a safe harbor should apply if another regulated
entity, such as a broker-dealer or a bank, is engaged to perform the services, which in turn may encourage
the use of professional regulated recordkeepers, thus enhancing overall protection in the crowdfunding
market).

including CPA firms, 660 registered broker-dealers 661 and software applications or other potential
low-cost alternatives. 662 Some commenters stated that intermediaries should be permitted to
provide the relevant recording services to issuers. 663 One commenter suggested funding portals
should only be permitted to do so with respect to securities purchased on their platform or
transferred among platforms, such that they would not be permitted to act as “full-fledged
[b]rokerage firms or transfer agents.” 664
(3)

Final Rules

After considering the comments, we are adopting Rule 301(b), as proposed, with one
modification. Rule 301(b) as adopted requires an intermediary to have a reasonable basis for
believing that an issuer has established means to keep accurate records of the holders of the
securities it would offer and sell through the intermediary’s platform, and provides that in
satisfying this requirement, an intermediary may rely on the representations of the issuer
concerning its means of recordkeeping unless the intermediary has reason to question the
reliability of those representations. We also are adding a provision to Rule 301(b) as adopted
stating that an intermediary will be deemed to have satisfied this requirement if the issuer has
engaged the services of a transfer agent that is registered under Section 17A of the Exchange
Act. 665 As we noted in the Proposing Release, we believe that the recordkeeping function may be
provided by the issuer, a broker, a transfer agent or some other (registered or unregistered) person.

665

15 U.S.C. 78q-1(c). We also note that an issuer’s exemption from Section 12(g) is conditioned on, among
other things, that issuer engaging a registered transfer agent. See Section II.E.4.

172

We recognize that, as a commenter explained, recordkeeping functions can be extensive and could
include, for example, the ability to (1) monitor the issuance of the securities the issuer offers and
sells through the intermediary’s platform, (2) maintain a master security holder list reflecting the
owners of those securities, (3) maintain a transfer journal or other such log recording any transfer
of ownership, (4) effect the exchange or conversion of any applicable securities, (5) maintain a
control book demonstrating the historical registration of those securities, and (6) countersign or
legend physical certificates of those securities. While the use of a registered transfer agent could
introduce a regulated entity with experience in maintaining accurate shareholder records, as noted
in the Proposing Release, we believe the issuer should have flexibility in establishing such means,
and that such flexibility may allow for competition among service providers that could reduce
operating costs for funding portals. We continue to believe that accurate recordkeeping can be
accomplished by diligent issuers or through a variety of third parties. We note also that, for
investors to have confidence in crowdfunding, issuers and intermediaries must have a shared
interest in ensuring stability and accuracy of records. Therefore, intermediaries should consider
the numerous obligations required of a record holder when determining whether an issuer has
established a reasonable means to keep accurate records of the security holders being offered and
sold securities through the intermediary’s platform.
At the same time, mindful of the role that may be played by registered transfer agents in
maintaining accurate shareholder records, we are providing a safe harbor for compliance with
Rule 301(b) for those issuers that use a registered transfer agent. While we do not intend to
provide regulated entities with a competitive advantage over other recordkeeping options that
comply with the rule’s requirements, we believe it is appropriate to provide certainty as to Rule

173

301(b) compliance in instances in which an issuer has engaged the services of a transfer agent that
is registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act.
c.

Denial of Platform Access
(1)

Proposed Rule

We also proposed in Rule 301(c)(1) of Regulation Crowdfunding a requirement that an
intermediary deny access by an issuer to its platform if it has a reasonable basis for believing that
an issuer, or any of its officers, directors or any person occupying a similar status or performing a
similar function, or any 20 Percent Beneficial Owner is subject to a disqualification under
proposed Rule 503. 666 In satisfying this requirement, we proposed to require an intermediary to,
at a minimum, conduct a background and securities enforcement regulatory history check on each
issuer whose securities are to be offered by the intermediary and on each officer, director or 20
Percent Beneficial Owner.
We further proposed in Rule 301(c)(2) to require an intermediary to deny access to its
platform if the intermediary believes the issuer or offering presents the potential for fraud or
otherwise raises concerns about investor protection. In satisfying this requirement, the proposed
rule would require that an intermediary deny access if it believes that it is unable to adequately or
effectively assess the risk of fraud of the issuer or its potential offering. In addition, we proposed
in Rule 301(c)(2) that if an intermediary becomes aware of information after it has granted access
that causes it to believe the issuer or the offering presents the potential for fraud or otherwise
raises concerns about investor protection, the intermediary would be required to promptly remove
the offering from its platform, cancel the offering, and return (or, for funding portals, direct the
return of) any funds that have been committed by investors in the offering.

See Section II.E.6 (discussing Rule 503 of Regulation Crowdfunding, which describes disqualification).

Comments on Proposed Rule

Commenters generally supported proposed Rule 301(c). 667 Commenters noted with
approval the discretion the proposed rules would provide intermediaries. 668 The “reasonable
basis” standard in proposed Rule 301(c)(1) also garnered comments. One commenter suggested
that the reasonable basis standard was not strong enough. 669 One commenter stated that having a
reasonable basis standard in the disqualification determination would be “difficult to imagine”
unless the Commission maintains a database for intermediaries to search. 670
Commenters had varied views on the proposed requirement in Rule 301(c)(1) for an
intermediary to perform a background check on the issuer and certain of its affiliated persons.
Several commenters supported the requirement, but a few commenters suggested ways to decrease
costs. 671 One commenter stated that only low-cost, minimum requirements should be
implemented, 672 while another commenter suggested that the background checks be required only
after an issuer has met its target offering amount so as to prevent unnecessary expense to the
intermediary. 673 Representing a different view, one commenter opposed a requirement for
background checks to be conducted on all persons related to an issuer. 674 Another commenter
noted that the checks would be appropriate, but did not support the requirement. 675

Commenters were divided as to whether we should set specific requirements for
background checks. One commenter stated that the proposal “fails to set even the most general of
standards for these checks” and “instead relies on intermediaries to use their experience and
judgment to reduce the risk of fraud.” 676 The same commenter stated that the proposed approach
is flawed and as such the checks are likely to be ineffective, especially because many
intermediaries are likely to be inexperienced. 677 Several commenters requested further
clarification and specification about required checks. 678 However, other commenters stated that
the Commission should not specify steps for an intermediary to take in conducting checks. 679
With respect to our request for comment on whether intermediaries should be required to
make the results of background checks public, several commenters opposed the requirement, 680
while some supported it. 681 Another commenter stated its view that the results should not be
made public unless a regulator called them into question. 682 Another commenter explained that
issuers should be able to publish the results if they choose, but no such requirement should be

consulted as part of the background check be posted on the [portal’s] website.” 684
As to proposed Rule 301(c)(2) requiring a funding portal to deny access if the intermediary
believes the issuer or offering presents the potential for fraud or otherwise raises concerns
regarding investor protection, one commenter stated that the proposed requirement conflicts with
the restrictions on a funding portal’s ability to limit the offerings on its platform in proposed Rule
402(b)(1). 685
Regarding the standard for denial based on potential fraud or investor protection concerns
in the proposed rule, one commenter suggested a stronger standard, 686 while another suggested a
weaker standard. 687 Other commenters suggested that the standard for an intermediary to deny
access to its platform is unclear. 688 One commenter urged the Commission to require that a
funding portal post on its website a description of its standards for determining which offerings
present a risk of fraud.” 689

size, need for additional capital, pending litigation, or other qualitative factors which increase the risk to an
investor”).

noting that it would not only help prevent fraud but also assist other intermediaries in excluding
issuers already discovered to be disqualified. 690 Other commenters disagreed with this
suggestion, 691 while one commenter stated that reporting should be required only if the
Commission or another agency created a database for such information. 692 One of these
commenters suggested that intermediaries should be required to notify a potential issuer when the
intermediary uses information from a third party to deny the issuer. 693
(3)

Final Rules

After considering the comments, we are adopting Rule 301(c)(1) as proposed. Rule
301(c)(1) requires an intermediary to deny access to its platform if the intermediary has a
reasonable basis for believing that an issuer, or any of its officers, directors (or any person
occupying a similar status or performing a similar function), or any 20 Percent Beneficial Owner
is subject to a disqualification under Rule 503 of Regulation Crowdfunding. We believe that a
“reasonable basis” standard for denying access is an appropriate standard for Rule 301(c)(1), in
part because this requirement on an intermediary is buttressed by the fact that an issuer
independently is subject to the disqualification provisions under Rule 503, as discussed below. 694
In addition, Rule 301(c)(1) implements the requirement of Section 4A(a)(5) that an intermediary
conduct a background and securities enforcement regulatory history check on each issuer whose
securities are to be offered by the intermediary, as well as on each of its officers, directors (or any

person occupying a similar status or performing a similar function) and 20 Percent Beneficial
Owners.
While we understand commenters’ concerns about the cost of the requirement that
intermediaries conduct background checks on issuers and certain affiliated persons, we are not
eliminating or limiting the requirement as suggested by commenters because we believe the
requirement is an important tool for intermediaries to employ when determining whether or not
they have a reasonable basis to allow issuers on their platforms. Even though a number of
commenters requested that the Commission provide specific requirements for background and
securities enforcement regulatory history checks, we are not establishing specific procedures in
the final rules. As we indicated in the Proposing Release, we believe that the better approach is to
allow an intermediary to be guided by its experience and judgment to design systems and
processes to help reduce the risk of fraud in securities-based crowdfunding. 695 We also believe
that such flexibility could mitigate cost concerns related to conducting the background and
securities enforcement regulatory history checks.
We are not developing a database of denied issuers as suggested by some commenters
because we do not believe it would significantly increase investor protection. The requirement to
deny an issuer access to a crowdfunding platform under the final rules based on fraud or other
investor protection concerns is important to the viability of crowdfunding, and the legitimacy of
the intermediary. This obligation is the responsibility of each intermediary, which must make a
determination about whether to deny access to an issuer. While a third party may decide to create
695

We disagree with the commenter that suggested that this method is ineffective because intermediaries lack
experience. See Consumer Federation Letter. Crowdfunding is a new form of capital formation. We believe
broker-dealers and funding portals will gain the relevant experience that will appropriately position them to
develop requirements for conducting background checks required by the rule. In addition, we believe that an
intermediary’s interest in developing a successful platform will motivate it to conduct rigorous background
checks.

179

a database of denied issuers at some point and an intermediary could use such a database to help
make its determination as to whether it was required to deny access to an issuer, such a database
could not be used as a substitute for an intermediary making its own determination.
We also are not requiring an intermediary to make publicly available the results of the
background checks or the sources consulted. We believe that the goal of the background check is
sufficiently served by the exclusion of an issuer from the intermediary’s platform. We do not
believe that making the results or sources publicly available adds a significant degree of investor
protection under these circumstances, given the potential problems that could arise from such
public disclosure of the results, such as the risk of disclosing personally identifiable information
or other information with significant potential for misuse. In addition, we are concerned that such
requirements could add to the cost of administration and could expose the individuals at the issuer
that are subject to a background check to harm, for example, if there were errors in the
information made publicly available.
We are adopting Rule 301(c)(2) substantially as proposed, but with certain revisions. As
adopted, Rule 301(c)(2) now contains a “reasonable basis” standard as opposed to the initially
proposed “believes” standard. Rule 301(c)(2) requires denial of access to its platform when the
intermediary has a reasonable basis for believing that the issuer or offering presents the potential
for fraud or otherwise raises concerns about investor protection. 696 In a conforming change, Rule
301(c)(2) also requires (i) an intermediary deny access to an issuer if it reasonably believes that it
is unable to adequately or effectively assess the risk of fraud of the issuer or its potential offering,
and (ii) if the intermediary becomes aware of information after it has granted the issuer access to

access to an issuer).

180

its platform that causes it to reasonably believe that the issuer or the offering presents the potential
for fraud or otherwise raises concerns regarding investor protection, the intermediary must
promptly remove the offering from its platform, cancel the offering and return to investors any
funds they may have committed.
We believe that a “reasonable basis” standard is appropriate for Rule 301(c)(2) because it
is a more objective standard. 697 Under this standard, an intermediary may not ignore facts about
an issuer that indicate fraud or investor protection concerns such that a reasonable person would
have denied access to the platform or cancelled the offering. Rule 301(c)(2) is intended to give an
intermediary an objective standard regarding the circumstances in which it must act to protect its
investors from potentially fraudulent issuers or ones that otherwise present red flags concerning
investor protection. This objective standard also will make it easier for an intermediary to assess
whether it would be compliant with Rule 301(c)(2) when deciding if it should deny an issuer
access or cancel its offering. 698 Thus, we believe these measures likely will promote compliance
and help to reduce the risk of fraud with respect to crowdfunding transactions, as required by
Section 4A(a)(5). This standard also will provide the Commission with a clear basis to review
whether an intermediary’s decision not to deny access to its platform or cancel an offering was
reasonable given the facts and circumstances.

697

Adding the reasonable basis standard to Rule 301(c)(2) also provides a consistent standard across Rule 301,
including Rules 301(a), (b) and (c)(1).

698

Aside from the requirement to deny access to issuers under Rule 302(c)(2), it is important to note that
intermediaries are permitted to determine whether and under what terms to allow an issuer to offer and sell
securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) through their platforms.
See Rule 402(b)(1) and Section II.D.3. The objective standard under Rule 301(c)(2) also helps to clarify that
a funding portal would not be providing investment advice or recommendations, if it denies access to or
cancels an offering because it has a reasonable basis for believing that there is a potential for fraud or other
investor protection concerns. See Rule 402(b)(10) of Regulation Crowdfunding and Section II.D.3.i.

181

We are not requiring that an intermediary report the issuers that have been denied access to
its platforms, as some commenters suggested, or that the intermediary post a summary of the
sources consulted as part of the background check on its platform along with a description of the
intermediary’s standards for determining which offerings present a risk of fraud. We also are not
adopting a requirement, as suggested by a commenter, that an intermediary notify a potential
issuer when the intermediary utilizes third-party information to deny access to the issuer. As with
background checks, discussed above, we believe that the investor protection goal is sufficiently
served by the exclusion of an issuer from the intermediary’s platform. In addition, we are
concerned that such requirements could add to the cost of administration and could expose the
issuers in question to harm, for example, if there were errors in the information made publicly
available. Likewise, we do not believe that requiring an intermediary to post to its website a
summary of the sources consulted as part of the background check and a description of the
intermediary’s standards for determining which offerings present a risk of fraud would sufficiently
increase investor protection to justify the burdens, such as those outlined above, that would be
associated with imposing such requirements. We also note that providing this information on an
intermediary’s website may give potentially fraudulent issuers or those that otherwise present
investor protection concerns a roadmap to an intermediary’s proprietary procedures for screening
for fraud that could assist such issuers with impeding or obstructing intermediaries from detecting
offerings that present a risk of fraud.

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 302(a)(1) of Regulation Crowdfunding would prohibit an intermediary or
its associated persons from accepting an investment commitment in a transaction involving the
182

offer or sale of securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) unless the investor has opened an account
with the intermediary, and the intermediary has obtained from the investor consent to electronic
delivery of materials. Proposed Rule 302(a)(2) would require an intermediary to provide all
information required by Subpart C of Regulation Crowdfunding, including, but not limited to,
educational materials, notices and confirmations, through electronic means.
Proposed Rule 302(a)(2) also would require an intermediary to provide such information
through an electronic message that either contains the information, includes a specific link to the
information as posted on the intermediary’s platform, or provides notice of what the information
is and that it is located on the intermediary’s platform or the issuer’s website. As proposed, Rule
302(a)(2) stated that electronic messages would include, but not be limited to, messages sent via
e-mail.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

One commenter suggested that intermediaries who are brokers should not be required to
open new accounts for persons who are existing customers of the broker. 699 In response to our
request for comments on whether an intermediary should be required to obtain specific
information from investors, and if so what type of information should be required, some
commenters generally supported requiring an intermediary to gather specific information from
investors, particularly identifying information that could help prevent duplicate or fraudulent
accounts and information about other intermediary accounts and investments. 700 A few of these
commenters supported the Commission requiring intermediaries to collect investors’ social

security numbers. 701 One commenter opposed the Commission requiring intermediaries to obtain
particular information from investors. 702
With respect to electronic delivery, some commenters urged that it should be sufficient for
the intermediary simply to make Subpart C materials, such as educational materials, notices and
confirmations, available on the intermediary’s platform for investors to access. 703 Other
commenters broadly opposed permitting intermediaries to satisfy their information delivery
requirement by providing an electronic message that informs an investor that information can be
found on the intermediary’s platform or an issuer’s website. 704 One commenter suggested that
investors may not actually receive required disclosures because they will not spend the time to
find the information. 705 Another commenter suggested that the Commission should “continue to
rely instead on the strong and effective policy for electronic delivery of disclosure adopted by the
Commission in the mid-1990s.” 706 The same commenter noted that it would be “a simple matter
to require that any electronic message through which disclosures are delivered include, at a
minimum, the specific URL where the required disclosures can be found.” 707
One commenter stated it was concerned that earlier Commission policies on electronic
delivery might be read as implying that paper delivery might be permitted in certain

circumstances. 708 This commenter did agree, however, that any electronic message through which
disclosures are delivered include, at a minimum, the specific URL where the required disclosures
can be found. 709
In response to our request for comments on whether exceptions to the consent to electronic
delivery should be allowed, one commenter stated that account creation and delivery of
communication should be completed digitally and that there should be no exemption to allow
paper delivery as a substitute. 710 Another commenter stated that investors should be allowed to
waive these delivery requirements entirely. 711
(3)

Final Rules

After considering the comments, we are adopting as proposed the account opening and
electronic delivery requirements in Rule 302(a). We are not prescribing particular requirements
for account opening. Rather, we believe that the final rule provides flexibility to intermediaries
given that intermediaries are better positioned than the Commission to determine what
information and processes it will require, both as a business decision and to ensure compliance
with all applicable regulatory requirements. Therefore, for example, an intermediary can decide
whether or not to open a new account for an existing customer. We also are not prescribing under
the final rule, as a commenter suggested, that an intermediary be required to collect identifying
information that could help prevent duplicative or fraudulent accounts. We believe that even
without prescribing particular account opening requirements intermediaries should be able to

708

See CFIRA Letter 12.

709

Id.

710

See RocketHub Letter.

711

See Public Startup Letter 3.

185

identify, by collecting basic account opening information, those accounts that appear to be
duplicative or present red flags of potential fraud.
However, the final rules do not permit investors to waive the electronic delivery
requirements entirely, as one commenter suggested. 712 We believe that electronic delivery of
materials in connection with crowdfunding offerings serves an important and basic investor
protection function by conveying information, such as offering materials, that will help investors
to make better informed investment decisions and by a method that is appropriately suited to the
electronic and Internet-based nature of crowdfunding transactions.
As explained in Section II.A.3, Rule 100(a)(3) of Regulation Crowdfunding requires that
crowdfunding transactions be conducted exclusively through an intermediary’s platform. Rule
302(a) implements this requirement by requiring that investors consent to electronic delivery of
materials in connection with crowdfunding offerings. 713 This requirement applies to all investors,
including an existing customer of a registered broker that has not already consented to electronic
delivery of materials. Therefore, this requirement will prohibit intermediaries from accepting an
investment commitment in a Section 4(a)(6) offering from any investor that has not consented to
electronic delivery.
We are adopting substantially as proposed Rule 302(a)(2), which requires that all
information required to be provided by an intermediary under Subpart C be provided through
electronic means. We have considered the comments but do not believe that it would be sufficient
– or consistent with our previous statements about electronic media – for the intermediary simply

712

Id.

713

Certain requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding that require timely actions by issuers and investors will be
facilitated by requiring consent to electronic delivery of documents. See, e.g., Section II.C.6 (discussing the
five-day periods for investor reconfirmations based on material changes and issuer cancellation notices).

186

to make Subpart C materials, such as educational materials, notices and confirmations, available
on the intermediary’s platform for investors to access. 714 Rather, unless otherwise indicated in the
relevant rules of Subpart C, 715 the intermediary must provide the information either through (1)
an electronic message that contains the information, (2) an electronic message that includes a
specific link to the information as posted on the intermediary’s platform, or (3) an electronic
message that provides notice of what the information is and notifies investors that this information
is located on the intermediary’s platform or on the issuer’s website. 716 We have added to the rule
text other examples of electronic messages that are permissible in addition to e-mail messages –
specifically text, instant messages, and messages sent using social media.
b.

Educational Materials
(1)

Proposed Rules

Securities Act Section 4A(a)(3) states that an intermediary must “provide such disclosures,
including disclosures related to risks and other investor education materials, as the Commission
shall, by rule, determine appropriate,” but it does not elaborate on the scope of this requirement.
As described in further detail below, proposed Rule 302(b)(1) of Regulation Crowdfunding would
require intermediaries to deliver to investors, at account opening, educational materials that are in
714

See Use of Electronic Media, Release No. 34-42728 (Apr. 28, 2000) [65 FR 25843, 25853 (May 4, 2000)]
(discussing the “access equals delivery” concept and citing Use of Electronic Media for Delivery Purposes,
Release No. 34-36345 (Oct. 6, 1995) [60 FR 53548, 53454 (Oct. 13, 1995)]).

715

For example, Rule 303(a) separately requires that an intermediary must make issuer information publicly
available on its platform, and so we do not believe that it is necessary to further require intermediaries to
send an electronic message regarding the posting of issuer materials.

716

As noted above, this electronic message could include a specific link to the information as posted on the
intermediary’s platform. However, we are not requiring intermediaries to provide a link to direct investors to
the intermediary’s platform or the issuer’s website where the information is located. We believe that the
final rule provides some flexibility to intermediaries when providing required information through electronic
messages given that intermediaries are well-positioned to determine how best to ensure compliance with all
applicable regulatory requirements. We also believe that, because of the widespread use of the Internet, as
well as advances in technology that allow funding portals to send various electronic messages, our final rule
requires sufficient notice to investors.

187

plain language and otherwise designed to communicate effectively and accurately certain
specified information. Proposed Rules 302(b)(1)(i)-(viii) would require the materials to include:
•

the process for the offer, purchase and issuance of securities through the intermediary;

•

the risks associated with investing in securities offered and sold in reliance on Section
4(a)(6);

•

the types of securities that may be offered on the intermediary’s platform and the risks
associated with each type of security, including the risk of having limited voting power
as a result of dilution;

•

the restrictions on the resale of securities offered and sold in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6);

•

the types of information that an issuer is required to provide in annual reports, the
frequency of the delivery of that information, and the possibility that the issuer’s
obligation to file annual reports may terminate in the future;

•

the limits on the amounts investors may invest, as set forth in Section 4(a)(6)(B);

•

the circumstances in which the issuer may cancel an investment commitment;

•

the limitations on an investor’s right to cancel an investment commitment;

•

the need for the investor to consider whether investing in a security offered and sold in
reliance on Section 4(a)(6) is appropriate for him or her; and

•

that following completion of an offering, there may or may not be any ongoing
relationship between the issuer and intermediary.

Proposed Rule 302(b)(2) would further require intermediaries to make the current version of the
educational materials available on their platforms, and to make revised materials available to all

188

investors before accepting any additional investment commitments or effecting any further
transactions in securities offered and sold in reliance on Section 4(a)(6).
(2)

Comments on Proposed Rules

Commenters generally supported distribution of educational materials through
intermediaries. 717 Some stated that intermediaries should be required to submit educational
materials to the Commission or to FINRA because oversight and review is needed for materials
that will be used by unsophisticated investors, 718 while others stated that intermediaries should
not be required to submit educational materials to the Commission or to FINRA because it would
be cumbersome and expensive. 719 One commenter stated that the proposed requirements should
be modified to state that education must be done prior to an investor’s first investment in a Section
4(a)(6) offering, not at account opening. 720
Some commenters suggested that additions be made to the scope of information proposed
to be required in an intermediary’s educational materials, 721 to include information about exit
strategies; 722 principles of investing in crowdfunding and how to evaluate investment

See Arctic Island Letter 6. The commenter also stated that the educational material requirements should only
apply to unaccredited investors, but we note that the requirement under Section 4A(a)(4) runs to “each
investor.” As discussed above, we believe that Congress intended for crowdfunding transactions under
Section 4(a)(6) to be available equally to all types of investors. Consistent with that approach, we do not
believe at this time it would be appropriate to tailor the educational requirements for any particular type of
investor or to create an exemption for accredited investors. Further, issuers can rely on other exemptions to
offer and sell securities to accredited investors or institutional investors.

opportunities in privately held companies; 723 the risks associated with crowdfunding
investments; 724 and reasons for investors to maintain their own personal records concerning
crowdfunding investments. 725 One commenter suggested that educational materials “should
include an industry standard disclosure document on the benefits and risks of crowdfunding
investments.” 726 This commenter indicated that “having these generic risk factors in the industry
standard educational materials will help focus the company specific disclosure on the factors that
are most important.” 727
Some commenters suggested that intermediaries should be required to design
questionnaires to increase investor knowledge and to monitor whether investors actually access
materials. 728 One commenter suggested that in addition to an “interactive questionnaire,” the
Commission should also “require that investors reaffirm each time they invest that they
understand the risks associated with crowdfunding, can afford to lose their entire investment, and
do not expect to need the funds being invested in the near term.” 729
Some commenters stated that we should develop model educational materials for investors
or specify the content for intermediaries. 730 One commenter suggested that the Commission, state

securities regulators, and FINRA, together, should develop “a sample guide” designed to alert
investors to the risks of crowdfunding including, among other things, “the high failure rate of
small startup companies, the fact that shares will not be set based on market data and may
therefore be mispriced, the lack of liquidity, and the risk that, absent appropriate protections, the
value of their shares could be diluted.” 731 This commenter also suggested that the guide “should
include explicit warnings that investors should not invest in crowdfunding unless they can afford
to lose the entire amount of their investment or if they expect to have an immediate need for the
funds.” 732 This commenter also stated that regulators should test the materials with investors to
ensure their effectiveness. 733
One commenter stated that we should not limit or specify the type of electronic media
being used to communicate educational material. 734 Finally, one commenter opposed all the
educational requirements for intermediaries, and suggested instead that the Commission itself,
rather than intermediaries, should provide investor educational materials to both investors and
issuers with funding portals linking to, for example, the SEC webpage or an open source website
containing any Commission drafted educational materials. 735

Final Rules

After considering the comments, we are adopting Rule 302(b) relating to educational
materials substantially as proposed, but adding one further requirement as to the content of the

suggestion that the Commission “could establish a set of standard educational requirements for the industry

materials. We believe that, consistent with Section 4A(a)(3) it is appropriate that intermediaries,
rather than the Commission (as a commenter suggested), be required to provide such disclosures,
including disclosures related to risks and other investor education materials as the Commission
determines to be appropriate. We believe that intermediaries are better equipped and positioned,
as compared to the Commission, to provide educational materials to investors that are reasonably
tailored to an intermediary’s offerings and investors, particularly in light of their access to and
interactions with investors.
We further believe that the scope of information that we are requiring to be included in an
intermediary’s educational materials is appropriate. In the Proposing Release we discussed our
rationales for requiring the different types of disclosures in the educational materials. As we
noted in the Proposing Release, we generally drew upon the statutory provisions when including
disclosures required in the educational materials relating to the risks of investing in securities
offered and sold in reliance on Section 4(a)(6), investors’ cancellation rights, resale restrictions
and issuer reporting. 736 The circumstances in which an investor can cancel an investment
commitment and obtain a return of his or her funds are particularly important to an investor’s
understanding of the investment process and may affect an investor’s decision to consider any
offerings made pursuant to Section 4(a)(6). The items required to be included, pursuant to Rule
302(b)(1)(i) through (viii), in the educational materials are basic terms, relevant to transactions
conducted in reliance on Section 4(a)(6), of which all investors should be aware before making an
investment commitment. Furthermore, information on the various types of securities that can be
available for purchase on the intermediary’s platform, any applicable resale restrictions, and the
risks associated with each type of security, including the risk of having limited voting power as a
736

See Securities Act Sections 4A(a)(4), 4A(a)(7), 4A(e), and 4A(b)(4).

192

result of dilution can affect an investor’s decision to consider any offerings made pursuant to
Section 4(a)(6). In addition, we are adding Rule 302(b)(1)(ix) to require the educational materials
to indicate that under certain circumstances an issuer may cease to publish annual reports and,
therefore, an investor may not continually have current financial information about the issuer. We
are adding this requirement because we believe that it is important for investors to be able to
consider the ongoing availability of information about an issuer’s financial condition when they
assess whether to invest in that issuer.
The final rule provides each intermediary with sufficient flexibility to determine: (1) the
content of the educational materials, outside of the minimum specified information required to be
included under Rule 302(b)(1)(i)-(viii), and (2) the overall format and manner of presentation of
the materials. We believe this flexibility will allow the intermediary to prepare and present
educational materials in a manner reasonably tailored to the types of offerings on the
intermediary’s platform and the types of investors accessing its platform. While we have
determined not to provide model educational materials, impose additional content (beyond those
proposed) or format requirements, mandate particular language or manner of presentation, or
require that an intermediary design an investor questionnaire, as suggested by commenters, the
final rules do not prohibit an intermediary from providing additional educational materials if they
choose. For example, because the final rules do not require an intermediary to design a
questionnaire, intermediaries maintain the flexibility in meeting the rule’s requirements to
determine whether such a disclosure format would be cost effective and appropriate particularly in
light of that intermediary’s particular business model. We further note the suggestion by some
commenters that we require additional information in the educational materials, including, for
example, requiring an intermediary to discuss exit strategies, how to evaluate investment
193

opportunities in privately held companies, and the reasons for investors to maintain their own
personal records concerning crowdfunding investments. Although these suggestions may provide
investors with some useful information, we are not persuaded that imposing such additional
requirements in the final rule is necessary at this time as it is unclear that those suggestions would
significantly strengthen the investor protections that will result from Rule 302(b) as adopted. We
also believe that adding such requirements may overly complicate these educational materials and
increase the costs associated with preparing them. Therefore, we have determined to allow
intermediaries the flexibility to prepare educational materials reasonably tailored to their offerings
and investors, provided the materials meet the standards and include the information required to
be provided under Rule 302(b). 737
We also recognize that FINRA or any other registered national securities association may
implement additional educational materials requirements. We are not, however, as one
commenter suggested, 738 requiring at this time that intermediaries submit their educational
materials to the Commission or to a registered national securities association for review and
approval. We note, however, that a registered national securities association could propose such a
requirement as its oversight of intermediaries in this new market evolves. Any such proposed
requirement would be considered by the Commission, and subject to public notice and opportunity
for comment, pursuant to Exchange Act Section 19(b) and Rule 19b-4.
Rule 302(b)(2) requires an intermediary to keep its educational materials accurate.
Accordingly, an intermediary must update the materials as needed to keep them current. In

737

We note that educational materials may be subject to examination and inspection. See Section II.D.5.
(describing the recordkeeping obligations of funding portals).

738

See RocketHub Letter (stating that “if educational materials are submitted to the Commission for approval,
such approval should act to limit liability of the Portal under the Act”).

194

addition, if an intermediary makes a material revision to its educational materials, the rule requires
that the intermediary make the revised educational materials available to all investors before
accepting any additional investment commitments or effecting any further crowdfunding
transactions. An intermediary will also be required to obtain a representation that an investor has
reviewed the intermediary’s most recent educational materials before accepting an investment
commitment from the investor. 739
We believe that these requirements will benefit investors by helping to ensure that they
receive information about key aspects of investing through the intermediary’s platform, including
aspects that may have changed since the last time they received the materials, prior to making
investment commitments, as that information can influence their investment decisions. We also
believe that requiring intermediaries to update materials on an ongoing basis, rather than at certain
specified intervals, will help to ensure that those materials are updated as circumstances warrant,
which, in turn, will provide investors with more current information and increase investor
protection.
c.

Promoters
(1)

Proposed Rule

Securities Act Section 4A(b)(3) provides that an issuer shall “not compensate or commit to
compensate, directly or indirectly, any person to promote its offerings through communication
channels provided by a broker or funding portal, without taking such steps as the Commission
shall, by rule, require to ensure that such person clearly discloses the receipt, past or prospective,
of such compensation, upon each instance of such promotional communication.” Under Rule 205
of Regulation Crowdfunding, as discussed above, an issuer can compensate persons to promote its
739

See Rule 303(b)(2)(i) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

195

offerings through communications channels provided by the intermediary on its platform, where
certain conditions are met. 740
We separately proposed in Rule 302(c) of Regulation Crowdfunding to require the
intermediary to inform investors, at the account opening stage, that any person who promotes an
issuer’s offering for compensation, whether past or prospective, or who is a founder or an
employee of an issuer that engages in promotional activities on behalf of the issuer on the
intermediary’s platform, must clearly disclose in all communications on the platform the receipt of
the compensation and the fact that he or she is engaging in promotional activities on behalf of the
issuer.
(2)

Comments on Proposed Rules

Some commenters suggested that the promoter disclosures should not be made at account
opening where they may be ignored. 741 One commenter proposed that the disclosures should be
made “prior to any participant on the platform being able to post comments, reviews, ratings, or
other promotional activities.” 742
(3)

Final Rules

We are adopting, as proposed, Rule 302(c) requiring intermediaries to inform investors, at
the time of account opening, that promoters must clearly disclose in all communications on the
platform the receipt of the compensation and the fact that he or she is engaging in promotional
activities on behalf of the issuer. As noted in the Proposing Release, in addition to the
information required under Rule 302(c), promoters will also be required to comply with Section
17(b) of the Securities Act, which requires promoters to fully disclose to investors the receipt,
740

See Rule 205 of Regulation Crowdfunding and the discussion in Section II.B.5.

741

See, e.g., Arctic Island Letter 6; Wefunder Letter.

742

See Arctic Island Letter 6.

196

whether past or prospective, of consideration and the amount of that compensation. 743 We believe
that the disclosures required by Rule 302(c) will help alert investors at the outset, rather than after
the account is opened, of the fact that information about the promotional activities of issuers or
representatives of issuers will be disclosed at a later time on the platform, pursuant to Rule
303(c)(4). We believe that the account opening is the appropriate time for this disclosure because
it gives investors notice of potential promotional activities by issuers and their representatives
prior to making investment commitments. As discussed below, Rule 303(c)(4) separately
mandates that intermediaries require any person, when posting a comment in the communication
channels, to clearly disclose with each posting whether he or she is a founder or an employee of
an issuer engaging in promotional activities on behalf of the issuer, or receives compensation,
whether in the past or prospectively, to promote an issuer’s offering. We believe that the
disclosure requirements of Rule 302(c), when coupled with the additional disclosure requirements
in Rule 303(c)(4), will promote a transparent information sharing process whereby investors are
able to discern the sources of information that they are receiving and any potential conflicts of
interest by those sources.
d.

Compensation Disclosure
(1)

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 302(d) of Regulation Crowdfunding would require that intermediaries,
when establishing an account for an investor, clearly disclose the manner in which they will be
compensated in connection with offerings and sales of securities made in reliance on Section
4(a)(6). This requirement would help to ensure investors are aware of any potential conflicts of
interest that may arise from the manner in which the intermediary is compensated. Rule 201(o) of
743

See Proposing Release at 78 FR 66467-68. See also Section 17(b) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77q(b)).

197

Regulation Crowdfunding, which is discussed in Section II.B.1, separately requires an issuer to
disclose in its offering materials, among other things, the amount of compensation paid to the
intermediary for conducting a particular offering, including the amount of referral and any other
fees associated with the offering.
(2)

Comments on Proposed Rule

Several commenters supported the disclosure of intermediary compensation. 744 One
commenter stated that the account opening is not an appropriate time to mention compensation,
asserting that the account opening stage should be dedicated to discussing the risk of startup
investing. 745 One commenter suggested that the best way for an intermediary to disclose
compensation is through a “Costs and Fees” page on its website. 746 Another commenter requested
that the Commission define compensation as any fees or compensation collected by the
intermediary in connection with a Section 4(a)(6) transaction, subject to Commission and FINRA
rules. 747
(3)

Final Rules

We are adopting Rule 302(d) as proposed. We believe that requiring intermediaries to
provide information to investors about the manner in which they will be compensated at account
opening, rather than at a subsequent time, will provide investors with notice of how the
intermediary is being compensated at a threshold stage in the relationship (i.e., account opening),
which, in turn, will help investors make better-informed decisions. We note that the final rules –
unlike the proposed rules – allow intermediaries to receive a financial interest in the issuer as
744

See, e.g., Arctic Island Letter 6; ASSOB Letter; CFA Institute Letter; Commonwealth of Massachusetts
Letter; Joinvestor Letter; StartupValley Letter; Wefunder Letter.

745

See Wefunder Letter.

746

747

See CFIRA Letter 4.

198

compensation, subject to certain limitations. 748 Therefore, an intermediary that receives or may
receive a financial interest in an issuer in the future as compensation for its services is required to
disclose that compensation at account opening. We also note that Rule 201(o), which is discussed
in Section II.B.1 and separately requires an issuer to disclose in its offering materials a description
of the intermediary’s interests in the issuer’s transaction, including the amount of compensation
paid or to be paid to the intermediary for conducting a particular offering, the amount of referral
and any other fees associated with the offering. We are not defining compensation as one
commenter suggested, as we believe the final rule’s requirement to clearly disclose the manner in
which an intermediary will be compensated in connection with offerings and sales of securities
made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) is sufficiently clear, and because we are also concerned that a
definition of compensation could be both under- and over-inclusive in a new and evolving
crowdfunding market.

Requirements with Respect to Transactions
a.

Issuer Information
(1)

Proposed Rule

Securities Act Section 4A(a)(6) requires each intermediary to make available to the
Commission and investors, not later than 21 days prior to the first day on which securities are sold
to any investor (or such other period as the Commission may establish), any information provided
by the issuer pursuant to Section 4A(b). 749 Accordingly, we proposed Rule 303(a) of Regulation
Crowdfunding to implement this provision by requiring each intermediary in a transaction
involving the offer or sale of securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) to make available to the
748

See Section II.C.2.b.

749

As discussed in Section II.B, Securities Act Section 4A(b) establishes the requirements for an issuer that
offers or sells securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6).

199

Commission and to investors any information required to be provided by the issuer under Rules
201 and 203(a) of proposed Regulation Crowdfunding. As proposed, Rule 303(a) would require
that this information: (1) be publicly available on the intermediary’s platform, in a manner that
reasonably permits a person accessing the platform to save, download or otherwise store the
information; (2) be made publicly available on the intermediary’s platform for a minimum of 21
days before any securities are sold in the offering, during which time the intermediary may accept
investment commitments; and (3) remain publicly available on the intermediary’s platform until
the offer and sale of securities is completed or cancelled (including any additional information
provided by the issuer). In addition, under Proposed Rule 303(a)(4), an intermediary would be
prohibited from requiring any person to establish an account with the intermediary in order to
access this information.
(2)

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Several commenters suggested that so long as issuer information is made available on the
intermediary’s platform, the rules should not mandate the delivery of this information, in addition
to or in lieu of, making the information available on the intermediary’s platform. 750
One commenter stated that having information about a deal publicly available on the
intermediary’s website will increase the potential for fraud—specifically, potential fraud
involving “data scraping” from websites (i.e., copying data from these websites in order to use

risk disclosures should be sent to the investor via email, and that “[e]verything else can be referenced by the
investor online at any time”); ASSOB Letter; CrowdCheck Letter (suggesting that the Commission remove
the requirement in the proposed rules that would effectively limit the presentation of information to only
formats that can be saved and downloaded by prospective investors); RocketHub Letter; Wefunder Letter;
Vann Letter (stating that no particular means of delivery to investors should be required because
“technologies may change” and intermediaries should be allowed to use whatever means “appropriate”).

that data for fraudulent purposes). 751 This same commenter suggested that that there should be
two levels of disclosure: the first, would be available to all and would contain certain general
information about the issuer and the terms of deal, and the second would be made available only
after investors proceed through a membership registration process and would contain disclosure
documents, financial information, legal disclosures and further information. 752
As to the amount of time that an intermediary should display issuer materials prior to the
first day on which securities are sold to any investor, some commenters supported the 21-day time
frame as a sufficient minimum period that offering information should be made available through
the intermediary’s platform. 753
Although one commenter objected to intermediaries displaying any issuer materials, 754
several commenters supported requiring intermediaries to continue to display issuer materials for
some period of time after completion of the offering. 755 One commenter, however, stated that
intermediaries should not be required to display issuer materials for closed offerings. 756 Another

see fit”).

commenter stated that “[o]nce an offering is complete, an issuer should have the right to limit
publicly available information.” 757
We also requested comments as to whether an intermediary should make efforts to ensure
that an investor has actually reviewed the relevant issuer information. A few commenters
expressed concern with requiring intermediaries to ensure that an investor has reviewed the
relevant issuer information. 758 Another commenter suggested that an investor “should
demonstrate, through a representation of acknowledgment, that they have reviewed all relevant
issuer information.” 759

Final Rules

After considering the comments, we are adopting, as proposed, Rule 303(a). As stated in
the Proposing Release, we believe that the requirement in Rule 303(a) that the information must
be made publicly available on the intermediary’s website satisfies the requirement under Section
4A(d) for the Commission to “make [available to the states], or . . . cause to be made [available]
by the relevant broker or funding portal, the information” issuers are required to provide under
Section 4A(b) and the rules thereunder. Moreover, this approach should help investors, the
Commission, FINRA (and any other applicable registered national securities association) and
other interested parties, such as state regulators, to access information without impediment.
Therefore, we believe that this rule is not only consistent with the statute but that it also enhances
investor protection by having issuer information about a crowdfunding security publicly available
on the intermediary’s website. While we considered the concern expressed by one commenter

757

See RocketHub Letter.

758

See, e.g., Arctic Island Letter 6 (stating that such a requirement “could make things incredibly messy and
expensive”); Wefunder Letter.

759

RocketHub Letter.

202

that having such information available on the intermediary’s website would increase the potential
for “data scraping,” 760 we believe the expected benefits of the requirement to investors and other
interested persons, as discussed above, justifies the risk of potential harm from such potential
activities.
We note that commenters who addressed the issue generally supported a 21-day time
frame as the minimum period that offering information should be made available through the
intermediary’s platform prior to the first day on which securities are sold to any investor. Under
the final rules, the information must remain available on the platform until the offering is
completed or canceled. While some commenters suggested that the rule should require
intermediaries to continue to display issuer materials for some period of time after completion of
the offering, we are not prescribing such a requirement nor are we prohibiting intermediaries from
doing so if they so choose. Although we appreciate that historical issuer information may provide
helpful background for investors generally, we are concerned that imposing such a requirement
could potentially result in persons relying on potentially stale issuer information particularly given
the nature of the crowdfunding market (i.e., we assume that each issuer generally will conduct
only one offering per year). 761 We note that intermediaries nonetheless are required to retain the
information in accordance with their obligation to make and preserve for a period of time records
with respect to any written materials that are used as part of an intermediary’s business, including
issuer materials made available on their platforms. 762
760

See StartupValley Letter.

761

As discussed in Section IV.B.1, we assume, for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, that each issuer
will conduct one offering per year.

762

Registered brokers would have to maintain records pursuant to Exchange Act Section 17 and the rules
thereunder. See e.g., 15 U.S.C. 78q and 17 CFR 240.17a-3 and 17a-4. Funding portals would be subject to
the recordkeeping requirements of proposed Rule 404 of Regulation Crowdfunding. See Section II.D.5
(discussing the recordkeeping requirements we are adopting for funding portals).

203

While the intermediary plays an important gatekeeper function, the investor has
responsibility for his or her actions as well. To that end, we are not requiring that an intermediary
ensure that an investor has actually reviewed the relevant issuer information. We believe that the
requirements of Rule 303(a) provide an investor with the relevant issuer information and an
adequate period of time in which to evaluate the investment opportunity before investing. We are
not at this time imposing additional requirements on the intermediary in this regard.
b.

Investor Qualification
(1)

Compliance with Investment Limits
(a)

Proposed Rule

Securities Act Section 4(a)(6)(B) limits the aggregate amount of securities that can be sold
by an issuer to an investor in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) during a 12-month period. Securities Act
Section 4A(a)(8) requires that intermediaries “make such efforts as the Commission determines
appropriate, by rule” to ensure that no investor has made purchases in the aggregate, from all
issuers, that exceed the limits in Section 4(a)(6).
Proposed Rule 303(b)(1) of Regulation Crowdfunding would implement this latter
provision by requiring that, each time before accepting an investment commitment on its platform
(including any additional investment commitment from the same person), an intermediary must
have a reasonable basis for believing that the investor satisfies the investment limits established by
Section 4(a)(6)(B). The proposed rule would allow an intermediary to rely on an investor’s
representations concerning annual income, net worth and the amount of the investor’s other
investments in securities sold in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) through other intermediaries unless
the intermediary has a reasonable basis to question the reliability of the representation.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

A number of commenters supported the proposed requirements for enforcing investment
limits and intermediary responsibility for investor compliance, 763 while a few commenters
opposed the requirements. 764 Several commenters suggested ways to strengthen the
requirements, such as by: requiring that an intermediary conduct more stringent checks, 765 having
the Commission maintain a registry of those who have purchased crowdfunding securities, 766
requiring that investors electronically upload financial documents for verification of income or net
worth, 767 requiring notices detailing investment limits and highlighting their importance, 768 and
precluding an investor who violates the investment limits from bringing a cause of action against
an issuer. 769 Some commenters suggested that the Commission require intermediaries to create a
tool for investors to use, such as a questionnaire, to assemble the underlying data on which
investment limits are calculated and to perform those calculations electronically. 770 However,

“verified and stringent determinations as to the income and net worth qualifications of any potential
investors.”).

tool, such as an electronic work sheet, would assist investors in identifying categories of assets and liabilities
such as bank accounts, investment accounts, and house value, for purposes of the net worth calculation, and
prompt them to deduct outstanding liabilities and exclude the value of principle residence). See also
BetterInvesting Letter.

another commenter disagreed with this suggestion. 771 One commenter suggested intermediaries’
platforms be required to provide to investors prior to accepting an investment commitment a
detailed statement of the investment limits that are applicable to investors that also includes a
penalty of perjury certification by the investor. 772 A few commenters emphasized a need to warn
investors that the value of their primary residence should be excluded for purposes of the net
worth calculation. 773 Commenters also suggested that the Commission adopt an approach similar
to that under the capital gains tax rules that would limit benefits and loss recovery for investors
who invest outside of their limits.774
Several commenters opposed the proposal to allow an intermediary to rely on the
representations of an investor. 775 Some urged the Commission to provide for verification through
either a third-party service or through the intermediaries themselves in lieu of reliance on investor
representations. 776 Other commenters suggested that intermediaries should be required to take
certain affirmative steps to verify investor representations. 777 One commenter stated that the

strongest possible approach to a verification requirement should be imposed for investments
beyond $2,000. 778 Another commenter suggested that the Commission create penalties for
intermediaries who fail to meet their duties regarding investment limits. 779 One commenter
suggested the Commission should require crowdfunding portals to collect enough data from
investors to avoid the most likely errors in calculating the investment limit and to prevent evasion
of those limits. This commenter also suggested that the Commission should require portals to
collect social security numbers to help prevent individuals from evading limits by opening
multiple accounts under false names. 780
Other commenters supported the proposal to allow an intermediary to rely on the
representations of an investor. 781 Some of these commenters warned against costly compliance
requirements such as, for example, requiring verification of investment limits by both the issuer
and the intermediary, 782 or burdening a broker-dealer with a vetting requirement for someone who
may only want to invest a small amount, such as $25. 783
Several commenters supported requiring an intermediary to confirm investment limits
compliance using a centralized database, should one become established. 784 A number of these
778

See Merkley Letter (suggesting that the Commission could reconsider possible options to relax any strict
initial approach after the first few years of the final rules being in effect, and stating that “it would be

207

commenters suggested the database be created and managed by the Commission with mandatory
intermediary participation 785 to allow intermediaries to check an investor’s total year to date
purchases across all platforms. 786 One commenter stated that the statute “contemplates” the
development of a central data repository and suggested that it could be established at the relevant
national securities association. 787 Another commenter suggested, in connection with its support
for the use of a centralized database, imposing a three-to-five year time limit, after which
intermediaries would no longer be permitted to rely on investor representations about their
investments on other platforms. 788 One commenter suggested the Commission incentivize the
private creation of a centralized database. 789 Another opposed the Commission imposing any
obligation on intermediaries until after such a centralized database is established. 790 Another
commenter, supporting the creation of a single, centralized database, warned that “competing
databases” would be incomplete. 791
Others commenters expressed concern that the proposed rule included no mechanism to
prevent investors from registering with multiple platforms and investing far in excess of the

request information about any other intermediary accounts prior to accepting an investment
commitment. 793 One of these commenters suggested requiring intermediaries to add a text box to
their site that requires the investor to input the total dollar amount invested on other platforms. 794
The other commenter stated that an intermediary should only be required to request additional
information if there are doubts about the investor’s self-certification. 795
(c)

Final Rules

After considering the comments, we are adopting Rule 303(b)(1) as proposed. As a
threshold matter, we note that a number of commenters supported the proposed approach for
establishing compliance with investment limits. Although we appreciate some of the additional
suggestions provided by commenters, as outlined above, we believe the approach in Rule
303(b)(1) for establishing compliance with investment limits is an appropriate means of
implementing the provisions of Section 4A(a)(8), which is designed to help ensure that an investor
has not made purchases, in the aggregate from all issuers, that exceed those limits during a 12month period. We note, however, that intermediaries can, in their discretion, take additional
measures for evaluating investors’ compliance with investment limits, including those suggested
by commenters, such as: using a centralized data repository, to the extent that one is created;
requiring verification of income or net worth electronically by uploading financial documents; or
creating a tool for investors to use, such as a questionnaire, to assemble the underlying data.

792

See, e.g., Finkelstein Letter; Vann Letter (stating that intermediaries should be required to “make it clear that
the aggregate limits apply across all such platforms, not just their own”).

795

See ASSOB Letter.

209

While several commenters opposed permitting an intermediary to rely on the
representations of an investor about investment limits and some suggested requiring
intermediaries to take certain affirmative steps to verify compliance, we believe that it would be
difficult for intermediaries to monitor or independently verify whether each investor remains
within his or her investment limits where the investor may be participating in offerings on
multiple platforms. We note, however, that reliance on investor representations must be
reasonable. At a minimum, it would not be reasonable, and therefore would be a violation of the
rule and potentially subject to an enforcement action by the Commission, for an intermediary to
ignore investments made by an investor in other offerings on the intermediary’s platform, to not
obtain information and take into account investments made by an investor in other offerings
(made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6)) on platforms that are controlled by or under common control
with the intermediary, or to ignore other information or facts about an investor within its
possession.
Under the final rules, an intermediary will be permitted to reasonably rely on a centralized
data repository of investor information, should one be created in the future. We are not mandating
the creation of such a database at this time, in part to help to minimize the obstacles that
intermediaries may face in getting this newly formed marketplace up and running. 796 We note, in
response to one commenter, 797 that it is the Commission’s normal practice to review the
effectiveness of all of its rules, particularly in light of market developments, and consider changes
as the Commission deems appropriate. Commission staff expects to review the need for a
796

We do not believe that the statute requires the establishment of a centralized database or repository of
investor information as one commenter suggested. See Merkley Letter. Instead, the statute calls for
intermediaries to “make such efforts as the Commission determines appropriate, by rule” to ensure that no
investor exceeds the investment limits set forth in Section 4(a)(6).

undertake no later than three years following the effective date of Regulation Crowdfunding. 798

Acknowledgment of Risk
(a)

Proposed Rule

Securities Act Section 4A(a)(4) requires an intermediary to ensure that each investor: (1)
reviews educational materials; (2) positively affirms that the investor understands that he or she is
risking the loss of the entire investment and that the investor could bear such a loss; and (3)
answer questions demonstrating an understanding of the level of risk generally applicable to
investments in startups, emerging businesses and small issuers, the risk of illiquidity and such
other matters as the Commission determines appropriate. As discussed above, Rule 302(b) of
Regulation Crowdfunding requires an intermediary to provide to investors certain educational
materials in connection with the opening of an account. In addition, proposed Rule 303(b)(2) of
Regulation Crowdfunding would require an intermediary, each time before accepting an
investment commitment, to obtain from the investor a representation that the investor has
reviewed the intermediary’s educational materials, understands that the entire amount of his or her
investment may be lost and is in a financial condition to bear the loss of the investment. 799 The
proposed rule would also require that an intermediary obtain from the investor answers to
questions demonstrating the investor’s understanding that there are restrictions on the investor’s
ability to cancel an investment commitment and obtain a return of his or her investment, that it
may be difficult for the investor to resell the securities, and that the investor should not invest any
798

See Section II. Further, we anticipate that, because of the electronic nature of crowdfunding, many of the
books and records maintained by intermediaries will be in electronic format. We expect this will enable the
Commission to analyze data across the crowdfunding industry as part of its ongoing oversight. We note that
Commission staff also expects to review the books and records practices of intermediaries as part of its
planned three-year review.

investment.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Several commenters supported the requirement that intermediaries obtain investor
acknowledgments. 800 Some of these commenters, however, opposed requiring investors to reacknowledge or to re-certify for each investment commitment.801
One commenter stated that investors should be required to complete and sign “subscription
forms” that set forth, in addition to what the proposed rules would require, additional information
concerning the investor’s level of investment experience, the identity of any person from whom
the investor acquired any information about the investment and the percentage of the investor’s
liquid net worth represented by the proposed investment. 802
One commenter supported the Commission providing recommended forms of questions
and representations, noting that “any material examples provided by the Commission will be
helpful to both the investor and the intermediary.” 803 However, another commenter stated that it
would be opposed to the Commission providing recommended forms of questions as a “starting
point” because such recommended forms could be seen as a safe harbor and constrain

not obligated to contact investors directly.

and representations should serve as a safe harbor so there is an incentive for issuers to use them. 805
(c)

Final Rules

After considering the comments, we are adopting Rule 302(b)(2) as proposed.
As noted in the Proposing Release, this rule is intended to help ensure that investors engaging in
transactions made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) are fully informed and reminded of the risks
associated with their particular investment before making any investment commitment. While an
intermediary cannot ensure that all investors understand the risks involved, the rule requires
intermediaries to confirm that an investor: (1) has reviewed the intermediary’s educational
materials delivered pursuant to Rule 302(b); (2) understands that the entire amount of his or her
investment may be lost, and is in a financial condition to bear the loss of the investment; and (3)
has completed a questionnaire demonstrating an understanding of the risks of any potential
investment and other required statutory elements. In addition, the questionnaire required under
the rule may help to address, at least in part, the concerns expressed by some commenters that
Section 4A(a)(4) requires more than a mere self-certification. 806 We note, however, that the plain
language of Section 4A(a)(4)(B) seemingly requires only that the investor positively affirms his or
her understanding of the risk of loss.
Our final rule does not provide a model form of acknowledgment or questionnaire.
Rather, the rule permits an intermediary to develop the representation and questionnaire in any
format that is reasonably designed to demonstrate the investor’s receipt of the information and

804

See Wefunder Letter.

805

See Public Startup Letter 3.

806

See, e.g., Accredify Letter; Commonwealth of Massachusetts Letter; Farnkoff Letter; Saunders Letter;
Verinvest Letter.

213

compliance with the other requirements under the final rules. As with the educational material
requirements, we continue to believe that rather than providing sample content or a model form of
acknowledgment or questionnaire, intermediaries should be provided with sufficient flexibility to
choose both the content, within the requirements of Rule 302(b), and the format used to present
the required materials. Likewise, we also believe that an intermediary’s familiarity with its
business and likely investor base make it best able to determine the format in which to present the
required materials. We note that any format used must be reasonably designed to demonstrate
receipt and understanding of the information. There are many ways, especially on a web-based
system, to convey information to, and obtain effective acknowledgment from, investors. As
explained in the Proposing Release, the requirements of the rule would not be satisfied if, for
example, an intermediary were to pre-select answers for an investor.
Further, an intermediary in its discretion may require additional information, such as
information concerning the investor’s level of investment experience, the identity of any person
from whom the investor acquired any information about the investment and the percentage of the
investor’s liquid net worth represented by the proposed investment, or impose additional
requirements on prospective investors, such as imposing express acknowledgments of the
investor’s responsibilities with respect to compliance.
Finally, although several commenters suggested that once an account has been created on
an intermediary’s platform, an investor should be able to invest in multiple offerings on the same
intermediary platform without having to re-certify and review the educational material, we
continue to believe that, in order to realize the statute’s investor protection goals, it is prudent to
require an intermediary to obtain an investor representation and completed questionnaire each
time an investor seeks to make an investment commitment. Accordingly, under Rule 303(b), an
214

intermediary will be required to obtain these items each time an investor seeks to make an
investment commitment.
c.

Communication Channels
(1)

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 303(c) of Regulation Crowdfunding would require an intermediary to
provide, on its platform, channels through which investors can communicate with one another and
with representatives of the issuer about offerings made available on the intermediary’s platform.
An intermediary that is a funding portal would be prohibited from participating in
communications in these channels. 807 Proposed Rule 303(c) also would require the intermediary
to: (1) make the communications channels publicly available; (2) permit only those persons who
have opened accounts to post comments; and (3) require any person posting a comment in the
communication channels to disclose whether he or she is a founder or an employee of an issuer
engaging in promotional activities on behalf of the issuer, or is otherwise compensated, whether in
the past or prospectively, to promote the issuer’s offering.
(2)

Comments on the Proposed Rule

We received comments both supporting 808 and opposing the proposed rules on
communications channels. 809 Several commenters agreed that posting in communication channels
should be limited to registered investors on an intermediary’s platform. 810

807

See Rule 303(c)(1) (an intermediary that is a funding portal cannot “participate in these communications,
other than to establish guidelines for communication and remove abusive or potentially fraudulent
communications”). See also Exchange Act Section 3(a)(80) (defining the term “funding portal” as any
person acting as an intermediary in a transaction involving the offer or sale of securities for the account of
others, solely pursuant to Securities Act Section 4(a)(6), that does not, among other things, “offer investment
advice or recommendations”).

808

See, e.g., PeoplePowerFund Letter; RocketHub Letter; Vann Letter (stating that intermediaries should be
allowed to decide who may post on the channels).

215

Some commenters stated there should be more privacy or control in the manner in which
comments are posted to the communications channels, such as submitting comments to
intermediaries to review prior to posting or restricting the publicly viewable comments. 811 One
commenter stated that he interprets the proposed rule to permit issuers to post videos and other
promotional content (similar to marketing content used on non-securities-based crowdfunding
sites like Kickstarter), and that he supported this approach as it would permit the issuer to
“communicate freely and creatively . . . while giving the crowd a forum to ask questions or offer
criticism.” 812 Another commenter encouraged the Commission “to provide an investor ‘hotline’,
where investors can report concerns relating to crowdfunding communications or transactions, and
that intermediaries be required to provide notice on their platforms of how to access this
hotline.” 813
Several commenters generally supported the disclosure requirement on communications
by issuers or intermediaries and agreed that these communications should be made transparent to
investors. 814

809

See, e.g., Cromwell Letter (claiming that “[a]s [a] venture investor, you cannot judge the abilities of the
management team over the Internet. Real venture capitalists do not make their investments over the Internet

One commenter generally supported the proposed rule requiring each promotional
communication to be accompanied by disclosure of the receipt of past or prospective
compensation. 815 Another commenter suggested that the proposed rules should be amended to
require that intermediaries prominently post the online identities of the issuer’s paid promoters in
the communication channels. 816 One commenter, however, stated that the Commission should not
mandate the exact methods by which an intermediary achieves compliance with the requirement
for promoters to disclose their relationship with an issuer. 817
In response to our request for comments, several commenters supported requiring
intermediaries to keep the communication channels available to investors post-offering. 818
Another commenter, however, stated that the communication channels should be closed after
stock certificates are issued and received by investors. 819 This commenter further noted that the
continued maintenance of a communication channel after the end of a campaign would be an
unnecessary cost. The same commenter suggested that the issuer’s website is a better place for
communication between investors and issuers. 820

Final Rule

After considering the comments, we are adopting Rule 303(c) as proposed. We considered
commenters’ suggestions that the issuer’s website is a better place for communication between
investors and issuers and that ongoing communication between issuers and investors should be an
obligation of issuers alone. We believe, however, that communication channels on the
intermediary’s platform will provide a centralized and transparent means for members of the
public that have opened an account with an intermediary to share their views about investment
opportunities and to communicate with representatives of the issuer to better assess the issuer and
investment opportunity. 821 While the JOBS Act does not impose this requirement, we believe it is
consistent with the legislative intent that such a mechanism be in place for offerings made in
reliance on Section 4(a)(6). 822 Also, though communications among investors may occur outside
of the intermediary’s platform, communications by an investor with a crowdfunding issuer or its
representatives about the terms of the offering are required to occur through these channels 823 on
the single platform through which the offering is conducted. 824 This requirement is expected to
provide transparency and accountability, and thereby further the protection of investors.
Although one commenter stated that it interpreted the proposed rule to permit issuers to
post videos and other promotional content, aside from Rule 303(c)(4) and its requirements for
promotional activity, Rule 303(c) itself does not address the content or form used by issuers when

821

See also discussion in Section II.B.5.

822

See 158 CONG. REC. S2231 (daily ed. Mar. 29, 2012) (statement of Sen. Scott Brown) (“In addition to
facilitating communication between issuers and investors, intermediaries should allow fellow investors to
endorse or provide feedback about issuers and offerings, provided that these investors are not employees of
the intermediary. Investors’ credentials should be included with their comments to aid the collective wisdom
of the crowd.”).

823

See Rule 204 of Regulation Crowdfunding and discussion in Section II.B.4.

824

See Rule 100(a)(3) of Regulation Crowdfunding and discussion in Section II.A.3.

218

communicating with investors through the channels provided on an intermediary’s platform.
Rather, Rule 204 of Regulation Crowdfunding sets forth the advertising requirements for issuers
and, as explained above, Rule 204 allows an issuer to communicate with investors about the terms
of the offering through communication channels provided by the intermediary on the
intermediary’s platform, so long as the issuer identifies itself as the issuer in all
communications. 825
We are requiring intermediaries to make the communications on the channels publicly
available for viewing. We believe that this requirement is consistent with the concept of
crowdfunding, as it provides for transparent crowd discussions about a potential investment
opportunity. We also are requiring in Rule 303(c)(3) that intermediaries limit the posting in
communication channels to those individuals who have opened an account with the intermediary
on its platform. As stated in the Proposing Release, while we recognize that this requirement
could narrow the range of views represented by excluding posts by anyone who has not opened an
account with the intermediary, we believe that it will help to establish accountability for
comments made in the communication channels. We continue to believe that, without this
measure, there would be greater risk of the communications including unfounded, potentially
abusive or biased statements intended to promote or discredit the issuer and improperly influence
the investment decisions of members of the crowd.
With respect to one commenter’s suggestion that the Commission provide an investor
“hotline” where investors can report concerns relating to crowdfunding communications or
transactions, we note that the Commission has an existing “Tips, Complaints and Referrals Portal”

825

See Section II.B.4 (discussing Rule 204).

219

available on its website, 826 where the public may provide the Commission with information about
potential fraud or wrongdoing involving alleged violations of the securities laws.
We are mindful of the cost associated with the communications channel, and, therefore, we
are not requiring that intermediaries keep the communication channels available to investors postoffering, as suggested by some commenters. 827 However, an intermediary in its discretion can
choose to maintain the communication channels post-offering. 828
Consistent with the prohibition on a funding portal offering investment advice or
recommendations, 829 the rule as adopted will prohibit an intermediary that is a funding portal from
participating in any communications in these channels, apart from establishing guidelines for
communication and removing abusive or potentially fraudulent communications. A funding
portal can, for example, establish guidelines pertaining to the length or size of individual postings
in the communication channels and can remove postings that include offensive or incendiary
language. Also, although we understand the reasons for commenters’ suggestions that there
should be more privacy or control in the manner in which comments are posted, we believe that
aside from intermediaries removing abusive or potentially fraudulent communications, investor
protection is better served by providing the opportunity for uncensored and transparent crowd
discussions about a potential investment opportunity.

826

See Enforcement Tips and Complaints, available at https://www.sec.gov/complaint/tipscomplaint.shtml.

827

See, e.g., PeoplePowerFund Letter; RocketHub Letter; StartupValley Letter.

828

It is important to note that an intermediary would still have to maintain records of such communications to
satisfy the books and records requirements of the crowdfunding rules. See Rule 404(a)(3).

829

See Rule 300(c)(2)(i). Exchange Act Section 3(a)(80) defines the term “funding portal” as any person acting
as an intermediary in a transaction involving the offer or sale of securities for the account of others, solely
pursuant to Securities Act Section 4(a)(6), that does not, among other things, “offer investment advice or
recommendations.”

220

Finally, under the rule as adopted an intermediary must require any person posting on the
communication channel to clearly and prominently disclose with each posting whether he or she is
a founder or an employee of an issuer engaging in promotional activities on behalf of the issuer, or
is otherwise compensated, whether in the past or prospectively, to promote the issuer’s offering.
This disclosure will apply to officers, directors and other representatives of the issuer, and also
will be required of an intermediary that is a broker and its associated persons. We continue to
believe that intermediaries, as the hosts of the communication channels, are well placed to take
measures to ensure that promoters clearly identify themselves in their communication channels, in
accordance with Securities Act Section 4A(b)(3).

Notice of Investment Commitment
(1)

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 303(d) of Regulation Crowdfunding would require an intermediary, upon
receipt of an investment commitment from an investor, to promptly give or send to the investor a
notification disclosing: (1) the dollar amount of the investment commitment; (2) the price of the
securities, if known; (3) the name of the issuer; and (4) the date and time by which the investor
may cancel the investment commitment. Pursuant to proposed Rule 302(a)(2) of Regulation
Crowdfunding, this notification would be provided by e-mail or other electronic media, and would
be documented in accordance with applicable recordkeeping rules. 830

830

See Section II.C.4 (discussing Rule 100(a)(3)) and Section II.D.5 (discussing the recordkeeping rules
applicable to funding portals). See also note 1114 (discussing the recordkeeping rules applicable to brokers
and intermediaries).

221

(2)

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Commenters generally supported the requirement that intermediaries send these
notifications to investors. 831 One of these commenters stated that, in its view, the notice should be
submitted twice: first, when an investor has made a commitment, and again when the cancellation
period is over. 832 One commenter stated that, in its view, investors also should be notified of
whether a campaign has been successful or not, both when the campaign is near completion and
when the campaign has been closed. 833 However, one commenter opposed all notice
requirements. 834
(3)

Final Rules

After considering the comments, we are adopting Rule 303(d) as proposed. As stated in the
Proposing Release, the notification is intended, among other things, to provide the investor with a
written record of the basic terms of the transaction, as well as a reminder of his or her ability to
cancel the investment commitment. We believe that the adopted notification requirements will be
useful to investors and provide transparency. We also believe that requiring that this notification
be sent once—promptly upon receipt of an investment commitment from an investor—rather than
multiple times as commenters suggested—will help to minimize the costs associated with
providing additional notification, while still providing the investor with, among other things, an
important reminder about the ability to cancel the investment commitment. Although an
intermediary can decide, in its discretion, to provide additional notifications to its customers as a

business decision, we believe at this time that adopting additional notification requirements could
hamper flexibility in the evolving crowdfunding market and potentially impair the development of
best practices that are tailored to this unique form of raising capital.
e.

Maintenance and Transmission of Funds
(1)

Proposed Rule

Securities Act Section 4A(a)(7) requires that an intermediary “ensure that all offering
proceeds are only provided to the issuer when the aggregate capital raised from all investors is
equal to or greater than a target offering amount, . . . as the Commission shall, by rule, determine
appropriate.” Proposed Rule 303(e)(1) of Regulation Crowdfunding would implement this
provision and address the maintenance and protection of investor funds, pending completion of a
transaction made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6), by requiring an intermediary that is a registered
broker to comply with established requirements in Exchange Act Rule 15c2-4 835 for the
maintenance and transmission of investor funds.
Proposed Rule 303(e)(2) would establish separate requirements for an intermediary that is
a funding portal. Because a funding portal cannot receive any funds, it would be required to direct
investors to transmit money or other consideration directly to a “qualified third party” that has
agreed in writing to hold the funds for the benefit of the investors and the issuer and to promptly
transmit or return the funds to the persons entitled to such funds. Proposed Rule 303(e)(2) would
define “qualified third party” to mean a bank 836 that has agreed in writing to either: (i) hold the
funds in escrow for the persons who have the beneficial interests in the funds and to transmit or
return the funds directly to the persons entitled to them when the appropriate event or contingency

223

has occurred; or (ii) establish a bank account (or accounts) for the exclusive benefit of investors
and the issuer.
Proposed Rule 303(e)(3) would require an intermediary that is a funding portal to
promptly direct transmission of funds from the qualified third party to the issuer when the
aggregate amount of investment commitments from all investors is equal to or greater than the
target amount of the offering and the cancellation period for each investor has expired, provided
that in no event may the funding portal direct this transmission of funds earlier than 21 days after
the date on which the intermediary makes publicly available on its platform the information
required to be provided by the issuer under Rules 201 and 203(a) of proposed Regulation
Crowdfunding.
(2)

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Several commenters generally supported the proposed fund maintenance and transmission
requirements. 837 One commenter suggested that intermediaries be allowed to reject an investor’s
investment commitment if that investor does not have a correlating balance in an account with the
intermediary. 838 Another commenter suggested that the Commission require that such accounts
be interest bearing and that either (1) the investors’ funds be returned to them with their pro rata
portion of the interest in the event the offering is canceled, or (2) the funds and the accrued
interest be dispersed to the issuer upon the offering’s successful closing. 839 Another commenter
suggested that qualified third parties should be registered and verified for “reputations [of]

See, e.g., Arctic Island Letter 6; ASTTC Letter; CSTTC Letter; Greenfield Letter (suggesting that the issuer
should be required to certify in writing under penalty of perjury to the escrow bank that the offering has been

circumstances that would render the representations in the offering statement false or misleading); Joinvestor
Letter; STA Letter.

integrity”; complaints against those entities should be made public; and “drawdown” schedules
should be submitted at the onset of projects and subsequently control issuer access to “project
funds.” 840
In the Proposing Release, we requested comment on various alternatives to the proposed
rules. As to whether the proposed rules should prohibit any variations of a contingency offering,
such as minimum-maximum, offerings, one commenter stated that the target amount of a
crowdfunding campaign “should represent the minimum to avoid investor confusion” and that
“oversubscription should be allowed.” 841 This commenter noted that these conditions would
allow companies to “choose to set their own minimum and maximum range.” 842 Another
commenter suggested that we permit contingency offers based on a maximum amount of funds
being raised or other benchmarks if the maximum is not met or, alternatively, permit “all-or-none”
offerings. 843
As to whether other types of custody arrangements should be permitted, one commenter
requested clarification that a carrying broker would not be deemed to accept any part of the sale
price of any security for purposes of Exchange Act Rule 15c2-4 under specific circumstances. 844
As to whether there should be a fixed deadline for transmission of funds (such as three
business days), one commenter stated that “fixed deadlines should be set to protect investor and

See PeoplePowerFund Letter (suggesting also that any oversubscribed issues be allocated on a “first come

See FOLIOfn Letter. Although this commenter stated its belief that the proposed procedure is consistent
with Rule 15c2-4 on the basis that the carrying broker would not be “accept[ing] any part of the sale price”
until closing, at which time funds would be promptly transferred to the issuer, it stated that additional clarity
would be helpful to ensure that the Proposing Release does not introduce confusion if read by some as
containing an implication to the contrary.

issuer interests.” This commenter suggested that “one week (7 days) should be sufficient to
disburse collected funds.” 845 Another commenter suggested a three-day deadline. 846
As to whether SRO and staff guidance on Exchange Act Rule 15c2-4 should be expressly
incorporated into the rules, one commenter suggested that there was no need for incorporation of
prior guidance about Rule 15c2-4 into the proposed rules. 847
As to whether the definition of “qualified third party” should be expanded to include
entities other than a bank, one commenter stated that the Commission should “consider
[permitting] non-bank custodians, such as internet services that specialize in escrow and payment
transfer.” 848 Another commenter suggested that “qualified third parties” should include credit
unions, savings and loans and other institutions that offer similar protections to banks. 849
Similarly, another commenter suggested that credit unions should be included. 850 One commenter
suggested that banks should not be a qualified third party. 851 One commenter suggested that the
definition of “qualified third party” be expanded to include certain broker-dealers that “hold funds
and securities on behalf of customer accounts pursuant to [Exchange Act] Rule 15c3-3 and

Funding Portals use a qualified third party, which is a bank, to hold investor funds as escrow agent and
transmit the funds to the issuer once the offering requirements are met”); ASTTC Letter (stating that it
“strongly supports the Proposed Rule’s requirement that Funding Portals be required to utilize qualified
escrow agents to hold the investor assets prior to transmittal to issuers and that “[q]ualified escrow agents are
generally regulated banks”); STA Letter (stating that “[it] is pleased that the Proposed Rules contain a
requirement that Funding Portals transmit investor assets to qualified escrow agents, which are banks, prior
to their release to the issuer.”).

maintain net capital pursuant to [Exchange Act] Rule 15c3-1(a)(2)(i)”. 852 The commenter also
suggested that funding portals and other brokers should be able to utilize these brokers “to the
identical degree they would be able to utilize banks under Rule 15c2-4.” 853
Commenters generally agreed with our proposed approach not to require funding portals to
maintain net capital, noting among other things that imposing “net capital requirements would
increase the cost of starting a new funding portal and reduce the potential number of
intermediaries, while providing little additional protection to investors and issuers.” 854
As to whether certain methods of payment for the purchase of securities should either be
required or prohibited, one commenter suggested that the types of payment methods not be limited
in any way. 855 However, some commenters stated, generally, that credit cards should be
prohibited as a form of payment for securities in connection with crowdfunding. 856

Final Rule

After considering the comments, we are adopting Rule 303(e) substantially as proposed,
but with certain revisions in response to comments. Rule 303(e)(1), as adopted, requires an

broker-dealer to act as trustee for an omnibus escrow account at an FDIC insured bank); Ex 24 Letter.

See Tiny Cat Letter (stating that “[f]unding portals are already prohibited from handling funds and securities,
and are also subject to a fidelity bond in the proposed regulations”). See also Joinvestor Letter (suggesting

instituted); Vann Letter (stating that a “capital requirement would unnecessarily restrict competition”).

855

See Public Startup Letter 3.

856

See, e.g., Arctic Island Letter 6 (suggesting that, given the chargeback periods for credit cards, broker-dealers
should only be permitted to accept credit card payments from investors if the broker-dealer “directly and
unconditionally guarantees the amounts obtained thereby to both the issuer and the escrow agent”);
Consumer Federation Letter (suggesting that allowing payment via credit card increases the risk that
investors will make crowdfunding investments that they cannot afford); Joinvestor Letter; RocketHub Letter
(stating that “[p]ermitting debt-based payment vehicles, such as credit cards, which have their own rescission
policies, (i.e., charge backs) is problematic”).

227

intermediary that is a registered broker-dealer to comply with established requirements in
Exchange Act Rule 15c2-4 for the maintenance and transmission of investor funds. Rule 15c2-4
requires, in relevant part, that in connection with a contingency offering of a security, any money
or other consideration received by a broker-dealer participating in the distribution must be
promptly deposited in a separate bank account, as agent or trustee for the persons who have the
beneficial interest therein, until the appropriate event or contingency has occurred, and thereafter
promptly transmitted or returned to the persons entitled thereto; 857 or alternatively, that all such
funds must be promptly transmitted to a bank that has agreed in writing to hold such funds in
escrow for the persons who have the beneficial interests therein and to transmit or return such
funds directly to the persons entitled thereto when the appropriate event or contingency has
occurred. 858 When the Commission adopted Rule 15c2-4, the Commission explained that the rule
was designed to prevent fraud by a broker-dealer “either upon the person on whose behalf the
distribution is being made or upon the customer to whom the payment is to be returned if the
distribution is not completed.” 859 As such, consistent with Securities Act Section 4A(a)(7), the
intermediary may transmit the proceeds to the issuer only if the target offering amount is met or
exceeded.
Rule 303(e)(2) as adopted establishes separate requirements for an intermediary that is a
funding portal (as compared to an intermediary that is a broker-dealer) because a funding portal

857

See Exchange Act Rule 15c2-4(b)(1). We note, however, that any broker-dealer seeking to hold such
investor funds in a separate bank account as agent or trustee for the persons who have a beneficial interest
therein are still subject to net capital requirements pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 15c3-1.

228

cannot, by statute, hold, manage, possess, or otherwise handle investor funds or securities. 860
Therefore, Rule 303(e)(2) requires a funding portal to direct investors to transmit money or other
consideration directly to a qualified third party that has agreed in writing 861 to hold the funds for
the benefit of the investors and the issuer and to promptly transmit or return the funds to the
persons entitled to such funds. 862
We are revising the definition of a “qualified third party” to include for purposes of the
final rule: a registered broker or dealer that carries customer or broker or dealer accounts and
holds funds or securities for those persons, 863 a bank, or a credit union insured by the National
Credit Union Administration (“NCUA”). 864 We had proposed to define “qualified third party” to
mean a bank 865 because investors, as well as intermediaries and issuers, would then be afforded
the protections of existing regulations that apply to banks, in particular those pertaining to the

860

See Exchange Act Section 3(a)(80)(D).

861

This written agreement is required to be maintained by the funding portal pursuant to proposed Rule 404 of
Regulation Crowdfunding. See Section II.D.5.

862

In the crowdfunding context, we expect that the intermediary will make the determination as to whether the
contingency (i.e., the target offering amount) has been met. See Securities Act Section 4A(a)(7) (requiring
that an intermediary “ensure that all offering proceeds are only provided to the issuer when the aggregate
capital raised from all investors is equal to or greater than a target offering amount, . . . as the Commission
shall, by rule, determine appropriate.”).

863

Broker-dealers that may serve as qualified third parties under Rule 303(e) include only those broker-dealers
that are required to maintain minimum net capital of $250,000 or a higher minimum amount depending on
their status under Appendix E of Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. See Exchange Act Rules 15c31(a)(2)(i) and 15c3-1(a)(7)(i).

The NCUA was established by the Federal Credit Union Act of 1934. See Federal Credit Union Act of 1934,

safeguarding of customer funds. 866 However, after considering the comments, we agree with
those commenters who suggested that the definition of “qualified third party” should be expanded
to include entities other than a bank and should include, as one commenter suggested, credit
unions provided that these entities offer similar protections to banks. 867 We also made a
corresponding change to the language of the rule text to indicate that a qualified third party
arrangement may involve either a bank or credit union account (or accounts) established for the
exclusive benefit of investors and the issuer.
After considering the comments, we further believe that the definition of “qualified third
party” should be expanded to include certain types of registered broker-dealers. We are
expanding the definition to include registered broker-dealers that carry customer or broker or
dealer accounts and holds funds or securities for those persons. We believe such brokers-dealers
are appropriate entities to serve as qualified third parties as they are subject to various regulatory
obligations, which are designed to provide enhanced protection of investor funds through the
imposition of capital and other requirements. 868 We note that we are not amending the
requirements of Rule 15c2-4 through this release and not distinguishing broker-dealers that
participate in offerings made in reliance on Securities Act Section 4(a)(6), either as a qualified

For example, bank deposit accounts at FDIC-insured banks are protected by FDIC deposit insurance. See
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., Deposit Insurance FAQs, available at
http://www.fdic.gov/deposit/deposits/faq.html.

867

We do not believe that the definition of qualified third party should be extended to include Internet service
providers that specialize in escrow and payment transfer, as suggested by one commenter, because we do not
believe that such entities are governed by a regulatory scheme designed to provide similar protections as the
other entities that we are defining as qualified third parties under Rule 303(e). We note that another
commenter suggested the addition of savings and loan associations. We believe that certain savings and loan
associations are covered by the definition of “bank” under Exchange Act Section 3(a)(6), and as such, are
qualified third parties under Rule 303(e). We note that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. extended its
authority to cover savings and loan associations in 1989. See Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and
Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) (creating the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF)).

third party or an intermediary, from broker-dealers in any other contingency offerings. As such,
broker-dealers participating in offerings made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6), either as an
intermediary or as a qualified third party, are still subject to Rule 15c2-4. 869 Further, we believe
that existing Commission and staff guidance on Rule 15c2-4 is extensive and clear and does not
warrant incorporation into the final rule or clarification.
The statute does not limit or require a particular payment mechanism, and we are not
imposing such a restriction because we believe that the rules should provide reasonable flexibility
regarding the payment mechanisms intermediaries employ. We believe that restrictions on
particular payment mechanisms would not serve to significantly increase investor protection,
particularly in light of the established investment limits. We note, however that an intermediary
can, in its discretion, decline to accept certain payment methods, such as credit cards, or accept
them only in certain circumstances. 870
We also are not adopting additional requirements that would, for example, (1) prohibit
variations of a contingency offering, such as minimum-maximum offerings; (2) establish a fixed
deadline for transmission of funds as compared to the proposed requirement to transmit funds
“promptly”; or (3) require funding portals to maintain a certain amount of net capital. We believe
that additional restrictions, such as prohibiting variations of a contingency offering or establishing

869

Under existing Rule 15c2-4, the qualified third party broker-dealer will be required to promptly deposit the
funds in a separate bank account, as agent or trustee for the persons who have the beneficial interest therein,
until the appropriate event or contingency has occurred, and thereafter promptly transmit or return the funds
to the persons entitled thereto. See Rule 15c2-4(b)(1).

870

We note, for example, that an intermediary can, in its discretion, decline to accept credit cards given that, as
at least one commenter suggested, an investor’s use of his or her right to dispute credit card charges can
inhibit the ability of an issuer to meet its target or to provide accurate disclosures to investors and the
Commission regarding the progress it has made toward, and whether it has, reached the target offering
amount. This potential impact will affect offerings conducted through brokers and funding portals alike. We
also note that pursuant to Exchange Act Section 3(a)(80)(D) (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(80)(D)), a funding portal is
statutorily prohibited from extending credit or margin to customers.

231

a fixed deadline for the transmission of funds could hamper flexibility in the nascent
crowdfunding market and prohibit the development of best practices specifically tailored to this
unique form of capital raising. Finally, we are not requiring in the final rule net capital standards
for funding portals. As noted above, funding portals are prohibited from handling, managing or
possessing investor funds or securities. 871 We continue to believe that the requirements relating,
in particular, to transmission of proceeds under the final rules will help ensure that investor funds
are protected, without requiring funding portals to maintain net capital.

Confirmation of Transactions
(1)

Proposed Rule

As proposed, Rule 303(f)(1) of Regulation Crowdfunding would require that an
intermediary, at or before the completion of a transaction made pursuant to Section 4(a)(6), give
or send to each investor a notification disclosing: (1) the date of the transaction; (2) the type of
security that the investor is purchasing; (3) the identity, price and number of securities purchased
by the investor, as well as the number of securities sold by the issuer in the transaction and the
price(s) at which the securities were sold; (4) certain specified terms of the security, if it is a debt
or callable security; and (5) the source and amount of any remuneration received or to be received
by the intermediary in connection with the transaction, whether from the issuer or from other
persons. This notification would be required to be provided by e-mail or other electronic
media, 872 and to be documented in accordance with applicable recordkeeping rules. 873 Pursuant to
871

See Exchange Act Section 3(a)(80)(D) [15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(80)(D)] and discussion in Section II.C.1.

See proposed Rule 302(a)(2) (requiring an intermediary to provide all information electronically). See also
Section II.C.4.a (discussing electronic delivery requirements).

Intermediaries that are brokers are subject to the recordkeeping requirements of Exchange Act Rules 17a-3
and 17a-4, and intermediaries that are funding portals are subject to recordkeeping requirements under Rule
404 of Regulation Crowdfunding. See note 1114 (discussing the recordkeeping rules applicable to brokers
and intermediaries). See also Section II.D.5.

proposed Rule 303(f)(2), an intermediary that gives or sends to each investor the notification
described above would be exempt from the requirements of Exchange Act Rule 10b-10 874 for the
subject transaction.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Commenters generally supported the proposed confirmation requirements. 875 One
commenter, however, stated its view that permitting intermediaries to satisfy the delivery
requirement for transaction confirmations through delivery of a message that contains a notice that
the information is available on the intermediary’s website would not be sufficient. 876
(3)

Final Rule

After considering the comments, we are adopting Rule 303(f), as proposed, but with one
clarifying change. As proposed, Rule 303(f)(1)(vi) would have required an intermediary to give
or send to each investor a notification disclosing: “[t]he source and amount of any remuneration
received or to be received by the intermediary in connection with the transaction, including the
amount and form of any remuneration that is received, or will be received, by the intermediary
from persons other than the issuer. We are revising Rule 303(f)(1)(vi) to require disclosure as
well of the form of any remuneration received or to be received by the intermediary in connection
with the transaction, including any remuneration received or to be received by the intermediary
from persons other than the issuer. This edit is intended to clarify the rule by placing “source,
form and amount” together, rather than having “form” listed out separately as proposed.

874

875

See, e.g., CFA Institute Letter; Joinvestor Letter.

876

See Consumer Federation Letter (stating that “[w]hile most if not all intermediaries would be likely to
deliver the actual confirmation to investors, the rule would not guarantee this”).

233

As explained in the Proposing Release, we believe that transaction confirmations serve an
important and basic investor protection function by, among other things, conveying information
and providing a reference document that allows investors to verify the terms of their transactions,
acting as a safeguard against fraud and providing investors a means by which to evaluate the costs
of their transactions. 877 Each of the required items of information is intended to assist investors in
memorializing and assessing their transactions. Furthermore, the requirement that an intermediary
disclose to an investor the source, form and amount of any remuneration received or to be received
is designed to help to highlight potential conflicts of interest if, for example, an intermediary has a
financial interest in an issuer using its services. 878
As for the concern raised by one commenter about the delivery requirements for
transaction confirmations, 879 we note, as we did in the Proposing Release, that the confirmation is
required to be provided by e-mail or other electronic media, consistent with the Commission’s
long-standing policies on the use of electronic media for delivery purposes. 880 This is also
consistent with the requirement for an intermediary to provide all information electronically. We
believe that this delivery requirement is appropriate for crowdfunding transactions and satisfies
our obligation that requirements under Securities Act Section 4A(a)(12) be for the protection of
investors and in the public interest. As to the same commenter’s view that the rule would not

10, 1994) [59 FR 59612, 59613 (Nov. 17, 1994)].

878

Although Securities Act Section 4A(a)(11) requires an intermediary to prohibit its directors, officers or
partners (or any person occupying a similar status or performing a similar function) from having any
financial interest in an issuer using its services, the final rules do not include a complete prohibition on the
intermediary, itself, having a financial interest in an issuer using its services. The intermediary may have a
financial interest in an issuer using its services, subject to certain limitations. See Rule 300(b). See also
Section II.C.2.b.

guarantee delivery of a confirmation to investors, 881 although we acknowledge that statutes and
rules cannot guarantee compliance, there is a robust regulatory scheme in place that is designed to
promote compliance and that is coupled with supervision and enforcement by both the
Commission and the registered national securities association.
In addition, under Rule 303(f)(2) as adopted, an intermediary that gives or sends to each
investor the notification described above is exempt from the requirements of Exchange Act Rule
10b-10 for the subject transaction. 882 The confirmation terms under Rule 303(f)(2) are similar to,
but not as extensive as, those broker-dealers are subject to under Rule 10b-10. We believe that
this difference is appropriate given the more limited scope of an intermediary’s role in
crowdfunding transactions. Rule 10b–10, for example, requires disclosure about such matters as
payment for order flow, riskless principal transactions, payment of odd-lot differentials and assetbacked securities. These items generally would not be relevant to crowdfunding securities
transactions or an intermediary’s participation in such transactions, and their inclusion in a
crowdfunding securities confirmation may be confusing to investors. Therefore, we believe that if

881

See Consumer Federation Letter.

882

Exchange Act Rule 10b-10 (17 CFR 240.10b-10) generally requires a broker-dealer effecting a customer
transaction in securities (other than U.S. savings bonds or municipal securities) to provide a notification to its
customer, at or before completion of a securities transaction, that discloses certain information specific to the
transaction. Specifically, Rule 10b-10 requires the disclosure of the date, time, identity, prices and number
of securities bought or sold; the capacity in which the broker-dealer acted (e.g., as agent or principal); yields
on debt securities; and under specified circumstances, the amount of remuneration the broker-dealer will
receive from the customer and any other parties. With regard to the specified circumstances mentioned
above, the remuneration disclosures of Rule 10b-10 generally are required, but certain exclusions apply. For
example, the remuneration disclosures are generally required where a broker or dealer is acting as agent for a
customer or some other person. In the case where remuneration is received or to be received by the broker
from such customer in connection with the transaction, the disclosures are not required where the
remuneration paid by such customer is determined pursuant to written agreement with such customer,
otherwise than on a transaction basis. 17 CFR 240.10b-10(a)(2)(i)(B). In contrast, the remuneration
disclosure requirements of Rule 303(f)(2)(vi) are required across all crowdfunding transactions where
remunerations are received or are to be received. Given the limits on the dollar amount of securities that can
be offered, as well as the limits on individual investment amounts, in transactions relying on Section 4(a)(6),
we do not expect investors to negotiate individualized compensation agreements.

235

an intermediary satisfies the notification requirements of the final rules, the intermediary will have
provided investors with sufficient relevant information about the crowdfunding security, and so
should not be required to meet the additional requirements of Rule 10b–10.
6.

Completion of Offerings, Cancellations and Reconfirmations
a.

Proposed Rule

Under Securities Act Section 4A(a)(7), an intermediary is required to allow investors to
cancel their commitments to invest as the Commission shall, by rule, determine appropriate.
Securities Act Section 4A(b)(1)(G) requires an issuer, prior to sale, to provide investors “a
reasonable opportunity to rescind the commitment to purchase the securities.” We proposed,
therefore, in Rule 304(a) of Regulation Crowdfunding, to give investors an unconditional right to
cancel an investment commitment for any reason until 48 hours prior to the deadline identified in
the issuer’s offering materials. Under this approach, an investor could reconsider his or her
investment decision with the benefit of the views of the crowd and other information, until the
final 48 hours of the offering. Thereafter, an investor would not be able to cancel any investment
commitments made within the final 48 hours of the offering (except in the event of a material
change to the offering, as discussed below). 883
We also proposed in Rule 304(b) that if an issuer reached the target offering amount prior
to the deadline identified in its offering materials, it could close the offering once the target
offering amount was reached, provided that: (1) the offering had been open for a minimum of 21
days; (2) the intermediary provided notice about the new offering deadline at least five business
days prior to the new offering deadline; (3) investors would be given the opportunity to reconsider
their investment decision and to cancel their investment commitment until 48 hours prior to the
883

See proposed Rule 304(c).

236

new offering deadline; and (4) at the time of the new offering deadline, the issuer continued to
meet or exceed the target offering amount.
In addition, we proposed in Rule 304(c) that if there was a material change 884 to the terms
of an offering or to the information provided by the issuer about the offering, the intermediary
would be required to give or send to any investors who have made investment commitments
notice of the material change, stating that the investor’s investment commitment will be cancelled
unless the investor reconfirms his or her commitment within five business days of receipt of the
notice. 885 As proposed, if the investor failed to reconfirm his or her investment within those five
business days, the intermediary would be required, within five business days thereafter, to: (1)
provide or send the investor a notification disclosing that the investment commitment was
cancelled, the reason for the cancellation and the refund amount that the investor should expect to
receive; and (2) direct the refund of investor funds. 886 This notification, like other notifications
from an intermediary, would be required to be provided by e-mail or other electronic media, and
to be documented in accordance with applicable recordkeeping rules. 887

884

In the Proposing Release, we noted that in those instances where an issuer had previously disclosed in its
offering materials only the method for determining the price of the securities offered and not the final price
of those securities, setting of the final price would be considered a material change. We also noted that if the
change involved closing the offering once the target offering amount is reached, which would be prior to the
deadline identified in the offering materials, then the procedures required under proposed Rule 304(b), and
not those in Rule 304(c), would apply.

885

The proposed rules also required that an issuer extend an offering to allow for a five business day period in
instances where material changes to the offering or to the information provided by the issuer occurred within
five business days of the maximum number of days that an offering was to remain open. See proposed Rule
304(c)(2) of Regulation Crowdfunding. See also Rule 302(a)(2) (requiring that notification be provided by
email or through other electronic media).

886

See proposed Rule 304(c)(1) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

887

Intermediaries that are brokers would be subject to the recordkeeping requirements of Exchange Act Rules
17a-3 and 17a-4, and intermediaries that are funding portals would be subject to recordkeeping requirements
under proposed Rule 404 of Regulation Crowdfunding. See note 1114 (discussing the recordkeeping rules
applicable to brokers and intermediaries). See also Section II.D.5; Section II.C.4. (discussing an
intermediary’s electronic delivery requirements and Rule 302(a)(2)).

237

Finally, we proposed in Rule 304(d) that if an issuer did not complete an offering, for
example, because the target was not reached or the issuer decided to terminate the offering, the
intermediary would be required, within five business days, to: (1) give or send to each investor
who had made an investment commitment a notification disclosing the cancellation of the
offering, the reason for the cancelation, and the refund amount that the investor should expect to
receive; (2) direct the refund of investor funds; and (3) prevent investors from making investment
commitments with respect to that offering on its platform. This notification, like other
notifications from an intermediary, would be required to be provided by e-mail or other electronic
media, and to be documented in accordance with applicable recordkeeping rules. 888
b.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

One commenter supported the unconditional right of investors to cancel an investment
commitment for any reason until 48 hours prior to the close of an offering. 889 Other commenters,
however, expressed concern over the potential for misconduct regarding cancellations, 890 such as
scenarios where investors commit and then withdraw at the last minute. 891

888

See note 1114 (discussing the recordkeeping rules applicable to brokers and intermediaries).

889

See CFA Institute Letter.

890

See, e.g., Joinvestor Letter (suggesting the lock-in-date should be fourteen days prior to the closing date to
prevent any misconduct surrounding the approach of a target, or the limit of oversubscription, near to the
close of the round); Consumer Federation Letter; RocketHub Letter.

891

See, e.g., RocketHub Letter (recommending a 24-hour cancellation period in order to protect investors from
“‘pump & rescind’ schemes” and minimize an issuer’s exposure to the risk of “‘short fall’ situations”);
Consumer Federation Letter (noting the risk that “individuals associated with the issuer will commit money
to the offering early in the process in order to stimulate interest and create a sense of urgency about
investing, only to withdraw at the last minute”). The same commenter suggested that potential
gamesmanship by investors associated with the issuer has the potential to discredit crowdfunding and
recommended that the Commission consider more meaningful restrictions on issuer participation.

238

One commenter stated that the rule on early closure of an offering should be more
narrowly defined. 892 This commenter requested that the Commission clarify whether, under such
circumstances, an offering should be closed from accepting more funds or keep accepting
commitments until the end of the five business day period, even if this puts an offering over set
limits. 893
Some commenters supported the proposal that existing disclosure materials can be
modified in the event of a material change, with the original offering remaining open, 894 while one
commenter also suggested that no changes should be allowed within 21 days of the close date. 895
Several commenters generally agreed that an investor should have to reconfirm the commitment
to invest when a material change occurs. 896 One commenter stated that many investors would
prefer not to have to re-confirm their investments and recommended allowing investors to decide
how to handle material changes. 897 Another commenter opposed any reconfirmation requirement
because it believed there should be a presumption that any changes made would be in the best
interest of the issuer and all of its stakeholders. 898
Some commenters supported the proposed five-day reconfirmation period for investors. 899
Some commenters, however, stated that five business days is not enough time for an investor to

issuer. 900 One commenter suggested a shorter reconfirmation time period. 901 Another
commenter recommended that the Commission clarify when the five-day reconfirmation period
begins. 902 One commenter suggested material revisions made to the offering should restart the
21-day minimum period for the campaign, though generally agreed that a five-business day
notification is sufficient in the event that an offering is cancelled. 903
c.

Final Rules

We are adopting Rule 304 as proposed, with a technical change to correct a cross-cite in
the rule text. We believe that the final rule appropriately takes into consideration the needs of
investors to be able to consider material changes to the terms of the offering and new views
expressed by the crowd, while allowing issuers to have certainty about their ability to close an
offering at the end of the offering period. We have considered the comments outlined above
about concerns with cancellation generally and those suggesting other types of cancellation or
lock-in periods. However, we continue to believe that allowing investors to cancel any investment
commitments for any reason until 48 hours prior to the deadline identified in the issuer’s offering
materials is an appropriate cancellation period because it is consistent with the requirement of
Section 4A(b)(1)(G) that investors have a “reasonable opportunity” to rescind investment
commitments, while also providing issuers with certainty within a reasonable amount of time
900

See, e.g., Arctic Island Letter 6 (advocating that the time period be “indefinite” so as to give investors more
time to consider the changes and to give issuers more time to answer questions of individual investors and
provide clarifications or make subsequent changes as needed); CfPA Letter (recommending that any change
in offering documents on a website after initial posting restart the 21-day period (or at least half of that)
during which offerings cannot close and prospective or pledged investors can reconsider and rescind their
commitments).

240

about whether they have indeed received investment commitments. Although we acknowledge
commenters’ concerns about potential misconduct in connection with cancellations of investment
commitments, we note that issuers and investors, including investors associated with the issuer,
are subject to the antifraud provisions of the securities laws. We also note that, as we discussed
above, an intermediary is required to promptly remove an offering from its platform if it becomes
aware of information that causes it to believe that the issuer or the offering presents the potential
for fraud or otherwise raises concerns about investor protection. 904
In regards to one commenter’s request for clarification as to whether an intermediary may
continue to receive investment commitments during the five business day period prior to an early
closure of an offering (even if the commitment may be oversubscribed), we note that
intermediaries are permitted to continue to receive investment commitments during that time
period, provided that the intermediary informs investors about the continuation of such acceptance
in accordance with Rule 304(b). 905
In addition, we believe that when material changes arise during the course of an offering,
an investor who had made a prior investment commitment should have a reasonable period during
which to review the new information and to decide whether to invest by reconfirming the
investment commitment. Despite some commenters’ concerns outlined above, we continue to
believe that a five business day period is appropriate because it reasonably reflects the need to
allow an investor sufficient time to consider material changes to the terms of the offering while
904

See Section II.C.3.

905

However, the issuer will still have to comply with the rules regarding oversubscriptions. See Section
II.B.6.a. This same commenter expressed uncertainty about how an issuer will communicate early closure to
a funding portal so that the funding portal can provide appropriate notice to investors about the new offering
deadline. The final rules do not prescribe the mechanics for how funding portals must communicate with
issuers as we believe the better course is to provide for flexibility in this regard so that intermediaries and
issuers can arrive at efficient working arrangements.

241

giving issuers certainty about their ability to close an offering. For the same reasons noted above,
we also believe that five business days is a sufficient amount of time for intermediaries to notify
investors about offerings that are not completed or terminated. Finally, we believe that requiring
an investor to reconfirm his or her investment commitment within five business days of receipt of
the notice of a material change is sufficiently clear as to when the reconfirmation period begins
and provides additional investor protection and is therefore an appropriate requirement for the
final rule.
7.

Payments to Third Parties
a.

Proposed Rule

Securities Act Section 4A(a)(10) provides that an intermediary in a transaction made in
reliance on Section 4(a)(6) shall not compensate “promoters, finders, or lead generators for
providing the broker or funding portal with the personal identifying information of any potential
investor.”
We proposed in Rule 305(a) of Regulation Crowdfunding to prohibit an intermediary from
compensating any person for providing it with the “personally identifiable information” 906 of any
investor. As explained in the Proposing Release, we believe that any person compensated for
providing the personally identifiable information of investors would be acting as a promoter,
finder or lead generator within the meaning of Securities Act Section 4A(a)(10).

906

As proposed, the term “personally identifiable information” would mean any information that can be used to
distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, either alone or when combined with other personal or identifying
information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual. See proposed Rule 305(c) of Regulation
Crowdfunding. As explained in the Proposing Release, personally identifiable information could include any
information that can be used to identify an individual, such as name, social security number, date or place of
birth, mother’s maiden name or biometric records, as well as any other information that is linked directly to
an individual, such as financial, employment, educational or medical information.

242

Proposed Rule 305(b), however, would permit an intermediary to compensate a person for
directing issuers or investors to the intermediary’s platform if: (1) the person does not provide the
intermediary with the personally identifiable information of any investor, and (2) the
compensation, unless it is paid to a registered broker or dealer, is not based, directly or indirectly,
on the purchase or sale of a security offered in reliance on Securities Act Section 4(a)(6) on or
through the intermediary’s platform. 907
b.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Some commenters generally supported the portion of the proposed rule that allows
intermediaries to compensate third parties for directing investors to the platform. 908 Some of
these comments also agreed that intermediaries should be permitted to compensate third parties
for general business advertising including, for example, web search engine direction or other
standard Internet marketing techniques. 909 In response to our request for comment as to whether
disclosures should be required when an intermediary compensates third parties for directing
investors to its platform, one commenter suggested the Commission should not require disclosure
of “standard Internet marketing [practices]” that “inform investors of companies they may be
interested in.” 910 Another commenter stated that compensation should only be allowed under
limited circumstances, albeit without providing examples of those limited circumstances. 911 We

907

We note that the receipt of direct or indirect transaction-based compensation would strongly indicate that the
recipient is acting as a broker. As such, the party receiving the compensation in the scenario described needs
to consider whether it would be required to register as a broker.

circumstances, as promotion will be a central issue to these campaigns.”).

243

did not receive comments related to the definition of the term “personally identifiable
information” as proposed in Rule 305(c).
c.

Final Rules

We are adopting Rule 305 with modifications. Rule 305(a), like the proposed rule, states
that an intermediary may not compensate any person for providing the intermediary with the
personally identifiable information of any investor in securities offered and sold in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act. However, we are not including in the final rule what was
proposed in paragraph (b), which stated that an intermediary may compensate a person for
directing issuers to the intermediary’s platform, provided that unless the compensation is made to
a registered broker or dealer, the compensation is not based, directly or indirectly, on the purchase
or sale of a security offered in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act on or through the
intermediary’s platform. Upon further consideration, we believe this provision would be
duplicative of Rule 402(b)(6), which addresses referral payments that funding portals are
permitted to pay to third parties. 912 In addition, registered broker-dealers are already subject to
limitations on the types of compensation that they may pay to third parties, and as we explained in
the Proposing Release, are subject to an established regulatory and oversight regime that provides
important safeguards for investors.
We agree with those commenters who believe intermediaries should be permitted to
compensate third parties for general business advertising including, for example, web search
engine direction or other standard Internet marketing techniques so long as that compensation is
not based, directly or indirectly, on the purchase or sale of a security offered in reliance on

912

See Section II.D.3.

244

Securities Act Section 4(a)(6). 913 We believe permitting compensation for these types of general
business advertising does not raise the same privacy concerns as those implicated by the provision
of personally identifiable information and is generally consistent with the statutory scheme for
crowdfunding promotional activities. Therefore, under the rules, an intermediary may pay a
person a flat fixed fee 914 to direct persons to the intermediary’s platform through, for example,
hyperlinks or search term results or make payments to a person to advertise its existence. 915 The
intermediary, however, cannot pay to receive personally identifiable information in under any
circumstances pursuant to the prohibition in Rule 305(a).
Finally, we are adopting as proposed the definition of personally identifiable information,
which will be renumbered as Rule 305(b).
D.

Additional Funding Portal Requirements
1.

Registration Requirement
a.

Generally
(1)

Proposed Rules

Securities Act Section 4A(a)(1) requires that an intermediary facilitating a transaction
made in reliance on Securities Act Section 4(a)(6) register with the Commission as a broker or a
funding portal. The statute does not, however, prescribe the manner in which a funding portal

913

See, e.g., 158 Cong. Rec. S5474-03 (daily ed. July 26, 2012) (statement of Sen. Jeff Merkley) (“[T]he
limitation on off-platform advertising is intended to prohibit issuers—including officers, directors, and 20
percent shareholders—from promoting or paying promoters to express opinions outside the platform that
would go beyond pointing the public to the funding portal.”).

914

A flat fixed fee is one that is not based on the success of the offering, and so would not be transaction-based
compensation. We note that the receipt of direct or indirect transaction-based compensation would strongly
indicate that the recipient is acting as a broker. As such, the party receiving this kind of compensation needs
to consider whether it would be required to register as a broker.

915

See also Rule 402 of Regulation Crowdfunding and discussion in Section II.D.3 (discussing advertising and
marketing activities in which a funding portal may engage under the Regulation’s safe harbor).

245

would register with the Commission.916 Securities Act Section 4A(a)(12) requires intermediaries
to comply with requirements as the Commission may, by rule, prescribe for the protection of
investors and in the public interest. Exchange Act Section 3(h)(1)(C) also permits the
Commission to impose, as part of its authority to exempt funding portals from broker registration,
“such other requirements under [the Exchange Act] as the Commission determines appropriate.”
We proposed to establish a streamlined registration process under which a funding portal
would register with the Commission by filing a form with information consistent with, but less
extensive than, the information required for broker-dealers on the Uniform Application for
Broker-Dealer Registration (“Form BD”). 917 Under proposed Rule 400(a), a funding portal would
register by completing a Form Funding Portal, which would include information concerning the
funding portal’s principal place of business, its legal status and its disciplinary history, if any;
business activities, including the types of compensation the funding portal would receive; control
affiliates of the funding portal and disclosure of their disciplinary history, if any; FINRA
membership or membership with any other registered national securities association; and the
funding portal’s website address(es) or other means of access. 918 Proposed Rule 400(a) also
would require a funding portal to become a member of FINRA or another applicable national
securities association registered under Exchange Act Section 15A. As proposed in Rule 400(a),
the funding portal’s registration would become effective the later of: (1) 30 calendar days after the

916

Compare Exchange Act Section 15(b) [15 U.S.C. 78o(b)] (prescribing the manner of registration of brokerdealers).

917

Brokers currently register with the Commission using Form BD. Information on that form regarding the
broker’s credentials, including current registrations or licenses and employment and disciplinary history, is
publicly available on FINRA’s BrokerCheck.

918

We discuss in Section II.D.1.b the information required to be included in Form Funding Portal.

246

date that the registration is received by the Commission; or (2) the date the funding portal is
approved for membership in FINRA or any other registered national securities association.
Proposed Rule 400(b) would require a funding portal to file an amendment to Form
Funding Portal within 30 days of any of the information previously submitted on the form
becoming inaccurate for any reason.
In addition, proposed Rule 400(c)(1) would permit a funding portal that succeeds to and
continues the business of a registered funding portal to also succeed to the registration of the
predecessor on Form Funding Portal. As proposed in Rule 400(c)(1), the registration would
remain effective as the registration of the successor if the successor, within 30 days after such
succession, files a registration on Form Funding Portal and the predecessor files a withdrawal on
Form Funding Portal. 919 Proposed Rule 400(c)(1), therefore, would not apply where the
predecessor funding portal intends to continue to engage in funding portal activities.
In certain circumstances, proposed Rule 400(c)(2) would allow the successor to file an
amendment to the predecessor’s Form Funding Portal rather than requiring the successor and
predecessor, respectively, to follow the registration filing and withdrawal process under Rule
400(c)(1) described above. Specifically, proposed Rule 400(c)(2) provides that, if the succession
is based solely on a change of the predecessor’s date or state of incorporation, form of
organization or composition of a partnership, the successor may, within 30 days after the
succession, amend the notice registration of the predecessor on Form Funding Portal to reflect
these changes. Successions by amendment would be limited to those successions that resulted

919

Under the proposed rules, the registration of the predecessor funding portal would be deemed withdrawn 45
days after the notice registration on Form Funding Portal was filed by the successor. See proposed Rule
400(c)(1). A similar process exists for registered broker-dealers under Exchange Act Rule 15b1-3 (17 CFR
240.15b1-3).

247

from a formal change in the structure or legal status of the funding portal but did not result in a
change in control.
The instructions to the proposed Form Funding Portal would limit the term “successor” to
an entity that assumed or acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the predecessor
funding portal’s business.
We also proposed in Rule 400(d) to require a funding portal to promptly file a withdrawal
of registration on Form Funding Portal upon ceasing to operate as a funding portal. The
withdrawal would be effective on the later of 30 days after receipt by the Commission, after the
funding portal was no longer operational, or within a longer period of time consented to by the
funding portal or that the Commission, by order, determined as necessary or appropriate in the
public interest or for the protection of investors. 920
Proposed Rule 400(e) would provide that each application for registration, amendment
thereto, successor registration or withdrawal would be considered filed when a complete Form
Funding Portal was submitted with the Commission or its designee. Proposed Rule 400(e) also
would require duplicate originals of the application to be filed with surveillance personnel
designated by the registered national securities association of which the funding portal is a
member.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

We received some comments generally supporting the proposed registration method, 921
while one commenter generally opposed the proposed registration method, stating the
920

A similar process exists for registered broker-dealers under Exchange Act Section 15(b)(5) (15 U.S.C.
78o(b)(5)) and Rule 15b6-1 (17 CFR 240.15b6-1) thereunder.

921

See, e.g., Joinvestor Letter; DreamFunded Letter (favoring the proposed rules which provide a “high barrier
to entry” to funding portals, as it will “stop anyone from potentially creating a funding portal over a
weekend”).

248

Commission is requiring too stringent a registration process and financial overhead for funding
portals. 922 One commenter encouraged the Commission to require broker-dealers to register on
the same form as funding portals. 923
In the Proposing Release, we requested comments on whether we should impose other
restrictions or prohibitions on affiliations of the funding portal, such as affiliation with a registered
broker-dealer or registered transfer agent. Some commenters opposed the imposition of other
restrictions or prohibitions on affiliations of the funding portal. 924 One of these commenters
stated that affiliations and partnerships with brokers or transfer agents should be optional. 925
(3)

Final Rules

We are adopting Rule 400(a) – (e) generally as proposed with one change. We are
deleting from Rule 400(e) as proposed the language stating that Form Funding Portal may be filed
with a Commission designee, as we have determined not to designate this function. Rather, these
filings will be made through the EDGAR system as explained in more detail below.
Rule 400 establishes a streamlined registration process for a funding portal to register with
the Commission. We have considered the general comment suggesting that the registration
requirement for funding portals is too stringent and creates financial overhead. We believe,
however, that the rules as adopted provide a reasonable approach to funding portal registration –
they are based on broker-dealer registration requirements, which we believe have been effective in

922

See PeoplePowerFund Letter (suggesting that the Commission should consider, “a simple registration
detailing the owners and operators of a web portal, the legal domicile and registration contact information
etc. and the portals [sic] commitment to adherence of the rules of the [C]ommission”).

923

See RocketHub Letter. The commenter also stated that it has “a serious concern with [broker-dealers] having
an unfair advantage in the market, by already being regulated and registered with the Commission as well as
FINRA. Therefore, they may be able to service the market well ahead of [funding] [p]ortals.”

924

See, e.g., Joinvestor Letter; Tiny Cat Letter.

925

See Tiny Cat Letter.

249

providing investor protection and allowing the Commission to perform its oversight function. At
the same time, the registration requirement takes into account the more limited activities of
funding portals as compared to broker-dealers. As such, the registration requirements we are
imposing on funding portals are generally consistent with those imposed on broker-dealers, while
not as extensive in every aspect. As we note in Section III.B.5, we have considered the costs of
funding portal registration and believe that the anticipated costs to funding portals are justified in
light of the expected benefits investors will receive from utilizing funding portals that are subject
to registration requirements, which include public disclosure of registration information on Form
Funding Portal in EDGAR, as described in more detail in Section II.D.1.b below. We believe that
having such a registration system will promote investor confidence in this new and emerging
market, while providing us and FINRA (and any other applicable national securities association
registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 15A) with information integral to effective oversight.
Finally, consistent with the proposal, we are not imposing additional restrictions or
prohibitions on affiliations of the funding portal in the final rules. We note, however, that Form
Funding Portal, which will be publicly available, requires a funding portal to disclose information
about its control relationships and the disciplinary history of associated persons. 926

926

See Item 4 - Control Relationship of Form Funding Portal and Item 5 – Disclosure Information of Form
Funding Portal. “Control” is defined for the purposes of Form Funding Portal as “[t]he power, directly or
indirectly, to direct the management or policies of the funding portal, whether through contract, or
otherwise. A person is presumed to control a funding portal if that person: (1) is a director, general
partner or officer exercising executive responsibility (or has a similar status or functions); (2) directly or
indirectly has the right to vote 25 percent or more of a class of a voting security or has the power to sell or
direct the sale of 25 percent or more of a class of voting securities of the funding portal; or (3) in the case
of a partnership, has contributed, or has a right to receive, 25 percent or more of the capital of the funding
portal.” See Instructions to Form Funding Portal.

250

b.

Form Funding Portal
(1)

Proposed Rules

As noted above, proposed Rule 400(a) requires a funding portal seeking to register with
the Commission, through an initial application, to file a completed Form Funding Portal with the
Commission. As proposed, Rule 400(b) – (d) would have also required funding portals to use
proposed Form Funding Portal to amend any part of the funding portal’s most recent Form
Funding Portal, including certain successor registrations, or to withdraw from registration as a
funding portal with the Commission.927 We proposed to make a blank Form Funding Portal
available through the Commission’s website or such other electronic database, as determined by
the Commission in the future.
As proposed, Form Funding Portal appropriately considered the need to provide efficiency
in completing the form while requesting sufficient information from funding portals to allow for
effective regulatory oversight. The proposed form would have consisted of eight sections,
including items related to: identifying information, form of organization, successions, control
persons, disclosure information, non-securities related business, escrow, compensation
arrangements, and withdrawal. These items would require an applicant to provide certain basic
identifying and contact information concerning its business; list its direct owners and executives;
identify persons that directly or indirectly control the funding portal, control the management or
policies of the funding portal and persons the funding portal controls; and supply information
about its litigation and disciplinary history and the litigation and disciplinary history of its

927

As noted in Section II.D.1.a., a successor funding portal may amend the registration of its predecessor on
Form Funding Portal, within 30 days after succession, if the succession is based solely on a change of the
predecessor’s date of incorporation, state of incorporation, form of organization, or composition of a
partnership. Otherwise, a successor must file a registration statement on Form Funding portal within 30 days
after succession and a predecessor must file a withdrawal on Form Funding Portal. See Rule 400(c).

251

associated persons. 928 Under proposed Form Funding Portal, a funding portal would be able to
operate multiple website addresses under a single funding portal registration, provided the funding
portal disclosed on Form Funding Portal all the websites and names under which it did
business. 929 In addition, the proposed form would have required an applicant to describe any nonsecurities related business activities and supply information about its escrow arrangements,
compensation arrangements with issuers and fidelity bond.
Upon a filing to withdraw from registration, a funding portal would be required to provide
certain books and records information. In addition, as discussed in detail in Section II.D.1.d.
below, applicants that are incorporated in or organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside of
the United States or its territories, or whose principal place of business is not in the United States
or its territories, would have been required to complete Schedule C to Form Funding Portal, which
would require information about the applicant’s arrangements to have an agent for service of
process in the United States, as well as a certification and an opinion of counsel addressing the
ability of the applicant to provide the Commission and the national securities association of which
it is a member with prompt access to its books and records and to submit to onsite inspection and
examination by the Commission and the national securities association.

928

This information would be used to determine whether to approve an application for registration, to decide
whether to revoke registration, to place limitations on the applicant’s activities as a funding portal and to
identify potential problem areas on which to focus during examinations. If an applicant or its associated
person has a disciplinary history, then the applicant could be required to complete the appropriate Disclosure
Reporting Page (“DRP”), either Criminal, Regulatory, Civil Judicial, Bankruptcy, Bond or Judgment on
proposed Form Funding Portal.

929

See proposed Form Funding Portal, Item 1; 17 CFR 249.2000.

252

We also proposed that a person duly authorized to bind the funding portal be required to
sign Form Funding Portal in order to execute the documents. 930 As proposed, the funding portal
also would have been required to consent to service of process to its contact person on the form. 931
Finally, we proposed to make all current Forms Funding Portal, including amendments and
registration withdrawal requests, immediately accessible and searchable by the public, with the
exception of certain personally identifiable information or other information with significant
potential for misuse (including the contact employee’s direct phone number and e-mail address
and any IRS Employer Identification Number, social security number, date of birth, or any other
similar information). 932
(2)

Comments on Proposed Rules

We received one comment in support of using EDGAR for all funding portal filing and
registration requirements. 933 Some commenters also generally supported allowing a funding
portal to file one registration application to operate multiple websites. 934 One commenter,
however, expressed concern about allowing funding portals to file one registration form for
multiple websites. This commenter suggested the Commission “clearly address Portals that
930

See execution statement of proposed Form Funding Portal. We proposed requiring a person executing Form
Funding Portal and Schedule C (if applicable) to represent that the person has executed the form on behalf
of, and is duly authorized to bind, the funding portal; the information and statements contained in the form
and other information filed are current, true and complete; and if the person is filing an amendment, to the
extent that any information previously submitted is not amended, such information is currently accurate and
complete.

931

See execution statement of proposed Form Funding Portal. Specifically, we proposed requiring the funding
portal to consent that service of any civil action brought by, or notice of any proceeding before, the
Commission or any national securities association of which it is a member, in connection with the funding
portal’s investment-related business, may be given by registered or certified mail to the funding portal’s
contact person at the main address, or mailing address, on the form.

See Public Startup Letter 3.

934

See, e.g., Joinvestor Letter; Tiny Cat Letter (stating that requiring new applications for each website would
be unnecessary as it “would not provide any new information for either the commission or the public” so
long as the expansion involves no material changes to information in the initial application).

253

register with the Commission, and then subsequently license out or sell their registration.” 935 The
same commenter stated that “[s]ome entrepreneurs have indicated that they intend to operate a
‘parent’ funding [p]ortal, which allows other sites to operate under its umbrella, (leveraging the
parent’s systems, architecture, design, infrastructure, etc.).” 936
(3)

Final Rules

We are adopting Form Funding Portal generally as proposed, 937 with the following
changes:
•

The final rules amend Regulation S-T to permit a funding portal to file PDF
exhibits and attachments to Form Funding Portal on EDGAR as “official
filings.” 938

•

The following has been added to the title of the form: “Application or
Amendment to Application for Registration or Withdrawal from Registration as
Funding Portal” to clarify that the form will be used for all funding portal
registration applications, amendments and withdrawals;

•

Amendments to Form Funding Portal will require a narrative explaining the
amendment, which we believe will clarify to investors and potential investors the
particular information being amended by the funding portal in its filing;

935

RocketHub Letter.

936

Id.

937

We also made minor non-substantive technical changes and changes to increase the clarity of the information
being requested in the form.

938

See Rule 101(a)(1)(xviii) of Regulation S-T. As we noted in Section II.B.3, Regulation S-T generally allows
PDF documents to be filed only as unofficial copies. See Rule 104 of Regulation S-T. However, Rule 101
provides for certain exceptions to this restriction. The PDF documents must be in the format required by the
EDGAR Filer Manual, as defined in Rule 11 of Regulation S-T.

254

•

Form Funding Portal will not require information about fidelity bonds since we are
not adopting the fidelity bond requirement in the proposed rules; 939

•

Item 1 also will require information about website URL changes on the most
recent Form Funding Portal, title of the contact employee and the month the
applicant funding portal’s fiscal year ends;

•

The title of Item 4 is changed from “Control Persons,” as proposed, to “Control
Relationships,” as adopted, to clarify that Item 4 may capture information not
being captured in Schedules A and B;

•

The language in Item 5 “to determine whether to approve an application for
registration” has been deleted; 940

•

Item 7, as adopted, references “qualified third party arrangements” rather than
“escrow arrangements,” as proposed, to indicate that, in addition to holding the
funds in escrow, a qualified third party may also hold investor funds in an account
for the benefit of investors and the issuer; 941

•

“G – Other (general partner, trustee, or elected member)” has been added as an
ownership code in Schedule A;

•

Schedules A and B have been changed from the proposal to clarify that the
Schedules are collecting information about whether direct owners and executive
officers are “control” persons;

939

See Section II.D.1.c.

940

We note, however, that failure to answer a question in Item 5 will result in an incomplete application for
registration.

941

See Section II.C.5.e.

255

•

The language to Schedule C of Form Funding Portal has been changed to track
more closely the requirements of Rule 400(f) for nonresident funding portals and
to add an execution section for these entities; and

•

Withdrawal information for funding portals proposed to be collected under Item 8
will instead be collected in a new “Schedule D”. 942

We continue to believe that the information required by Form Funding Portal is important
for our oversight of funding portals and to allow us to assess a funding portal’s application for
registration and perform examinations of funding portals. We also note that the information
required by the Form will be available to investors and potential investors and will provide
transparency regarding intermediaries. Although we generally modeled Form Funding Portal on
Form BD, we have tailored the questions to the activities of funding portals. For example, Form
Funding Portal, in contrast to Form BD, does not include any questions about holding customer
funds and securities because funding portals are statutorily prohibited from holding or maintaining
customer funds or securities. We also included questions in Form Funding Portal to address
specific restrictions that are imposed upon funding portals but not upon broker-dealers. For
example, Form Funding Portal requires specific information about a funding portal’s qualified

942

There have been no substantive changes to the withdrawal information to be collected on Schedule D. The
instructions to Form Funding Portal have been modified from the proposal to (1) include IRS Tax
Identification Number and the contact employee’s fax number as information that will be redacted on Form
Funding Portal by the Commission and, therefore, not disseminated to the public by the form; and (2) inform
funding portals that they should manually redact certain personally identifiable information or other
information with significant potential for misuse (including the contact employee’s direct phone number, fax
number and e-mail address and any IRS Employer Identification Number, IRS Tax Identification Number,
social security number, or any other similar information) from any PDF attachments they file as part of their
Form Funding Portal submission due to privacy concerns. The instructions have also been modified to
amend the definition of SRO to delete the reference to Section 3 of the Exchange Act and clarify that the
phrase “any national securities association registered with the Commission” in the definition encompasses
any national securities association registered under Section 15A of the Exchange Act, in order to alleviate
any confusion by funding portals when completing the form.

256

third party arrangements because a funding portal is prohibited from holding and maintaining
customer funds.
In developing these requirements, we have taken into account that funding portals are
limited purpose brokers that are conditionally exempt from registration as broker-dealers, and
accordingly have sought to require appropriate information from these entities, while, at the same
time, not making the process of completing and filing the required form inappropriately
burdensome for funding portals.
As noted above, we proposed to make a blank Form Funding Portal available through our
website or another electronic database. At the time of the Proposing Release, we had not yet
determined the appropriate database through which to access and electronically file Form Funding
Portal. We requested comments in the Proposing Release on the type of web-based registration
that funding portals should use for accessing and filing Form Funding Portal, and as noted above,
received one comment in support of using EDGAR for funding portal filing and registration
requirements. 943 We have determined to require funding portals to access and file Form Funding
Portal through the Commission’s EDGAR system. Before a funding portal will be able to access
EDGAR and electronically file Form Funding Portal, it will have to obtain EDGAR access codes
and a central index key (“CIK”) by creating and submitting a Form ID with the Commission for
authorization to access EDGAR. The applicant will be required to fill out general user
information fields on Form ID, including filer type name, address, phone number, e-mail address,
organization name and employer identification number and file a signed, notarized version of the
document. To facilitate this process, we are amending Form ID to add “Funding Portal” as a filer
type and are also revising the instructions to the form to include the definition of “funding portal”
943

See Public Startup Letter 3.

257

(as defined by Rule 300(c)(2)). Once the application has been accepted by the Commission, the
funding portal will receive an e-mail with a CIK, which it can use (along with a passphrase that it
has previously created) to generate EDGAR access codes, and access the system and Form
Funding Portal.
As proposed, a funding portal will be required to check a box indicating the purpose for
which the funding portal was filing the form:
•

to register as a funding portal with the Commission, through an initial application;

•

to amend any part of the funding portal’s most recent Form Funding Portal,
including a successor registration; or

•

to withdraw from registration as a funding portal with the Commission.

The funding portal will receive an SEC file number after it files its Form Funding Portal
initial application, and thereafter must provide us that file number when submitting an amendment
or withdrawal from registration on Form Funding Portal. We will use this number to crossreference amendments and withdrawals to the original registration.
When a funding portal’s registration becomes effective, the information on Form Funding
Portal will be made available to the public through EDGAR, with the exception of certain
personally identifiable information or other information with significant potential for misuse
(including the contact employee’s direct phone number, fax number and e-mail address and any
IRS Employer Identification Number, IRS Tax Identification Number, social security number,
date of birth or any other similar information). In addition to current versions of Form Funding
Portal, investors and potential investors also will be able to access historical versions of a funding
portal’s filings on EDGAR. We believe that making these documents publicly available and

258

searchable will provide the public with information about the registration process and the funding
portal industry, thereby increasing transparency into this developing market.
The final rule permits a funding portal to operate multiple website addresses under a single
funding portal registration. As we noted in the Proposing Release, we believe that allowing a funding
portal to utilize more than one website address, if it chooses to do so, may allow the portal to minimize
its regulatory costs while having the flexibility to customize each website to fit its specific needs, such
as appealing to certain industries or investors. We have considered one commenter’s concern about

funding portals licensing or selling their registrations, and note that registrations are not
transferrable among entities; rather, each funding portal is required to register with the
Commission, pursuant to Rule 400(a). As explained above, an entity may succeed to and continue
the business of a registered funding portal, but the successor must file a registration on Form
Funding Portal within 30 days after any succession resulting in a change of control. 944
c.

Fidelity Bond
(1)

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 400(f) would have required that funding portals, as a condition of
registration, have in place, and thereafter maintain for the duration of such registration, a fidelity
bond that: (1) has a minimum coverage of $100,000; (2) covers any associated person of the
funding portal unless otherwise excepted in the rules set forth by FINRA or any other registered
national securities association of which it is a member; and (3) meets any other applicable
requirements set forth by FINRA or any other registered national securities association of which it
is a member. While fidelity bond coverage was not mandated by statute, the proposed
requirement was intended to help insure against the loss of investor funds that might occur if a
944

See Section II.D.1.a.

259

funding portal were to violate the express prohibition set forth in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(80)
on holding, managing, possessing or otherwise handling investor funds or securities.
(2)

Comments on Proposed Rule

We received comments both in support of, 945 and opposition to,946 the proposed
requirement for funding portals to maintain fidelity bonds. One commenter stated its view that a
fidelity bond may be necessary as a preventative measure to protect the interests of investors and
issuers. 947 Another commenter noted that although fidelity bond coverage may be “indirect” to
customers, they are protected under such coverage because the insured entity may recover its
losses due to theft or embezzlement by its employees and meet the obligations of its customers. 948
The same commenter, however, suggested that the Commission may find a surety bond more
appropriate in the crowdfunding context than a fidelity bond because investors would be able to
make a direct claim under it for losses due to a funding portal’s violation of the rules, and the
insurer would be able to seek indemnity for that amount from the funding portal. 949 One
commenter stated that it is not appropriate to require that the fidelity bond cover associated
persons, and that the requirement is a “hangover from a non-transparent financial services sector,”
unlike the transparent crowdfunding model. 950 Another commenter noted that a fidelity bond
would protect a funding portal from employee theft or embezzlement, and suggested that there is a
low risk of this occurring since a funding portal not does hold cash or customer funds. 951 The

commenter further stated that “[o]btaining a bond is simply one more expense that the portal must
incur and it is necessary to control compliance costs if crowdfunding is to be a success.” 952
(3)

Final Rules

After taking into account the comments and upon further consideration, we have
determined not to adopt a fidelity bond requirement for funding portals. We have been persuaded
by the comments that such a requirement may not be appropriate. We believe that the statutory
protections and prohibitions set forth in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(80) on holding, managing,
possessing or otherwise handling investor funds or securities provide substantial protections to
investors. We recognize, as some commenters observed, that there may be potential risks to
investors if a funding portal were to violate the prohibitions in Regulation Crowdfunding,
including the potential loss of investor funds. As we discussed in the Proposing Release, funding
portals will not be members of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”) and their
customers, therefore, will not receive SIPC protection. 953 Furthermore, consistent with the
proposed rules, the final rules also do not subject funding portals to minimum net capital
requirements. Despite these vulnerabilities, we note that the potential burden associated with the
requirement of a fidelity bond (or any bond) may not be justified by the benefits that could be
derived from requiring that a funding portal obtain such a bond. In particular, we are concerned
that a fidelity bond requirement could create a potential barrier to entry for some funding portals
that could be detrimental to our mission of capital formation, as well as the feasibility of
crowdfunding. At the same time, we are mindful of the potentially limited benefits of requiring
such bonds to be obtained by funding portals, when taking into account the statutory restrictions

261

on funding portals’ permissible activities. Instead, we believe at this time that the prohibition on a
funding portal from handling customer funds and securities as well as the general anti-fraud
provisions of our statutes and rules provide significant investor protections that do not need to be
supplemented by a fidelity bond requirement. This decision is consistent with our approach
generally to the regulation of funding portals in which we have sought to structure rules tailored to
the business of funding portals that address the risks posed by such activities while considering
the impact that our rules may have on this emerging market.

Requirements for Nonresident Funding Portals
(1)

Proposed Rules

Under proposed Rule 400(g), registration pursuant to Rule 400 of Regulation
Crowdfunding by a “nonresident funding portal” 954 would be first conditioned upon there being
an information sharing arrangement in place between the Commission and the competent
regulator in the jurisdiction under the laws of which the nonresident funding portal is organized or
where it has its principal place of business that is applicable to the nonresident funding portal.
The proposed rule would further require a nonresident funding portal registered or applying for
registration to: (1) obtain a written consent and power of attorney appointing an agent for service
of process in the United States (other than the Commission or a Commission member, official or
employee), upon whom may be served any process, pleadings, or other papers in any action; 955 (2)
furnish the Commission with the name and address of its agent for services of process on
Schedule C of Form Funding Portal; 956 and (3) certify on Schedule C of Form Funding Portal and
954

See proposed Rule 400(g)(1) of Regulation Crowdfunding (defining “nonresident funding portal” as “a
funding portal incorporated in or organized under the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the United States or
its territories, or having its principal place of business in any place not in the United States or its territories”).

955

See proposed Rule 400(g)(2)(i) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

956

See proposed Rule 400(g)(2)(ii) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

262

provide an opinion of counsel that it can, as a matter of law, provide the Commission and any
national securities association of which it is a member with prompt access to its books and records
and can, as a matter of law, submit to onsite inspection and examination by the Commission and
such national securities association. 957
Proposed Rule 400(g)(2)(iv) would require a registered nonresident funding portal to
promptly appoint a successor agent if it discharges its identified agent for service of process or if
its agent for service of process is unwilling or unable to accept service on its behalf. In addition,
proposed Rule 400(g)(2)(iii) would require a registered funding portal to promptly amend
Schedule C to its Form Funding Portal if its agent, or the agent’s name or address, changes.
Finally, proposed Rule 400(g)(2)(v) would require the registered nonresident funding portal to
maintain, as part of its books and records, the agreement with the agent for service of process for
at least three years after termination of the agreement.
In addition, we proposed in Rule 400(g)(3)(ii) to require a registered nonresident funding
portal to re-certify, on Schedule C to Form Funding Portal, within 90 days after any changes in the
legal or regulatory framework that would affect: (1) its ability to provide (or the manner in which
it provides) the Commission, or the national securities association of which it is a member, with
prompt access to its books and records; or (2) the ability of the Commission or the national
securities association to inspect and examine the nonresident funding portal. The re-certification
would be accompanied by a revised opinion of counsel describing how, as a matter of law, the
entity can continue to meet its obligations to provide the Commission and the national securities

957

See proposed Rule 400(g)(3)(i) of Regulation Crowdfunding. Exchange Act Section 3(h)(1)(C) permits us to
impose, as part of our authority to exempt funding portals from broker registration, “such other requirements
under [the Exchange Act] as the Commission determines appropriate.”

examination. 958

Comments on the Proposed Rule

One commenter stated its view that the definition of a nonresident funding portal will
create a competitive advantage for foreign intermediary platforms. 959 Another commenter stated
its view that nonresident funding portals should be subject to the same rules as domestic funding
portals. 960
In the Proposing Release, we requested comments about other actions or requirements that
could address our concern that the Commission and the applicable national securities association
be able to have direct access to books and records and be able to adequately examine and inspect
a nonresident funding portal, if it would be impossible or impractical for such funding portal to
obtain the required opinion of counsel. In response, a commenter suggested an arrangement
between a nonresident funding portal and a domestic funding portal in which the nonresident
funding portal would be required to make and keep current books and records, but the domestic

958

See proposed Rule 400(g)(3)(ii) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

959

See Public Startup Letter 3 (stating its view that the definition of nonresident funding portal is “flawed”
because it believes these foreign entities could choose to act as intermediaries for U.S. issuers and U.S.
investors in crowdfunding transactions without relying on Section 4(a)(6) and, therefore, gain a competitive
advantage by not having to comply with the requirements of the rules under Regulation Crowdfunding in the
same manner as domestic funding portals). But see Joinvestor Letter (stating its belief that “nonresident
funding portal is properly defined”).

960

See Wales Capital Letter 3. The commenter also recommended using the term “‘foreign’ funding portal” to
be consistent with the treatment of corporations incorporated in another jurisdiction under various state laws.
According to the commenter, a foreign corporation must file a notice of doing business in any state or nation
in which it does substantial regular business, and must name an “‘agent for acceptance of service’” in that
nation (or the Secretary of State as agent) to allow people doing business with a foreign corporation to be
able bring legal actions locally.

264

funding portal would have the ability to obtain and be responsible for the accuracy of such books
and records. 961
One commenter suggested that nonresident funding portals be required to clearly indicate
on their websites that they are organized and operating outside of the U.S. and indicate whether a
U.S. or non-U.S. bank will be used to process investors’ funds. 962 One commenter suggested that
a nonresident funding portal should be required to appoint a U.S. agent for all potential
proceedings, 963 while another commenter suggested that a nonresident funding portal should be
required to have a resident legal representative to handle any matters between issuers or investors
and the portal. 964

Final Rules

We are adopting Rule 400(g) as proposed with certain minor changes, and renumbering it
as Rule 400(f) due to the elimination of the fidelity bond requirement proposed as
subparagraph (f). 965 We are changing the language of the rule as adopted applicable to a
nonresident funding portal to:
•

Add the term “registered” to any references to national securities association in the
Rule to be more consistent with the terminology in the Exchange Act; and

•

Require the nonresident funding portal also to certify that it “will” provide the
Commission and any national securities association of which it “becomes” (rather

We also added “Inspections and Examinations” to the heading of Rule 400(f)(3); this modification does not
change the requirements from those proposed. In addition, we changed a cross-cite in the rule text to reflect
the renumbering.

265

than “is”) a member with prompt access to the books and records and “will” submit
to onsite inspection and examination by the Commission and such national
securities association. 966
As we noted in the Proposing Release, the rule aims to help ensure that we and any
applicable registered national securities association can access the books and records of, conduct
examinations and inspections of, and enforce U.S. laws and regulations with respect to, funding
portals that are not based in the United States, or that are subject to laws other than those of the
United States. We believe that these rules will further our goal of promoting the ability of the
Commission and any applicable national securities association to conduct effective regulatory
oversight of funding portals.
We have considered the comments and believe that the final rule appropriately takes into
consideration the need to provide more choices for U.S. issuers seeking to use intermediaries or
access investors outside of the United States, while meeting the challenges associated with
supervising, examining, and enforcing rules regarding activities of intermediaries based outside
the United States. For example, as we noted in the Proposing Release, the requirement for an
information sharing arrangement is designed to provide us with greater assurance that we will be
able to obtain information about a nonresident funding portal necessary for our oversight of the
funding portal. The ability to obtain information and secure the cooperation of the home country
regulator according to established practices and protocols is expected to help to address the
increased challenges that may arise from oversight of entities located outside of the United States.

966

The language in the proposed rule required a certification that the funding portal “can” meet such obligations
but did not require a certification that it “will” meet them.

266

We note that nonresident funding portals are subject to the same registration requirements as other
funding portals under Rule 400. 967
We have also considered the comment submitted in response to our question about the use
of books and records arrangements in situations where it would be impossible or impractical for a
nonresident funding portal to obtain the required opinion of counsel. 968 We have determined not
to adopt an alternative to the opinion of counsel requirement for nonresident funding portals in
Regulation Crowdfunding. The opinion of counsel requirement is consistent with our approach to
other nonresident registered entities and we believe it is an appropriate mechanism to use here, as
well. 969 As we stated in the Proposing Release, we believe that the certification and supporting
opinion of counsel requirements are important to confirm that each nonresident funding portal is
in a position to provide the Commission and FINRA (or the applicable national securities
association registered under Exchange Act Section 15A) with information that is necessary for us
and the national securities association to effectively fulfill regulatory oversight responsibilities. 970
We do not believe that the books and records arrangement suggested by the commenter would
provide assurance that we or FINRA would be able to consistently obtain such information, which
could hinder our ability to fulfill our regulatory oversight responsibilities.

967

We have considered the commenter’s view that there would be a potential competitive advantage for foreign
intermediaries choosing to operate outside of the Section 4(a)(6) exemption. See Public Startup Letter 3.
However, we note that any entities (foreign or domestic) intermediating offerings of securities between U.S.
issuers and investors generally will be broker-dealers, either required to register under the Exchange Act or
to be exempt from registration. See 15 U.S.C. 78o(a). We also note that the offer and sale of securities in
the United States or to U.S. persons must be registered unless an exemption is available.

968

See Wales Capital Letter 3.

969

We note that the opinion of counsel requirement is generally consistent with the requirement for nonresident
security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants, as well as those for nonresident
municipal advisors. See Exchange Act Rule 15Fb2-4 and Rule 15Ba1-6.

970

See Exchange Act Section 3(h)(1)(A). Failure to make this certification or re-certification or to provide an
opinion of counsel or revised opinion of counsel will result in an incomplete application for registration.

267

We have also considered the comment suggesting that a nonresident funding portal be
required to clearly indicate on its website that it is organized and operating outside of the United
States and whether it will use a U.S. or non-U.S. bank to process investors’ funds. 971 However, in
light of the other disclosure requirements we are adopting, we are not persuaded that such a
requirement is necessary. We note that the information required to be filed on Form Funding
Portal (and that will be publicly disclosed) will include information about the qualified third party
for the maintenance and transmission of investors’ funds under Rule 303(e), including the name
and address of the qualified third party. 972 In addition, a nonresident funding portal will be
required to publicly disclose information on Schedule C to Form Funding Portal. Since Schedule
C is required to be completed by nonresident funding portals only, investors will be able to
discern easily whether or not the entity is a nonresident funding portal and, among other things,
has certified (and provided an attached opinion of counsel indicating) that it is able to provide the
Commission and any national securities association prompt access to its books and records and
will submit to onsite inspection and examination by the same.
Finally, we have considered the comments suggesting that a nonresident funding portal
should be required to have a U.S. agent for potential proceedings, 973 or a resident legal
representative to handle any matters between issuers or investors, and the portal. 974 We note that,
as discussed above, we are requiring funding portals to execute a written consent and power of
attorney appointing an agent in the United States. The agent will be the representative of the
funding portal for service of any process, pleadings or other papers in any action to enforce the

268

Exchange Act, Securities Act or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder. As we noted
above, we have limited the types of actions for which a nonresident funding portal will be
required to have an agent for service of process, pleadings, or other papers in order to remain
generally consistent with recent requirements that we have imposed on other types of nonresident
entities. The funding portal will be required to disclose the name and address of its U.S. agent in
Schedule C to its Form Funding Portal, and amend the Schedule promptly upon any change to the
agent, agent’s name or agent’s address. We are not, however, requiring that nonresident funding
portals have a resident legal representative to handle any matters between the portal and issuers or
investors, which is consistent with our approach to other nonresident registered entities. 975

Exemption from Broker-Dealer Registration
a.

Proposed Rule

Exchange Act Section 3(h)(1), which was added by Section 304(a) of the JOBS Act,
directs the Commission by rule to exempt, conditionally or unconditionally, a registered funding
portal from the requirement to register as a broker or dealer under Exchange Act Section 15(a),
provided that the funding portal: (1) remains subject to the examination, enforcement and other
rulemaking authority of the Commission; (2) is a member of a registered national securities
association; and (3) is subject to other requirements that the Commission determines appropriate.
As explained earlier, the role contemplated by Title III of the JOBS Act for an entity
acting as an intermediary in a crowdfunding transaction would bring that entity within the

975

For example, we note that requiring a U.S. agent for service of process but not requiring a U.S. legal
representative to handle any matters between a funding portal and issuers or investors is generally consistent
with the requirements for nonresident security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap
participants, as well as those for nonresident municipal advisors. See Exchange Act Rule 15Fb2-4 and Rule
15Ba1-6.

269

definition of “broker” under Exchange Act Section 3(a)(4). 976 A funding portal would be
“effecting transactions in securities for the account of others” by, among other things, ensuring
that investors comply with the conditions of Securities Act Section 4A(a)(4) and (8), making the
securities available for purchase through the funding portal, and ensuring the proper transfer of
funds and securities as required by Securities Act Section 4A(a)(7). 977 In addition, a funding
portal’s receipt of compensation linked to the successful completion of the offering also would be
indicative of acting as a broker in connection with these transactions. Thus, absent an exemption
or exception, a funding portal would be required to register as a broker under the Exchange Act.
We proposed Rule 401(a) to provide an exemption for registered funding portals from the
broker registration requirements of Exchange Act Section 15(a)(1) in connection with its activities
as a funding portal. Consistent with the JOBS Act, the funding portal would remain subject to the
full range of our examination and enforcement authority, even though it is not registered as a
broker. 978 In this regard, proposed Rule 403 would require that a funding portal permit the
examination and inspection of all of its business and business operations that related to its
activities as a funding portal, such as its premises, systems, platforms and records, by
976

See Exchange Act Section 3(a)(4)(A) [15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(4)(A)] (defining “broker” as “any person engaged in
the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others”). An entity acting as an
intermediary in the offer and sale of securities pursuant to Section 4(a)(6), as contemplated in Title III of the
JOBS Act, would not come within the meaning of “dealer,” which is defined in Exchange Act Section
3(a)(5)(A) (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(4)(A)), because it would not be engaging in the business of buying and selling
securities for its own account. See also Exchange Act Section 15(a) [15 U.S.C. 15o(a)].

977

At the same time, there are statutory restrictions on the scope of services that a funding portal could provide.
See Section II.C.1 (discussing Exchange Act Section 3(a)(80)).

978

See Exchange Act Section 3(h)(1)(C). See also Securities Act Section 20 [15 U.S.C. 77t] and Exchange Act
Sections 21 and 21C [15 U.S.C. 78u and 78u-3]. In addition, we highlighted in the Proposing Release that
Exchange Act Sections 15(b)(4) and 15(b)(6) (15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(4) and 78o(b)(6)) apply to brokers
(including funding portals) regardless of whether or not they are registered with the Commission as brokers.
Exchange Act Section 15(b)(4) authorizes the Commission to bring administrative proceedings against a
broker when the broker violates the federal securities laws (and for other misconduct) and provides for the
imposition of sanctions, up to and including the revocation of a broker’s registration. Exchange Act Section
15(b)(6) provides similar enforcement authority against the persons associated with a broker, including
barring persons from associating with any Commission registrant.

270

representatives of the Commission and of the national securities association of which it is a
member. 979 Proposed Rule 404 also would impose certain recordkeeping requirements on funding
portals. 980
We had further proposed in Rule 401(b) that, notwithstanding the exemption from broker
registration, for purposes of Chapter X of Title 31 of the Code of Federal Regulations, a funding
portal would be a broker or dealer “required to be registered” with the Commission under the
Exchange Act, thereby requiring funding portals to comply with Chapter X, including certain antimoney laundering (“AML”) provisions thereunder. 981
b.

Comments on the Proposed Rule

Commenters generally agreed with the funding portal exemption from registration as a
broker-dealer. 982 One commenter stated that funding portals that provide no advice, make no
warranties as to the suitability of an investment and do not handle share transfers or money,
should not be required to register as a broker-dealer and requiring them to do so would provide no
benefit to the public. 983
One commenter stated that the exemption from broker-dealer registration actually
precludes funding portals from becoming members of FINRA, 984 and asserted that funding portals

as the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”)) [12. U.S.C. 1829b, 12 U.S.C. 1951-1959, 31 U.S.C. 5311-5330].

See Vann Letter (reasoning that, because a funding portal is “not registered as a ‘broker dealer,’” and
because “the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 states ‘A registered securities association shall deny
membership to any person who is not a registered broker or dealer,’” then funding portals cannot become
members of FINRA).

271

should not have to comply with the same requirements as broker-dealers for purposes of Chapter
X of Title 31 of the CFR. 985 Another commenter, however, stated that it “supports the
Commission’s interpretation of the exemption, and believes that AML compliance is
necessary.” 986
c.

Final Rules

We are adopting, as proposed, paragraph (a) under Rule 401, but renumbering it as Rule
401 as we not adopting proposed Rule 401(b). We note, however, that the exemption from broker
registration is applicable only to funding portals that are registered under Rule 400. Therefore, a
funding portal that ceases to be registered under Rule 400 will no longer be exempt from broker
registration under Rule 401. In response to the comment that this exemption precludes funding
portals from becoming members of FINRA, as we noted above, because a funding portal will be
engaged in the business of effecting securities transactions for the accounts of others through
crowdfunding, it will be a “broker” within the meaning of Section 3(a)(4) of the Exchange Act.
We also note that Exchange Act Section 3(h)(2) states that for purposes of sections 15(b)(8) and
15A, the term “broker or dealer” includes a funding portal and the term “registered broker or
dealer” includes a registered funding portal. Therefore, funding portals are explicitly permitted by
statute to become members of FINRA.
We are not, however, adopting proposed Rule 401(b). As described in more detail in
Section II.D.4.b. below, we have determined that the imposition of AML requirements on funding
portals should be addressed outside of the rules that we are adopting in this release.

Safe Harbor for Certain Activities

Under Exchange Act Section 3(a)(80), which was added by Section 304(b) of the JOBS
Act, a funding portal is defined as an intermediary that does not: (i) offer investment advice or
make recommendations; (ii) solicit purchases, sales or offers to buy the securities offered or
displayed on its platform or portal; (iii) compensate employees, agents or other persons for such
solicitation or based on the sale of securities displayed or referenced on its platform or portal; (iv)
hold, manage, possess or otherwise handle investor funds or securities; or (v) engage in such other
activities as the Commission, by rule, determines appropriate. As noted in the Proposing Release,
commenters have raised questions about the scope of permissible activities for funding portals
consistent with these prohibitions.987 To provide regulatory clarity, we proposed Rule 402, which
would provide a non-exclusive conditional safe harbor for funding portals under which certain
limited activities would be deemed consistent with the statutory prohibitions on funding portals.
The permissible activities in the proposed safe harbor involved: (i) limiting offerings on the
platform; (ii) highlighting and displaying offerings on the platform; (iii) providing communication
channels; (iv) providing search functions; (v) advising issuers; (vi) compensating others for
referring persons to the funding portal; (vii) paying or offering to pay compensation to registered
brokers or dealers; (viii) receiving compensation from a registered broker or dealer; (ix)
advertising the funding portal and offering; (x) denying access to, or cancelling, offerings due to
fraud or investor protection concerns; (xi) accepting investment commitments on behalf of the
issuer; (xii) directing the transmission of investor funds; and (xiii) directing a qualified third
party’s transmission of investor funds.

987

See Proposing Release, 78 FR 66484-66485.

273

Proposed Rule 402(a) also stated that no presumption shall arise that a funding portal has
violated the prohibitions under Section 3(a)(80) of the Exchange Act or Regulation Crowdfunding
by reason of the funding portal or its associated persons engaging in activities in connection with
the offer or sale of securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act that do not meet
the conditions specified in the safe harbor, and that the antifraud provisions and all other
applicable provisions of the federal securities laws continue to apply to the activities described in
the safe harbor.
Commenters strongly supported the idea of a safe harbor for funding portals, 988 but they
also suggested additional examples for the safe harbor. We are adopting the safe harbor in Rule
402 with certain changes as discussed further below. Each activity of the safe harbor is addressed
below.
a.

Limiting Offerings
(1)

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 402(b)(1) would permit a funding portal to apply objective criteria to limit
the securities offered in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act through the funding
portal’s platform where: (i) the criteria are reasonably designed to result in a broad selection of
issuers offering securities through the funding portal’s platform, are applied consistently to all
potential issuers and offerings and are clearly displayed on the funding portal’s platform; and (ii)
the criteria could include, among other things, the type of securities being offered (for example,
common stock, preferred stock or debt securities), the geographic location of the issuer and the
industry or business segment of the issuer, provided that a funding portal may not deny access to
988

See, e.g., CFIRA Letter 1; Joinvestor Letter; Merkley Letter (stating that the proposed safe harbor “strikes
the right balance”). But see Public Startup 3 Letter (stating that the safe harbor should cover any activity by
a funding portal not directly related to the sale of securities for the account of others).

274

an issuer based on the advisability of investing in the issuer or its offering, except to the extent
described in proposed Rule 402(b)(10) for fraud and investor protection concerns.
(2)

Comments on Proposed Rule

We received a significant number of comments on the ability of a funding portal to limit the
offerings on its platform. Many of these comments suggested a broader standard than the standard
that we proposed. Several commenters expressed concern that the proposed safe harbor placed
funding portals at a competitive disadvantage to registered brokers because it did not provide
funding portals with the flexibility to limit the offerings on their platforms, 989 even if they have
legitimate concerns about offerings aside from fraud or investor protection. 990 For example,
commenters suggested that a funding portal should be permitted to reject offerings based on
whatever factors the portal deems appropriate without automatically triggering regulation as a
broker-dealer, 991 especially if it deems the offering to have tangible shortcomings that could be
detrimental to investors or overly risky. 992
Commenters asserted that a funding portal’s ability to limit the offerings on its platform is
important for investor protection. They stated that funding portals should be permitted to screen
out clearly unprepared or ill-conceived offerings, 993 and should be permitted to limit offerings on

989

See, e.g., EMKF Letter; SBA Office of Advocacy Letter.

990

See, e.g., ABA Letter; CfPA Letter; CrowdCheck 2 Letter; Graves Letter; Seyfarth Letter (stating that “even
with a lower liability threshold, curation is an essential tool for investor protection”).

991

See, e.g., IAC Recommendation (suggesting that “[o]ne of the most cost-effective ways to reduce the risk of
serious compliance violations is to give crowdfunding intermediaries a free hand to reject any offering they
believe could pose an undue compliance or fraud risk”); see also CFIRA Letter 12 (agreeing with IAC’s
suggestion “that all intermediaries . . . should have greater latitude in their ability to curate offerings. . . . All
intermediaries (including non-BD portals) should be allowed to use their discretion as to whether or not any
particular offering is suitable for their service”). See also BetterInvesting Letter.

275

their platforms to issuers that are “crowdfund-ready.” 994 Commenters drew a distinction between
the permissibility of applying internal screening standards to limited offerings on the platform
versus the prohibition on providing investment advice or recommendations. 995 Some commenters
suggested that having a disclaimer that “curation” (or limiting offerings on a platform) does not
constitute a recommendation on the advisability of any investment displayed on the platform; 996
or that the funding portal does not advertise or make statements that the offerings listed on its
platform are safer or better investments than those listed on other platforms, 997 would mitigate
regulatory concerns. Some commenters also suggested that the criteria used to limit offerings
should be clearly displayed on a funding portal’s platform. 998
In addition, some commenters pointed to a tension in the statute under which a funding
portal is potentially subject to liability for material misstatements and omissions in the issuer’s
offering materials but, at the same time, may be limited in its ability to deny access to its
platform. 999 These commenters argued that it was not equitable for a funding portal to have such
liability if it cannot determine whether and under what circumstances to permit an issuer or
offering access to its platform.

In view of the comments, and upon further consideration, we are modifying Rule
402(b)(1) to expressly provide that a funding portal may, consistent with the prohibitions under

See SBEC Letter.

Exchange Act Section 3(a)(80) (including the prohibition against offering investment advice or
recommendations in Section 3(a)(80)(A)), determine whether and under what terms to allow an
issuer to offer and sell securities in reliance on Securities Act Section 4(a)(6) through its
platform. 1000
We agree with commenters that the ability of a funding portal to determine which issuers
may use its platform is important for the protection of investors, as well as to the viability of the
funding portal industry, and thus the crowdfunding market. We acknowledge the concerns raised
by commenters that the proposed rules could otherwise have unduly restricted a funding portal’s
ability to limit offerings conducted on its platform, and we are modifying the safe harbor
contained in Rule 402(b)(1) to address these concerns. Specifically, we are revising Rule
402(b)(1) to read that a funding portal may “[d]etermine whether and under what terms to allow
an issuer to offer and sell securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C.
77d(a)(6)) through its platform, provided that the funding portal otherwise complies with
Regulation Crowdfunding (§§ 227.100 et seq.).” The new language is designed to make it clear
that a funding portal may exercise its discretion, subject to the prohibition in the statute on
providing investment advice or recommendations, to limit the offerings and issuers that it allows
on its platform under the safe harbor, as long as it complies with all other provisions of Regulation
Crowdfunding.
In making this change, we recognize that the activities in which a funding portal may
engage are, by definition, far more limited than the activities in which a registered broker-dealer
may engage. At the same time, we believe that the JOBS Act established an important role for
1000

See also Rule 402(b) (limiting permissible activities to those consistent with the prohibitions under Exchange
Act Section 3(a)(80)). The discretion a funding portal has to limit offerings on its platform is in addition to
the requirement under Rule 301 to deny access, and cancel offerings, based on fraud and investor protection
concerns.

277

intermediaries, both broker-dealers and funding portals, to play in crowdfunding offerings. While
we are providing funding portals with broad discretion to determine whether and under what
circumstances to allow an issuer to offer and sell securities through its platform in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)), a funding portal must comply with all
applicable provisions of Regulation Crowdfunding, including the prohibition on providing
investment advice or recommendations. In this regard and as more fully discussed below, among
other things, a funding portal cannot advertise, make statements or otherwise represent that the
offerings listed on its platform are safer or better investments than those listed on other platforms.
Given this statutory restriction, we are not, as some commenters suggested, requiring a funding
portal to provide a disclaimer stating that limiting the offerings on its platform does not constitute
investment advice or a recommendation, nor are we requiring that its criteria for limiting offerings
on its platform be publicly displayed. We do not believe that requiring a funding portal to display
its criteria for limiting offerings on its platform will add significant investor protection. While a
funding portal may decide to make such criteria public, we caution that a funding portal must
avoid any appearance that it is giving investment advice or recommendations or that the funding
portal believes its offerings are investment worthy.
b.

Highlighting Issuers and Offerings
(1)

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 402(b)(2) would permit a funding portal to apply objective criteria to
highlight offerings on the funding portal’s platform where: (i) the criteria are reasonably designed
to highlight a broad selection of issuers offering securities through the funding portal’s platform,
are applied consistently to all issuers and offerings and are clearly displayed on the funding
portal’s platform; (ii) the criteria may include, among other things, the type of securities being
offered (for example, common stock, preferred stock or debt securities); the geographic location
278

of the issuer; the industry or business segment of the issuer; the number or amount of investment
commitments made, progress in meeting the issuer’s target offering amount or, if applicable, the
maximum offering amount; and the minimum or maximum investment amount; provided that a
funding portal may not highlight an issuer or offering based on the advisability of investing in the
issuer or its offering; and (iii) the funding portal does not receive special or additional
compensations for highlighting one or more issuers or offerings on its platform.
(2)

Comments on Proposed Rule

Several commenters suggested additional criteria for the safe harbor, including for
example: (i) how long the issuer has been operational or profitable; 1001 (ii) historical and projected
revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA); 1002 (iii) the
size of the issuer’s management team; 1003 (iv) relevant experience and length of experience of the
issuer’s management; 1004 (v) the type of corporate structure of the issuer; 1005 (vi) the stage and
operating history of the issuer; 1006 (vii) valuation methodology; 1007 (viii) results of securities and
background checks; 1008 (ix) “trending”; 1009 and (x) most money raised, soonest offering to close,
most money invested, least money invested, or on a purely random basis (so long as none of the
bases are value-driven – that is, which investment is a safer or better investment). 1010 Another

commenter questioned whether, under the safe harbor, funding portals would be permitted to
highlight offerings based on their discretion or the use of metrics, such as topic, media coverage,
or momentum. 1011 However, another commenter suggested that a funding portal should not have
discretion regarding which objective criteria it can use to highlight issuers or offerings because it
may result in the portal implicitly recommending securities. 1012 This commenter suggested that
the Commission should create a specific list of acceptable objective criteria that a funding portal
may apply. 1013

Several commenters stated that the criteria used to highlight offerings should be clearly
displayed on the platform. 1014 However, one commenter stated that algorithms should not be
required to be disclosed on the platform. 1015
Several commenters suggested that the safe harbor should include the ability of a funding
portal to provide mechanisms by which investors can rate an issuer or an offering, which then
could be highlighted on the platform. 1016 However, one of these commenters stated that any such
rating must be mathematical rather than value-driven or it would amount to “enticement.” 1017

Final Rules

After considering the comments, we are adopting Rule 402(b)(2) as proposed.
Specifically, Rule 402(b)(2) allows a funding portal to highlight particular issuers or offerings of
securities made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) on its platform based on objective criteria where the
criteria are reasonably designed to highlight a broad selection of issuers offering securities
through the funding portal’s platform, are applied consistently to all issuers and offerings and are
clearly displayed on the funding portal’s platform. Consistent with the proposal, the final rule
specifies in subparagraph (b)(2)(ii) that objective criteria may include, for example: the type of
securities being offered (e.g., common stock, preferred stock or debt securities); the geographic
location of the issuer; the industry or business segment of the issuer; the number or amount of
investment commitments made; the progress in meeting the target offering amount or, if
applicable, the maximum offering amount; and the minimum or maximum investment amount.
It is important to note that the criteria must be reasonably designed to highlight a broad
selection of issuers and offerings, so as not to recommend or implicitly endorse one issuer or
offering over another, and must be applied consistently to all potential issuers and offerings. 1018
This highlighting of issuers or offerings that have been admitted to a funding portal’s platform
can, depending on relevant facts and circumstances, involve providing investment advice that
violates the prohibition on a funding portal providing such advice. To that end, the rule provides a
safe harbor only when a funding portal is using objective criteria and such criteria are clearly
displayed on its platform to inform investors why certain issuers or offerings are being
highlighted. 1019 To reiterate, a funding portal may not highlight an issuer or offering based on the

1018

See Rule 402(b)(2) and (b)(2)(i).

1019

Id.

281

advisability of investing in the issuer or offering or give the impression that the funding portal is
providing an implicit (or explicit) recommendation on whether to invest in the issuer or offering.
To help prevent conflicts of interest and incentives for funding portals to favor certain
issuers over others, the final rule also prohibits a funding portal from receiving any special or
additional compensation for highlighting (or offering to highlight) one or more issuers or offerings
on its platform. 1020
Although some commenters suggested that we include additional criteria in subparagraph
(b)(2)(ii), we emphasize that the rule does not establish an exclusive list. The listed criteria are
intended as examples, and the safe harbor is non-exclusive. Crowdfunding is a new and evolving
market, and we believe that providing principles in the safe harbor by which a funding portal can
highlight offerings on its platform will provide it with the flexibility to adapt to the crowdfunding
market as it develops while maintaining investor protection. In this regard, the examples listed in
Rule 402(b)(2)(ii) are intended to provide guidance to funding portals as they develop their
platform and related tools.
Although we are not including additional criteria in Rule 402(b)(2)(ii) at this time, we
note that certain of the suggested highlighting criteria are covered by the criteria listed in the rule,
such as the issuer’s industry; the type of securities being offered; and the geographic location of
the issuer’s business. Others, while not listed in the final rule, we believe are based on objective
criteria, such as the amount of money being raised or size of the offering; soonest offering to
close; most or least money invested; how long the issuer has been operational or profitable; the
size of the management team of the issuer; the stage and operating history of the issuer; valuation

suggested by one commenter. See Earlyshares Letter.

282

methodology; “trending”; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
(EBITDA); and highlighting on a purely random basis. However, we caution that a funding portal
must be cognizant not to present highlighted issuers in a manner that, directly or implicitly, results
in the provision of investment advice or recommendations. 1021
c.

Providing Search Functions
(1)

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 402(b)(3) would permit a funding portal to provide search functions or
other tools that investors can use to search, sort, or categorize the offerings available through the
funding portal’s platform according to objective criteria where: (i) the objective criteria may
include, among other things, the type of securities being offered (for example, common stock,
preferred stock or debt securities); the geographic location of the issuer; the industry or business
segment of the issuer; the number or amount of investment commitments made, progress in
meeting the issuer’s target offering amount or, if applicable, the maximum offering amount; and
the minimum or maximum investment amount; and (ii) the objective criteria may not include,
among other things, the advisability of investing in the issuer or its offering, or an assessment of
any characteristic of the issuer, its business plan, its key management or risks associated with an
investment.
(2)

Comments on Proposed Rule

Several commenters suggested that the safe harbor be broadened to include additional
criteria. 1022 One commenter suggested that funding portals should be permitted to sort offerings
based on an algorithmic score that takes into account any objective numerical data that is
1021

For example, a funding portal may provide the EBITDA of an issuer but it cannot insinuate or state on its
platform that the EBITDA corresponds to the advisability of investing in an issuer.

1022

See, e.g., EMKF Letter; EquityNet Letter.

283

reasonably likely to correlate to successful investments, such as numeric ratings by accredited and
unaccredited investors, number of investment commitments weighted by investor portfolio
valuation, and number of page views. 1023 Another commenter stated that the use of the word
“assessment” in the proposed safe harbor 1024 is inappropriately vague when applied to technology,
as it could effectively prohibit the use of any computational sorting algorithm using objective
searching and sorting criteria. This commenter suggested that the word “assessment” be
substituted with the word “opinion,” and also that the term “objective criteria” be removed so that
the safe harbor would prohibit the use of subjective criteria – such as the advisability of investing
or an opinion of any characteristic of the issuer, its business plan, its key management or risks
associated with an investment – “generated exclusively by the portal,” excepting instances of peer
review and feedback generated by users. 1025
(3)

Final Rules

After considering comments, we are adopting Rule 402(b)(3) substantially as proposed.
The final rule permits a funding portal to provide search functions or other tools on its platform
that users could use to search, sort or categorize available offerings according to objective
criteria. 1026 The final rule also permits search functions that, for example, will allow an investor
to sort through offerings based on a combination of different criteria, such as by the percentage of
1023

See EMKF Letter.

1024

Rule 402(b)(3)(ii) states in part that the “objective criteria may not include . . . an assessment of any
characteristic of the issuer, its business plan, its key management or risks . . . .”

1025

See EquityNet Letter (noting that “[a]llowing investors the ability to sort through each other’s comments or
opinions becomes an integral part of any site where commenting is allowed on products” and that “[b]ecause
sorting comments would require a technological assessment of subjective data, we believe an explicit carve
out in the safe harbor provisions is necessary”).

1026

See Rule 402(b)(3) Regulation Crowdfunding. See also 158 CONG. REC. 2231 (daily ed. Mar. 29, 2012)
(statement of Sen. Scott Brown) (“Funding portals should be allowed to organize and sort information based
on certain criteria. This will make it easier for individuals to find the types of companies in which they can
potentially invest. This type of capability – commonly referred to as curation – should not constitute
investment advice.”).

284

the target offering amount that has been met, geographic proximity to the investor and number of
days remaining before the closing date of an offering. 1027 However, the final rule makes clear that
the search criteria may not include the advisability of investing in the issuer or its offering, or an
assessment of any characteristic of the issuer, its business plan, its management or risks associated
with an investment. In this regard, we are making minor changes from proposed Rule 402(b)(3)(i)
and (ii) by deleting the word “objective” in the final rules because the term is redundant to the
requirement in Rule 402(b)(3) that the criteria be “objective.” Further, we are persuaded by one
commenter’s observation that the use of the word objective in the subparts could be
misleading. 1028 The new sentence structure also makes Rule 402(b)(3) consistent with Rule
402(b)(2), which we believe provides additional clarity and consistency for funding portals when
complying with the rules.
Rule 402(b)(3) does not preclude the use of computational sorting algorithms using
objective searching and sorting criteria. 1029 However, a funding portal must take care not to
indicate that the platform’s search results or tools, directly or indirectly, correlate to successful
investments. Likewise, we believe that the more particular, biased or weighted a funding portal’s
algorithm or assessment is, the less likely the criteria as a whole will be objective. However, this
does not preclude a funding portal from permitting investors with access to its communication
channels from rating issuers or offerings (e.g., a star rating) on its platform or searching such
1027

See Rule 402(b)(3) of Regulation Crowdfunding. Rule 402(b)(3)(i) provides examples of search criteria that
are consistent with those listed in the Rule 402(b)(2)(ii) safe harbor for highlighting issuers and offerings.

1028

See EquityNet Letter. However, we do not agree with the commenter’s assertion that using the word
“assessment” in Rule 402(b)(3) equates to a prohibition on the use of computational sorting algorithms using
objective searching and sorting criteria because, in this context, assessment is used to refer to subjective
criteria.

1029

In response to one commenter’s suggestion that a funding portal should be permitted to use algorithmic
scores, the final rule does not preclude the use of algorithms as long as the criteria used by the algorithm are
objective. See EMKF Letter. Thus, a “score” based on an algorithm may be used as long as it does not
involve subjective criteria.

285

ratings, as long as a funding portal (including its associated persons, such as its employees) does
not participate in the rating process. 1030
d.

Providing Communication Channels
(1)

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 402(b)(4) would address the terms under which a funding portal could
provide communication channels by which investors can communicate with one another and with
representatives of the issuer through the funding portal’s platform about offerings conducted
through the platform, as required by Rule 303(c). Under the terms of Rule 402(b)(4) as proposed,
the safe harbor would apply so long as the funding portal (and its associated persons): (i) does not
participate in these communications, other than to establish guidelines for communication and
remove abusive or potentially fraudulent communications; (ii) permits public access to view the
discussions made in the communication channels; (iii) restricts posting of comments in the
communication channels to those persons who have opened an account on its platform; and (iv)
requires that any person posting a comment in the communication channels clearly disclose with
each posting whether he or she is a founder or an employee of an issuer engaging in promotional
activities on behalf of the issuer, or is otherwise compensated, whether in the past or
prospectively, to promote an issuer’s offering.
(2)

Comments on Proposed Rule

Several commenters supported permitting a funding portal to provide communication
channels on its platform through which investors can make comments, rate issuers and provide
other feedback, and through which issuers can respond to investor comments. 1031 One of these

1030

See Rule 402(b)(4)(i).

1031

See, e.g., CFIRA Letter 1; EquityNet Letter; Milken Institute Letter.

286

commenters stated that these capabilities could enable a funding portal to share with investors
information related to issuers, capital raised by an issuer, crowd investing, or the crowd-based
rating of specific issuers. 1032 Another commenter suggested that funding portals allow investors to
assign a quantifiable indicator to each other’s comments, so that users can search out the best and
worst of the comments and issuers have a chance to respond to investor comments in an open
forum. 1033 One commenter recommended that permission to rate issuers or offerings should only
be given to investors who actually invested in or committed to invest in the offering. 1034
(3)

Final Rules

We are adopting, as proposed, Rule 402(b)(4) to address the terms under which a funding
portal can provide communication channels by which investors can communicate with one
another and with representatives of the issuer through the funding portal’s platform about
offerings conducted through the platform, as required by Rule 303(c). 1035 The safe harbor
specifies that a funding portal (including its associated persons, such as its employees) may not
participate in these communications, other than to establish guidelines about communication and
to remove abusive or potentially fraudulent communications. Under Rule 402(b)(4), a funding
portal must make communication channels available to the general public and restrict the posting
of comments on those channels to those who have accounts on the funding portal’s platform. In
addition, the funding portal must require each person posting comments to disclose clearly with
each posting in the channel whether he or she is a founder or an employee of an issuer engaging in

promotional activities on behalf of the issuer, or is otherwise compensated or will receive any
compensation for promoting an issuer. 1036
We agree with commenters that investors should be permitted to communicate with one
other, and with representatives of the issuer, over communication channels on the platform
provided by the funding portal. 1037 The communication channel is meant to strengthen and foster
the ability of the crowd to communicate. We believe that the capabilities within the
communication channel will develop and evolve over time. For example, as noted above, a
communication channel may permit investors to rate or comment on an issuer or offering, or to
assign quantifiable indicators to one other’s comments. Also, a funding portal must make
communication channels available for viewing by the general public, and permit anyone who has
opened an account on its platform to post comments on the channel. 1038 As we stated in the
Proposing Release, requiring investors to have accounts with the funding portal before posting a
comment should provide a measure of control over these communications that could aid in
promoting accountability for comments made and help ensure that interested persons, such as
those associated with the issuer or receiving compensation to promote the issuer, are properly
identified.
We reiterate that while a funding portal must provide for a communication channel and
may develop certain features or tools as a part of that channel (such as a crowd-based rating
system), a funding portal (including its associated persons, such as its employees) may not engage

1036

See Rule 402(b)(4)(iv).

1037

As discussed in Section II.C.5, an issuer, its agents and promoters must identify themselves in all
communications through the communication channel.

1038

See Rule 402(b)(4)(i) and (ii).

288

or participate in such communications. 1039 In addition, a funding portal should consider whether
the tools or features of the communication channels it develops and the guidelines it establishes
for the channel would constitute the funding portal providing impermissible investment advice or
recommendations. For example, the funding portal may not establish a guideline that permits a
person to rate an offering only if the person provides a positive rating, or otherwise incentivizes
persons to give positive ratings. However, contrary to what one commenter suggested, we do not
believe a funding portal may limit the rating capability to those account holders who have made
investment commitments to the relevant offering. 1040 We believe that limiting ratings capability
to persons that invest in an offering is likely to skew the ratings, and therefore, we would view
such a limitation as inappropriate. Further, such a limitation could prevent persons with relevant
and important information about the investment from contributing their views to the crowd.
e.

Advising Issuers
(1)

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 402(b)(5) would permit a funding portal to advise an issuer about the
structure or content of the issuer’s offering, including assisting the issuer in preparing offering
documentation.
(2)

Final Rules

We did not receive any comments that specifically addressed the ability of a funding portal
to advise issuers and are adopting Rule 402(b)(5) as proposed. The rule permits a funding portal
to advise an issuer about the structure or content of the issuer’s offering, including preparing
offering documentation. We believe funding portals will be in a position to provide experience

1039

See Rule 402(b)(4)(i). See also Rule 303(c).

1040

See CFIRA Letter 1.

289

and assistance to issuers relatively efficiently, and should be able to leverage their expertise to
increase the viability of crowdfunding.
We believe that funding portals, as well as broker-dealers, should be permitted to provide
certain services to issuers to facilitate the offer and sale of securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6).
Without these services, crowdfunding as a method to raise capital might not be viable. Rule
404(b)(5) permits funding portals to advise an issuer about the structure and content of the issuer’s
offering in a number of ways. A funding portal can, for example, provide pre-drafted templates or
forms for an issuer to use in its offering that will help it comply with its proposed disclosure
obligations. Other examples of permissible assistance can include advice about the types of
securities the issuer can offer, the terms of those securities and the procedures and regulations
associated with crowdfunding.
f.

Paying for Referrals
(1)

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 402(b)(6) would permit a funding portal to compensate a third party for
referring a person to the funding portal, so long as the third party does not provide the funding
portal with personally identifiable information of any investor and the compensation, other than
that paid to a registered broker or dealer, is not based, directly or indirectly, on the purchase or
sale of a security in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act offered on or through the
funding portal’s platform.
(2)

Comment on Proposed Rule

One commenter requested clarification as to: (i) whether and when compensation paid to a
non-broker-dealer will be deemed improperly based on the purchase or sale of a security; (ii)
whether a funding portal may pay a registered broker-dealer a referral fee without a formal

290

agreement; and (iii) whether a funding portal may charge issuers fees based on the success of the
offering. 1041
(3)

Final Rules

We are adopting Rule 402(b)(6) as proposed. Rule 402(b)(6) permits a funding portal to
compensate a third party for referring a person to the funding portal if the third party does not
provide the funding portal with personally identifiable information about any investor and the
compensation, other than that paid to a registered broker or dealer, is not based, directly or
indirectly, on the purchase or sale of a security in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act
offered on or through the funding portal’s platform. We believe the safe harbor in this regard
addresses the prohibition in Rule 305 against an intermediary compensating any person for
providing the intermediary with the personally identifiable information of any investor in
securities offered and sold in reliance on Section 4(a)(6). We also believe that Rule 402(b)(6)’s
prohibition on funding portals paying transaction-based compensation to third parties, other than
that paid to a registered broker or dealer, will help to minimize the incentive for high-pressure
sales tactics and other abusive practices in this area. One commenter requested additional
guidance as to what types of compensation would equate to compensation based on the offer or
sale of a security. 1042 The Commission and courts have interpreted the definition of transactionbased compensation broadly, 1043 and whether compensation is transaction-based is a facts and
circumstances determination. Thus, we do not believe that additional guidance is necessary or
appropriate in this context.

Compensation Arrangements with Registered Broker-Dealers
(1)

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 402(b)(7) would permit a funding portal to pay or offer to pay any
compensation to a registered broker or dealer for services in connection with the offer or sale of
securities by the funding portal in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) of the Act, provided that: (i) such
services are provided pursuant to a written agreement between the funding portal and the
registered broker or dealer; (ii) such services and compensation are permitted under Regulation
Crowdfunding and are not otherwise prohibited under Rule 305; and (iii) such compensation
complies with and is not prohibited by the rules of any registered national securities association of
which the funding portal is required to be a member.
Proposed Rule 402(b)(8) would permit a funding portal to receive any compensation from
a registered broker or dealer for services provided by the funding portal in connection with the
offer or sale of securities by the funding portal in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) of the Act, provided
that: (i) such services are provided pursuant to a written agreement between the funding portal and
the registered broker or dealer; (ii) such compensation is permitted under Regulation
Crowdfunding; and (iii) such compensation complies with and is not prohibited by the rules of
any registered national securities association of which the funding portal is required to be a
member.

Comments on Proposed Rule

Several commenters expressed concerns about the permitted relationships between funding
portals and broker-dealers. 1044 One of these commenters stated that the proposed safe harbor is
“overly broad” and creates “unmanageable conflicts between funding portals and broker dealers,”
and suggested the Commission prevent these conflicts by prohibiting funding portals from paying
broker-dealers any type of compensation in connection with the offer or sale of securities under
the crowdfunding exemption. 1045 Another of these commenters suggested that the Commission
require relationships between funding portals and brokers to be arms-length and, if they are not,
require that the funding portal activity be operated by the broker-dealer entity. 1046
(3)

Final Rules

We are adopting Rule 402(b)(7) generally as proposed, but with minor modifications for
clarity and consistency. Rule 402(b)(7) specifies that a funding portal may pay or offer to pay
compensation to a registered broker or dealer for services, including for referring a person to the
funding portal, in connection with the offer or sale of securities by the funding portal in reliance
on Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act, provided that (i) such services are provided pursuant to a
written agreement between the funding portal and the registered broker or dealer; (ii) such
compensation is permitted under Regulation Crowdfunding; and (iii) such compensation complies
with the rules of any registered national securities association of which the funding portal is a
member. As discussed above, proposed Rule 402(b)(7) did not contain a reference to “referrals,”
while proposed Rule 402(b)(6) included the language “for referring a person to the funding

293

portal.” We have added a reference to “referrals pursuant to [Rule 402](b)(7)” to make clear that
all payment arrangements with a broker-dealer, including paying a broker-dealer for referrals as
permitted under subparagraph (b)(6), must be in writing.
Proposed Rule 402(b)(7)(ii) had also stated that “such compensation is permitted under
this part and is not otherwise prohibited under § 227.305”; and subparagraph (b)(7)(iii) stated
“such compensation complies with and is not prohibited by the rules of any registered national
securities association of which the funding portal is required to be a member.” We are deleting the
phrases “and is not otherwise prohibited under § 227.305” and “and is not prohibited by” to make
the language in Rule 402(b)(7) and Rule 402(b)(8) consistent, and because the phrases are
redundant. Also, we are deleting the phrase “required to be a member” and replacing it with “is a
member” in recognition of the fact that additional national securities associations may exist in the
future and that a funding portal would only have to be a member of one such association.
Consistent with Rule 402(b)(7), a funding portal may, for example, pay a broker-dealer for
certain services, such as information technology services, qualified third party services or referral
services, pursuant to a written agreement. Each party to this type of arrangement will need to
comply with all applicable regulations, including the rules of the registered national securities
association of which it is a member.
Similarly, we are adopting Rule 402(b)(8) as proposed with minor modifications. Rule
402(b)(8) permits a funding portal to provide services to, and receive compensation from, a
registered broker-dealer in connection with the funding portal’s offer or sale of securities in
reliance on Section 4(a)(6), provided that: (i) such services are provided pursuant to a written
agreement between the funding portal and the registered broker or dealer; (ii) such compensation
is permitted under Regulation Crowdfunding; and (iii) such compensation complies with the rules
294

of any registered national securities association of which the funding portal is a member. The
proposed rules had stated that “such compensation complies with and is not prohibited by the
rules of any registered national securities association of which the funding portal is required to be
a member.” For the reasons discussed above with regard to Rule 402(b)(7)(ii), we are deleting the
phrase “and is not prohibited” because it is redundant and deleting the phrase “required to be a
member” and replacing it with “is a member.”
Pursuant to Rule 402(b)(8), a funding portal may receive compensation, including
transaction-based compensation, from a broker-dealer for providing referrals to that broker-dealer
relating to an offering made pursuant to Section 4(a)(6). It is important to emphasize that the safe
harbor does not permit a funding portal to receive transaction-based compensation for referrals of
investors in other types of offerings, such as Rule 506 offerings, that are effected by a registered
broker-dealer. 1047 Further, these arrangements must be compliant with Rule 305, which prohibits,
with certain exceptions, an intermediary from compensating any person for providing the
intermediary with the personally identifiable information of any investor. 1048 As we stated in the
Proposing Release, the safe harbor is intended to facilitate intermediaries’ cooperation with each
other and promote the use of the Section 4(a)(6) exemption to raise capital, while maintaining a
written record of compensation payments.
We disagree with the commenter who suggested that Rules 402(b)(7) and (8) create an
unmanageable conflict between funding portals and broker-dealers. 1049 We believe that any
potential conflict of interest between broker-dealers and funding portals as a result of

1047

Receipt of transaction-based compensation in connection with such referrals can cause a funding portal to be
a broker required to register with us under Exchange Act Section 15(a)(1) (15 U.S.C. 78o(a)(1)).

compensation arrangements is mitigated due to the fact that both entities are registered with the
Commission and members of FINRA and because permissible activities under Rule 402(b)(7) and
(8) are limited by Regulation Crowdfunding. We also are not prohibiting a registered brokerdealer and a registered funding portal from being affiliated, nor are we requiring that any
crowdfunding operation be performed by the registered broker-dealer in such an affiliation. 1050
Because funding portals and broker-dealers are each registered with the Commission and required
to be members of a registered national securities association with the attendant rules and
oversight, we believe concerns about conflicts of interests among affiliated funding portals and
broker-dealers are sufficiently mitigated by this regulatory framework.
While a commenter questioned whether a funding portal may pay introducing brokers a
fee for referring persons to the funding portal without a formal written arrangement, 1051 we
emphasize that Rule 402(b)(7) requires all such arrangements to be in writing.

Advertising
(1)

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 402(b)(9) would permit a funding portal to advertise the existence of the
funding portal and identify one or more issuers or offerings available on the portal on the basis of
objective criteria, as long as: (i) the criteria are reasonably designed to identify a broad selection
of issuers offering securities through the funding portal’s platform and are applied consistently to
all potential issuers and offerings; (ii) the criteria may include, among other things, the type of
securities being offered (for example, common stock, preferred stock or debt securities); the
geographic location of the issuer; the industry or business segment of the issuer; the expressed

funding portals, so as to evade FINRA oversight as a broker-dealer).

interest by investors, as measured by number or amount of investment commitments made,
progress in meeting the issuer’s target offering amount or, if applicable, the maximum offering
amount; and the minimum or maximum investment amount; and (iii) the funding portal does not
receive special or additional compensation for identifying the issuer or offering in this manner.
(2)

Comments on Proposed Rule

Several commenters supported the proposed safe harbor on funding portal advertising. 1052
However, commenters were divided on whether funding portals should be permitted to advertise
current offerings and issuers in their advertisements. One commenter was supportive of allowing
funding portals to “advertise more generally, as well as highlight ongoing offerings through
various communication channels.” 1053 The same commenter stated that a portal’s decision to
feature or highlight issues available should not be viewed by the Commission as investment
advice, a recommendation, or a solicitation. 1054 This commenter nonetheless cautioned that
“[p]ortals should be barred from language that implicates the level of risk involved in the
investment or the overall quality of the investment opportunity” as well as “from soliciting
investments for any specific campaign by providing offering details outside of the Portal
itself.” 1055 Another commentator expressed opposition to “a limitation on the funding portal to
only advertise its past offerings,” stating that such a limitation “would be overly restrictive.” 1056
In contrast, one commenter stated that, while funding portals should be allowed to
advertise, funding portals should not be able to display specific issuers in their advertising

materials. 1057 This commenter stated that “[t]he concern with displaying individual issuers is that
investors will interpret this as a recommendation and endorsement of the issuer.” 1058 The
commenter noted that the prohibition on providing recommendations can be easily circumvented
by manipulating otherwise seemingly objective criteria, and that funding portals could advertise
offerings based on certain criteria, such as high target offerings, that may generate more money
for the funding portal (i.e., a funding portal can mask self-interest by using objective criteria). 1059
This same commenter suggested that the Commission could allow descriptions of the portals
themselves and the specific business segments featured on their websites, without mentioning
specific issuers currently registered with the portal. 1060
One commenter suggested the Commission clarify that it would be inappropriate for a
funding portal to send out soliciting e-mails recommending investment in particular companies to
investors who have signed up with that portal. 1061 Another commenter stated that a funding portal
should not be permitted to advertise or otherwise make statements that offerings listed are
somehow safer or better than other platforms. 1062
(3)

Final Rules

We are adopting Rule 402(b)(9) as proposed. Rule 402(b)(9) permits a funding portal to
advertise its existence and identify one or more issuers or offerings available on the portal on the
basis of objective criteria, as long as: (i) the criteria are reasonably designed to identify a broad
selection of issuers offering securities through the funding portal’s platform and are applied

consistently to all potential issuers and offerings; (ii) the criteria may include, among other things,
the type of securities being offered (for example, common stock, preferred stock or debt
securities); the geographic location of the issuer; the industry or business segment of the issuer;
the expressed interest by investors, as measured by number or amount of investment commitments
made, progress in meeting the issuer’s target offering amount or, if applicable, the maximum
offering amount; and the minimum or maximum investment amount; and (iii) the funding portal
does not receive special or additional compensation for identifying the issuer or offering in this
manner. However, a funding portal may not base its decision as to which issuers to include in its
advertisements on whether it has a financial interest in the issuer,, and any advertising may not
directly or indirectly favor issuers in which the funding portal has invested or will invest.
After considering the comment letters, we believe that the requirements of the safe harbor,
including the requirement for objective criteria designed to result in a broad selection of
highlighted issuers or offerings, will result in advertisements that are focused on the funding
portal itself, as opposed to recommending a particular offering or offerings. 1063 Funding portals
continue to be subject to the statutory prohibition on providing investment advice and
recommendations. 1064 An advertisement by a funding portal must not be an implicit (or explicit)
recommendation as to whether to invest in the issuer or offering or advice on the advisability of
investing in the issuer or offering. Therefore, consistent with the views of one commenter, a
funding portal may not advertise in such a way that expresses the funding portal’s view that, for

1063

The safe harbor is limited to identifying one or more issuers. More detailed information about an issuer
should be provided on the funding portal’s platform.

1064

See Exchange Act Section 3(a)(80)(A).

299

example, certain offerings on its platform are of a higher quality, safer or more worthy than
others, or that otherwise gives a recommendation. 1065
We recognize that advertisements can take many varied forms, including non-traditional
means, such as blogs, e-mails through social media or other methods. We believe that these types
of communications, when made by a funding portal to investors can be a permissible means of
advertising within the scope of Rule 402(b)(9). We agree, however, with a commenter’s
statement that it would be inconsistent with the statutory prohibition on providing investment
advice or recommendations for a funding portal to send out soliciting e-mails recommending
investments in particular companies as part of its advertising. 1066
i.

Deny Access to Platform
(1)

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 402(b)(10) would permit a funding portal to deny access to its platform to,
or cancel an offering of, an issuer that the funding portal believes may present the potential for
fraud or otherwise raises investor protection concerns.
(2)

Comments on Proposed Rule

Some commenters asserted that the proposed rules are ambiguous, and that the lack of
specificity exposes funding portals to potential liability. The commenters were concerned that the
perceived lack of specificity may also lead funding portals to unintentionally violate the ban on
providing investment advice with their attempts to mitigate liability. 1067

See, e.g., RocketHub Letter and Seyfarth Letter.

300

(3)

Final Rules

We are adopting Rule 402(b)(10) substantially as proposed with modifications to make it
consistent with Rule 301(c)(2), which requires an intermediary to deny access if it has a
reasonable basis for believing that the issuer or the offering presents the potential for fraud or
otherwise raises concerns about investor protection. 1068 In satisfying this requirement, an
intermediary must deny access if it reasonably believes that it is unable to adequately or
effectively assess the risk of fraud of the issuer or its potential offering. In addition, if an
intermediary becomes aware of information after it has granted access that causes it to reasonably
believe that the issuer or the offering presents the potential for fraud or otherwise raises concerns
about investor protection, the intermediary must promptly remove the offering from its platform,
cancel the offering, and return (or, for funding portals, direct the return of) any funds that have
been committed by investors in the offering. Rule 402(b)(10) requires a funding portal to deny
access to its platform to, or cancel an offering of an issuer, pursuant to Rule 301(c)(2), if the
funding portal has a reasonable basis for believing that the issuer or the offering presents the
potential for fraud or otherwise raises concerns.
We changed the standard in Rule 402(b)(10) to a “reasonable basis for believing” – rather
than “believes” – to conform the safe harbor to the requirements of Rule 301(c)(2) as adopted.
Thus, the standard in Rule 402(b)(10) is consistent with the modifications that we made to the
standard in Rule 301(c)(2). 1069 We believe this change also should help to address commenters’
concerns about the perceived lack of specificity in the proposed safe harbor by providing an
objective “reasonable belief” standard for the required determinations. Under this standard a

1068

See Section II.C.3 discussing the change to Rule 301(c) to include a “reasonable basis” standard.

1069

See Section II.C.3.

301

funding portal may not ignore facts about an issuer that indicate fraud or investor protection
concerns such that a reasonable person would have denied access to the platform. At the same
time, a funding portal can also feel assured in its decision to deny an issuer access or cancel an
offering if it has a reasonable basis for such a determination. We also believe that including a
“reasonable basis” standard adds objectivity to a funding portal’s determinations regarding which
issuers must be denied access to (or removed from) its platform, which is expected to help to
address concerns regarding the clarity of the standard under the proposed rule.
j.

Accepting Investor Commitments
(1)

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 402(b)(11) would permit a funding portal to accept, on behalf of an issuer,
an investment commitment for securities offered in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities
Act by that issuer on the funding portal’s platform.
(2)

Comments on Proposed Rule

One commenter noted that the statute prohibits funding portals from handling investor
funds or securities, and that the proposed rule requiring the use of third-party entities would create
additional transaction costs for funding portals. 1070 Another commenter stated that the safe harbor
for accepting investor commitments should permit a funding portal to assist issuers in handling a
direct registration system (DRS) between issuers and investors. 1071

1070

See Stephenson, et al., Letter.

1071

See RocketHub (suggesting that a portal should be permitted to provide DRS support to issuers and
investors). A DRS allows investors to transfer a security that is registered in the investor’s name on the
issuer’s books, and either the company or its transfer agent holds the security for the investor in book-entry
form.

302

(3)

Final Rules

We are adopting Rule 402(b)(11) as proposed. Rule 402(b)(11) permits a funding portal,
on behalf of an issuer, to accept investment commitments from investors for securities offered in
reliance on Section 4(a)(6) by that issuer on the funding portal’s platform. We are not broadening
the safe harbor to permit funding portals to handle customer funds, as suggested by one
commenter. Although we recognize that the requirement to use a third party entity to handle
customer funds imposes an additional expense on a funding portal, Exchange Act Section
3(a)(80)(D) explicitly prohibits funding portals from handling customer funds and securities.
Similarly, we believe it would be inconsistent with the statute for a funding portal to facilitate a
securities registration system for issuers and investors because such activity implicitly requires
funding portals to handle customer funds and securities, which is prohibited by the statute. In this
regard, we note that the activities that a funding portal is permitted to engage in are limited in
scope, and as such are subject to a more limited regulatory scheme as compared to registered
broker-dealers.
k.

Directing Transmission of Funds
(1)

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 402(b)(12) would permit a funding portal to direct investors where to
transmit funds or remit payment in connection with the purchase of securities offered and sold in
reliance on Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act.
Proposed Rule 402(b)(13) would permit a funding portal to direct a qualified third party,
as required by Rule 303(e), to release proceeds to an issuer upon completion of a crowdfunding
offering or to return proceeds to investors in the event an investment commitment or an offering is
cancelled.

303

(2)

Final Rules

We did not receive comments on the ability of a funding portal to direct investment funds
and are adopting Rules 402(b)(12) and (13) as proposed. Rules 402(b)(12) and (13) provide that a
funding portal can fulfill its obligations with respect to the maintenance and transmission of funds
and securities, as set forth in Rule 303, without violating the prohibition in Exchange Act Section
3(a)(80)(D). Specifically, a funding portal can direct investors where to transmit funds or remit
payment in connection with the purchase of securities offered and sold in reliance on Section
4(a)(6), 1072 and as required by Rule 303(e), a funding portal can direct a qualified third party to
release the proceeds of an offering to the issuer upon completion of the offering or to return
investor proceeds when an investment commitment or offering is cancelled. 1073
l.

Posting News

In the Proposing Release, we asked whether we should adopt a safe harbor that permits a
funding portal to post news, such as market news and news about a particular issuer or industry,
on its platform. In response to our request for comment, some commenters stated that the safe
harbor should permit funding portals to post third party news related to issuers or offerings on
their platform. 1074 One commenter cautioned that objective criteria should be used to ensure, for
example, that funding portals are not picking out the most flattering or positive news. 1075 Another
commenter suggested that funding portals should be aware of the content of materials posted on
their portal and held responsible for inappropriate information that is posted. 1076

1072

See Rule 402(b)(12) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

1075

See CFIRA Letter 1.

1076

See RoC Letter.

304

While we believe it is possible for funding portals to post news on their platforms in a
manner that would not violate the prohibitions in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(80), we are not
including such activities within the safe harbor because we believe the permissibility of posting
news should be a facts and circumstances determination. When posting news, funding portals will
need to ensure that they do not violate the prohibition on giving investment advice and
recommendations. For example, if a funding portal selectively determines which news articles to
post or posts only flattering or positive news, then the funding portal is more likely to be giving
impermissible investment advice or recommendations.
m.

No Presumption and Anti-Fraud Provisions
(1)

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 402(a) also stated that no presumption shall arise that a funding portal has
violated the prohibitions under Section 3(a)(80) of the Exchange Act or Regulation Crowdfunding
by reason of the funding portal or its associated persons engaging in activities in connection with
the offer or sale of securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act that do not meet
the conditions specified in the safe harbor and that the antifraud provisions and all other
applicable provisions of the federal securities laws continue to apply to the activities described in
the safe harbor.
(2)

Final Rules

We did not receive any comments on the proposed “no presumption” and anti-fraud
provisions and are adopting Rule 402(a) as proposed. We also reiterate that Rule 402(b) is a nonexclusive safe harbor. Rule 402(a) expressly provides that the failure of a funding portal to meet
the conditions of the safe harbor does not give rise to a presumption that the funding portal is in

305

violation of the statutory prohibitions of Exchange Act Section 3(a)(80) or Regulation
Crowdfunding. 1077
Further, the safe harbor under Rule 402 does not prohibit funding portals from engaging
third party service providers to assist the funding portal in operating its platform, such as
providers of software, website maintenance and development, communication channel
applications, recordkeeping systems, and other technology. 1078 However, the funding portal
remains responsible for its activities and the operation of its platform and for compliance with
Regulation Crowdfunding and other applicable federal securities laws.
4.

Compliance
a.

Policies and Procedures
(1)

Proposed Rule

As proposed, Rule 403(a) would require a funding portal to implement written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the federal securities laws and the
rules and regulations thereunder, relating to its business as a funding portal. 1079
(2)

Comments on the Proposed Rules

One commenter agreed that the Commission should not specify requirements for a funding
portal’s policies and procedures, while another commenter thought the Commission should
provide guidance concerning the policies and procedures. 1080 Another commenter suggested that

1077

See Rule 402(a) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

1078

One commenter asked whether funding portals could engage third party service providers consistent with
Regulation Crowdfunding. See CFIRA Letter 1.

1079

As a condition to exempting funding portals from the requirement to register as a broker or a dealer under
Exchange Act Section 15(a)(1) (15 U.S.C. 78o(a)(1)), Exchange Act Section 3(h)(1)(C) provides that
registered funding portals must comply with such other requirements as the Commission determines
appropriate.

1080

See ASSOB Letter; Consumer Federation of America (“[The Commission] fails to address at all the

306

all changes to a funding portal’s policies and procedures should be disclosed within 30 days and
publicly announced. 1081 Yet another commenter suggested requiring the SRO to mandate that
broker-dealers and funding portals follow the same policies. 1082
(3)

Final Rules

We are adopting Rule 403(a) as proposed. We believe that the requirement to implement
written policies and procedures will provide important investor protections as it will necessitate
that funding portals remain aware of the various regulatory requirements to which they are subject
and take appropriate steps for complying with such requirements. We recognize, however, that
funding portals may have various business models and, therefore, consistent with the views of one
commenter, we are not imposing specific requirements for a funding portal’s policies and
procedures, provided the policies and procedures are reasonably designed to achieve compliance
with the federal securities laws and the rules relating to their business as funding portals. Rather,
we are providing a funding portal with discretion to establish, implement, maintain and enforce its
policies and procedures based on its relevant facts and circumstances.
We note, however, that a funding portal may rely on the representations of others when
meeting certain requirements under Regulation Crowdfunding, unless the funding portal has
reason to question the reliability of those representations. For example, a funding portal may rely
on an issuer’s representation to establish a reasonable basis for believing that an issuer seeking to
offer and sell securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) through its platform complies with the
requirements in Securities Act Section 4A(b) and the related requirements in Regulation

areas that should be covered by such policies and procedures, or what a funding portal’s responsibilities to
monitor compliance would be.”).
1081

See Joinvestor Letter.

1082

See Rockethub Letter.

307

Crowdfunding, unless the funding portal has reason to question the reliability of that
representation. 1083 A funding portal may also rely on an investor’s representation to establish a
reasonable basis for believing that an investor satisfies the investment limits established by
Section 4(a)(6)(B), unless the funding portal has reason to question the reliability of that
representation. 1084 We believe that when a funding portal relies on the representations of others to
form a reasonable basis, the funding portal should have policies and procedures regarding under
what circumstances it can reasonably rely on such representations and when additional
investigative steps may be appropriate. We further believe that a funding portal’s policies and
procedures should cover not only permitted activities, but also address prohibited activities. For
example, a funding portal should have policies and procedures on the criteria used to limit,
highlight and advertise issuers and offerings.
We note one commenter’s suggestion that we require funding portals to update their
policies and procedures to reflect changes in applicable rules and regulations within a specified
time period after the change occurs. However, as explained in the Proposing Release, we believe
that the requirement for reasonably designed policies and procedures includes an ongoing
obligation for a funding portal to promptly update its policies and procedures if necessary to
reflect changes in applicable rules and regulations, a funding portal’s business practices, and/or
the marketplace. 1085 Finally, in response to one commenter’s suggestion that we require SROs to
mandate that broker-dealers and funding portals follow the same policies, as noted above, we
believe that funding portals should have flexibility to implement policies and procedures suited to

1083

See Rule 301(a).

1084

See Rule 303(b)(1).

1085

Consistent with our requirements for broker-dealers, we are not requiring that a funding portal’s policies and
procedures be made public, as suggested by a commenter.

308

their own facts and circumstances. Moreover, we note that any proposed SRO rules relating to
policies and procedures of either broker-dealers or funding portals will be subject to the Exchange
Act Section 19(b) SRO rule filing process. 1086
Commission staff expects to review intermediaries’ compliance policies and procedures
relating to their activities in connection with the offer or sale of securities in reliance on Section
4(a)(6) during the study of the federal crowdfunding exemption that it plans to undertake no later
than three years following the effective date of Regulation Crowdfunding. 1087
b.

Anti-Money Laundering
(1)

Proposed Rule

Proposed Rule 403(b) would require that funding portals comply with certain AML
provisions, 1088 as set forth in Chapter X of Title 31 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The BSA
and its implementing regulations establish the basic framework for AML obligations imposed on
financial institutions. 1089 The BSA is intended to facilitate the prevention, detection and
prosecution of money laundering, terrorist financing and other financial crimes.
Among other things, the BSA and its implementing regulations require a “broker or dealer
in securities” (sometimes referred to in the regulations as a “broker-dealer”) to: (1) establish and
maintain an effective AML program; 1090 (2) establish and maintain a Customer Identification
Program; 1091 (3) monitor for and file reports of suspicious activity (SARs); 1092 and (4) comply

1086

Pursuant to Exchange Act Section 19(b) and Rule 19b-4, SROs are required to file proposed new rules and
rule changes with the Commission.

1087

See Section II.

1088

See also Section II.D.2. (discussing proposed Rule 401(b)).

1089

See BSA, note 981; 31 CFR Chapter X.

1091

See 31 CFR 1023.220.

309

with requests for information from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”). 1093
For purposes of the BSA obligations, a “broker or dealer in securities” is defined as a “broker or
dealer in securities, registered or required to be registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except persons who register pursuant to
[S]ection 15(b)(11) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.” 1094 As explained above, Exchange
Act Section 3(h) expressly directs the Commission, conditionally or unconditionally, to exempt
funding portals from the requirement to register as a broker or dealer under Section 15(a). As
such, a funding portal is not a broker “registered or required to be registered” if it registers as a
funding portal with the Commission. We proposed that, notwithstanding this exemption from
broker registration, under Rule 401(b) a funding portal would be “required to be registered” as a
broker or dealer with the Commission under the Exchange Act solely for purposes of Chapter X of
Title 31 of the Code of Federal Regulations, thus subjecting funding portals to the AML
requirements of Chapter X of Title 31.
(2)

Comments on the Proposed Rule

A few commenters generally suggested that since funding portals are prohibited from
handling customer funds and securities they should not be required to comply with AML
provisions. 1095 Some commenters, however, generally supported requiring funding portals to

1092

See 31 CFR 1023.320. See also FINRA Rule 3310.

1093

See 31 CFR 1010.520.

1094

See 31 CFR 1010.100(h). As noted above, certain FinCEN regulations apply to a “broker-dealer,” which is
defined as a “person registered or required to be registered as a broker or dealer with the Commission under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.), except persons who register pursuant to 15
U.S.C. 78o(b)(11).” 31 CFR 1023.100(b). Such broker-dealers also would meet the definition of “broker or
dealers in securities” above.

310

comply with AML provisions. 1096 One commenter, noting that non-U.S. investors may participate
in crowdfunding and use U.S.-based funding portals, requested that the Commission provide
advice and suggestions on “how to prevent anti-money laundering.” 1097
(3)

Final Rules

Upon further consideration, we have determined not to adopt proposed Rule 403(b). The
BSA requirements play a critical role in detecting, preventing, and reporting money laundering
and other illicit financing, such as market manipulation and fraud. However, after careful
consideration, we believe that AML obligations for funding portals are better addressed outside of
the rules that we are currently adopting in this release, and that it would be more appropriate to
work with other regulators to develop consistent and effective AML obligations for funding
portals. 1098 We note, however, that broker-dealers continue to have their own AML obligations,
as do certain other parties involved in transactions conducted pursuant to Section 4(a)(6), such as
a bank acting as a qualified third party to hold investor funds.

1096

See RocketHub Letter (stating that it “supports the Commissions [sic] interpretation of the exemption, and
believes that AML compliance is necessary”); Berlingeri Letter (supporting funding portal “compliance with
existing anti-money laundering provisions and the requirement to report suspicious activity”).

1097

See Zhang Letter.

1098

FinCEN within the Department of Treasury has primary regulatory responsibility for administering the BSA.
We note that FinCEN has included in the Unified Agenda and Regulatory Plan an item that states:
“FinCEN…is proposing amendments to the regulatory definitions of ‘broker or dealer in securities’ under
the regulations implementing the Bank Secrecy Act. The proposed changes are intended to expand the
current scope of the definitions to include funding portals. In addition, these amendments would require
funding portals to implement policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with all of
the Bank Secrecy Act requirements that are currently applicable to brokers or dealers in securities.” See
Office of Mgmt. & Budget, Exec. Office of the President, Office of Info. & Regulatory Affairs, Amendments
of the Definition of Broker or Dealer in Securities, RIN 1506-AB29, available at
http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=201504&RIN=1506-AB29. In addition, the
Commission has adopted its own rules that require broker-dealers to comply with certain requirements of the
BSA’s implementing regulations, such as books and records requirements. See Exchange Act Rule 17a-8.
See also Section II.D.5.

311

c.

Privacy
(1)

Proposed Rule

Section 4A(a)(9) of the Securities Act requires intermediaries to take such steps to protect
the privacy of information collected from investors as the Commission shall, by rule, determine
appropriate. Proposed Rule 403(c) would implement the requirements of Section 4A(a)(9) by
subjecting funding portals to the same privacy rules as those applicable to brokers. Proposed Rule
403(c), therefore, would have required funding portals to comply with Regulation S-P (Privacy of
Consumer Financial Information and Safeguarding Personal Information), 1099 Regulation S-AM
(Limitations on Affiliate Marketing), 1100 and Regulation S-ID (Identity Theft Red Flags) 1101
(collectively, the “Privacy Rules”). 1102
Regulation S-P governs the treatment of nonpublic personal information by brokers,
among others. 1103 It generally requires a broker to provide notice to investors about its privacy
policies and practices; describes the conditions under which a broker may disclose nonpublic
personal information about investors to nonaffiliated third parties; and provides a method for
investors to prevent a broker from disclosing that information to most nonaffiliated third parties
by “opting out” of that disclosure, subject to certain exceptions. Regulation S-AM allows a
consumer, in certain limited situations, to block affiliates of covered persons (i.e., brokers, dealers,
investment companies and both investment advisers and transfer agents registered with the

Comments and Final Rules

We are adopting Rule 403(c) as proposed, but renumbering it as Rule 403(b). 1106 One
commenter opposed Proposed Rule 403(c), which would impose the Privacy Rules on funding
portals, stating that in its view, funding portals do not raise privacy concerns. 1107 We disagree.
We believe that privacy is a concern as it relates to funding portals given that funding portals will
collect and maintain sensitive personal information about the investors using their platforms.
d.

Inspections and Examinations
(1)

Proposed Rule

Exchange Act Section 3(h)(1)(A) specifies that funding portals must remain subject to our
examination authority to, among other things, rely on any exemptions from broker-dealer
registration that we impose. Under proposed Rule 403(d) of Regulation Crowdfunding, a funding
portal would be required to permit the examination and inspection of all of its business and
business operations that relate to its activities as a funding portal, such as its premises, systems,

1104

See 17 CFR Part 248, Subpart B.

1105

See 17 CFR Part 248, Subpart C.

platforms and records, by our representatives and by representatives of the registered national
securities association of which it is a member.
(2)

Comment and Final Rules

We are adopting Rule 403(d) as proposed, but renumbering it as 403(c). 1108 One
commenter opposed the Commission’s proposed inspections and examinations rules as
unnecessary. 1109 As a condition to exempting funding portals from the requirement to register as
broker-dealers under Exchange Act Section 15(a)(1), Exchange Act Section 3(h)(1)(A) requires
that registered funding portals remain subject to, among other things, our examination authority.
We believe that inspections and examinations are an important aspect of our oversight function of
funding portals as they will assist us in monitoring the activities of funding portals in light of
applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. Therefore, we are adopting Rule 403(c) to
implement the statute and retain examination authority over funding portals.
5.

Records to be Created and Maintained by Funding Portals
a.

Proposed Rule

As proposed, Rule 404(a) would require funding portals to make and preserve certain
records for five years, with the records retained in a readily accessible place for at least the first
two years. The required records would include the following:
•

All records relating to investors who purchase or attempt to purchase securities
through the funding portal; 1110

1108

The Rule is being renumbered to account for the elimination of the proposed anti-money laundering
provision in proposed Rule 403(b), which is described in more detail in Section II.D.4.b. We are also adding
the word “registered” to “national securities association” to be consistent with the rest of the rule text and
with Exchange Act Section 3(h)(1)(B).

1109

See Public Startup Letter 3.

1110

This would include information relating to educational materials provided to investors, account openings and
transactions, including notices of investment commitments and reconfirmations.

314

•

All records relating to issuers that offer and sell, or attempt to offer and sell,
securities through the funding portal and to persons having control with respect to
those issuers;

•

Records of all communications that occur on or through its platform;

•

All records related to persons that use communication services provided by a
funding portal to promote an issuer’s securities or to communicate with potential
investors;

•

All records demonstrating a funding portal’s compliance with requirements of
Subparts C (intermediary obligations) and D (additional funding portal
requirements); 1111

•

All notices provided by the funding portals to issuers and investors generally
through the funding portal’s platform or otherwise; 1112

•

All written agreements (or copies thereof) entered into by a funding portal, relating
to its business as such;

•

All daily, monthly and quarterly summaries of transactions effected through the
funding portal; 1113 and

1111

This requirement alone would not, however, require the creation of any records or proscribe the format or
manner of any records. However, without records, it would be difficult for a funding portal to demonstrate
compliance with Subparts C and D to examiners.

1112

These would include, but not be limited to: (1) notices addressing hours of funding portal operations (if any);
(2) funding portal malfunctions; (3) changes to funding portal procedures; (4) maintenance of hardware and
software; (5) instructions pertaining to access to the funding portal; and (6) denials of, or limitations on,
access to the funding portal.

1113

These would include: (1) issuers for which the target offering amount has been reached and funds
distributed; and (2) transaction volume, expressed in number of transactions, number of securities involved
in a transaction and total amounts raised by and distributed to issuers, as well as total dollar amounts raised
across all issuers, expressed in U.S. dollars.

315

•

A log reflecting the progress of each issuer who offers and sells securities through
the funding portal toward meeting the target offering amount.

As proposed, Rule 404(b) would require that a funding portal make and preserve its
organizational documents during its operation as a funding portal and also those of any successor
funding portal. These would include, but not be limited to: (1) partnership agreements; (2)
articles of incorporation or charter; (3) minute books; and (4) stock certificate books (or other
similar type documents).
We also proposed in Rule 404(c) that the records required to be maintained and preserved
pursuant to Rule 404(a) be produced, reproduced, and maintained in the original, non-alterable
format in which they were created or as permitted under Section 17a-4(f) of the Exchange Act.
We proposed in Rule 404(d) to allow third parties to prepare or maintain the required records on
behalf of the funding portal, provided that there is a written undertaking in place between the
funding portal and the third party stating that the required records are the property of the funding
portal and will be surrendered promptly, on request by the funding portal, to the Commission or
the national securities association of which the funding portal is a member. 1114 The funding portal
also would have been required to file, with the registered national securities association of which
1114

The written undertaking would be required to include the following provision:
With respect to any books and records maintained or preserved on behalf of [name of
funding portal], the undersigned hereby acknowledges that the books and records are
the property of [name of funding portal], and hereby undertakes to permit examination
of such books and records at any time, or from time to time, during business hours by
representatives of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the national
securities association of which the funding portal is a member, and to promptly furnish
to the Commission and national securities association of which the funding portal is a
member, a true, correct, complete and current hard copy of any, all, or any part of,
such books and records.
This provision is consistent with the recordkeeping provisions applicable to brokers under Exchange Act
Rules 17a-4(f) (17 CFR 17a-4(f)) and 17a-4(j) (17 CFR 240.17a-4(j)), but has been scaled to be more
appropriate for funding portals.

316

it is a member, this written undertaking, signed by a duly authorized representative of the third
party. As proposed, an agreement between a funding portal and a third party would not relieve the
funding portal of its responsibility to prepare and maintain records, as required under Rule 404 of
Regulation Crowdfunding.
As proposed, Rule 404(e) would require all records of a funding portal to be subject at any
time, or from time to time, to such reasonable periodic, special or other examination by our
representatives and representatives of the registered national securities association of which the
funding portal is a member.
Finally, we proposed in Rule 404(f) that funding portals would be required to comply with
the reporting, recordkeeping and record retention requirements of Chapter X of Title 31 of the
Code of Federal Regulations. Where Chapter X of Title 31 and proposed rules 404(a) and 404(b)
would require the same records or reports to be preserved for different periods of time, we
proposed requiring the records or reports to be preserved for the longer period of time.
b.

Comments on Proposed Rule

Commenters generally did not object to the proposed recordkeeping requirements. Some
commenters suggested that the cost for a funding portal to maintain the proposed books and
records would not be significant. 1115 A few commenters suggested that funding portals should
maintain required records for a longer period of time. One of these commenters recommended a
retention period of 10 years, 1116 while the other suggested that issuer data should be kept
permanently accessible by the funding portal. 1117 Another commenter suggested that the

1115

See, e.g., CFIRA Letter 1, Joinvestor Letter.

1116

See Joinvestor Letter.

317

Commission should require intermediaries, rather than the issuers, to maintain records (or arrange
for third-party recordkeeping) of the offering materials used by the issuers, thereby reducing the
burden on issuers by no longer requiring them to transcribe offering materials into something that
can be filed with EDGAR. 1118
c.

Final Rules

We are adopting Rule 404 as proposed, with a modification to subparagraph (e) to require
that books and records subject to review under the subsection be produced promptly to
representatives of the Commission and the national securities association of which the funding
portal is a member, 1119 and a minor modification to subparagraph (f) related to anti-money
laundering related records. 1120 We also made a modification to state that, in addition to being
furnished to representatives of the Commission, books and records would have to be furnished to
the Commission itself. We are also adding the word “registered” to “national securities
association” to be consistent with the rest of the rule text and with Exchange Act Section
3(h)(1)(B). 1121
We believe that it is important for funding portals to be subject to the recordkeeping
requirements in order to create a meaningful record of crowdfunding transactions and
communications. For example, we are requiring records of all notices provided by the funding

1117

Mollick, et al Letter. See also Public Startup Letter 5 (suggesting that the Commission should improve
“forensic record-keeping obligations of a funding portal” by requiring portals to “maintain the URLs and
website content in perpetuity for all issuers who use the portal to raise capital from the public.”).

1118

CFIRA Letter 1.

1119

We are making this change to remain consistent with the prompt production standard that is required for
third party recordkeeping undertakings pursuant to Rule 404(d).

1120

In the Proposing Release and as noted in this section, we have provided examples of the types of information
that would be required to be maintained under each of the specified records. The same guidance applies with
respect to application of the final rules.

1121

Conforming changes were made to both Rules 404(d) and (e).

318

portals to issuers and investors generally through the funding portal’s platform or otherwise. We
believe that, in addition to the list of examples provided in the rule, this encompasses any notices
relating to the funding portal’s business as such, including communications in electronic form sent
from an associated person of a funding portal to issuers or investors (including potential
investors). Every funding portal is required under Rule 404 to furnish promptly to the
Commission and its representatives, and the registered national securities association of which the
funding portal is a member, legible, true, complete and current copies of such records of the
funding portal that are requested by the representatives of the Commission and the national
securities association. 1122
The requirements will enable regulators to more effectively gather information about the
activities in which a funding portal has been engaged, as well as about the other parties involved
in crowdfunding (e.g., issuers, promoters, and associated persons), to discern whether the funding
portals and the other parties are in compliance with the requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding
and any other applicable federal securities laws. We believe the requirements will assist
regulators’ compliance examinations because, without these records, the Commission and any
registered national securities association of which the funding portal is a member may have
difficulty examining a funding portal for compliance with the requirements of Regulation

1122

The Commission generally interprets the term “promptly” or “prompt” to mean making reasonable efforts to
produce records that are requested by the staff during an examination without delay. The Commission
believes that in many cases a funding portal could, and therefore will be required to, furnish records
immediately or within a few hours of a request. The Commission expects that only in unusual circumstances
would a funding portal be permitted to delay furnishing records for more than 24 hours. Accord SecurityBased Swap Data Repository Registration, Duties, and Core Principles, Exchange Act Release No. 74246

Crowdfunding and the federal securities laws. 1123 Therefore, we believe the record retention
requirements should be mandatory rather than voluntary as suggested by one commenter.
Although we are not requiring that funding portals utilize the record retention services of brokerdealers, as suggested by one commenter, we note that a funding portal may find it cost-effective or
otherwise appropriate to use the recordkeeping services of a third party, and the final rules provide
the necessary flexibility to allow funding portals to utilize these options.
While some commenters suggest a longer record retention period, we believe the
requirement that funding portals preserve their records for five years, with the records retained in
a readily accessible place for at least the first two years, provides sufficient investor protection,
while not imposing overly burdensome recordkeeping costs. 1124 We are not adopting, as
commenters recommended, a requirement that funding portals be required to keep issuer data
permanently accessible or maintain URLs and website content in perpetuity for all issuers, as we
believe the permanent storage of such information could be unduly burdensome and is
unnecessary.
Because permissible funding portal activity is far more limited than that of broker-dealers
and a relatively high proportion of funding portals will be new market entrants that have not been
subject to regulation before (rather than broker-dealers switching their business models to become
funding portals) and, therefore, may not have formal recordkeeping practices in place, the
recordkeeping requirements for funding portals are relatively streamlined compared to those for

1123

See, supra, note 798.

1124

We note that the record retention period requirement continues for a funding portal after it withdraws its
registration. Schedule D of Form Funding Portal requests information about the location(s) of where a
funding portal will keep its books and records after withdrawal.

320

broker-dealers. Funding portals are intended to be subject to less regulation than broker-dealers,
and recordkeeping requirements adopted in the final rules are consistent with this intent.
Finally, as described above, we are not adopting the proposed requirement that a funding
portal comply with the BSA. 1125 Nevertheless, we are revising the final recordkeeping rule to
require a funding portal to maintain books and records related to BSA requirements, should
funding portals become subject to the requirements of the BSA. 1126
Commission staff expects to review the books and records practices of intermediaries
during the study of the federal crowdfunding exemption that it plans to undertake no later than
three years following the effective date of Regulation Crowdfunding. 1127
E.

Miscellaneous Provisions
1.

Insignificant Deviations from Regulation Crowdfunding
a.

Proposed Rules

We proposed Rule 502 of Regulation Crowdfunding to provide issuers a safe harbor for
insignificant deviations from a term, condition or requirement of Regulation Crowdfunding. As
proposed in Rule 502(a), to qualify for the safe harbor, the issuer relying on the exemption would
have to show that: (1) the failure to comply with a term, condition or requirement was
insignificant with respect to the offering as a whole; and (2) the issuer made a good faith and
reasonable attempt to comply with all applicable terms, conditions and requirements of Regulation
1125

See Section II.D.4.b.

1126

15 U.S.C. 5311 et seq. To the extent that funding portals become subject to the requirements of the BSA and
are required to comply with BSA recordkeeping requirements, we believe that this recordkeeping
requirement will be valuable to our regulatory oversight function of funding portals’ compliance with such
BSA requirements. See generally Recordkeeping by Brokers and Dealers, Release No. 34-18321 (Dec. 10,
1981) [46 FR 61454 (Dec. 17, 1981)] (noting the effectiveness of on-site examinations of broker-dealers by
the Commission and SROs in enforcing compliance with reporting and recordkeeping requirements when
adopting Exchange Act Rule 17a-8). Rule 17a-8 (17 CFR 240.17a-8) requires broker-dealers to comply with
the reporting, recordkeeping and record retention rules adopted under the BSA.

1127

See Section II.

321

Crowdfunding; and (3) the issuer did not know of the failure to comply, where the failure to
comply with a term, condition or requirement was the result of the failure of the intermediary to
comply with the requirements of Section 4A(a) and the related rules, or such failure by the
intermediary occurred solely in offerings other than the issuer’s offering. As proposed in Rule
502(b), notwithstanding this safe harbor, any failure to comply with Regulation Crowdfunding
would nonetheless be actionable by the Commission.
b.

Comments on the Proposed Rules

Commenters were generally in favor of the proposed safe harbor. 1128 However, some
commenters representing state securities regulators suggested that the safe harbor is unnecessary,
would be detrimental to state enforcement efforts and would be a burden on regulators when
issuers assert the safe harbor, whether or not they were operating in good faith. 1129 These
commenters also recommended that the proposed safe harbor, if adopted, should not be a defense
to an enforcement action by the states. 1130
c.

Final Rules

We are adopting the Rule 502(a) safe harbor as proposed. 1131 The first two prongs of the
safe harbor provision in Rule 502(a) are modeled after a similar provision in Rule 508 of
Regulation D, 1132 and we believe a similar safe harbor is appropriate for offerings made in
reliance on Section 4(a)(6). We believe that provisions for insignificant deviations serve an
important function by allowing for certain errors that can occur in the offering process without

causing the issuer to lose the exemption and incur certain consequences, including potential
private rights of action for rescission for violations of Section 5 of the Securities Act, 1133 and loss
of preemption for state securities law registration requirements. The offering exemption in
Section 4(a)(6) was designed to help alleviate the funding gap and the accompanying regulatory
challenges faced by startups and small businesses, many of which may not be familiar with the
federal securities laws. We continue to believe that issuers should not lose the Section 4(a)(6)
exemption because of insignificant deviations from a term, condition or requirement of Regulation
Crowdfunding, so long as the issuer, in good faith, attempted to comply with the rules. We note
that whether a deviation from the requirements would be significant to the offering as a whole will
depend on the facts and circumstances of the offering and the deviation. While such
determinations will be based on the particular facts and circumstances, we believe that a deviation
from certain fundamental requirements in the rules, such as a failure to adhere to the aggregate
offering limit under Rule 100(a)(1), presumptively would not be an insignificant deviation that
would allow reliance on this safe harbor.
We are adopting the third prong of the safe harbor in Rule 502(a) because, under the
statute, an issuer could lose the exemption and potentially violate Section 5 because of the failure
of the intermediary to comply with the requirements of Section 4A(a). We believe that an issuer
should not lose the offering exemption due to a failure by the intermediary, which likely will be
out of the issuer’s control, if the issuer did not know of such failure or such failure related to
offerings other than the issuer’s offering. Absent this safe harbor, we believe that issuers may be
hesitant to participate in offerings in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) due to uncertainty about their

1133

See Securities Act Section 12(a)

323

ability to rely on, and to control their ongoing eligibility for, the exemption, which could
undermine the facilitation of capital raising for startups and small businesses.
We believe that the potential harm to investors that might result from the applicability of
this safe harbor would be minimal because the deviations must be insignificant to the offering as a
whole for the safe harbor to apply. We also believe the safe harbor appropriately protects an
issuer who made a diligent attempt to comply with the rules from losing the exemption as a result
of insignificant deviations from Regulation Crowdfunding.
We also are adopting Rule 502(b) largely as proposed to set forth clearly that the safe
harbor for insignificant deviations in Rule 502(a) does not preclude the Commission from
bringing an enforcement action seeking appropriate relief for an issuer’s failure to comply with all
applicable terms, conditions, and requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding. Despite the
suggestion of two commenters, 1134 we are not extending Rule 502(b) to enforcement actions by
the states. While we recognize the concerns of certain state securities regulators that the safe
harbor could be detrimental to state enforcement efforts, we believe that a state’s review as to
whether there is an insignificant deviation from our rules would create undue uncertainty for
issuers seeking to rely on the Section 4(a)(6) exemption. 1135 We note that, irrespective of the
scope of the safe harbor, states retain antifraud authority in all cases.
2.

Restrictions on Resales
a.

Proposed Rules

Section 4A(e) provides that securities issued in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) may not be
transferred by the purchaser for one year after the date of purchase, except when transferred: (1) to
1134
1135

See Commonwealth of Massachusetts Letter; NASAA Letter.
Securities Act Section 18(b)(4)(C), as amended by the JOBS Act, preempts state securities laws’ registration
and qualification requirements for offerings made pursuant to Section 4(a)(6). 15 U.S.C. 77r(b)(4)(C).

324

the issuer of the securities; (2) to an accredited investor; (3) as part of an offering registered with
the Commission; or (4) to a family member of the purchaser or the equivalent, or in connection
with certain events, including death or divorce of the purchaser, or other similar circumstances, in
the discretion of the Commission. Section 4A(e) further provides that the Commission may
establish additional limitations on securities issued in reliance on Section 4(a)(6).
Proposed Rule 501 largely tracked the provisions of Section 4A(e). We also proposed
definitions of “accredited investor” and a “member of the family of the purchaser or the
equivalent.” Under the proposed rules, the term “accredited investor” would have the same
definition in Rule 501 of Regulation D. 1136
The statute does not define “member of the family of the purchaser or the equivalent.” We
proposed to define the phrase to include a “child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent,
grandparent, spouse or spousal equivalent, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law,
daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law of the purchaser, and shall include adoptive
relationships.” This definition tracks the definition of “immediate family” in Exchange Act Rule
16a-1(e), 1137 but with the addition of “spousal equivalent.”

Two commenters supported the proposed restrictions on resales, 1138 while several other
commenters opposed any resale restrictions. 1139 Two commenters expressed support for the

who self-certify that they are low-income investors would not be subject to a holding period); Public Startup
Letter 3 (also opposing accredited investors having an advantage over other buyers).

proposal that to sell securities purchased in a transaction made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) to an
accredited investor during the restricted period, the seller of such securities would need to have a
reasonable belief that the purchaser is an accredited investor. 1140
One commenter noted that the investors who are eligible to purchase securities from the
initial purchasers in the first year would be able to circumvent the investment limits of the
proposed rules by purchasing securities from the initial purchasers in an amount greater than they
would be able to purchase through intermediaries. 1141 Another commenter noted that the
restrictions on resale appear only to cover the sale by the initial purchaser, thus creating the
possibility that securities of a particular issuer could become widely traded within the first year if
the initial purchaser sells the securities to an eligible purchaser who then resells them to the public
within the first year. 1142
c.

Final Rules

We are adopting the restrictions on resales in Rule 501 as proposed, with certain revisions
as described below. 1143 We are concerned that, as noted by several commenters, the restrictions
on resales would cover only the sale by the initial purchaser, which creates the possibility that
securities of a particular issuer could become widely traded within the first year if the initial
purchaser sells the securities to an eligible purchaser who subsequently resells them to the public

types of transfers; or (4) remove the words “by the purchaser” from the first sentence of proposed Rule
501(a)).

1143

See Rule 501 of Regulation Crowdfunding.

326

within the first year. Further, the proposed rule could allow, as one commenter noted, 1144
investors to circumvent the investment limits in the first year by purchasing securities from the
initial purchasers. In response to these concerns, we have modified Rule 501 from the proposal so
that the one-year resale restriction will apply to any purchaser during the one-year period
beginning when the securities were first issued, not just the initial purchaser. In addition, we have
modified the definition to track more closely the language in Securities Act Rule 501(a) to clarify
that the person reselling the securities must have a reasonable belief that the purchaser qualifies as
an accredited investor.
As adopted, the rule provides that securities issued in a transaction pursuant to Section
4(a)(6) may not be transferred by any purchaser of such securities during that one-year period
unless such securities are transferred: (1) to the issuer of the securities; (2) to an accredited
investor; (3) as part of an offering registered with the Commission; or (4) to a member of the
family of the purchaser or the equivalent, to a trust controlled by the purchaser, to a trust created
for the benefit of a member of the family of the purchaser or the equivalent, or in connection with
the death or divorce of the purchaser or other similar circumstance. We recognize that several
commenters expressed concerns about the exception for resales to accredited investors and the
potential unfair advantage this could provide to such investors. While we appreciate these
concerns, we note that this treatment will provide some measure of liquidity for holders of these
securities within the first year of the offering without undermining the investor protections
otherwise provided by the statute and our rules.

1144

Information Available to States

Under Section 4A(d), the Commission shall make available, or shall cause to be made
available by the relevant intermediary, the information required under Section 4A(b) and such
other information as the Commission, by rule, determines appropriate to the securities commission
(or any agency or office performing like functions) of each state and territory of the United States
and the District of Columbia. We proposed to require issuers to file on EDGAR the information
required by Section 4A(b) and the related rules. Information filed on EDGAR is publicly
available and would, therefore, be available to each state, territory and the District of Columbia.
As we stated in the Proposing Release, we believe this approach will satisfy the statutory
requirement to make the information available to each state and territory of the United States, and
the District of Columbia. Commenters who addressed this issue agreed with our proposed
approach, 1145 and we are adopting this provision as proposed.
4.

Exemption from Section 12(g)
a.

Proposed Rule

Section 303 of the JOBS Act amended Exchange Act Section 12(g) to provide that “the
Commission shall, by rule, exempt, conditionally or unconditionally, securities acquired pursuant
to an offering made under [S]ection 4[(a)](6) of the Securities Act of 1933 from the provisions of
this subsection.” As amended by the JOBS Act, Section 12(g) requires, among other things, that
an issuer with total assets exceeding $10,000,000 and a class of securities held of record by either
2,000 persons, or 500 persons who are not accredited investors, register such class of securities

the thresholds for triggering reporting obligations under Section 12(g). As discussed in the
Proposing Release, Section 303 could be read to mean that securities acquired in a crowdfunding
transaction would be excluded from the record holder count permanently, regardless of whether
the securities continue to be held by a person who purchased in the crowdfunding transaction. An
alternative reading could provide that securities acquired in a crowdfunding transaction would be
excluded from the record holder count only while held by the original purchaser in the Section
4(a)(6) transaction, as a subsequent purchaser of the securities would not be considered to have
“acquired [the securities] pursuant to an offering made under [S]ection 4[(a)](6).”
Consistent with the statute, the Commission’s proposed Rule 12g-6 would provide that
securities issued pursuant to an offering made under Section 4(a)(6) would be permanently
exempted from the record holder count under Section 12(g). An issuer seeking to exclude a
person from the record holder count would have the responsibility for demonstrating that the
securities held by the person were initially issued in an offering made under Section 4(a)(6).

Comments on the Proposed Rules

Commenters generally supported the permanent exemption from the record holder count
under Section 12(g). 1147 One commenter recommended that the exemption from the record holder
count under Section 12(g) apply to different securities issued in a subsequent restructuring,
recapitalization or similar transaction that is exempt from, or otherwise not subject to, the
registration requirements of Section 5, if the parties to the transaction are affiliates of the original

has total assets exceeding $10,000,000 and a class of securities held of record by 2,000 persons, register such
class of securities with the Commission. See Section 601 of the JOBS Act.

count under Section 12(g) on the issuer’s asset value, 1149 while a few others opposed such
concept. 1150 Another commenter recommended that issuers that fail to comply with Regulation
Crowdfunding’s ongoing reporting requirements be disqualified from relying on the exemption
from the record holder count under Section 12(g), 1151 while two commenters opposed such
concept. 1152
c.

Final Rules

In response to comments received, we are adopting Rule 12g-6 with certain
modifications. 1153 The rule provides that securities issued pursuant to an offering made under
Section 4(a)(6) are exempted from the record holder count under Section 12(g), provided that the
issuer is current in its ongoing annual reports required pursuant to Rule 202 of Regulation
Crowdfunding, has total assets as of the end of its last fiscal year not in excess of $25 million, and
has engaged the services of a transfer agent registered with the Commission pursuant to Section
17A of the Exchange Act. 1154
An issuer that exceeds the $25 million total asset threshold, in addition to exceeding the
thresholds in Section 12(g), will be granted a two-year transition period before it will be required
to register its class of securities pursuant to Section 12(g), provided it timely files all its ongoing

1148

See Arctic Island Letter 7. See also ABA Letter (recommending that the Commission, at a minimum,
exempt from the Section 12(g) record holder count securities issued in a statutory merger to change the
domicile of the issuer, in reliance on Securities Act Rule 145(a)(2)).

reports pursuant to Rule 202 of Regulation Crowdfunding during such period. 1155 Section 12(g)
registration will be required only if, on the last day of the fiscal year the company has total assets
in excess of the $25 million total asset threshold, the class of equity securities is held by more than
2,000 persons or 500 persons who are not accredited investors. 1156 In such circumstances, an
issuer that exceeds the thresholds in Section 12(g) and has total assets of $25 million or more will
be required to begin reporting under the Exchange Act the fiscal year immediately following the
end of the two-year transition period. 1157 An issuer entering Exchange Act reporting will be
considered an “emerging growth company” to the extent the issuer otherwise qualifies for such
status. 1158
An issuer seeking to exclude a person from the record holder count has the responsibility
for demonstrating that the securities held by the person were initially issued in an offering made
under Section 4(a)(6). As noted in the proposal, we believe that allowing issuers to sell securities
pursuant to Section 4(a)(6) without becoming Exchange Act reporting issuers is consistent with
the intent of Title III. 1159 In this regard, we note that Title III provides for an alternative reporting
system under which issuers using the crowdfunding exemption are required to file annual reports
with the Commission.1160 We believe that conditionally exempting securities issued in reliance on

1157

1158

Under Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, an “emerging growth company” is defined as, among other
things, an issuer that had total annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion during its most recently
completed fiscal year. 15 U.S.C. 77b(a)(19). See also Section 3(a)(80) of the Exchange Act (which repeats
the same definition). 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(80).

1159

See 158 CONG. REC. S1829 (daily ed. Mar. 20, 2012) (statement of Sen. Jeff Merkley) (“It also provides a
very important provision so the small investors do not count against the shareholder number that drives
companies to have to become a fully public company. That is critical and interrelates with other parts of the
[crowdfunding] bill before us.”).

1160

See Section II.B.2 for a discussion of the requirement to file annual reports.

331

Section 4(a)(6) from the record holder count under Section 12(g), and thereby from the more
extensive reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, is appropriate in light of the existence of
the alternative ongoing reporting requirements that are tailored to the types of issuers and
offerings we anticipate under Regulation Crowdfunding.
In determining to provide a conditional exemption from the provisions of Section 12(g),
we have considered a number of factors. First, we believe that conditioning the exemption on the
issuer being current in its ongoing reporting requirements is consistent with the intent behind the
original enactment of Section 12(g) because this condition requires that relevant, current
information about issuers will be made routinely available to investors and the marketplace. 1161
Second, we believe that conditioning the 12(g) exemption on crowdfunding issuers using a
registered transfer agent will provide an important investor protection in this context. As
discussed in Section II.C.3 above, regarding the need for an issuer to establish means to keep
accurate records of its securities holders, we received a number of comments about the benefits of
using a registered transfer agent. As noted above, we are not mandating the use of a transfer agent
for all crowdfunding offerings, for both flexibility and cost reasons. However, we believe that
requiring the use of a transfer agent is appropriate for those issuers that are seeking to have their
crowdfunding securities exempted from the record holder count under Section 12(g). We expect
that issuers at a stage at which they are seeking to rely on the Section 12(g) exemption are likely
to be larger and thus better able to incur the costs of a transfer agent. In the absence of a
conditional exemption from the provisions of Section 12(g), the use of a transfer agent registered

1161

Section 12(g) was enacted by Congress as a way to ensure that investors in over-the-counter securities about
which there was little or no information, but which had a significant shareholder base, were provided with
ongoing information about their investment. See, generally, Report of the Special Study of Securities
Markets of the Securities and Exchange Commission. House Document No. 95, House Committee on
Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 88th Cong., 1st Sess. (1963), at 60-62.

332

under the Exchange Act would be required of issuers when they register under the Exchange
Act. 1162 We note that a registered transfer agent is a regulated entity with experience in
maintaining accurate shareholder records, and its use will help to ensure that security holder
records and secondary trades will be handled accurately. Third, we believe that the condition of
total assets not exceeding $25 million will result in phasing out the Section 12(g) exemption once
companies grow and expand their shareholder base and is consistent with the intent behind Title
III of the JOBS Act, which was enacted to facilitate smaller company capital formation.
Rule 12g-6 does not extend the exclusion from the Section 12(g) record holder count to
different securities issued in exchange for Section 4(a)(6)-issued securities in a subsequent
restructuring, recapitalization or similar transaction. While some commenters requested such an
extension in instances where the parties to the transaction are affiliates of the original issuer, or in
certain restructuring transactions, we do not believe that such an expansion in the context of
shares initially issued using Regulation Crowdfunding would be appropriate because certain
restructuring and recapitalization transactions could change the pool of holders of the securities
beyond those who initially acquired the securities in a crowdfunding transaction, denying those
holders the protections of Section 12(g) registration.
5.

Scope of Statutory Liability

Securities Act Section 4A(c) provides that an issuer will be liable to a purchaser of its
securities in a transaction exempted by Section 4(a)(6) if the issuer, in the offer or sale of the
1162

Section 3(a)(25) of the Exchange Act provides that a “transfer agent” is any person who engages on behalf of
an issuer of securities or on behalf of itself as an issuer of securities in: (A) countersigning such securities
upon issuance; (B) monitoring the issuance of such securities with a view to preventing unauthorized
issuance (i.e., a registrar); (C) registering the transfer of such securities; (D) exchanging or converting such
securities; or (E) transferring record ownership of securities by bookkeeping entry without the physical
issuance of securities certificates. 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(25). Section 17A(c)(1) of the Exchange Act generally
requires any person performing any of these functions with respect to any security registered pursuant to
Section 12 of the Exchange Act to register with the Commission or other appropriate regulatory agency. 15
U.S.C. 78q-1(c)(1).

securities, makes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to
be stated or necessary in order to make the statements, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, provided that the purchaser did not know of the untruth or
omission, and the issuer does not sustain the burden of proof that such issuer did not know, and in
the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the untruth or omission. Section
4A(c)(3) defines, for purposes of the liability provisions of Section 4A, an issuer as including
“any person who offers or sells the security in such offering.”
In describing the statutory liability provision in the Proposing Release, the Commission
noted that it appears likely that intermediaries would be considered issuers for purposes of the
provision. Several commenters agreed that Section 4A(c) liability should apply to intermediaries
noting that it “may serve as a meaningful backstop against fraud” 1163 and would create a “true
financial incentive” for intermediaries to conduct checks on issuers and their key personnel. 1164
However, a large number of other commenters disagreed that Section 4A(c) liability
should apply to intermediaries. 1165 Some of these commenters stated their views that applying
statutory liability to intermediaries would have a chilling effect on intermediaries’ willingness to
facilitate crowdfunding offerings. 1166 Others cited the cost of being subject to this liability as
overly burdensome on funding portals, to the extent that they may not be able to conduct
business. 1167 Several commenters also explained that the nature of funding portals, as intended by

Congress, is distinct from that of registered broker-dealers. 1168 According to these commenters, a
funding portal’s role is not to offer and sell securities, but rather to provide a platform through
which issuers may offer and sell securities. As such, these commenters asserted that it would not
be appropriate to hold them liable for statements made by issuers. 1169 In addition, one commenter
suggested that applying statutory liability to funding portals, while precluding their ability to limit
the offerings that they facilitate, is an “untenable” framework. 1170 Some commenters stated that
the statutory construct could unnecessarily lead to lawsuits against funding portals, 1171 with one of
these commenters asserting that such suits would arise “for any deal that loses money” because
the burden of proof is on the funding portal to prove it could not have known of material
misstatements.” 1172 One commenter stated that risk disclosures should require an explanation to
investors that lawsuits by investors are only potentially viable if based on claims sounding in
fraud or negligence and that “lawsuits cannot be filed just because the retail investor loses their
risk capital.” 1173

1168

service providers under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, that exist “for the transmission of

Letter.

portal in a heads-you-win, tails-I-lose environment”); Milken Institute Letter (noting also that funding portals
should be permitted to make subjective judgments in deciding which offerings to list, including based on an
assessment of the merits or shortcomings of an offering); Wefunder Letter. See also Section II.D.3.a

One commenter suggested that the Commission retract its statement in the Proposing
Release that “it appears likely that intermediaries, including funding portals, would be considered
issuers for purposes of this liability provision.” 1174 Other commenters suggested that the
Commission should take action, such as: (i) exempting funding portals from liability, provided
conditions are met such as compliance with Regulation Crowdfunding 1175 or disclosure of the
specific steps the funding portal has taken in its due diligence; 1176 (ii) providing a safe harbor for
activities funding portals can undertake in posting issuer materials on their platforms, 1177 and (iii)
providing a list of reasonable steps funding portals can take in reviewing an offering in order to
rely on the reasonable care defense. 1178
We have considered the comments both in support of and against funding portals being
considered issuers for purposes of Section 4A(c) liability. Specifically, we acknowledge
commenters’ concerns that statutory liability may adversely affect funding portals, and
suggestions that, under the statutory scheme, funding portals and broker-dealers engage in
different activities that do not warrant a funding portal being subject to statutory liability. One
difference commenters highlighted was the inability of a funding portal to limit the offerings on
its platform under the proposed rules, and the untenable position of imposing statutory liability
while precluding funding portals’ ability to limit the offerings on their platforms. In response to
this comment, as described above, we have modified the language of the Rule 402 safe harbor

protection”); StartupValley Letter.

336

from the proposal to permit funding portals to exercise discretion to limit the offerings and issuers
that they allow on their platforms. 1179 We believe this will avoid the “untenable” framework that
commenters described. We are specifically declining to exempt funding portals (or any
intermediaries) from the statutory liability provision of Section 4A(c) or to interpret this provision
as categorically excluding such intermediaries. We do not believe that we should preclude the
ability of investors to bring private rights of action against funding portals (or any intermediaries).
Such a categorical exemption or exclusion could pose undue risks to investors by providing
insufficient incentives for intermediaries to take steps to prevent their platforms from becoming
vehicles for fraud.
Accordingly, we believe that the determination of “issuer” liability for an intermediary
under Section 4A(c) will turn on the facts and circumstances of the particular matter in question.
While we acknowledge the concerns of commenters about the potential application of Section
4A(c) liability, we note that Congress provided a defense to any such liability if an intermediary
did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the untruth or
omission. We continue to believe, as we identified in the Proposing Release, that there are
appropriate steps that intermediaries might take in exercising reasonable care in light of this
liability provision. These steps may include establishing policies and procedures 1180 that are
reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding,
and conducting a review of the issuer’s offering documents, before posting them to the platform,
to evaluate whether they contain materially false or misleading information.

Disqualification Provisions

Section 302(d) of the JOBS Act requires the Commission to establish disqualification
provisions under which an issuer would not be eligible to offer securities pursuant to Section
4(a)(6) and an intermediary would not be eligible to effect or participate in transactions pursuant
to Section 4(a)(6). Section 302(d)(2) specifies that the disqualification provisions must be
“substantially similar” to the “bad actor” disqualification provisions contained in Rule 262 of
Regulation A 1181 and they also must cover certain actions by state regulators enumerated in
Section 302(d)(2).
The disqualification provisions included in Section 302(d) of the JOBS Act are modeled
on the disqualification provisions included in Section 926 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which also
required the Commission to adopt rules “substantially similar” to Rule 262 of Regulation A that
disqualify securities offerings involving certain “felons and other ‘bad actors’” from reliance on
Rule 506 of Regulation D. On July 10, 2013, we adopted rules to implement Section 926 of the
Dodd-Frank Act to disqualify certain securities offerings from reliance on Rule 506 of Regulation
D. 1182 On March 25, 2015, we adopted amendments to Rule 262 of Regulation A 1183 that made
those provisions substantially similar to those adopted under Rule 506 of Regulation D.

respect to events occurring after effectiveness of the rules and disqualified persons may seek a
waiver from the Commission from application of the disqualification provisions.

Comments on Proposed Rules

Commenters were generally supportive of the proposed disqualification rules. 1184 A few
commenters recommended that pre-existing events should be subject to the disqualification
rules, 1185 although another supported the proposed approach of imposing disqualification only for
events after effectiveness. 1186 One commenter recommended that the Commission expand the list
of covered persons to include transfer agents and lawyers who are subject to certain
disqualifications. 1187
(3)

Final Rules

We are adopting bad actor disqualification provisions for Regulation Crowdfunding 1188
substantially as proposed with the exception of several modifications to further align the final
rules with similar provisions in Rules 262 and 506. We believe that the final rules are appropriate
in light of the JOBS Act Section 302(d) mandate. We further believe that creating a uniform set

1184

See, e.g., ABA Letter (expressing general support and recommending the Commission provide guidance on
the term “voting securities” and regarding the waiver process); Commonwealth of Massachusetts Letter;
Consumer Federation Letter (expressing an understanding of why the proposed disqualification rules are
consistent with those under Regulation D, but noting their belief that those rules were weak when adopted);
FundHub Letter 1 (stating that the proposed disqualification rules “are, to a certain degree, overkill” and too
costly, but that disqualifying bad actors is good for the future of equity crowdfunding); Joinvestor
(supporting the proposed look-back periods and waiver rules). But see Public Startup Letter 3 (stating the
proposed rules are unconstitutional without explaining its reasoning); Public Startup Letter 5 (recommending
the Commission establish an “offender registry” that requires issuers to maintain a “public profile”
containing information about potential issuers in a standardized format, similar to FINRA’s BrokerCheck).

of bad actor standards for all exemptions that include bad actor disqualification is likely to
simplify due diligence, particularly for issuers that may engage in different types of exempt
offerings.
Under the final disqualification rules, covered persons include the issuer and any
predecessor of the issuer or affiliated issuer; directors, officers, general partners or managing
members of the issuer; beneficial owners of 20% or more of the issuer’s outstanding voting equity
securities (which we believe should be calculated based on the present right to vote for the
election of directors, irrespective of the existence of control or significant influence); any
promoter connected with the issuer in any capacity at the time of such sale; compensated solicitors
of investors; and general partners, directors, officers or managing members of any such
solicitor. 1189 We have not expanded the list of covered persons, as suggested by a commenter,
because we believe that the limited additional investor protection that such an expansion may
provide would not justify the costs that would result from inconsistent bad actor disqualification
rules.
The disqualifying events include:
•

felony and misdemeanor convictions within the last five years in the case of issuers, their
predecessors and affiliated issuers, and 10 years in the case of other covered persons in
connection with the purchase or sale of a security, involving the making of a false filing
with the Commission; or arising out of the conduct of the business of an underwriter,
broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, investment adviser, funding portal or paid
solicitor of purchasers of securities; 1190

conduct or practices in connection with the purchase or sale of securities; involving the
making of any false filing with the Commission; or arising out of the conduct of the
business of an underwriter, broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, investment adviser,
funding portal or paid solicitor of purchasers of securities; 1191

•

certain final orders and bars of certain state and other federal regulators; 1192

•

Commission cease-and-desist orders relating to violations of scienter-based anti-fraud
provisions of the federal securities laws or Section 5 of the Securities Act; 1193

•

suspension should be issued, or as to which a stop order or suspension was issued within
the last five years; 1194

•

•

for covered persons other than the issuer:
o being subject to a Commission order:



o being suspended or expelled from membership in, or suspended or barred from
association with a member of, a registered national securities exchange or national
securities association for conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles of
trade. 1197
Consistent with Rules 262 and 506 and the proposal, we also are adopting provisions
allowing for a waiver from and a reasonable care exception to the disqualification provisions. 1198
Under the final rules, an issuer will not lose the benefit of the Section 4(a)(6) exemption if it is
able to show that it did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of
the existence of a disqualification. 1199 Further, persons that are disqualified from relying on the
exemption may request a waiver of disqualification from the Commission. 1200
The final rules also specify that triggering events that pre-date effectiveness of the final
rules will not cause disqualification, but instead must be disclosed on a basis consistent with Rules
262 and 506(e). 1201 Specifically, issuers will be required to disclose in their offering materials
matters that would have triggered disqualification had they occurred after the effective date of
proposed Regulation Crowdfunding. 1202 In a change from the proposal, Rule 201(u) does not
include the word “timely” as is included in Rule 506(e) of Regulation D, because unlike the

342

disclosure associated with Rule 506(e), the disclosure required by Rule 201(u) must be included in
an issuer’s offering statement and thus is required to be timely to the offering.
We believe this disclosure will put investors on notice of events that would, but for the
timing of such events, have disqualified the issuer from relying on Section 4(a)(6). We also
believe that this disclosure is particularly important because, as a result of the implementation of
Section 302(d), investors may have the impression that all bad actors are disqualified from
participating in offerings under Section 4(a)(6). If disclosure of a pre-existing, otherwise
disqualifying event is required and not provided to an investor, we would not view this as an
insignificant deviation from Regulation Crowdfunding under Rule 502.
Consistent with the proposal and with Rule 506, the final disqualification rules provide
that events relating to certain affiliated issuers are not disqualifying if the events pre-date the
affiliate relationship. Specifically, Rule 503(c) provides that events relating to any affiliated
issuer that occurred before the affiliation arose will be not considered disqualifying if the affiliated
entity is not (1) in control of the issuer or (2) under common control with the issuer by a third
party that was in control of the affiliated entity at the time of such events. 1203
We also have modified the final rules to expressly include funding portals in the list of
entities that could be subject to felony and misdemeanor convictions, injunctions and court orders
that would constitute disqualifying events. 1204 As proposed, funding portals would have been
included because they meet the definition of broker; however, for clarity, the final rule expressly
includes them.
1203

See Rule 503(c) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

1204

See Rules 503(a)(1)(iii) and 503(a)(2)(iii) of Regulation Crowdfunding. Because funding portals are brokers
within the meaning of Exchange Act Section (3)(a)(4) (albeit exempt from registration as such), we believe
that they would be covered by the term “broker” in the final rule. Nevertheless, for clarity, we are adding
funding portals to the final rule text to avoid any confusion in this regard.

Intermediaries and Certain Other Associated Persons
(1)

Proposed Rules

Section 302(d)(1)(B) requires the Commission to establish disqualification provisions
under which an intermediary would not be eligible to effect or participate in transactions
conducted pursuant to Securities Act Section 4(a)(6). Section 302(d)(2) requires that the
disqualification provisions be substantially similar to the provisions of Securities Act Rule 262,
which applies to issuers. Exchange Act Section 3(a)(39) 1205 currently defines the circumstances in
which a broker would be subject to a “statutory disqualification” with respect to membership or
participation in a self-regulatory organization such as FINRA or any other registered national
securities association. We believe that the definition of “statutory disqualification” under Section
3(a)(39) is substantially similar to, while somewhat broader than, the provisions of Rule 262. 1206
As proposed, Rule 503(d) would have prohibited any person subject to a statutory
disqualification as defined in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(39) from acting as, or being an
associated person of, an intermediary unless permitted to do so by Commission rule or order. The
term “subject to a statutory disqualification” has an established meaning under Exchange Act
Section 3(a)(39) and defines circumstances that subject a person to a statutory disqualification
with respect to membership or participation in, or association with a member of, a self-regulatory
organization. 1207 Because funding portals, like broker-dealers, are required to be members of

1205

15 U.S.C. 78c(39).

1206

See the Proposing Release at note 812 for a discussion of differences between Exchange Act Section
3(a)(39) and Rule 262. Despite the differences, we believe that Section 3(a)(39) and Rule 262 are
substantially similar, in particular with regard to the persons and events they cover, their scope and their
purpose.

1207

Events that could result in a statutory disqualification for an associated person under Section 3(a)(39)
include, but are not limited to: certain misdemeanor and all felony criminal convictions; temporary and
permanent injunctions issued by a court of competent jurisdiction involving a broad range of unlawful
investment activities; expulsions (and current suspensions) from membership or participation in an SRO;

344

FINRA or any other applicable registered national securities association, we anticipate that
funding portals will take appropriate steps to check the background of any person seeking to
become associated with them, including whether such person is subject to a statutory
disqualification.
In addition, we proposed to clarify that associated persons of intermediaries engaging in
transactions in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) must comply with Exchange Act Rule 17f-2, 1208
relating to the fingerprinting of securities industry personnel. Under the proposal, Exchange Act
Rule 17f-2 would have applied to all brokers, including registered funding portals. The proposed
instruction to Rule 503(d) would have clarified that Rule 17f-2 generally requires the
fingerprinting of every person who is a partner, director, officer or employee of a broker, subject
to certain exceptions.
(2)

Final Rules

We are adopting Rule 503(d) as proposed. We received two comments on the proposed
rule. One commenter was in favor, 1209 while another commenter was opposed. 1210 The Section
3(a)(39) standard is an established one among financial intermediaries and their regulators. For
this reason, we believe the Section 3(a)(39) standard is more appropriate for intermediaries than
Rule 262 or the issuer disqualification rules under Regulation Crowdfunding. We are concerned
that if we imposed a new or different statutory disqualification standard only for those

bars (and current suspensions) ordered by the Commission or an SRO; denials or revocations of registration
by the CFTC; and findings by the Commission, CFTC or an SRO that a person: (1) “willfully” violated the
federal securities or commodities laws, or the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) rules; (2)
“willfully” aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced or procured such violations; or (3) failed to
supervise another who commits violations of such laws or rules. 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(39).

intermediaries that engage in transactions in reliance on Section 4(a)(6), we may create confusion
and unnecessary burdens on market participants. We note that such a divergence in standards
would cause brokers that act as intermediaries in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) (and their associated
persons) to become subject to two distinct standards for disqualification. Instead, we believe that
intermediaries should be subject to the same statutory disqualification standard regardless of
whether or not they are engaging in transactions involving the offer or sale of securities in reliance
on Section 4(a)(6), and note that applying consistent standards for all brokers and funding portals
will also assist FINRA or any other registered national securities association in its oversight of its
members. Further, Exchange Act Rule 19h-1 prescribes the form and content of, and establishes
the mechanism by which the Commission reviews, proposals submitted by SROs (such as
FINRA) for its members, to allow a member or associated person subject to a statutory
disqualification to become or remain a member or be associated with a member (“notice of
admission or continuance notwithstanding a statutory disqualification,” as described in Rule 19h1(a)). Among other things, Rule 19h-1 provides for Commission review of notices filed by SROs
proposing to admit any person to, or continue any person in, membership or association with a
member notwithstanding a statutory disqualification as defined in Section 3(a)(39). Because
intermediaries are required to be members of a registered national securities association (which is
an SRO), actions taken by the SRO with respect to a proposed admission or continuance with
respect to an intermediary or its associated persons will be subject to Rule 19h-1. Thus, the
“pursuant to Commission rule” provision in Rule 503(d) will be satisfied if the admission or
continuance request was subject to the requirements and process of Exchange Act Rule 19h-1.
We also are adopting, as proposed, the instruction to Rule 503(d) clarifying that the Rule 17f-2

346

fingerprinting requirements are applicable to all associated persons of intermediaries engaging in
transactions in reliance on Section 4(a)(6).
7.

Secondary Market Trading

In addition to the actions the Commission is taking today to permit the offer and sale of
securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6), the Commission also recently adopted rules that exempt
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act certain offerings of up to $50 million of
securities annually, 1211 and rules to eliminate the prohibition against general solicitation in certain
offerings pursuant to Regulation D under the Securities Act. 1212 The Commission is mindful of
the need for market participants to have updated information in connection with the secondary
market trading of securities issued pursuant to these rules. 1213
The anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and rules adopted thereunder,
apply to the secondary market trading of securities, including securities offered and sold in
reliance on Section 4(a)(6). For example, Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11 governs broker-dealers’
publication of quotations for certain over-the-counter securities in a quotation medium other than
a national securities exchange. 1214 The Commission adopted Rule 15c2-11 to prevent fraudulent
and manipulative trading schemes that had arisen in connection with the distribution and trading
of certain unregistered securities. 1215 The rule prohibits broker-dealers from publishing quotations

1211

See Regulation A Adopting Release, supra, note 506.

1212

See Rule 506(c) Adopting Release, supra, note 5.

1213

As discussed in Section II.E.2, Rule 501 imposes a one-year restriction on the transfer of securities issued in
a transaction exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act, other than to the
issuer, an accredited investors, or to a family member of the purchaser or the equivalent in connection with
certain specified events.

(or submitting quotations for publication) in a “quotation medium” 1216 for covered over-thecounter securities without first reviewing basic information about the issuer, subject to certain
exceptions. 1217 A broker-dealer also must have a reasonable basis for believing that the issuer
information is accurate in all material respects and that it was obtained from a reliable source. 1218
To be clear, the rules adopted today do not affect the obligations of a broker-dealer under
Exchange Rule 15c2-11 to have a reasonable basis under the circumstances for believing that the
information required by Rule 15c2-11 is accurate in all material respects, and that the sources of
the information are reliable, prior to publishing any quotation, absent an exception, 1219 for a
covered security in any quotation medium. 1220 The staff is directed to begin promptly an
evaluation of the operation of Rule 15c2-11, both historically and in light of recent market
developments, including Regulation Crowdfunding and earlier proposals for amendments to Rule

See 17 CFR 240.15c2-11(f). For example, the rule includes an exception for unsolicited orders. 17 CFR

(other than a person acting as or for a dealer) and that broker-dealers should be prepared to demonstrate that
a customer initiated the order. 17 CFR 240.15c2-11(b)(1).

1220

Rule 15c2-11(c) further requires that broker-dealers keep the documents that they reviewed to establish this
reasonable basis for believing that the required information is accurate in all material respects for a period of
not less than three years. 17 CFR 240.15c2-11(c). The lack of documents used at the time the broker-dealer
established the reasonable basis for its belief or presentation of incomplete or non-responsive documents,
including later-dated filings, would not be sufficient to demonstrate that the broker-dealer had satisfied its
obligations in this regard. See Initiation or Resumption of Quotations Without Specified Information,
Exchange Act Release No 27247 (Sept. 14, 1989), 54 FR 39194, 39196 (Sept. 25, 1989) (“Subject to certain

trading in these securities during the study it plans to undertake within three years following the
effective date of Regulation Crowdfunding, and to recommend to the Commission such additional
actions with respect to Rule 15c2-11, as may be warranted. 1222
III.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Title III sets forth a comprehensive regulatory structure for startups and small businesses

to raise capital through securities-based crowdfunding transactions using the Internet. In
particular, Title III provides an exemption from registration for certain offerings of securities by
adding Securities Act Section 4(a)(6). In addition, Title III:
•

adds Securities Act Section 4A, which requires, among other things, that issuers and
intermediaries that facilitate transactions between issuers and investors provide certain
information to investors, take certain actions and provide notices and other information
to the Commission;

•

adds Exchange Act Section 3(h), which requires the Commission to adopt rules to
exempt, either conditionally or unconditionally, funding portals from having to register
as broker-dealers or dealers pursuant to Exchange Act Section 15(a)(1);

•

mandates that the Commission adopt disqualification provisions under which an issuer
would not be able to avail itself of the exemption for crowdfunding if the issuer or

1222

See Section II.

349

other related parties, including an intermediary, were subject to a disqualifying event;
and
•

adds Exchange Act Section 12(g)(6), which requires the Commission to adopt rules to
exempt from Section 12(g), either conditionally or unconditionally, securities acquired
pursuant to an offering made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6).

As discussed in detail above, we are adopting Regulation Crowdfunding to implement the
requirements of Title III. The final rules implement the new exemption for the offer and sale of
securities pursuant to the requirements of Section 4(a)(6) and provide a framework for the
regulation of issuers and intermediaries, which include broker-dealers and funding portals
engaging in such transactions. The final rules also permanently exempt securities offered and sold
in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) from the record holder count under Exchange Act Section 12(g).
We are mindful of the costs imposed by, and the benefits to be obtained from, our rules.
Securities Act Section 2(a) and Exchange Act Section 3(f) require us, when engaging in
rulemaking that requires us to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest, to consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action will
promote efficiency, competition and capital formation. Exchange Act Section 23(a)(2) requires
us, when adopting rules under the Exchange Act, to consider the impact that any new rule would
have on competition and to not adopt any rule that would impose a burden on competition that is
not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. The discussion
below addresses the economic effects of the final rules, including the likely costs and benefits of
Regulation Crowdfunding, as well as the likely effect of the final rules on efficiency, competition
and capital formation. Given the specific language of the statute and our understanding of
Congress’s objectives, we believe that it is appropriate for the final rules generally to follow the
350

statutory provisions. We nonetheless also rely on our discretionary authority to adopt certain
additional provisions and make certain other adjustments to the final rules. While the costs and
benefits of the final rules in large part stem from the statutory mandate of Title III, certain costs
and benefits are affected by the discretion we exercise in connection with implementing this
mandate. For purposes of this economic analysis, we address the costs and benefits resulting from
the mandatory statutory provisions and our exercise of discretion together because the two types
of benefits and costs are not separable.
A.

Baseline

The baseline for our economic analysis of Regulation Crowdfunding, including the
baseline for our consideration of the effects of the final rules on efficiency, competition and
capital formation, is the situation in existence today, in which startups and small businesses
seeking to raise capital through securities offerings must register the offer and sale of securities
under the Securities Act unless they can rely on an existing exemption from registration under the
federal securities laws. Moreover, under existing requirements, intermediaries intending to
facilitate such transactions generally are required to register with the Commission as brokerdealers under Exchange Act Section 15(a).
1.

Current Methods of Raising up to $1 Million of Capital

The potential economic impact of the final rules, including their effects on efficiency,
competition and capital formation, will depend on how the crowdfunding method of raising
capital compares to existing methods that startups and small businesses currently use for raising
capital. Startups and small businesses can potentially access a variety of external financing
sources in the capital markets through registered or unregistered offerings of debt, equity and
hybrid securities and bank loans.
351

Issuers seeking to raise capital must register the offer and sale of securities under the
Securities Act or qualify for an exemption from registration. Registered offerings, however, are
generally too costly to be viable alternatives for startups and small businesses. Issuers conducting
registered offerings incur Commission registration fees, legal and accounting fees and expenses,
transfer agent and registrar fees, costs associated with periodic reporting requirements and other
regulatory requirements and various other fees. Two surveys concluded that the average initial
compliance cost associated with conducting an initial public offering is $2.5 million, followed by
an ongoing compliance cost for issuers, once public, of $1.5 million per year. 1223 Hence, for an
issuer seeking to raise less than $1 million, a registered offering may not be economically
feasible. 1224 Moreover, issuers conducting registered offerings also usually pay underwriter fees,
which are, on average, approximately 7% of the proceeds for initial public offerings,

1223

See IPO Task Force, Rebuilding the IPO On-Ramp, at 9 (Oct. 20, 2011) for the two surveys, available at
http://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/acsec/rebuilding_the_ipo_on-ramp.pdf (“IPO Task Force”). These
estimates should be interpreted with the caveat that most firms in the IPO Task Force surveys likely raised
more than $1 million. The IPO Task Force surveys do not provide a breakdown of costs by offering size.
However, compliance related costs of an initial public offering and subsequent compliance related costs of
being a reporting company likely have a fixed cost component that would disproportionately affect small
offerings.
Title I of the JOBS Act provided certain accommodations to issuers that qualify as emerging growth
companies (EGCs). According to a recent working paper, the underwriting, legal and accounting fees of
EGC and non-EGC initial public offerings were similar (based on a time period from April 5, 2012 to April
30, 2014). For a median EGC initial public offering, gross spread comprised 7% of proceeds and accounting
and legal fees comprised 2.4% of proceeds. See Susan Chaplinsky, Kathleen W. Hanley, and S. Katie Moon,
The JOBS Act and the Costs of Going Public, Working Paper (2014), available at
http://ssrn.com/abstract_id=2492241.

approximately 5% for follow-on equity offerings and approximately 1−1.5% for issuers raising
capital through public bond issuances. 1225
An alternative to raising capital through registered offerings is to offer and sell securities
by relying on an existing exemption from registration under the federal securities laws. For
example, startups and small businesses could rely on current exemptions from registration under
the Securities Act, such as Section 3(a)(11), 1226 Section 4(a)(2), 1227 Regulation D, 1228 and
Regulation A. 1229 While we do not have complete data on offerings relying on an exemption
under Section 3(a)(11) or Section 4(a)(2), certain data available from Regulation D and
Regulation A filings allow us to gauge how frequently issuers seeking to raise up to $1 million use
these exemptions.
Based on Regulation D filings by issuers that are not pooled investment vehicles from
2009 to 2014, 1230 a substantial number of issuers chose to raise capital by relying on Rule 506,

1226

Securities Act Section 3(a)(11), generally known as the “intrastate offering exemption,” provides an
exemption from registration for issuers doing business within a particular state or territory. To qualify for
this exemption, the offering must be “part of an issue offered and sold only to persons resident within a
single State or Territory, where the issuer of such security is a person resident and doing business within, or,
if a corporation, incorporated by and doing business within, such State or Territory.”

1227

Securities Act Section 4(a)(2) provides that the registration provisions of the Securities Act shall not apply to
“transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering.”

1228

Regulation D provides exemptions and a nonexclusive safe harbor from registration for certain types of
securities offerings.

1229

Regulation A provides a conditional exemption from registration for certain small issuances.

1230

Market for Unregistered Securities Offerings, 2009–2014 (October 2015) (“Unregistered Offerings White

even though their offering size would qualify for an exemption under Rule 504 or Rule 505. 1231
The 2013 amendment to Rule 506 of Regulation D permits an issuer to engage in general
solicitation and general advertising in offering and selling securities pursuant to Rule 506(c),
subject to certain conditions, 1232 which can enable issuers to reach a potentially broader base of
accredited investors. As shown in the table below, although issuers can raise unlimited amounts
of capital relying on the Rule 506(c) exemption, most of the issuers made offers for amounts of up
to $1 million.

Note: Data based on Form D, excluding issuers that are pooled investment vehicles, and Form 1-A
filings from 2009 to 2014. We consider only new offerings and exclude offerings with amounts
sold reported as $0 on Form D. Data on Rule 506(c) offerings covers the period from September
23, 2013 (the day the rule became effective) to December 31, 2014. We also use the maximum
amount indicated in Form 1-A to determine offering size for Regulation A offerings. 1233

1231

This tendency could, in part, be attributed to two features of Rule 506: preemption from state registration
(“blue sky”) requirements and an unlimited offering amount. See also U.S. Government Accountability
Office, Factors That May Affect Trends in Regulation A Offerings, GAO-12-839 (Jul. 3, 2012), available at
http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-12-839 (“GAO Report”).

1232

In particular, all purchasers of securities sold in any offering under the exemption must be accredited
investors, and the issuer must take reasonable steps to verify that purchasers of securities sold in any offering
are accredited investors (17 CFR 230.506). See Rule 506(c) Adopting Release, supra, note 5.

1233

We only consider Regulation A offerings that have been qualified by the Commission. For purposes of
counting filings, we exclude amendments or multiple Form 1-A filings by the same issuer in a given year.
For purposes of determining the offering size for Regulation A offerings, we use the maximum amount
indicated on the latest pre-qualification Form 1-A or amended Form 1-A. We reclassify two offerings that
are dividend reinvestment plans with unclear offering amounts as having the maximum permitted offering
amount.

354

Based on the table above, from 2009 to 2014, almost no issuers in offerings of up to $1
million relied on Regulation A. This data does not reflect the recent changes to Regulation A
adopted by the Commission on March 25, 2015. Those changes allow issuers to raise up to $50
million over a 12-month period and exempt certain Regulation A offerings (Tier 2 offerings) from
state registration requirements. Because these changes are so recent, more time is needed to
observe how the amendments to Regulation A will affect capital raising by small issuers. 1234
Each of these exemptions, however, includes restrictions that may limit its suitability for
startups and small businesses. The table below lists the main requirements of these exemptions.
For example, the exemption under Securities Act Section 3(a)(11) is limited to intrastate
offerings. 1235 Issuers conducting a Regulation A offering may be required to register their
offerings with states or meet additional regulatory requirements, such as investment limitations (if
the investor is not an accredited investor), audited financial statements and ongoing reporting. In
addition, issuers in all Regulation A offerings are required to file with the Commission an offering
document on Form 1-A. Such compliance related costs may be a more significant constraint on
issuers in offerings of up to $1 million.1236 Issuers of securities pursuant to Securities Act Section
4(a)(2) and Rules 504, 505 and 506(b) under Regulation D generally may not engage in general
solicitation and general advertising to reach investors, which also can place a significant limitation
on offerings by startups and small businesses. While Rule 506 under Regulation D preempts the
applicability of state registration requirements and new Rule 506(c) permits general solicitation

Although Section 3(a)(11) does not have explicit resale restrictions, the Commission has explained that “to
give effect to the fundamental purpose of the exemption, it is necessary that the entire issue of securities shall

restrictions. Securities Act Rule 147, a safe harbor under Section 3(a)(11), limits resales to persons residing
in-state for a period of nine months after the last sale by the issuer. [17 CFR 230.147].

1240

Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act provides a statutory exemption for “transactions by an issuer not
involving any public offering.” See SEC v. Ralston Purina Co. 346 U.S. 119 (1953) (holding that an offering
to those who are shown to be able to fend for themselves is a transaction “not involving any public
offering.”)

1241

The Regulation A exemption also is not available to companies that have been subject to any order of the
Commission under Exchange Act Section 12(j) entered within the past five years; have not filed ongoing
reports required by the regulation during the preceding two years, or are disqualified under the regulation's
“bad actor” disqualification rules.

Current Sources of Funding for Startups and Small Businesses that
Could Be Substitutes or Complements to Crowdfunding

At present, startups and small businesses can raise capital from several sources that could
be close substitutes for or complements to crowdfunding transactions that rely on Section 4(a)(6).
This capital raising generally is conducted through unregistered securities offerings, involves
lending by financial institutions or derives from family and friends.

1242

No general solicitation or advertising is permitted unless the offering is registered in a state requiring the use
of a substantive disclosure document or sold under a state exemption for sales to accredited investors with
general solicitation.

1243

Filing is not a condition of the exemption, but it is required under Rule 503.

General solicitation and general advertising are permitted under Rule 506(c), provided that all purchasers are
accredited investors and the issuer takes reasonable steps to verify accredited investor status.

1248

Filing is not a condition of the exemption, but it is required under Rule 503.

a.

Family and Friends

Family and friends are sources through which startups and small businesses can raise
capital. This source of capital is usually available early in the lifecycle of a small business, before
the business engages in arm’s-length and more formal funding channels. 1249 Among other things,
family and friends may donate funds, loan funds or acquire an equity stake in the business. A
recent study of the financing choices of startups finds that most of the capital supplied by friends
and family is in the form of loans. 1250 In contrast to a commercial lender that, for example, would
need to assess factors such as the willingness and ability of a borrower to repay the loan and the
viability of its business, family and friends may be willing to provide capital based primarily or
solely on personal relationships. Family and friends, however, may be able to provide only a
limited amount of capital compared to other sources. In addition, financial arrangements with
family and friends may not be an optimal source of funding if any of the parties is not
knowledgeable about the structuring of loan agreements, equity investments or related areas of
accounting. We do not have data available on these financing sources that allow us to quantify
their magnitude and compare them to other current sources of capital.

Commercial Loans, Peer-to-Peer Loans and Microfinance

Startups and small businesses also may seek loans from financial institutions. 1251 A 2014
study of the financing choices of startups suggests that they resort to bank financing early in their
lifecycle. 1252 The study finds that businesses rely heavily in the first year after being formed on
external debt sources such as bank financing, mostly in the form of personal and commercial bank
loans, business credit cards and credit lines. Another recent report, however, suggests that bank
lending to small businesses fell by $100 billion from 2008 to 2011 and that, by 2012, less than
one-third of small businesses reported having a business bank loan. 1253 Trends in small business
lending by FDIC-insured depository institutions are illustrated in the figure below. As of June
2014, business loans of up to $1 million amounted to approximately $590 billion, approximately
17% lower than the 2008 level. 1254

1251

Using data from the 1993 Survey of Small Business Finance, one study indicates that financial institutions
account for approximately 27% of small firms’ borrowings. See Allen N. Berger and Gregory F. Udell, The
Economics of Small Business Finance: The Roles of Private Equity and Debt Markets in the Financial
Growth Cycle, 22 J. BANKING & FIN. 613 (1998). See also 1987, 1993, 1998 and 2003 Surveys of Small
Business Finances, available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss3/nssbftoc.htm. The Survey of
Small Business Finances was discontinued after 2003. Using data from the Kauffman Foundation Firm
Surveys, one study finds that 44% of startups use loans from financial institutions. See Rebel A. Cole and
Tatyana Sokolyk, How Do Start-Up Firms Finance Their Assets? Evidence from the Kauffman Firm
Surveys (2012), available at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2028176.

cautions against prematurely concluding that banks are not lending enough to small businesses as the sample
period of the study includes the most recent recession.

We define small business loans to include commercial and industrial loans to U.S. addressees of up to $1
million and loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties. See Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,

Additionally, although covering the pre-recessionary period, a Federal Reserve Board staff
study analyzing data from the 2003 Survey of Small Business Finance suggests that 60 percent of
small businesses have outstanding credit in the form of a credit line, a loan or a capital lease. 1255
These loans were borrowed from two types of financial institutions – depositary and nondepositary institutions (e.g., finance companies, factors or leasing companies). 1256 Lines of credit
were the most widely used type of credit. 1257 Other types included mortgage loans, equipment
loans and motor vehicle loans. 1258
Various loan guarantee programs of the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) make
credit more accessible to small businesses by either lowering the interest rate of the loan or

enabling a market-based loan that a lender would not be willing to provide absent a guarantee. 1259
Although the SBA does not itself act as a lender, the agency guarantees a portion of loans made
and administered by lending institutions. SBA loan guarantee programs include 7(a) loans 1260 and
CDC/504 loans. 1261 For example, in SBA fiscal year 2014, the SBA supported approximately
$28.7 billion in 7(a) and CDC/504 loans distributed to approximately 51,500 small businesses. 1262
SBA-guaranteed loans, however, currently account for a relatively small share (18 percent) of the
balances of small business loans outstanding. 1263 The SBA also offers the Microloan program,
which provides funds to specially designated intermediary lenders that administer the program for
eligible borrowers. 1264

1259

Numerous states also offer a variety of small business financing programs, such as Capital Access Programs,
collateral support programs and loan guarantee programs. These programs are eligible for support under the
State Small Business Credit Initiative, available at http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sbprograms/Pages/ssbci.aspx.

15 U.S.C. 695 et seq. The CDC/504 loans are made available through “certified development companies” or
“CDCs,” typically structured with the SBA providing 40% of the total project costs, a participating lender
covering up to 50% of the total project costs and the borrower contributing 10% of the total project costs.

1262

See U.S. Small Business Administration, FY 2016 Congressional Budget Justification and FY 2014 Annual
Performance Report, available at https://www.sba.gov/content/fiscal-year-2016-congressional-budgetjustificationannual-performance-report (“2014 Annual Performance Report”).

1263

As of the end of SBA fiscal year 2014, the SBA-guaranteed business loans outstanding (including 7(a) and
504 loans) equaled $107.5 billion. See Small Business Administration Unpaid Loan Balances by Program,
available at https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/files/WDS_Table1_UPB_Report.pdf. This comprises
approximately 18% of the approximately $590 billion in outstanding small business loans for commercial
real estate and commercial and industrial loans discussed above. In 2014 the SBA expanded eligibility for
loans under its business loan programs. See SBA 504 and 7(a) Loan Programs Updates (Mar. 21, 2014) [79
FR 15641 (Apr. 21, 2014)]. In addition to loan guarantees, the SBA program portfolio also includes direct
business loans, which are mainly microloans (outstanding direct business loans equaled $137.1 billion), and
disaster loans.

1264

15 U.S.C. 631 et seq. The Microloan program provides small, short-term loans to small businesses and
certain types of not-for-profit childcare centers. The maximum loan amount is $50,000, but the average
microloan is about $13,000. Intermediaries are nonprofit community-based organizations with experience in
lending, as well as management and technical assistance. Intermediaries set their own lending requirements
and generally require some type of collateral as well as the personal guarantee of the business owner. See
Microloan Program, U.S. Small Business Administration, available at
http://www.sba.gov/content/microloan-program.

362

Many startups and small businesses may find loan requirements imposed by financial
institutions difficult to meet and may not be able to rely on these institutions to secure funding.
For example, financial institutions generally require a borrower to provide collateral and/or a
guarantee, 1265 which startups, small businesses and their owners may not be able to provide.
Collateral and/or a guarantee may similarly be required for loans guaranteed by the SBA.
Another source of debt financing for startups and small businesses is peer-to-peer lending,
which began developing in 2005. 1266 Such debt transactions are facilitated by online platforms
that connect borrowers and lenders and potentially offer small businesses additional flexibility on
pricing, repayment schedules, collateral or guarantee requirements, and other terms. Some market
participants offer a secondary market for loans originated on their own sites. 1267 At least one of
the platforms sells third-party issued securities to multiple individual investors, thus improving the
liquidity of these securities. 1268 Like in any traditional lending arrangement, however, borrowers
are required to make regular payments to their lenders. This requirement could make it a less
attractive option for small businesses with negative cash flows and short operating histories, both
of which may make it more difficult for such businesses to demonstrate their ability to repay
loans. According to some estimates, the global volume of “lending-based” crowdfunding, which

As of the end of SBA fiscal year 2014, the SBA Microloans outstanding equaled $136.7 billion. See Small
Business Administration Unpaid Loan Balances by Program, available at
https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/files/WDS_Table1_UPB_Report.pdf.
1265

Approximately 92% of all small business debt to financial institutions is secured, and about 52% of that debt
is guaranteed, primarily by the owners of the firm. See Berger, note 1251.

billion in 2014.1269
Technology has facilitated the growth of alternative models of small business lending.
According to one study, 1270 the outstanding portfolio balance of online lenders has doubled every
year, although this market represents less than $10 billion in outstanding loan capital as of the
fourth quarter of 2013. Several models of online small business lending have emerged: online
lenders raising capital from institutional investors and lending on their own account (for example,
short-term loan products similar to a merchant cash advance); peer-to-peer platforms; and “lender‐
agnostic” online marketplaces that facilitate small business borrower access to various loan
products (such as term loans, lines of credit, merchant cash advances and factoring products) from
traditional and alternative lenders. 1271 According to the 2014 Small Business Credit survey, 1272
18% of all small businesses surveyed applied for credit with an online lender. The survey also
showed differences in the use of online lenders by type of borrower: 22% of small businesses
categorized in the survey as “startups” (i.e., businesses that have been in business for less than

peer-to-business lending to small businesses as “lending-based” crowdfunding. The discussion in this
economic analysis refers to peer-to-peer business lending more broadly in a sense synonymous with
“lending-based” crowdfunding.

Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. The survey authors note that since the sample is not a random sample, results
were reweighted for industry, age, size, and geography to reduce coverage bias. See Federal Reserve Banks

categorized in the survey as “growers” (i.e., businesses that were profitable and experienced an
increase in revenue) applied with online lenders, and 3% of small businesses categorized in the
survey as “mature firms” (i.e., businesses that have been in business for more than five years, had
over ten employees, and had prior debt) applied with an online lender. The latter two categories
of small businesses were more likely to apply for credit with bank lenders than with online
lenders.
Microfinance is another source of debt financing for startups and small businesses.
Microfinance consists of small, working capital loans provided by microfinance institutions
(“MFIs”) that are invested in microenterprises or income-generating activities. 1273 The typical
users of microfinance services and, in particular, of microcredit are family-owned enterprises or
self-employed, low-income entrepreneurs, such as street vendors, farmers, service providers,
artisans and small producers, who live close to the poverty line in both urban and rural areas. 1274
The microfinance market has evolved and grown considerably in the past decades. While
data on the size of the overall industry is sparse, according to one report, in fiscal year 2012, the
U.S. microfinance industry was estimated to have disbursed $292.1 million across 36,936
microloans and was estimated to have $427.6 million in outstanding microloans (across 45,744 in
microloans). 1275 As of 2013, this report identified 799 microenterprise programs that provide

Venture Capitalists and Angel Investors

Startups and small businesses also may seek funding from venture capitalists (“VCs”) and
angel investors. Entrepreneurs seek VC and angel financing usually after they have exhausted
sources of capital that generally do not require the entrepreneurs to relinquish control rights (e.g.,
personal funds from family and friends).
According to data from the National Venture Capital Association, in calendar year 2014,
VCs invested approximately $49.3 billion in 4,361 transactions involving 3,665 companies, which
included seed, early-stage, expansion, and late-stage companies. Seed and early-stage deals
represented 1.5% and 32.2%, respectively, of the dollar volume of deals and 4.4% and 49.7%,
respectively of the overall number of VC deals. 1277

Some startups, however, may struggle to attract funding from VCs because VCs tend to
invest in startups with certain characteristics. A defining feature of VCs is that they tend to focus
on startup companies with high-growth potential and a high likelihood of going public after a few
years of financing. VCs also tend to invest in companies that have already used some other
sources of financing, tend to be concentrated in certain geographic regions (e.g., California and
Massachusetts) and often require their investments to have an attractive business plan, meet
certain growth benchmarks or fill a specific portfolio or industry niche. 1278 In addition, when
investing in companies, VCs tend to acquire significant control rights (e.g., board seats, rights of
first refusal, etc.), which they gradually relinquish as the company approaches an initial public
offering. 1279 In 2014, according to an industry source, information technology and
medical/health/life sciences deals attracted the largest dollar volume of VC financing. 1280

367

According to a 2012 academic study, VCs appear to focus on scale or potential for scale rather
than short-term profitability in their selection of targets, and firms that receive VC financing tend
to be significantly larger than non-VC firms, based on employment and sales. 1281
According to a recent report, angel investments amounted to $24.1 billion in 2014, with
approximately 73,400 entrepreneurial ventures receiving angel funding and approximately
316,600 active angel investors. 1282 In 2014, angel investments were concentrated in software,
healthcare, and IT services. The average angel deal size was approximately $328,500.
Seed/startup stage deals accounted for 25% and early stage deals accounted for 46%. 1283 As
suggested by an academic study, angel investors tend to invest in younger companies than
VCs. 1284

Current Crowdfunding Practices

A recent crowdfunding industry report 1285 defines the current crowdfunding activity in the
United States generally as “lending-based,” 1286 “reward-based,” “donation-based,” “royaltybased,” “equity-based,” 1287 and “hybrid.” We note that the definitions of crowdfunding types

1287

The report does not identify which jurisdictions were represented in the survey. For example, France, Italy,
Japan, and the UK have adopted specialized equity crowdfunding regimes. It should be noted that “equitybased” crowdfunding is not a one-size-fits-all model. The crowdfunding regimes in these four countries
differ on a number of dimensions (e.g., securities allowed to be sold by issuers, or types of issuers allowed to
use the exemption), amongst themselves and when compared to Regulation Crowdfunding. Some number
also allow equity crowdfunding through their general securities laws. See Eleanor Kirby and Shane Worner,

used in this industry report and the characteristics of crowdfunding activity currently in existence
are not directly comparable to the contours of security-based crowdfunding transactions
contemplated by the rules being adopted today. Thus, considerable caution must be exercised
when generating projections of future crowdfunding volume from current activity broadly
attributed to the “crowdfunding” industry. In particular, the industry report defines reward-based
crowdfunding as a model where funders receive a “reward,” such as a perk or a pre-order of a
product, and it defines donation-based crowdfunding as a model where funders make
philanthropic donations to causes that they want to support, with no return on their investment
expected. 1288 According to the industry report, royalty-based crowdfunding, which involves a
percentage of revenue from a license or a usage-based fee for the other parties’ right to the
ongoing use of an asset, continues to grow. 1289
The industry report indicates that, in 2014, crowdfunding platforms raised approximately
$16.2 billion globally, which represented a 167% increase over the amount raised in 2013. 1290
These amounts include various types of crowdfunding: lending-based crowdfunding accounted
for the largest share of volume (approximately $11.08 billion) followed by equity-based
crowdfunding (approximately $1.11 billion), reward-based crowdfunding (approximately $1.33
billion), donation-based crowdfunding (approximately $1.94 billion), royalty-based crowdfunding

2014, North American crowdfunding volume was approximately $9.46 billion, which represented
a 145% increase over the amount raised in 2013 1292 (including approximately $1.23 billion in
reward-based crowdfunding, approximately $959 million in donation-based crowdfunding, and
approximately $787.5 million in equity-based crowdfunding, with the remainder comprised of
lending-based, royalty-based, and hybrid models 1293). The industry report further indicates that
global equity-based crowdfunding volume grew by 182% in 2014. 1294 According to the report,
this rapid growth in equity-based crowdfunding has been driven largely by North America and
Europe. 1295
The industry report further indicates that, in 2014 the worldwide average size of a funded
campaign was less than $4,000 for consumer lending-based, reward-based, and donation-based
crowdfunding types. 1296 Crowdfunded business loans and equity-based campaigns, however,
were substantially higher. In 2014, the global average size of a funded peer-to-business lendingbased crowdfunding campaign was $103,618. 1297 In 2014, a typical equity-based campaign was
larger, with the global average size of $275,461. 1298 These figures suggest that the types of

through other crowdfunding methods. In 2014, the average size of a funded equity-based
campaign in North America was $175,000. 1299
Since the passage of the JOBS Act, many U.S. states have made changes to their securities
laws to accommodate intrastate securities-based crowdfunding transactions. Based on
information from NASAA, as of September 2015, 29 states and the District of Columbia have
enacted state crowdfunding provisions that rely, at the federal level, on the intrastate offering
exemptions under Securities Act Section 3(a)(11) and Rule 147 or on Rule 504 of Regulation D.
These state crowdfunding rules allow businesses in a state to use securities-based crowdfunding to
raise capital from investors within that state. 1300 There is limited information available to us about
the scope of domestic crowdfunding activity in reliance on the intrastate exemptions. Since
December 2011, when the first state (Kansas) enacted its crowdfunding provisions, 118 state
crowdfunding offerings have been reported to be filed with the respective state regulator and 102
were reported to be approved or cleared, as of August 1, 2015. 1301

Survival Rates for Startups and Small Businesses

Startups and small businesses that lack tangible assets or business experience needed to
obtain conventional financing might turn to securities-based crowdfunding in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6) as an attractive potential source of financing. There is broad evidence that many

of these potential issuers are likely to fail after receiving funding. For example, a 2010 study
reports that of a random sample of 4,022 new high-technology businesses started in 2004, only
68% survived by the end of 2008. 1302
Similarly, other studies suggest that startups and small businesses financed by venture
capitalists also tend to have high failure rates. One study finds that for 16,315 VC-backed
companies that received their first institutional funding round between 1980 and 1999,
approximately one-third failed after the first funding round. 1303 Additionally, another study of
more than 2,000 companies that received at least $1 million in venture funding, from 2004
through 2010, finds that almost three-quarters of these companies failed. 1304 Another study, based
on a sample ending in 2005, found cumulative failure rates of 34.1% for VC-financed firms and
66.3% for non-VC-financed firms, with the difference driven by lower failure rates of VCfinanced firms in the initial years after receiving VC financing. 1305
Taken all together, the failure rates documented in these studies are high for startups and
small businesses, even with the involvement of sophisticated investors like VCs. Because we
expect that issuers that will engage in offerings made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) will be in an
earlier stage of business development than the businesses included in the above studies, we

Market Participants

The final rules will have their most significant impact on the market for the financing of
startups and small businesses. The number of participants in this market and the amounts raised
through alternative sources indicate that this is a large market. In 2013, there were more than 5
million small businesses, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as having fewer than 500 paid
employees. 1306 As of June 2014, FDIC-insured depositary institutions held approximately $590
billion in approximately 23.4 million small business loans. 1307 According to the SBA’s fiscal year
2014 annual performance report, approximately 51,500 small businesses received funding in 2014
through SBA’s main lending programs, 7(a) and 504 loans. 1308 In 2014, VCs invested $49.3
billion of capital in in 4,361 transactions involving 3,665 startups, according to an industry
source. 1309 In 2014, angel investors contributed $24.1 billion, with approximately 73,400
entrepreneurial ventures receiving angel funding. 1310
Below, we analyze the economic effect of the final rules on the following parties:
(1) issuers, typically startups and small businesses, that seek to raise capital by issuing securities;
(2) intermediaries through which issuers seeking to engage in transactions in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6) will offer and sell their securities; (3) investors who purchase or may consider

purchasing securities in such offerings; and (4) other capital providers, broker-dealers and finders
who currently participate in private offerings. The potential economic impact of the final rules
will depend on how these market participants respond to the final rules. Each of these parties is
discussed in further detail below.
a.

Issuers

The final rules will permit certain entities to raise capital by issuing securities for the first
time. The number, type and size of the potential issuers that will seek to use crowdfunding to
offer and sell securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) is uncertain, but data on current market
practices may help identify the number and characteristics of potential issuers.
It is challenging to precisely predict the number of future securities offerings that might
rely on Section 4(a)(6), particularly because rules governing the process are being adopted
today. 1311
According to filings made with the Commission, from 2009 to 2014, there were
approximately 4,559 issuers per year in new Regulation D offerings with offer sizes of up to $1
million (excluding issuers that are pooled investment vehicles), including approximately 1,020
(22%) per year that reported having no revenue and approximately 861 (19%) per year that
reported revenues of up to $1 million.1312 Among issuers in new Regulation D offerings with
offer sizes of up to $1 million (excluding issuers that are pooled investment vehicles) during this
period, the overwhelming majority of issuers (approximately 80%) are younger than 5 years old,

1311

See also Section IV.B.1.

1312

In addition, in an average year, approximately 50% of issuers in new Regulation D offerings with offer sizes
of up to $1 million (excluding issuers that are pooled investment vehicles) declined to disclose their
revenues. It is also possible that some issuers in Regulation D offerings that report revenues in excess of $1
million may participate in offerings in reliance on Section 4(a)(6).

374

with the median age of approximately one year. Approximately 92% of these issuers were
organized as either a corporation or a limited liability company.
It is expected that many future issuers of securities in crowdfunding offerings would have
otherwise raised capital from one of the alternative sources of financing discussed above, while
others would have been financed by friends and family or not financed at all. Due to the
differences between small business loans (including SBA-guaranteed loans) and securities-based
crowdfunding offerings that can be conducted under the final rules, we are not able to estimate
how many small businesses utilizing these forms of financing may instead pursue an offering in
reliance on Section 4(a)(6). Similarly, due to the differences between the terms of crowdfunding
campaigns in existence today and the provisions of the final rules, is not clear how many current
campaigns can instead become offerings in reliance on Section 4(a)(6). 1313 Hence, while some of
the businesses using these alternative funding sources may become issuers offering and selling
securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) in the future, we cannot know how many of these
businesses will elect securities-based crowdfunding in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) once it becomes
available, nor can we know how many future businesses may not be financed at all.
We believe that many potential issuers of securities through crowdfunding will be startups
and small businesses that are close to the “idea” stage of the business venture and that have

1313

A recent industry report estimated that the equity-based crowdfunding volume in North America in 2014 was
$787.5 million and the average size of a successful equity-based crowdfunding campaign was $175,000. See
Massolution 2015 at 55 and 60. This allows us to estimate approximately 4,500 successful equity-based
crowdfunding campaigns for North America in 2014. The report does not provide statistics for the United
States alone. Equity-based crowdfunding campaigns in the United States are currently limited to accredited
investors or intrastate offerings in certain jurisdictions. Further, the industry report does not provide
information that would allow us to estimate the number of crowdfunding campaigns of other types (such as
reward-based or donation-based) in North America or the United States in 2014. We note that many such
campaigns, particularly those that relate to individual projects, may not have a defined or sustained business
model commensurate with typical issuers of securities. In particular, many of the current reward-based or
donation-based crowdfunding projects likely entail endeavors that may not be suitable to a long-lived
securities issuance (e.g., certain artistic endeavors or artistic projects).

375

business plans that are not sufficiently well-developed or do not offer the growth potential or
business model to attract VCs or angel investors. In this regard, a study of one large platform
revealed that relatively few companies on that platform operate in technology sectors that
typically attract VC investment activity. 1314
b.

Intermediaries

Section 4(a)(6)(C) requires that an offer and sale of securities in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6) be conducted through a registered funding portal or a broker. Registered brokerdealers, both those that are already registered with the Commission and those that will register,
might wish to facilitate securities-based crowdfunding transactions. New entrants that do not wish
to register as broker-dealers might decide to register as funding portals to facilitate securitiesbased crowdfunding transactions in reliance on Section 4(a)(6). Donation-based or reward-based
crowdfunding platforms with established customer relationships might seek to leverage these
relationships and register as funding portals, or register as or associate with registered brokerdealers. Although the number of potential intermediaries that will fill these roles is uncertain,
practices of existing broker-dealers and crowdfunding platforms provide insight into how the
market might develop.
Based on FOCUS Reports filed with the Commission, as of December 2014, there were
4,267 broker-dealers registered with the Commission, with average total assets of approximately
$1.1 billion per broker-dealer. The aggregate total assets of these registered broker-dealers are
approximately $4.9 trillion. Of these registered broker-dealers, 816 also are dually registered as
investment advisers.

2013), available at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2088298.

376

Existing crowdfunding platforms are diverse and actively involved in financing, allowing
thousands of projects to search for capital. A recent industry report estimates that, as of 2014,
1,250 crowdfunding platforms were operating worldwide, including 375 platforms operating in
North America. 1315 Globally, approximately 19% (236) of platforms were engaged in equitybased crowdfunding, 18.3% in lending-based crowdfunding, 22.6% in donation-based
crowdfunding, 28.9% in reward-based crowdfunding, with the remainder engaged in royaltybased and hybrid crowdfunding. 1316 An earlier industry report indicated that crowdfunding
platforms typically charge entrepreneurs a “transaction fee” that is based on how large the target
amount is and/or upon reaching the target and that fees from survey participants worldwide ranged
from 2% to 25%, with an average of 7% in North America and Europe. 1317 The 2012 industry
report provides one case study of fees for a “large-securities-based CFP” stating “[t]here are no
management fees for uncommitted capital, but a “2 and 20” arrangement is set on deals
funded.” 1318
We do not know at present which market participants will become intermediaries under
Section 4(a)(6) and Regulation Crowdfunding, but we believe that existing crowdfunding
platforms might seek to leverage their already-existing Internet-based platforms, brand
recognition and user bases to facilitate offerings in reliance on Section 4(a)(6). 1319

1319

For example, the Massolution 2012 industry report suggests that funding portal reputation is important in the
crowdfunding market, especially for equity-based crowdfunding. See Massolution 2012 at 46.

377

Under the statute and the final rules, funding portals are constrained in the services they
can provide, and persons (or entities) seeking the ability to participate in activities unavailable to
funding portals, such as offering investment advice or holding, managing, possessing or otherwise
handling investor funds, would instead need to register as broker-dealers or investment advisers,
depending on their activities. Although we expect that initially, upon adoption of the final rules,
more new registrants will register as funding portals than as broker-dealers given the less
extensive regulatory requirements imposed on funding portals, it is possible that market
competition to offer broker-dealer services as part of intermediaries’ service capabilities might
either drive more broker-dealer growth in the longer term or provide registered funding portals
with the incentive to form long-term partnerships with registered broker-dealers. One commenter
suggested that funding portals may find it beneficial to cooperate with registered broker-dealers
and transfer agents. 1320 Other commenters on the proposal did not provide additional information
on this issue. There is anecdotal evidence that such partnerships are already forming under
existing regulations in crowdfunding transactions involving accredited investors. 1321 The final
rules provide that intermediaries will be deemed to have satisfied the requirement to have a
reasonable basis for believing that an issuer has established means to keep accurate records of the

has engaged the services of a registered transfer agent. 1322 This registered transfer agent safe
harbor may lead intermediaries to encourage issuers to use a registered transfer agent.
c.

Investors

It is unclear what types of investors will participate in offerings made in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6), but given the investment limitations in the final rules, we believe that many
investors affected by the final rules will likely be individual retail investors who currently do not
have broad access to investment opportunities in early-stage ventures. Offerings made in reliance
on Section 4(a)(6) may provide retail investors with additional investment opportunities, although
the extent to which they invest in such offerings will likely depend on their view of the potential
return on investment as well as the risk for fraud.
In contrast, larger, more sophisticated or well-funded investors may be less likely to invest
in offerings made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6). The relatively low investment limits set by the
statute for crowdfunding investors may make these offerings less attractive for professional
investors, including VCs and angel investors. 1323 While an offering made in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6) can bring an issuer to the attention of these investors, it is possible that
professional investors will prefer, instead, to invest in offerings in reliance on Rule 506, which are
not subject to the investment limitations applicable to offerings made in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6).

1322

See Rule 301(b) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

1323

An observer suggests that, unlike angels, VCs may be less interested in crowdfunding because, if VCs rely
on crowdfunding sites for their deal flow, it would be difficult to justify charging a 2% management fee and
20% carried interest to their limited partners. See Ryan Caldbeck, Crowdfunding – Why Angels, Venture
Capitalists And Private Equity Investors All May Benefit, FORBES, Aug. 7, 2013.

379

d.

Other Capital Providers, Broker-Dealers and Finders in Private
Offerings

The final rules may affect other parties that provide sources of capital, such as small
business lenders, VCs, family and friends and angel investors that currently finance small private
businesses. The current scope of financing provided by these capital providers is discussed above.
As discussed below, the magnitude of the final rules’ economic impact will depend on whether
crowdfunding in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) emerges as a substitute or a complement to these
financing sources.
In addition, issuers conducting private offerings may, outside of offerings in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6), currently use broker-dealers to help them with various aspects of the offering and
to help ensure compliance with the ban on general solicitation and advertising that exists for most
private offerings. Private offerings also could involve finders who connect issuers with investors
for a fee. 1324 These private offering intermediaries also may be affected by the final rules, because
once issuers can undertake offerings in reliance on Section 4(a)(6), some issuers might no longer
need the services of those broker-dealers and finders.
Although we are unable to predict the exact size of the market for broker-dealers and
finders in private offerings that are comparable to those that the final rules permit, data on the use
of broker-dealers and finders in the Regulation D markets suggest that they may not currently play
a large role in private offerings. Based on a staff study, only 21% of all new Regulation D
offerings from 2009 to 2014 used an intermediary such as a broker-dealer or a finder. 1325 The use
of a broker-dealer or a finder increased with offering size; they participated in approximately 17%

1324

Depending on their activities, these persons may need to be registered as broker-dealers.

1325

See Unregistered Offerings White Paper, note 1230.

380

of offerings for up to $1 million and 30% of offerings for more than $50 million. Moreover, the
fee tends to decrease with offering size. Unlike the gross spreads in registered offerings, the
differences in fees for Regulation D offerings of different sizes are large: the average total fee
(commission plus finder fee) paid by issuers conducting offerings of up to $1 million (6.4% in
2014) is almost three times larger on a percentage basis than the average total fee paid by issuers
conducting offerings of more than $50 million (1.9% in 2014). 1326 These estimates, however,
only reflect practices in the Regulation D market. It is possible that issuers engaging in other
types of private offerings (e.g., those relying on Section 4(a)(2)), for which we do not have data,
may use broker-dealers and finders more frequently and have different fee structures.
B.

Analysis of Final Rules

As noted above, we are mindful of the costs and benefits of the final rules, as well as the
impact that the final rules may have on efficiency, competition and capital formation. In enacting
Title III, Congress established a framework for a new type of exempt offering and required us to
adopt rules to implement that framework. To the extent that crowdfunding rules are successfully
utilized, the crowdfunding provisions of the JOBS Act are expected to provide startups and small
businesses with the means to raise relatively modest amounts of capital, from a broad cross
section of investors, through securities offerings that are exempt from registration under the
Securities Act. They also are expected to permit small investors to participate in a wider range of
securities offerings than may be currently available. 1327 Specifically, the statutory provisions and
the final rules address several challenges specific to financing startups and small businesses,
including, for example, accessing a large number of investors, the regulatory requirements
1326

See, e.g., 158 CONG. REC. S1781 (daily ed. Mar. 19, 2012) (statement of Sen. Carl Levin) (“Right now, the
rules generally prohibit a company from raising very small amounts from ordinary investors without
significant costs.”).

381

associated with issuing a security, protecting investors and making such securities offerings costeffective for the issuer.
In the sections below, we analyze the costs and benefits associated with the crowdfunding
regulatory regime, as well as the potential impacts of such a regulatory regime on efficiency,
competition and capital formation, in light of the baseline discussed above.
1.

Broad Economic Considerations

In this release, we discuss the potential costs and benefits of the final rules. Many of these
costs and benefits are difficult to quantify or estimate with any degree of certainty, especially
considering that Section 4(a)(6) provides a new method for raising capital in the United States.
Some costs are difficult to quantify or estimate because they represent transfers between various
participants in a market that does not yet exist. For instance, costs to issuers can be passed on to
investors and costs to intermediaries can be passed on to issuers and investors. These difficulties
in estimating and quantifying such costs are exacerbated by the limited public data that indicates
how issuers, intermediaries and investors will respond to these new capital raising opportunities.
The discussion below highlights several general areas where uncertainties about the new
crowdfunding market might affect the potential costs and benefits of the final rules, as well as our
ability to quantify those costs and benefits. It also highlights the potential effects on efficiency,
competition and capital formation.
The extent to which the statute and the final rules affect capital formation and the cost of
capital to issuers depends in part on the issuers that choose to participate. In particular, if
offerings in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) only attract issuers that are otherwise able to raise capital
through another type of exempt offering, the statute and the final rules may result in a

382

redistribution of capital flow, which may enhance allocative efficiency but have a limited impact
on the aggregate level of capital formation. 1328
Notwithstanding the existence of these alternative methods of capital raising, we believe
that offerings pursuant to Section 4(a)(6) will likely represent a new source of capital for many
small issuers that currently have difficulty raising capital. Startups and small businesses usually
have smaller and more variable cash flows than larger, more established companies, and internal
financing from their own business operations tends to be limited and unstable. Moreover, these
businesses tend to have smaller asset bases 1329 and, thus, less collateral for traditional bank loans.
As discussed above, startups and small businesses, which are widely viewed to have more
financial constraints than publicly-traded companies and large private companies, could therefore
benefit significantly from a securities-based crowdfunding market. Some small businesses may
not qualify for traditional bank loans and may find alternative debt financing too costly or
incompatible with their financing needs. While some small businesses may attract equity
investments from angel investors or VCs, other small businesses, particularly, businesses at the
seed stage may have difficulty obtaining external equity financing from these sources. We believe
that the statute, as implemented by the final rules, may increase both capital formation and the
efficiency of capital allocation among small issuers by expanding the range of methods of external
financing available to small businesses and the pool of investors willing to finance such types of

1328

For example, a 2012 GAO report on Regulation A offerings suggests that a significant decline in the use of
this funding alternative after 1997 could be partially attributed to a shift to Rule 506 offerings under
Regulation D, as a result of the preemption of state law registration requirements for Rule 506 offerings that
occurred in 1996. See GAO Report, note 1231.

1329

383

businesses. The extent to which such issuers will use the Section 4(a)(6) offering exemption,
however, is difficult to assess.
If startups and small businesses find other capital raising options more attractive than
securities-based crowdfunding, the impact of Section 4(a)(6) on capital formation may be limited.
Even so, the availability of securities-based crowdfunding as a financing option may increase
competition among suppliers of capital, resulting in a potentially lower cost of capital for all
issuers, including those that choose not to use securities-based crowdfunding.
For issuers that pursue offerings in reliance on Section 4(a)(6), establishing an initial
offering price might be challenging. Offerings relying on Section 4(a)(6) will not involve an
underwriter who, for larger offerings, typically assists the issuer with pricing and placing the
offering. Investors in offerings relying on Section 4(a)(6) may lack the sophistication to evaluate
the offering price. Thus, the involvement of these investors, who are likely to have a more limited
capacity for conducting due diligence on deals, may contribute to less accurate valuations.
Moreover, because of the investment limitations in securities-based crowdfunding
transactions, there may not be a strong incentive, even assuming adequate knowledge and
experience, for an investor to perform a thorough analysis of the issuer disclosures. To the extent
that these potential information asymmetries resulting from the lack of a thorough analysis of the
disclosures are anticipated by prospective investors, investor participation in offerings made in
reliance on Section 4(a)(6) may decline and the associated benefits of capital formation may be
lower.
Uncertainty surrounding exit strategies for investors in crowdfunding offerings also may
limit the benefits. In particular, it is unlikely that purchasers in crowdfunding transactions will be
able to follow the typical path to liquidity that investors in other exempt offerings follow. For
384

instance, investors in a VC-backed startup may eventually sell their securities in an initial public
offering on a national securities exchange or to another company in an acquisition. 1330 We
anticipate that most businesses engaging in offerings in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) will be
unlikely to progress directly to an initial public offering on a national securities exchange given
their small size, 1331 and investors may lack adequate strategies or opportunities to eventually
divest their holdings. 1332 A sale of the business will require the issuer to have a track record in
order to attract investors with the capital willing to buy the business.
Further, the likely broad geographical dispersion of crowdfunding investors may make
shareholder coordination difficult. It may also exacerbate information asymmetries between
issuers and investors, if the distance between them diminishes the ability for investors to capitalize
on local knowledge that may be of value in assessing the viability of the issuer’s business. The
use of electronic means may mitigate some of these difficulties. Even if an issuer can execute a
sale or otherwise offer to buy back or retire the securities, it might be difficult for investors to
determine whether the issuer is offering a fair market price. These uncertainties may limit the use
of the Section 4(a)(6) exemption.
The potential benefits of the final rules also may depend on how investors respond to
potential liquidity issues unique to the securities-based crowdfunding market. It is currently
unclear how securities offered and sold in transactions conducted in reliance on Section 4(a)(6)
1330

See Gompers, note 1249.

1331

As noted, under the statute and the final rules, issuers relying on Section 4(a)(6) would be limited to raising
an aggregate of $1 million during a 12-month period. By contrast, as noted in the IPO Task Force, the size
of an initial public offering generally exceeds $50 million. See IPO Task Force, note 1223.

1332

In contrast, given the required investor qualifications and offering limit amounts, Regulation D offerings
may generally attract issuers that are more experienced and better capitalized. Moreover, such offerings are
likely to have a larger proportion of accredited investors because, in contrast to securities-based
crowdfunding, there are no limitations on individual investment amounts. As a result, we believe that
Regulation D issuers and investors are more likely to have potential exit strategies in place.

will be transferred in the secondary market after the one-year restricted period ends, and investors
who purchased securities in transactions conducted in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) and who seek to
divest their securities may not find a liquid market. 1333 Assuming a secondary market develops,
securities may be quoted on the over-the-counter market or on trading platforms for shares of
private companies. 1334 Nevertheless, it is possible that secondary trading costs for investors may
be substantial, effective and quoted spreads may be wide, trading volume may be low, and price
volatility may be high compared to those of listed securities. 1335 Illiquidity, to different degrees,
remains a concern for other exempt offerings and for registered offerings by small issuers.
However, because investors purchasing securities sold in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) may be less
sophisticated than investors in other private offerings due to the fact that there are no investor
qualification requirements, they may face additional challenges in addressing the impact of
illiquidity, either in finding a suitable trading venue or negotiating with the issuer for an
alternative liquidity option. The potentially high degree of illiquidity associated with securities

1333

Academic studies have shown that the over-the-counter market is less liquid than the national exchanges.

Section of OTC Stocks, 26 REV. FIN. STUD. 2985–3028 (2013).

1334

Given the services that funding portals are permitted to provide under the statute and the final rules, investors
will not be able to use funding portals to trade in securities offered and sold in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) in
the secondary market.

1335

Academic studies show that reducing the information transparency about an issuer increases the effective
and quoted spreads of its shares, reduces share price and increases price volatility. Specifically, percentage
spreads triple and volatility doubles when NYSE issuers are delisted to the Pink Sheets. See Jonathan
Macey, Maureen O’Hara and David Pompilio, Down and Out in the Stock Market: The Law and Finance of
the Delisting Process, 51 J.L. & ECON 683–713 (2008). When NASDAQ issuers delist and subsequently
trade on the OTC Bulletin Board and/or the Pink Sheets, share volume declines by two-thirds, quoted
spreads more than double, effective spreads triple and volatility triples. See Jeffrey H. Harris, Venkatesh
Panchapagesan and Ingrid M. Werner, Off But Not Gone: A Study of NASDAQ Delistings, Fisher College of
Business Working Paper No. 2008-03-005 and Dice Center Working Paper No. 2008-6 (Mar. 4, 2008),
available at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=628203. One factor that may alleviate
transparency concerns is the fact that issuers that sold securities in an offering made in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6) will have an ongoing reporting obligation, so disclosure of information about the issuer will
continue to be required.

386

purchased in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) may discourage some investors from investing in issuers
through such offerings, thus limiting the potential efficiency, competition and capital formation
benefits of the final rules.
Even with the mandated disclosures, unsophisticated investors purchasing securities issued
in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) may face certain expropriation risks, potentially limiting the upside
of their investment, even when they select investments in successful ventures. This can occur if
issued securities include certain features (e.g., callable securities or securities with differential
control rights) or if issuers conduct insider-only financing rounds or financing rounds at reduced
prices (so-called “down rounds”) that have the effect of diluting an investor’s interest or otherwise
diminishing the value of the securities offered and sold in reliance on Section 4(a)(6). Investors
purchasing securities issued in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) may not have the experience or the
market power to negotiate various anti-dilution provisions, right of first refusal, tag-along rights,
superior liquidation preferences and rights upon a change in control that have been developed by
institutional and angel investors as protections against fundamental changes in a business. 1336
Moreover, the disperse ownership stakes of investors in securities-based crowdfunding offerings
may weaken their incentives to monitor the issuer to minimize the risk of expropriation. The
ensuing expropriation risk may discourage some investors from participating in offerings made in
reliance on Section 4(a)(6), potentially limiting the efficiency, competition and capital formation
benefits of the final rules.
The final rules also may have an effect on broker-dealers and finders participating in
private offerings. Some issuers that previously relied on broker-dealers and finders to assist with
raising capital through private offerings may, instead, begin to rely on the Section 4(a)(6)
1336

See Kaplan, note 1279.

387

exemption to find investors. The precise impact of the final rules on these intermediaries will
depend on whether (and, if so, to what extent) issuers switch from using existing exemptions to
using the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(6) or whether the final rules primarily attract new
issuers. The impact of the final rules on registered broker-dealers will also depend on the extent to
which broker-dealers participate as intermediaries in the securities-based crowdfunding market. If
a significant number of issuers switch from raising capital under existing private offering
exemptions to relying on the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(6), this may negatively affect
the revenue of finders and broker-dealers in the private offerings market. While this may
disadvantage existing private offering market intermediaries, the new competition may ultimately
lead to more efficient allocation of capital.
If securities-based crowdfunding primarily attracts new issuers to the market, the impact
on broker-dealers and finder revenue may be negligible and the final rules may even have a
positive effect on their revenues by revealing more potential clients for them, particularly to the
extent that they chose to operate a funding portal. Additionally, greater investor interest in private
company investment may increase capital formation, creating new opportunities for brokerdealers and finders that otherwise would have been unavailable.
The final rules also may encourage current participants in the crowdfunding market to
diversify their funding models to attract a broader group of companies and to provide additional
investment opportunities for investors. For example, donation-based crowdfunding platforms that
currently offer investment opportunities in micro-loans generally do not permit donors to collect
interest on their investments because of concerns that this activity will implicate the federal

388

securities laws unless an exemption from registration is available. 1337 Under the final rules, these
platforms may choose to register as funding portals and permit businesses to offer securities that
provide investors with the opportunity to obtain a return on investment. This can broaden their
user base and attract a group of investors different from those already participating in rewardbased or donation-based crowdfunding. It is likely that some registered broker-dealers will find it
profitable to enter the securities-based crowdfunding market and operate funding portals as well.
Such an entry will increase the competition among intermediaries and likely lead to lower
issuance costs for issuers.
However, many projects that are well suited for reward-based or donation-based
crowdfunding (e.g., because they have finite lives, their payoffs to investors could come before
the project is completed or could be contingent on the project’s success, etc.) may have little in
common with startups and small businesses that are well suited for an offering in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6). As a result, diversification among existing platforms may not always be optimal
or preferred, particularly if complying with the final rules proves disproportionately costly
compared to the potential amount of capital to be raised.
2.

Crowdfunding Exemption
a.

Limitation on Capital Raised

The statute imposes certain limitations on the total amount of securities that may be sold
by an issuer during the 12-month period preceding the date of the transaction made in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6). Specifically, Section 4(a)(6)(A) provides for a maximum aggregate amount of $1
million sold in reliance on the exemption during a 12-month period. 1338 The final rules preserve

1337

See, e.g., Deutsche Bank Microcredit Development Fund, Inc., SEC No-Action Letter (Apr. 8, 2012).

1338

See also Rule 100(a)(1) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

389

the $1 million limit. The limitation on the amount that may be raised is expected to benefit
investors by reducing the potential loss from dilution or fraud 1339 in the securities-based
crowdfunding market. However, we recognize that this limit on the amount that may be sold in
reliance on Section 4(a)(6) also can prevent certain issuers from raising all the capital they need to
make their businesses viable, which in turn can result in lost opportunities, as indicated by various
commenters. 1340 It also is likely to limit efficiency to the extent that capital cannot be channeled
to the most productive use. Due to the lack of data, however, we are not able to quantify the
unrealized efficiency or capital formation associated with the adoption of the $1 million limit
instead of the alternative of a higher limit. Since issuers in securities-based crowdfunding
offerings bear certain fixed costs, as discussed in Section III.B.3., offering costs as a percentage of
offering proceeds will be larger under the $1 million limit than under the alternative of a higher
limit.
As an alternative, we could have defined the $1 million limit to be net of intermediary
fees, as suggested by some commenters. 1341 If a funding portal announces in advance the fees it

1339

While we lack information to predict the potential incidence of fraud in securities-based crowdfunding
offerings made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) and note that current crowdfunding practices differ
significantly from the securities-based crowdfunding market that may develop upon effectiveness of the final
rules, some concern has been expressed about the potential for fraud in this area. See, e.g., NASAA
Enforcement Report: 2015 Report on 2014 data, September 2015, available at
http://nasaa.cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2015-Enforcement-Report-on-2014Data_FINAL.pdf (listing Internet fraud (including social media and crowdfunding) among the products and
schemes that are frequently investigated by states, without statistics specific to securities-based
crowdfunding).

charges for a given transaction (fixed or variable), the economic effects of such an alternative
definition would be qualitatively similar to the effects of raising the offering limit. If the funding
portal fees are not known in advance, then this alternative may also create uncertainty for issuers
about how much capital they would be able to raise. Several commenters opposed such an
alternative. 1342
The costs associated with not increasing the investment limit above $1 million are
mitigated in part by the ability of issuers to concurrently seek additional financing in reliance on
another type of exempt offering, such as Regulation D or Regulation A, in addition to the offering
in reliance on Section 4(a)(6). In this release, we provide guidance clarifying our view that issuers
may conduct other exempt offerings without having those offerings integrated with the offering
made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6), provided that each offering complies with the applicable
exemption relied upon for that particular offering. Several commenters opposed this approach on
the ground that it could result in fewer investor protections than if the offerings were integrated.
Some commenters noted that a potential cost to investors associated with not requiring integration
is a reduction in investor protection due to the possibility of an issuer’s use of advertising for one
offering to indirectly promote another exempt offering that would have been subject to more
stringent advertising restrictions. 1343 While we recognize this concern, we note that the final rules
do not provide a blanket exemption from integration with other private offerings that are
conducted simultaneously with, or around the same time as, a Section 4(a)(6) offering. Rather, we
provide guidance that an offering made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) is not required to be

Recommendation; MCS Letter.

391

integrated with another exempt offering made by the issuer to the extent that each offering
complies with the requirements of the applicable exemption that is being relied upon for that
particular offering. As mentioned earlier, an issuer conducting a concurrent exempt offering for
which general solicitation is not permitted will need to be satisfied that purchasers in that offering
were not solicited by means of the offering made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6). Alternatively, an
issuer conducting a concurrent exempt offering for which general solicitation is permitted, for
example, under Rule 506(c), cannot include in any such general solicitation an advertisement of
the terms of an offering made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6), unless that advertisement otherwise
complies with Section 4(a)(6) and the final rules. This may partly alleviate some of commenters’
concerns because each offering will have the investor protections of the offering exemption upon
which it relies.
As an alternative, in line with the suggestions of some commenters, 1344 we could have
provided guidance that the amounts offered in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) should be integrated
with the amounts offered pursuant to other exempt offerings. Under such an alternative, the
amounts raised in other exempt offerings would count toward the maximum offering amount
under Section 4(a)(6). Such an alternative would potentially limit the amount of capital raised by
issuers, including the set of issuers eligible to conduct an exempt offering relying on
Section 4(a)(6), and thus potentially limit the capital formation benefits of the final rules.
Compared to this alternative, the ability of issuers to conduct other exempt offerings that do not
count toward the maximum offering amount under Section 4(a)(6) may alleviate some of the
concerns that certain issuers will not be able to raise sufficient capital. The net effect on capital

1344

See, e.g., AFL-CIO Letter; Brown J. Letter; Consumer Federation Letter; Fund Democracy Letter; MCS
Letter; NASAA Letter.

392

formation will also depend on whether issuers seeking an aggregate exempt offering amount in
excess of $1 million elect to rely on Regulation Crowdfunding as part of their capital raising or
elect to rely on a different exemption, such as Rule 506 of Regulation D. These considerations
and the relative differences in the investor protections associated with the different offering
exemptions will determine the net effect on the amount of information about issuers available to
market participants and the level of investor protection.
b.

Investment Limitations

Since offering documents for offerings made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) will not be
subject to review by Commission staff prior to the sale of securities, we are sensitive to potential
investor protection concerns arising from the participation of less sophisticated investors in these
exempt offerings. Some commenters 1345 raised concerns that the “wisdom of the crowd” will not
result in investors pooling information so as to lead to better informed investment decisions. 1346

1345

See, e.g., AFR Letter; Brown J. Letter; Consumer Federation Letter.

1346

Predictions in research studies regarding the impact of social interaction on investor decisions are mixed. On
the one hand, a recent study of opinions that were posted on the Internet website http://seekingalpha.com
finds evidence of predictability of earnings surprises and returns that is interpreted as potentially suggesting
the value relevance of user opinions rather than a naïve investor reaction. See Hailiang Chen, Prabuddha de,
Yu Hu, and Byoung-Hyoun Hwang, Wisdom of Crowds: The Value of Stock Opinions Transmitted Through
Social Media, 27 REV. FIN. STUD. 1367–1403 (2014). An earlier theoretical paper shows that word-of-mouth
can, under some circumstances, result in superior decisions. See Glenn Ellison and Drew Fudenberg, Wordof-Mouth Communication and Social Learning, 110 QUARTERLY J. ECON. 93–125 (1995). On the other hand,
some behavioral finance literature examines irrational herding and contagion of thought and behavior
through social interaction, such as the propagation of investing memes, which need not be predictive of
superior trading performance. For example, one article characterizes memes as “mental representation (such
as an idea, proposition, or catchphrase) that can be passed from person to person”. The article provides an
example of investors using “verbal ‘reasons’ to decide how to trade” and notes that these reasons “are often
not cogent”. The article notes that such reasons, or financial memes, can be simple or can be elaborate
structures of analysis, examples, terminology, catchphrases, and modeling. See for example, David A.
Hirshleifer and Siew Hong Teoh, Thought and Behavior Contagion in Capital Markets, HANDBOOK OF
FINANCIAL MARKETS: DYNAMICS AND EVOLUTION (2009). Another article compares the investment
decisions of stock clubs and individuals. It finds that while both individuals and clubs are more likely to
purchase stocks that are associated with “good reasons” (such as a company that is featured on a list of
“most-admired” companies), stock clubs favor such stocks more than individuals, despite the fact that such
reasons do not improve performance. The article analyzes social dynamics that may make “good reasons”
more important for groups than individuals. See Brad Barber, Chip Heath, and Terrance Odean, Good

393

While we acknowledge these concerns, we note that, by adding Section 4(a)(6) to the Securities
Act, Congress made an express determination to facilitate securities-based crowdfunding
transactions under the federal securities laws, subject to certain specified investor protections.
Consistent with the statute, the final rules incorporate several important investor
protections, including limits on the amount that can be raised, issuer eligibility criteria, and issuer
and intermediary requirements, including statutorily mandated investor education requirements.
The statute and the final rules also impose certain limitations on the aggregate dollar amount of
securities in offerings in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) that may be sold to an investor during a 12month period. 1347 These provisions are designed to limit the potential investment and,
consequently, the potential losses for any single investor, thus providing downside protection for
investors.
We recognize that these provisions also will limit the potential upside for investors. This
may particularly affect the decisions of investors with large portfolios who might be able to
absorb losses and understand the risks associated with risky investments and who may have more
expertise and stronger incentives to acquire and analyze information about an issuer. For these
investors, the $100,000 aggregate limit may reduce their incentive to participate in the securitiesbased crowdfunding market, compared to other types of investments, potentially depriving the
securities-based crowdfunding market of more experienced and knowledgeable investors and
impeding capital formation. Moreover, limiting the participation of such investors may negatively
affect the informational efficiency of the securities-based crowdfunding market because
sophisticated investors are better able to accurately price such offerings. These investors also can

394

add value to the discussions taking place through an intermediary’s communication channels
about a potential offering by providing their views on the issuer’s financial viability and potential
for fraud. Persons with larger portfolios are also likely to be in a better position to monitor the
issuer’s insiders, which can reduce the extent of moral hazard and the risk of fraud on the part of
the issuer and the issuer’s insiders, yielding benefits for all investors. Such investors also can add
value by advising the issuer and contributing strategic expertise, which can be particularly
beneficial for early-stage issuers. Some of these potential benefits, however, may still be
available to issuers that seek to attract such investors through another type of exempt offering,
such as a Regulation D offering.
The aggregate limit on crowdfunding investments also can impede the ability of investors
to diversify within the securities-based crowdfunding market. As securities-based crowdfunding
investments might have inherently high failure rates, 1348 investors who do not or cannot diversify
their investments across a number of offerings can face an increased risk of incurring large losses,
relative to their investments, even when they investigate offerings thoroughly. By comparison,
VC firms typically construct highly diversified portfolios with the understanding that many
ventures fail, resulting in a complete loss of some investments, but with the expectation that those
losses will be offset by the large upside of the relatively fewer investments that succeed. 1349 The
securities-based crowdfunding market is expected to involve earlier-stage financing compared to
venture capital financing, and therefore, the chances of investment success may be lower. 1350 The
statutory caps on aggregate securities-based crowdfunding investments under Section 4(a)(6) may

REV. 184−190 (2002)

395

limit an investor’s ability to choose a sufficiently large number of investments to offset this risk
and to recover the due diligence costs of sufficiently investigating individual investments. One
potential solution to this diversification problem is to invest smaller amounts in a greater number
of ventures. However, such a strategy has limited benefit to the extent that there is a fixed cost to
the due diligence associated with identifying and reviewing each investment opportunity, making
it more costly to implement than a strategy that relies on the selection of fewer investment
opportunities.
In a change from the proposed rules, both the investor’s annual income and net worth must
be above $100,000 for the 10 percent limitation to apply. This change is intended to strengthen
investor protections for investors whose annual income or net worth is below $100,000. Such
investors may not be as well situated to bear the risk of loss (e.g., in the event of fraud on the part
of an issuer) as investors with both income and net worth of $100,000 or more. According to
Commission staff analysis of the data in the 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances, approximately
17% of U.S. households have both income and net worth of $100,000 or higher. By comparison,
39% of U.S. households have either income or net worth of $100,000 or higher. 1351 Thus,
approximately 22% of households will be subject to a lower investment limit under the final rules
than under the proposal. We note that these figures are only available at the household level
rather than at the individual level. We further note that these figures do not account for the fact
that only some households might seek to invest in an offering in reliance on Section 4(a)(6).
Thus, we are not able to determine the actual percentage of investors affected by this change in the
final rules relative to the proposal.

1351

Based on data from the 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances, a triennial survey sponsored by the Federal
Reserve Board, available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/scf/scfindex.htm.

396

Within each investment limitation tier, the investment limitation percentage is multiplied
by the “lesser of” an investor’s annual income or net worth in the investment limitation
calculation, which was suggested by several commenters. 1352 This change from the proposal is
expected to reduce the permitted investment limit for each individual investor because most
investors are unlikely to have annual income and net worth amounts that are identical. 1353
Investment limitations will likely have a negative effect on capital formation. For
example, investment limitations may make it more difficult for some issuers to reach their funding
targets. However, these limits also are expected to reduce the risk and impact of potential loss for
investors that accompany the high failure rates associated with investments in small businesses
and startups, thus potentially improving investor protection. There is no available market data that
would allow us to empirically evaluate the magnitude of these effects.
Consistent with the proposed rules, the final rules allow an issuer to rely on the efforts that
an intermediary is required to undertake in order to determine that the aggregate amount of
securities purchased by an investor will not cause the investor to exceed the investor limits,
provided that the issuer does not have knowledge that the investor had exceeded, or would exceed,
the investor limits as a result of purchasing securities in the issuer’s offering, which was supported
by various commenters. 1354 This may result in aggregate verification cost savings since a given

See, e.g., AFR Letter; BetterInvesting Letter; Consumer Federation Letter; Fund Democracy Letter; Fryer
Letter; Growthfountain Letter; IAC Recommendation (but also stating that the “greater of” approach would
be appropriate for accredited investors); Merkley Letter; NASAA Letter; Schwartz Letter; Zhang Letter
(recommending that net worth not be used to calculate the investment limit).

1353

Although we lack information to determine the average change in the applicable investment limit resulting
from this change, based on Commission staff analysis of the 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances, a larger
percentage of households exceeded a particular dollar threshold, such as $100,000 or $200,000, based on the
net worth standard than the percentage of households that exceeded the same dollar threshold based on the
income standard.

intermediary may be involved in and have information on crowdfunding transactions pertaining to
the offerings of multiple issuers, which makes it potentially less costly to identify investors that
exceed the investment limitation. As a potential alternative, we could have imposed more
extensive verification requirements on issuers, which would have resulted in larger compliance
costs for issuers but could have potentially increased investor compliance with the investment
limitations, with corresponding investor protection benefits. As noted above, we believe the final
rules appropriately consider investor protection and facilitating capital formation.
c.

Issuer Eligibility

Section 4A(f) of the statute excludes certain categories of issuers from eligibility to engage
in securities-based crowdfunding transactions in reliance on Section 4(a)(6). The final rules
exclude those categories of issuers. 1355 The final rules also exclude two additional categories of
issuers, beyond those identified in the statute, from being eligible to rely on Section 4(a)(6) to
engage in crowdfunding transactions. First, the final rules exclude issuers that sold securities in
reliance on Section 4(a)(6) and have not filed with the Commission and provided to investors the
ongoing annual reports required by Regulation Crowdfunding during the two years immediately
preceding the filing of the required offering statement, 1356 which is generally consistent with
suggestions from several commenters. 1357 This additional exclusion is not expected to impose any

Letter; Public Startup Letter 2; RoC Letter; RocketHub Letter; Vann Letter; Wefunder Letter; Whitaker
Chalk Letter.
1355

These categories of issuers are: (1) issuers that are not organized under the laws of a state or territory of the
United States or the District of Columbia; (2) issuers that are subject to Exchange Act reporting
requirements; (3) investment companies as defined in the Investment Company Act or companies that are
excluded from the definition of investment company under Section 3(b) or 3(c) of the Investment Company
Act. See Section 4A(f). See also Rule 100(b) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

Democracy Letter; Grassi Letter; Joinvestor Letter; NASAA Letter; Wefunder Letter.

398

additional burdens and costs on an issuer that it would not have already incurred had it complied
with the ongoing reporting requirements as they came due. Further, the requirement that a
delinquent issuer prepare and file up to two annual reports at one time in order to become eligible
to rely on Section 4(a)(6) is expected to incentivize issuers to provide updated and current
information to investors, if they intend to rely again on Section 4(a)(6) to raise additional capital,
without necessarily requiring an issuer to become fully current in its reporting obligations. We
recognize that conditioning an issuer’s Section 4(a)(6) eligibility on the requirement that issuers
provide ongoing reports for only the previous two years may result in less information being
available to investors in some periods, with potential adverse effects on the price formation and
liquidity of the securities in the secondary market. The potential damage to an issuer’s reputation
resulting from being delinquent along with potential enforcement action for failure to comply with
a regulatory reporting obligation and the modification from the proposed rules to require an issuer
to disclose in its offering statement if it or any of its predecessors previously failed to comply with
the ongoing reporting requirements of Rule 203 of Regulation Crowdfunding, however, may help
to mitigate these potential adverse effects. As an alternative, we could have chosen not to impose
this exclusion or adopted a shorter look-back period, as suggested by some commenters. 1358
Compared to the provisions in the final rules, either of these alternatives could result in less
information being available to investors and reduced informational efficiency of securities prices
or possibly increased likelihood of issuer misconduct in offerings made in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6).
Second, the final rules exclude a company that has no specific business plan or has
indicated that its business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified
1358

See, e.g., ABA Letter; Parsont Letter; Projectheureka Letter; Public Startup Letter 2; RocketHub Letter.

399

company or companies, as suggested by several commenters. 1359 This requirement is intended to
help ensure that investors have adequate information about the issuer’s proposed business plan to
make an informed investment decision, which may increase investor protection in some instances.
As an alternative, we could have chosen not to impose this exclusion or to impose a less restrictive
exclusion, as suggested by several commenters. 1360 Although these alternatives might increase
capital formation by allowing a subset of additional issuers to rely on Section 4(a)(6), they may
also result in less informed investor decisions in such offerings.
Overall, categories of issuers that are excluded from eligibility under the final rules may be
at a competitive disadvantage relative to those that are eligible to offer securities under the final
rules, to the extent that excluded issuers may raise less external capital or incur a higher direct or
indirect cost of financing, or additional restrictions, when seeking financing from alternative
sources.

Issuer Requirements

Issuer Costs

We recognize that there are benefits and costs associated with Regulation Crowdfunding’s
requirements pertaining to issuers, including the final rule’s disclosure requirements. In the
Proposing Release, we provided cost estimates for each of these requirements and requested
comment on our estimates. 1361 In response, we received several comment letters providing
alternative cost estimates, some of which were lower and some of which were higher than the cost

estimates in the Proposing Release. 1362 For example, one commenter 1363 provided the following
cost estimates: portal fees of 6% to 15% 1364; accounting review fees of $1,950 to $9,000;
accounting audit fees of $3,100 to $9,000; financial statements/projections costs of $2,000 to
$5,000; Title III disclosure/compliance costs of $1,000 to $4,000; and corporate formation costs of
$300 to $500. 1365 In addition, the commenter estimated the total cost to raise $99,000 of capital
under the proposed rules to be $9,300 to $24,500 (9.4% to 24.7%); to raise $499,000 of capital to
be $33,240 to $84,750 (6.7% to 17%); and to raise $1 million of capital to be $72,800 to $168,500
(7.3% to 16.9%). The commenter stated that the entry of new vendors into the market and
ensuing competition may lead to a decline in some of these costs over time. Another
commenter 1366 estimated that a $200,000 offering will incur the following average costs: legal
fees of $10,000; intermediary fees of $20,000 (10%); accounting fees of $5,000; accounting
review fees of $8,000; and other fees (transfer agent, campaign development, filing and other) of
$7,000. A different commenter estimated that the cost to issuers could range from 26% to 601%
of the offering amount over a five-year period, depending on the size of the offering, which does
not account for additional estimated opportunity costs of internal personnel time of $35,000 to
$85,000 over a five-year period. 1367 Some commenters referred to estimates of total costs without

1364

The commenter does not specify whether these fees are expressed as a percentage of the amount sought or
raised in the offering.

1365

We do not consider the costs associated with the incorporation or formation of the business itself to be part
of the incremental costs of Regulation Crowdfunding, as these are costs associated with forming any
business endeavor that relies on outside sources of capital.

401

estimating individual components of those costs. 1368 Other commenters provided additional
analysis of costs under different scenarios and offering sizes based on the estimates in the
Proposing Release. 1369
In general, commenters identified the following as the main costs for issuers in securitiesbased crowdfunding offerings: the intermediary fees; the costs of preparing, ensuring compliance
with, and filing of Form C and Form C-AR; and the cost of accounting review or audit of financial
statements. 1370 Below we discuss the comments received on each of these costs and any revisions
to our estimates made in response.
With regard to intermediary fees, the estimates of the commenters that quantified these
fees 1371 were generally very close to our estimates in the Proposing Release (5% to 15%). We
agree with the commenter that suggested that there is likely to be a fixed component to these costs
1368

See, e.g., WealthForge Letter (suggesting that the costs associated with completing a crowdfunding
transaction under the current regulations can be as high as one hundred thousand dollars, including audit
fees, intermediary fees, legal fees and other offering costs); Berlingeri Letter (suggesting that the total cost
would amount to between 15% and 20% of the offering); Traklight Letter (suggesting that the total cost
would amount to between 15% and 20% of the offering for offerings above $100,000); FundHub Letter 1
(referring to potential costs, based on the Commission’s estimates and the commenter’s assumptions, of
between $15,000 and $25,000 associated with raising $100,000); Harrison Letter and Ramsey Letter
(referencing a Forbes estimate that the costs of disclosure documents, engaging an intermediary, performing
background checks, and filing annual reports with the Commission might be upwards of $100,000). See also

1369

See, e.g., EarlyShares Letter; RocketHub Letter; SeedInvest Letter 1.

1370

But see Growthfountain Letter (suggesting that crowdfunding issuers will also incur investor relations costs).
We do not consider investor relations costs to be incremental to Regulation Crowdfunding, as these costs
may be incurred by any business that relies on outside sources of capital and a widely dispersed investor
base. However, to the extent that investment limitations in crowdfunding offerings increase the number of
investors in a typical offering and to the extent that some investor relations costs are variable, issuers in
crowdfunding offerings may incur higher investor relations costs than issuers in types of offerings that
typically have fewer investors.

1371

See StartEngine Letter 2 (estimating portal fees of 6-15%). See also Grassi Letter (estimating an
intermediary fee of $20,000 for a $200,000 offering, which amounts to 10% of the offering). But see
Wefunder Letter (noting that, in contrast to the assumption in the Proposing Release, “good startups will pay
a maximum of $0” and citing three accredited investor crowdfunding platforms that use a “carried interest”
model for Rule 506 offerings, including the example of the commenter itself that does not charge a fee to
startups but that charges investors a $25 fee and 10% carried interest (share of profits upon acquisition or
initial public offering)).

402

that reflects a certain necessary level of due diligence and background screening, which will result
in these costs as a percentage of offering size being higher for smaller offerings. 1372 Thus, we
have revised our intermediary fee estimates in the following way: we project (as a percentage of
offering proceeds) 5% to 15% for offerings of $100,000 or less, 5% to 10% for offerings between
$100,000 and $500,000, and 5% to 7.5% for offerings above $500,000. Data on Regulation D
offerings that involve intermediaries suggests that offerings of up to $1 million have an
intermediary fee (commission and/or finder fee) of approximately 6.5% on average, which is
within the range we estimate for larger crowdfunding offerings. Although crowdfunding
intermediaries are not expected to provide issuers with services commensurate with those
provided by underwriters in registered offerings (and, in fact, funding portals would be prohibited
from doing so), the fees charged in a crowdfunding offering can be significantly larger on a
percentage basis relative to the underwriting fees for registered offerings, which range from as
high as 7% for initial public offerings to less than 1% for certain bond issuances. 1373 In general, to
the extent that a significant component of these fees is fixed, the transaction costs for issuers will
make smaller offerings more expensive on a percentage basis. As previously discussed, we
believe that competition among crowdfunding venues and the potential development of new
products and services may have a significant impact on these estimates over time.

The next major cost driver for issuers in securities-based crowdfunding offerings, as
suggested by commenters, is the cost of preparing and filing disclosure documents and the internal
burden of ensuring compliance with the disclosure requirements of the final rules. Issuers will
incur costs to comply with the disclosure requirements and file the information in the new Form
C: Offering Statement and Form C-U: Progress Update before the offering is funded. Thus,
issuers will incur those costs regardless of whether their offerings are successful. In addition, for
successful offerings, issuers will incur costs to comply with the ongoing reporting requirements
and file information in the new Form C-AR: Annual Report. 1374
Several commenters provided estimates of these costs. One commenter stated that Form C
could be prepared by third-party service providers, such as itself, at much lower costs than those
estimated by the Commission, noting that it can prepare Form C and other required disclosure
documents, perform “bad actor” checks, verify investor status and fulfill other compliance
requirements for an estimated total cost of $2,500 for an offering of $100,000 and that, in most
cases, its services and associated legal fees will cost an issuer between $2,500 and $5,000 for an
offering up to $500,000 and between $5,000 and $10,000 for an offering between $500,000 and
$1,000,000. 1375
Other commenters indicated that the compliance costs for issuers are likely to be higher
than the Commission’s estimates. One commenter indicated that the burden of completing Form
C would likely exceed the 60 burden hours estimated by the Commission in the proposed rules
and that the sum of attorney and accounting fees and management and administrative time and
other costs to prepare these required disclosures will likely exceed $10,500, except in cases of

1374

1375

See FundHub Letter 2.

404

start-ups with no operating history. 1376 The commenter also noted that most Regulation D
offerings, which tend to be less complex than crowdfunding offerings, based on the requirements
in the proposed rules, incur accounting and legal fees above $2,500. 1377 Another commenter
noted that issuers and intermediaries will likely incur higher attorney and accounting fees and
financial and administrative burdens than estimated in the proposed rules but did not provide
estimates. 1378
One commenter submitted several estimates of the compliance costs associated with the
final rules’ disclosure requirements. In one comment letter, the commenter estimated the upfront
compliance costs of the proposed rules to be potentially hundreds of hours in internal company
time and $20,000 to $50,000 in outside professional costs and noted that such costs will likely be
a significant deterrent to crowdfunding. 1379 In a different comment letter, 1380 this commenter
stated that, based on an informal survey of potential vendors, it believes the costs of preparing a
Form C-AR would range from $6,000 to $20,000, with the median being roughly $10,000. The
commenter 1381 further estimated that an additional $15,000 worth of internal burden per year
would be required to prepare Form C-AR and an additional $5,000 to $10,000 worth of internal
burden would be required to prepare financial statements. In yet another comment letter, 1382 this
commenter estimated the cost of ongoing disclosure obligations and ongoing requirements to file
financial statements under the proposed rules to be upwards of $10,000 to $40,000 per year.

Based on these comments, we have revised our estimates of the compliance costs
associated with the disclosure requirements of the final rules and Forms C and C-AR. On the
lower end of the spectrum, one commenter suggested that the cost of preparing and filing these
forms and the associated compliance costs would range from $3,000 to $9,000. 1383 Another
commenter estimated preparation and compliance costs of $2,500 for an offering of $100,000,
between $2,500 and $5,000 for an offering between $100,000 and $500,000, and between $5,000
and $10,000 for an offering between $500,000 and $1,000,000. 1384 We rely on this commenter’s
estimates of the costs of preparing and filling Form C for offerings of up to $100,000 and
offerings between $100,000 and $500,000. Another commenter presented higher estimates,
ranging from $6,000 to $20,000, with a median cost of $10,000, but did not provide estimates for
different offering sizes. 1385 Given commenters’ estimates, we think that the $6,000 to $20,000
estimate is more appropriate for larger offerings (of more than $500,000). Thus, to estimate the
costs of preparing, filing, and complying with Form C for large offerings, we combine the cost
ranges provided by the two commenters for these types of offerings, resulting in a cost estimate
between $5,000 and $20,000. As in the Proposing Release, we estimate that the cost of preparing
and complying with the requirements related to Form C-AR will be approximately two-thirds of
that for Form C. We base this estimate on the fact that no offering-specific information will be
required in Form C-AR and issuers may thus be able to update disclosure previously provided on
Form C. Our estimates of the costs of Forms C and C-AR are exclusive of the costs of an
accounting review or audit, which are discussed separately below.

1383

See StartEngine Letter 2.

1384

See FundHub Letter 2.

1385

See SeedInvest Letter 1.

406

We expect that the cost of preparing and filing Forms C and C-AR will vary based on the
characteristics of issuers, but we do not have the information to quantify such variation. For
example, issuers with little operating activity may have less to disclose than issuers with more
complex operations. Further, some issuers may rely to a greater extent on the services of outside
professionals in preparing the required filings, 1386 while other issuers may choose to prepare and
file the required forms without seeking the assistance of outside professionals. 1387 We also
recognize the possibility that many if not all of the filing requirements may ultimately be
performed by funding portals on behalf of issuers using their platforms.
The other significant cost for crowdfunding issuers, as identified by commenters, is the
cost of an independent accounting review or audit. As discussed above, reviewed financial
statements will be required in offerings of more than $100,000 but not more than $500,000, unless
the issuer has audited statements otherwise available. Audited financial statements are required in
offerings of more than $500,000.
In a change from the proposal, issuers that have not previously sold securities in reliance
on Section 4(a)(6) will be permitted to provide reviewed financial statements in offerings of more
than $500,000 but not more than $1,000,000, unless the issuer has audited statements otherwise
available. This change is expected to greatly reduce the initial costs associated with providing
financial statements for first-time crowdfunding issuers offering more than $500,000 but not more

1386

See, e.g., McGladrey Letter (suggesting that issuers that are startups may rely on outside professional
services to a greater extent, which would increase costs).

1387

For purposes of the PRA, we estimate that, for the average issuer, 25 percent of the burden associated with
preparing and filing Form C and Form C-AR will be carried by outside professionals. See Section IV.C.1.a
below.

407

than $1,000,000. According to one commenter, the difference in cost for reviewed versus audited
financial statements could easily run into tens of thousands of dollars. 1388
Some commenters argued that the cost of reviewed or audited financial statements of
startup companies, which is the type of companies expected to use Regulation Crowdfunding,
would be lower than our estimates because such companies would be less complex and because a
competitive industry would develop to support the compliance and disclosure needs of securitiesbased crowdfunding issuers. 1389 Commenters provided estimates for the cost of an accounting
review of financial statements that generally ranged from $1,500 – $10,000. 1390 One commenter
suggested that the cost of an accounting review is approximately 60% of the cost of an audit. 1391
Consistent with this comment, we also use an alternative way to estimate the cost of an accounting
review: indirectly, from the cost of an audit.
Commenters provided several estimates of the cost of an audit for securities-based
crowdfunding issuers, most of which ranged from $2,500 to $10,000. 1392 Other commenters,

1388

See FundHub Letter 1. The comment letter also cites the commenter’s article, which notes that “while a
review could be in the range of $1000 in some cases, a formal audit by a CPA typically starts at $5,000 and
could be much more.” See Kendall Almerico, Has The SEC Made Equity Crowdfunding Economically
Unfeasible? CROWDFUND INSIDER (Nov. 21, 2014), available at http://www.crowdfundinsider.com

408

however, provided higher annual audit cost estimates of up to $20,000 – $30,000. 1393 Based on a
compilation of audit fee data from reporting companies for fiscal year 2014, the average cost of an
audit for an issuer with less than $1 million in market capitalization and less than $1 million in
revenues is approximately $20,000. 1394 We estimate the audit cost to be approximately $2,500 to
$30,000. In the Proposing Release, we estimated the audit cost to be $28,700, which falls within
this range. Assuming that, as suggested by one commenter, 1395 the accounting review cost is
approximately 60% of the audit cost, this range of audit costs yields an estimate of the accounting
review cost of approximately $1,500 to $18,000. In the Proposing Release, we estimated the
accounting review cost to be $14,350, which falls within this range. Estimates of the cost of an
accounting review that we received from commenters also fall within this range. In light of the
wide range of estimates provided by commenters for the cost of a review or audit of financial
statements, we use in this release a range of estimates ($1,500 – $18,000 for the accounting
review cost and $2,500 – $30,000 for the audit cost) instead of a single point estimate for these
anticipated costs for offerings.
As discussed below, in a change from the proposal, the final rules do not require issuers to
provide reviewed or audited financial statements in the annual report, unless such statements are
1393

See, e.g., Frutkin Letter (suggesting a “rough estimate of $30,000 per audit”); Graves Letter (suggesting that
audit costs can be upwards of $18,000 to $25,000); Startup Valley Letter (suggesting that audit fees can be
up to $10,000 for small startups with no financials and can exceed $20,000 for companies that have been in
business for a few years); Traklight Letter (suggesting that audit costs can be up to $20,000).

1394

See Audit Analytics, Auditor-Fees, available at http://www.auditanalytics.com/0002/audit-datacompany.php. The auditor fee database contains fee data disclosed by Exchange Act reporting companies in
electronic filings since January 1, 2001. For purposes of our calculation, we averaged the auditor fee data for
companies with both market capitalization and revenues of greater than zero and less than $1 million (the
smallest subgroup of companies for which data is compiled). We note that the cost of an audit for many
issuers conducting a securities-based crowdfunding offering in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) is likely to be
lower than for the subset of Exchange Act reporting companies referenced above, because they likely would
be at an earlier stage of development than issuers that file Exchange Act reports with us and, thus, could be
less complex to audit.

1396

In addition to the compliance costs outlined in the table, issuers also will incur costs to (1) obtain EDGAR
access codes on Form ID; (2) prepare and file progress updates on Form C-U; and (3) prepare and file Form
C-TR to terminate ongoing reporting. These additional compliance costs are discussed further below. In
addition, for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act (“PRA”), we provide burden estimates for each of
these filings obligations in Section IV.C.1, below.

1397

For purposes of the table, we estimate the range of fees that an issuer would pay the intermediary assuming
the following: (1) the fees would be calculated as a percentage of the offering amount ranging from 5% to
15% of the total offering amount for offerings of $100,000 or less, 5% to 10% for offerings between
$100,000 and $500,000, and 5% to 7.5% for offerings of more than $500,000; and (2) the issuer is offering
$50,000, $300,000 and $750,000, which are the mid-points of the offering amounts under each of the
respective columns. The fees paid to the intermediary may, or may not, cover services to an issuer in
connection with the preparation and filing of the forms identified in this table.

1398

As noted above, we estimate that these costs are approximately two-thirds of the costs for preparation and
filing of Form C.

1399

First-time crowdfunding issuers within this offering range will be permitted to provide reviewed financial
statements.

410

We do not have additional data on the costs likely to be incurred by crowdfunding issuers
to prepare the required disclosures beyond the information discussed above. Overall, we
recognize that cost estimates may vary from issuer to issuer and from service provider to service
provider. However, even with the additional accommodations provided in the final rules, the
costs of compliance may be significant for some issuers.
b.

General Disclosure Requirements

The statute and the final rules related to issuer disclosures are intended to reduce the
information asymmetries that currently exist between small businesses and investors. Small
private businesses typically do not disclose information as frequently or as extensively as public
companies, if at all. Moreover, unlike public companies, small private businesses generally are
not required to hire an independent accountant to review financial statements. When information
about a company is difficult to obtain or the quality of the information is uncertain, investors are
at risk of making poorly-informed investment decisions about that company.
Such information asymmetries may be especially acute in the securities-based
crowdfunding market because the market includes startups and small businesses that have
significant risk factors and other characteristics that may have led them to be rejected by other
potential funding sources, including banks, VCs and angel investors. In addition, the securitiesbased crowdfunding market may attract unsophisticated investors who may not have the resources
necessary to gather and analyze information about issuers before investing or to effectively
monitor issuers after investing. Moreover, investment limits in securities-based crowdfunding
offerings in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) will likely lead to investors having smaller stakes in the
firm, which may reduce their incentives to monitor or gather information for a given investor.
These considerations may give rise to adverse selection and moral hazard in offerings in reliance
411

on Section 4(a)(6). For instance, some issuers may use capital to fund riskier projects than what
was disclosed to investors, or they may not pursue their stated business objectives. If investors in
securities-based crowdfunding have limited information about issuers or a limited ability to
monitor such issuers, they may seek higher returns for their investment or choose to withdraw
from the securities-based crowdfunding market altogether, which would increase the cost of
capital to issuers and limit the capital formation benefits of the final rules. In addition, investors
in offerings made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) may make relatively small investments, due in
part to the application of investment limitations. This potential dispersed investor base may make
it difficult for investors to solve collective action problems in monitoring the issuer.
The statute and the final rules seek to reduce information asymmetries by requiring issuers
to file specified disclosures with the Commission for offerings made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6)
during the offering and on an annual basis thereafter. 1400 Issuers also are required to provide these
disclosures to investors and, in the case of offering documents, to investors and the relevant
intermediary. The disclosure requirements, which are described above, 1401 are more extensive
than those required under some other existing exemptions from registration. For example,
although the current requirements of Tier 1 Regulation A offerings include similar initial financial
disclosures, issuers in Tier 1 offerings are not required to file ongoing reports. 1402 Issuers using
the Rule 504 exemption under Regulation D to raise up to $1 million are not required to provide

1400

See Section 4A(b). See also Rules 201, 202 and 203 of Regulation Crowdfunding.

1401

See Section II.B.1 above.

1402

However, issuers in Tier 1 Regulation A offerings are required to provide information about sales in such
offerings and to update certain issuer information by electronically filing a Form 1-Z exit report with the
Commission not later than 30 calendar days after the termination or completion of an offering. Further, Tier
1 offerings must be qualified by the Commission and are subject to state registration requirements. Issuers in
Tier 2 offerings are subject to annual, semiannual and current reporting requirements. See Regulation A
Adopting Release.

412

audited financial statements, and there are no periodic disclosure requirements. Regulation D
offerings under Rules 505 and 506 for up to $2 million require issuers to provide audited current
balance sheets (and unaudited statements of income, cash flows and changes in stockholders’
equity) to non-accredited investors, but there are no periodic reporting requirements. The
disclosure requirements in Regulation Crowdfunding are expected to benefit investors by enabling
them to better evaluate the issuer and the offering, monitor how the issuer is performing over time
and be aware of when the issuer may terminate its ongoing reporting obligations. This will allow
investors with various risk preferences to invest in the offerings best suited for their risk tolerance,
thus improving allocative efficiency.
The disclosure requirements also may improve informational efficiency in the market.
Specifically, the required disclosure may provide investors with a useful benchmark to evaluate
the issuer and compare the issuer to other private issuers both within and outside of the securitiesbased crowdfunding market. 1403 Additionally, disclosure by issuers engaging in crowdfunding
transactions in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) may inform financial markets more generally about
new consumer trends and new products, thus creating externalities that benefit other types of
investors and issuers.
We recognize, however, that the disclosure requirements also will have associated
limitations and costs, including the direct costs of preparation, certification, independent
accounting review (when necessary) and dissemination of the disclosure documents. As noted
above, the disclosure requirements for offerings made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) are more
extensive, in terms of breadth and frequency, than those for other exempt offerings. The statute

also provides us with the discretion to impose additional requirements on issuers engaging in
crowdfunding transactions, and in some cases, the final rules require issuers to disclose
information beyond what is specifically mandated by the statute. 1404 We recognize that these
additional discretionary disclosure provisions may impose additional compliance costs on issuers
compared with the proposal. However, we believe these provisions will improve investor
decision-making and may ultimately benefit issuers by improving price efficiency in the
securities-based crowdfunding market. Although requiring less disclosure could impose lower
compliance costs, we believe that the disclosure requirements we are adopting appropriately
consider the need to enhance the ability of issuers relying on Section 4(a)(6) to raise capital while
enabling investors to make informed investment decisions. In response to the suggestion by some
commenters that issuers not be required to disclose information in multiple places, 1405 under the
final rules, an issuer is not required to repeat disclosure that is already provided in the issuer’s
financial statements. This may help to mitigate the cost of compliance for issuers.
We note that the disclosure requirements may have indirect costs to the extent that
information disclosed by issuers relying on Section 4(a)(6) can be used by their competitors,
resulting in a potential loss of a competitive advantage or intellectual property, particularly for
high-growth issuers and issuers engaged in significant research and development. Requiring
significant levels of disclosure at an early stage of an issuer’s lifecycle may affect an issuer’s
competitive position and may limit the use of the exemption in Section 4(a)(6) by issuers who are
especially concerned with confidentiality. These disclosure costs also may make other types of

requirements.

statements); Grassi Letter (same).

private offerings more attractive to potential securities-based crowdfunding issuers. For example,
the 2013 changes to Rule 506 of Regulation D, 1406 which allow for general solicitation, subject to
certain conditions, may make it a more attractive option for small business financing and, thus,
may divert potential issuers from crowdfunding.
In addition, under the statute and the final rules, issuers that complete a crowdfunding
offering in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) are subject to ongoing reporting requirements, 1407 which
will increase compliance costs. The ongoing reporting, however, may provide a liquidity benefit
for secondary sales of securities issued in crowdfunding transactions and make the prices of such
securities more informationally efficient, should a secondary market develop.
c.

Financial Condition and Financial Statement Disclosure
Requirements

Consistent with the statute, the final rules require narrative disclosure about the issuer’s
financial condition, including, to the extent material, liquidity, capital resources and the issuer’s
historical results of operations. 1408 We expect that this discussion will inform investors about the
financial condition of the issuer, without imposing significant costs on issuers, because issuers
likely will already have such information readily available. In addition, the final rules do not
prescribe the content or format for this information.
With respect to the requirement to provide financial statements, the final rules implement
tiered financial disclosure requirements based on the aggregate amount of securities offered and
sold in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) during the preceding 12-month period, inclusive of the offering

amount in the offering for which disclosure is being provided. 1409 The disclosure requirements
will provide investors with more information than might otherwise be obtained in private
offerings, but also may create additional costs for those issuers that have limited financial and
accounting expertise necessary to produce the financial disclosures envisioned by the statute and
the final rules.
The final rules, consistent with the proposed rules, require issuers to provide a complete
set of their financial statements (balance sheets, statements of comprehensive income, statements
of cash flows and statement of changes in stockholders’ equity) that are prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP and cover the shorter of the two most recently completed fiscal years or the
period since inception. 1410 We could have chosen an alternative that allows financial statements to
be prepared in accordance with other comprehensive bases of accounting, as some commenters
suggested. 1411 Such an alternative may have mitigated costs for some issuers, especially those
smaller issuers that historically have prepared their financial statements in accordance with other
comprehensive bases of accounting rather than U.S. GAAP. However, as we discussed above,
this alternative would reduce the comparability of financial statements across issuers and might
not provide investors with a fair representation of a company’s financial position and results of

1409

See, e.g., ABA Letter (for offerings of $100,000 or less, but stating that the Commission could require
providing U.S. GAAP financial statements if available); AICPA Letter; CFIRA Letter 5; CFIRA Letter 7;
CrowdCheck Letter 4; EarlyShares Letter; EY Letter (for offerings of $100,000 or less, unless U.S. GAAP
financial statements are available); Grassi Letter; Graves Letter (for issuers with less than $5 million in
revenue); Mahurin Letter (stating that simple Excel spreadsheets accompanied by bank records should meet
the financial statement requirements); Milken Institute Letter (for early-stage issuers); NFIB Letter; SBEC
Letter; StartupValley Letter; Tiny Cat Letter (for offerings of less than $500,000); Whitaker Chalk Letter

operations. Further, it may be difficult for investors to determine whether the issuer complied
with such basis of accounting. 1412
The final rules also specify that an issuer may conduct an offering in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6) using financial statements for the fiscal year prior to the most recently completed
fiscal year, provided that not more than 120 days have passed since the end of the issuer’s most
recently completed fiscal year, and financial statements for the most recently completed fiscal
year are not otherwise available. 1413 This may impose a cost on investors to the extent that the
investors do not have more current financial information about the issuer. However, this concern
is somewhat mitigated by the requirement that issuers include a discussion of any material
changes or trends known to management in the financial condition and results of operations
subsequent to the period for which financial statements are provided. 1414
Requiring financial statements covering the two most recently completed fiscal years is
expected to benefit investors by providing a basis for comparison against the most recently
completed fiscal year and by allowing investors to identify changes in the development of the
business. Compared to an alternative that we could have selected, that of requiring financial
statements covering only the most recently completed fiscal year, as some commenters
suggested, 1415 requiring a second year of financial statements will to some degree increase the cost
for the issuer. Also, to the extent that the issuer had little or no operations in the prior year, the
benefit of comparability may not be realized. We recognize that many crowdfunding issuers may

not have any financial history, and investors may make investment decisions without a track
record of issuer performance, relying largely on the belief that an issuer can succeed based on
their business plan and other factors. Nevertheless, for those issuers that do have a financial
history, we believe this disclosure can contribute to better informed investment decisions and
improve the overall allocative efficiency of the securities-based crowdfunding market.
For offerings of $100,000 or less, the final rules require the issuer to provide financial
statements that are certified by the principal executive officer to be true and complete in all
material respects. 1416 The final rules include a form of certification for the principal executive
officer to provide in the issuer’s offering statement, which we believe will help issuers comply
with the certification required by the statute and the final rules. 1417 However, if reviewed financial
statements or audited financial statements are otherwise available, they must be provided. 1418
The proposed rules would have required income tax returns for the most recently
completed year (if any). In a change from the proposed rules, consistent with the suggestions of
some commenters and to respond to privacy concerns, 1419 the final rules do not require complete
tax returns and instead require that an issuer disclose its total income, taxable income and total
tax, or the equivalent line items from the applicable form, and have the principal executive officer
certify that those amounts reflect accurately the information in the issuer’s federal income tax
returns. 1420 We believe that the requirement to provide selected items from the return, rather than

a voluntary basis only); Zhang Letter.

the return itself, will alleviate some of the privacy concerns for issuers. This change may increase
record keeping costs for issuers and give rise to potential transcription errors. It also may reduce
the amount of information available to investors, but as we noted in the Proposing Release, it is
not clear to what extent all of the information presented in a tax return would be useful for an
investor evaluating whether or not to purchase securities from the issuer. Finally, although
principal executive officers will incur some incremental liability for their certification that these
amounts reflect accurately the information in the issuer’s federal income tax return, we do not
expect this change from the proposal to impose substantial additional costs on officers or issuers
given the limited scope of the required certification.
Moreover, the final rules specify that if an issuer is offering securities in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6) before filing a tax return for the most recently completed fiscal year, the issuer
may use information from the tax return filed for the prior year, on the condition that the issuer
provides information from the tax return for the most recently completed fiscal year when it is
filed, if it is filed during the offering period. 1421 This accommodation is expected to benefit
issuers by enabling them to engage in transactions during the time period between the end of their
fiscal year and when they file their tax return for that year. This may impose a cost on investors
because they might not receive the most up-to-date tax information about the issuer.
The proposed rules would have required financial statements for offerings exceeding
$100,000 but not exceeding $500,000 to be reviewed by a public accountant independent of the
issuer and financial statements for offerings exceeding $500,000 to be audited by a public
accountant independent of the issuer. The final rules specify that the required financial statements
must be reviewed by a public accountant that is independent of the issuer for offerings exceeding
1421

See Instruction 6 to paragraph (t) of Rule 201 of Regulation Crowdfunding.

419

$100,000 but not exceeding $500,000. 1422 If, however, financial statements of the issuer are
available that have been audited by a public accountant that is independent of the issuer, the issuer
must provide those financial statements instead and need not include the reviewed financial
statements. 1423
Similar to the proposal, issuers in offerings exceeding $500,000 must provide audited
financial statements. In a change from the proposal, the final rules specify that issuers that have
not previously sold securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) and are conducting offerings with a
target offering amount exceeding $500,000 but not exceeding $1,000,000 can provide reviewed
financial statements, unless audited financial statements are otherwise available. 1424 Audited
financial statements can benefit investors in evaluating offerings by issuers with substantive prior
business activity by providing them with potentially higher-quality financial statements.
However, as noted by a number of commenters 1425 and discussed above, requiring audited
financial statements could significantly increase the cost to issuers compared to requiring
reviewed financial statements. 1426 Further, for issuers that are newly formed, with no or very
limited operations, and for small issuers, the benefit of the audit may not justify its cost.

As discussed above, 1427 the approach in the final rules of requiring reviewed financial
statements rather than audited financial statements, unless otherwise available, for first-time
crowdfunding issuers that undertake offerings of more than $500,000 but not more than
$1,000,000 is expected to reduce the costs associated with financial statements for such first-time
issuers compared to the proposed requirement of audited financial statements for all issuers in
offerings of more than $500,000. This accommodation is expected to alleviate the significant
upfront cost of an audit for first-time issuers that have not yet raised capital in a crowdfunding
offering and may be more financially constrained. To the extent that their financing needs have
not been met through alternative financing methods, first-time crowdfunding issuers are likely to
be more financially constrained than issuers that have already established a track record of
successful crowdfunding offerings. We recognize, however, that there are costs associated with
this accommodation. Not requiring audited financial statements for offerings of more than
$500,000 but not more than $1,000,000 by first-time issuers may reduce the quality of financial
disclosure, which may be a more significant concern for new crowdfunding issuers due to the fact
that their more limited track record may translate into a higher level of information asymmetry
between issuers and investors. The potentially reduced quality of financial disclosure associated
with offerings of more than $500,000 by first-time issuers may affect the likelihood of detecting
fraud, which would decrease investor protection. To the extent that investors anticipate such
increased risks, issuers may face a higher cost of capital or be unable to raise the entire amount
offered, which would diminish the capital formation benefits of the final rule. We note that some
first-time issuers in offerings of more than $500,000 but not more than $1,000,000may have
audited statements otherwise available, which could partly mitigate the described effects. We also
1427

Id.

421

note that some first-time issuers concerned about investor confidence in the quality of their
financial statements may voluntarily provide audited financial statements.
Tiered disclosure requirements aim to partially mitigate the impact of the fixed component
of compliance costs on issuers in smaller securities-based crowdfunding offerings. However, it is
possible that the thresholds may have an adverse competitive effect on some issuers. For
example, the cost of reviewed financial statements may cause issuers in offerings exceeding but
close to $100,000 to incur significantly higher offering costs as a percentage of the amount offered
compared to issuers offering less than but close to $100,000. Similarly, the cost of audited
financial statements may cause issuers in follow-on crowdfunding offerings exceeding but close to
$500,000 to incur significantly higher offering costs as a percentage of the amount offered
compared to issuers in offerings of less than but close to $500,000. We note, however, that the
issuer has the ability to select its offering amount, and since the choice of offering amount
determines which financial statement requirements will apply to its offering, the issuer, by
choosing its offering amount, effectively also chooses its financial statement requirements.
We considered the alternative of exempting issuers with no operating history or issuers
that have been in existence for fewer than 12 months from the requirement to provide financial
statements. We believe that financial statements contain valuable information that can aid
investors in making better informed decisions, particularly, when evaluating early-stage issuers
characterized by a high degree of information asymmetry. We also expect that other
accommodations in the final rules will help alleviate some of these issuer compliance costs.

422

Similar to the proposed rules, financial statements must be reviewed in accordance with
SSARS issued by the AICPA. 1428 Although we could have chosen to develop a new review
standard for purposes of the final rules, we believe that issuers will benefit from using the
AICPA’s widely-utilized review standard. We believe that many accountants reviewing financial
statements of issuers raising capital in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) are familiar with the AICPA’s
standards and procedures for review, which should help to partly mitigate review costs.
As described above, the final rules require certain financial statements to be reviewed or
audited by a public accountant that is independent of the issuer. 1429 In a change from the proposed
rules, the final rules permit the use of independence standards set forth in Rule 2-01 of Regulation
S-X or the independence standards of the AICPA. 1430 This change to allow the use of AICPA
standards may reduce issuer compliance costs to the extent that there are higher costs associated
with engaging an accountant that satisfies the independence standards set forth in Rule 2-01 of
Regulation S-X. The change also will increase the number of public accountants able to perform
the reviews or audits, which may lead to a decrease in the price of their services and thus a
decrease in the direct issuance costs to issuers compared with the proposal. The benefit from this
change will accrue to issuers making offerings of $100,000 to $1,000,000. To the extent that the
AICPA independence standards impose fewer restrictions with respect to potential conflicts of
interest than the independence standards in Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X, however, this
accommodation may weaken investor protection. Moreover, any decrease in investor confidence

Regulation Crowdfunding.

1429

See Section II.B.1 above.

1430

See Instruction 10 to paragraph (t) of Rule 201 of Regulation Crowdfunding.

423

in the reliability of financial statements as a result of this change will limit the capital formation
benefits of the final rules.
In addition, the final rules require an issuer to file a signed review report or audit report,
whichever is applicable, and notify the public accountant of the issuer’s intended use of the report
in the offering. 1431 This can impose an additional cost on issuers to the extent that the accountant
or auditor increases the fee associated with the review or audit to compensate for any additional
liability that may result from the requirement to file the report. As discussed above, 1432 in a
change from the proposal, the final rules do not permit qualified audit reports. This change may
impose an additional cost on issuers, which we are not able to quantify. However, this change is
expected to provide investors with more reliable financial statements, which should enable
investors to better evaluate the prospects of issuers relying on Section 4(a)(6) and thus make better
informed investment decisions. By providing investors with a greater degree of confidence in the
reliability of the financial information, audited financial statements will reduce the information
asymmetry about the issuer’s financial condition that exists between issuers and potential
investors. This decrease in information asymmetry may lead to greater capital formation.
In a change from the proposed rules, the final rules do not require financial statements in
the annual report that meet a standard of review equal to the highest standard provided in a prior
offering. 1433 The final rules require an annual report to include financial statements of the issuer
to be certified by the principal executive officer of the issuer as true and complete in all material
respects. 1434 Issuers that otherwise have available financial statements that have been reviewed or

audited by an independent certified public accountant, must provide them and will not be required
to have the principal executive officer certification. 1435 As discussed above, these changes will
reduce the compliance costs to issuers compared with the proposal. 1436 At the same time, they
may reduce the quality of the ongoing financial statements, resulting in a potential decrease in
investor protection and investor confidence in the quality of these financial statements. We note
that some issuers may have reviewed or audited financial statements otherwise available, which
would partly mitigate this concern. In addition, an issuer is able to voluntarily provide financial
statements that meet a higher standard, so if an issuer is concerned about investor confidence in
the quality of financial statements, it can choose to provide reviewed or audited financial
statements.
d.

Issuer Filing Requirements

As discussed above, issuers will incur costs to prepare and file the various disclosures
required under Regulation Crowdfunding. 1437 The statute requires issuers to file and provide to
investors certain specified information at the time of offering, such as information about the
issuer, officers and directors, and certain shareholders, a description of the business, a description
of the purpose and intended use of proceeds, target offering amount and the deadline to reach it,
offering price (or the method for determining the price) and other terms of the offering, a
description of the financial condition of the issuer, as well as certain other disclosures. 1438 These
disclosure requirements are expected to strengthen investor protection and enable investors to
make better informed investment decisions. The statute does not specify a format that issuers

425

must use to present the required disclosures to the Commission. As noted above, the final rules
require issuers to file the mandated disclosure on EDGAR using new Form C. 1439
Form C requires certain disclosures to be submitted using an XML-based filing, 1440 while
allowing the issuer to customize the presentation of other required disclosures. This approach
provides issuers with the flexibility to present the required disclosures in a cost-effective manner,
while also requiring the disclosure of certain key offering information in a standardized format,
which we believe will benefit investors and help facilitate capital formation.
We expect that requiring certain disclosures to be submitted using XML-based filings will
produce benefits for issuers, investors and the Commission. For instance, using information filed
pursuant to these requirements, investors can track capital generated through crowdfunding
offerings without manually inspecting each filing. The ability to efficiently collect information on
all issuers also can provide an incentive for data aggregators or other market participants to offer
services or analysis that investors can use to compare and choose among different offerings. For
example, reporting key financial information using XML-based filings will allow investors,
analysts and data aggregators to more easily compile, analyze and compare information about the
capital structure and financial position of various issuers. XML-based filings also will provide the
Commission with data about the use of the new crowdfunding exemption that will allow the
Commission to evaluate whether the rules implementing the exemption include appropriate
investor protections and are effectively facilitating capital formation.
Certain provisions of the filing requirements in the final rules provide flexibility and
potentially reduce the compliance burden compared with the proposal. The final rules allow

1439

1440

See Instruction to paragraph (a)(1) of Rule 203 of Regulation Crowdfunding. See also Section II.B.3 above.

426

issuers to customize the presentation of their non-XML disclosures and file those disclosures as
exhibits to Form C in PDF format as official filings, consistent with the suggestions of some
commenters. 1441 In addition, the final rules include an optional Question and Answer (“Q&A”)
format that issuers may opt to use to provide the disclosures that are not required to be filed in
XML format. 1442 Relative to some other possible formats, this Q&A format may facilitate the
preparation of the Form C disclosures by crowdfunding issuers. To the extent that this provision
lowers the compliance cost for issuers, it may encourage greater use of Regulation Crowdfunding
for raising capital.
The final rules require that issuers file a Form C-U: Progress Update to describe the
progress of the issuer in meeting the target offering amount. 1443 In a change from the proposed
rules, based on concerns expressed by commenters, the final rules permit issuers to satisfy the
progress update requirement by relying on the relevant intermediary to make publicly available on
the intermediary’s platform frequent updates about the issuer’s progress toward meeting the target
offering amount. This change is expected to mitigate some of the direct cost for the issuer without
reducing the amount of contemporaneous information available to investors. However, an issuer
relying on the intermediary to make publicly available frequent progress updates must still file a
Form C-U at the end of the offering to disclose the total amount of securities sold in the
offering. 1444 Although the final offering information likely will be available on the registered
intermediary’s website, having the information available on EDGAR will allow comparisons

across platforms and provide ongoing access to historical information for future investor analyses
that may otherwise be difficult or impossible to perform by accessing information from each
individual portal. We expect the costs of preparing updates on Form C-U to vary among issuers
but to be relatively small. 1445
As noted above, the statute also requires an issuer to file and provide to investors
information about the issuer’s financial condition on at least an annual basis, as determined by the
Commission.1446 Ongoing disclosure requirements are expected to strengthen investor protection.
Ongoing disclosure requirements are also expected to facilitate better informed investment
decisions in secondary market transactions and enhance the informational efficiency of prices of
crowdfunding securities, should a secondary market for such securities develop. To implement
this statutory requirement, the final rules require any issuer that has sold securities in a
crowdfunding transaction in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) to file annually with the Commission a
new Form C-AR: Annual Report, no later than 120 days after the end of each fiscal year covered
by the report. 1447 We believe that annual reports will inform investors in their portfolio decisions
and can enhance price efficiency. Moreover, as discussed above, under the statute and the final
rules, the securities will be freely tradable after one year, 1448 and therefore, this information also
will benefit potential future holders of the issuer’s securities by enabling them to update their
assessments as new information is made available through the annual updates, potentially
allowing for more efficient pricing. More generally, these continued disclosures also may help
1445

For purposes of the PRA, we estimate that an issuer’s compliance with the Form C-U requirement will result,
on average, in approximately 0.50 burden hours per issuer. See Section IV.C.1.a below.

facilitate the transfer of securities in secondary markets after the one-year restricted period ends,
which can mitigate some of the potential liquidity issues that are unique to the securities-based
crowdfunding market, as discussed above.
As an alternative, we could have added a current reporting requirement, consistent with the
view of some commenters that there may be major events that occur between annual reports about
which investors would want to be updated. 1449 Such an alternative could result in better informed
investment decisions. We are concerned, however, that the benefits of a current reporting
requirement may not justify the additional compliance costs associated with such a requirement,
especially given the size and early stage of development of the issuers likely to be involved in
offerings in reliance on Section 4(a)(6).
Any issuer terminating its annual reporting obligations will be required to file a notice
under cover of Form C-TR: Termination of Reporting to notify investors and the Commission
that it will no longer file and provide annual reports pursuant to the requirements of Regulation
Crowdfunding. 1450 The final rules enable issuers to terminate reporting if: (1) the issuer becomes
a reporting company required to file reports under Exchange Act Sections 13(a) or 15(d); (2) the
issuer or another party repurchases all of the securities issued pursuant to Securities Act
Section 4(a)(6), including any payment in full of debt securities or any complete redemption of
redeemable securities; or (3) the issuer liquidates or dissolves its business in accordance with state

law. 1451 We expect the costs of preparing Form C-TR to vary among issuers but to be relatively
small. 1452
In a change from the proposed rules, after considering the comments, the final rules also
permit termination of ongoing reporting in two additional circumstances: (1) the issuer has filed
at least one annual report and has fewer than 300 holders of record, or (2) the issuer has filed
annual reports for at least the three most recent years and has total assets not exceeding
$10,000,000. 1453 This change is expected to mitigate some of the compliance cost for small
issuers and make the final rules a more attractive option for capital formation among small issuers,
and at the same time, help to ensure that larger issuers with a significant number of investors
continue to provide relevant disclosure.
This change may, however, make relevant information about the financial condition of
certain issuers no longer available to investors, resulting in less informed investor decisions. This
change may affect a large number of securities-based crowdfunding offerings, since it is likely
that many crowdfunding issuers will either have fewer than 300 holders of record or assets below
$10 million. Termination of ongoing reporting may result in a decrease in investor protection,
particularly in the presence of an investor base with a limited degree of sophistication. Allowing
issuers to terminate ongoing reporting can make monitoring of the issuer more difficult for
investors and can potentially make it more difficult to detect fraud. We note, however, that the
investment limits in the final rules serve to limit the amount of each investor’s capital that is
exposed to these and other risks of securities-based crowdfunding offerings. We further note that

1451

See Rule 202(b) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

1452

For the purposes of the PRA, we estimate that issuers will spend, on average, approximately 1.5 burden
hours to complete this task. See Section IV.C.1.a below.

1453

Id.

the investment amounts involved in these transactions might limit a typical investor’s incentives
to analyze the information contained in ongoing disclosures and to monitor issuers, even if all
issuers are required to provide ongoing disclosures.
Nevertheless, the risk that an issuer in a securities-based crowdfunding offering may
terminate ongoing reporting in the future may discourage prospective investors from making an
initial investment in offerings in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) or may cause issuers to obtain lower
valuations for the securities they offer, which may limit some of the capital formation benefits of
the final rules. We note that issuers who believe that increased investor confidence justifies the
cost of annual reporting would be able to continue ongoing reporting voluntarily.
Termination of ongoing reporting may also reduce the informational efficiency of prices
and secondary market liquidity, making it more difficult for investors to exit their holdings after
the expiration of resale restrictions. A lack of ongoing reporting may reduce the likelihood that a
secondary market for such securities develops. We recognize, however, that a secondary market
for securities in offerings in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) may not develop even if all issuers are
required to provide ongoing reports.
The asset size cap in one of the termination thresholds may create adverse competitive
effects for issuers close to but above the termination threshold.
e.

Advertising – Notice of Offering

The statute and the final rules prohibit an issuer from advertising the terms of the offering,
except for notices that direct investors to an intermediary’s platform. 1454 The terms of the offering
include the amount offered, the nature of the securities, price of the securities and length of the

1454

See Section 4A(b)(2). See also Rule 204 of Regulation Crowdfunding.

431

offering period. 1455 The final rules allow an issuer to publish a notice about the terms of the
offering made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6), subject to certain limitations on the content of the
notice. 1456 The notices are similar to the “tombstone ads” permitted under Securities Act Rule
134, 1457 except that the final rules require the notices to direct investors to the intermediary’s
platform, through which the offering made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) is being conducted.
We believe this approach will allow issuers to generate interest in offerings and to leverage
the power of social media to attract investors, potentially resulting in enhanced capital formation.
At the same time, we believe it also will protect investors by limiting the ability of issuers to
provide certain advertising materials without also directing investors to the disclosures, available
on the intermediary’s platform, that are required for an offering made in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6). Moreover, this requirement is not expected to impose costs on market
participants.
As an alternative, we could have required communications about the offering to be
conducted through the intermediary, as suggested by some commenters. 1458 To the extent that an
issuer might be able to inform more investors about its offering if it is not limited to
communications through the intermediary’s platform, this alternative might limit the issuer’s
ability to inform a wide range of investors about its offering. Limited recognition among
prospective investors might be a particularly significant hurdle for early-stage or small issuers. As
another alternative, we could have required issuers to file advertising notices with the Commission

1455

1458

See Hackers/Founders Letter (supporting the issuer being able to repost the communications elsewhere so
long as it first appeared through the intermediary); Joinvestor Letter.

432

and/or the relevant intermediary, as suggested by other commenters. 1459 While this could increase
the likelihood of issuer compliance with advertising restrictions, it also would impose an
additional cost on the issuer. Overall, in light of the restrictions on advertising already in place, it
is not clear to what extent, if any, additional restrictions would enhance investor protection.
Some commenters, suggesting that advertising restrictions are unnecessary because sales
must occur through an intermediary’s platform, 1460 recommended allowing the issuer more leeway
to publicize its business or offering on its own website or social media platform so long as the
specific terms of the offering could be found only through the intermediary’s platform, 1461 and
recommended allowing advertising notices to have a section for supplemental information
highlighting certain intangible purposes such as a particular social cause. 1462 The alternative of
relaxing or eliminating restrictions on advertising could enhance capital formation efforts of
issuers. However, it might also result in a cost to investors if they make less informed investment
decisions based on incomplete or selectively presented information about the offering contained in
advertising materials.
f.

Compensation of Persons Promoting the Offering

The statute and the final rules prohibit an issuer from compensating, or committing to
compensate, directly or indirectly, any person to promote the issuer’s offering through
communication channels provided by the intermediary unless the issuer takes reasonable steps to

1459

See, e.g., Commonwealth of Massachusetts Letter; CFIRA Letter 6.

1460

See, e.g., FundHub Letter 1; Seed&Spark Letter (noting the proposed advertising restrictions will restrict the
ability of filmmakers to market and raise money for their films); Arctic Island Letter 5; PeoplePowerFund
Letter.

1461

See Fryer Letter.

1462

See RocketHub Letter.

433

ensure that such person clearly discloses the receipt of such compensation (both past and
prospective) each time a promotional communication is made. 1463
We believe this requirement will benefit the securities-based crowdfunding market by
allowing investors to make better informed investment decisions. Although the requirement to
take steps to ensure disclosure of compensation paid to persons promoting the offering will
impose compliance costs on issuers, we believe that investors will benefit from knowing if the
comments about the investment they are considering are being made by a promoter who is
compensated by the issuer and therefore may not be providing an independent, disinterested
perspective.
The final rules also require that an issuer not compensate or commit to compensate,
directly or indirectly, any person to promote its offerings outside of the communication channels
provided by the intermediary, unless the promotion is limited to notices that comply with the
advertising rules. 1464 We believe this will similarly serve to improve investors’ ability to make
informed judgments about the information they encounter through various communication
channels about the issuer, and thus, to make better informed investment decisions.
g.

Oversubscription and Offering Price

The final rules permit an issuer to accept investments in excess of the target offering
amount, subject to the $1 million limitation, but require the issuer to disclose the maximum
amount the issuer will accept and how shares in oversubscribed offerings will be allocated. 1465
We continue to believe that permitting oversubscriptions will provide flexibility to issuers so that
they can raise the amount of capital they deem necessary to finance their businesses. Given the
1463

See Section 4A(b)(3). See also Rule 205 of Regulation Crowdfunding and Section II.B.5 above.

1465

See Rule 201(h) of Regulation Crowdfunding. See also Section II.B.6.a above.

434

uncertainty on the part of the issuer about potential market demand for the issuer’s securities, we
believe it is valuable for issuers to have the option to permit oversubscriptions. For example,
permitting oversubscriptions will allow an issuer to raise more funds, while lowering compliance
costs as a proportion of the amount raised, if the issuer discovers during the offering process that
there is greater investor interest in the offering than initially anticipated or if the cost of capital is
lower than initially anticipated. As an alternative, we could have limited the maximum
oversubscription amount to a certain percentage of the target offering amount, as suggested by one
commenter. 1466 However, such a restriction might reduce valuable flexibility and potentially limit
capital formation without appreciably enhancing investor protection.
The final rules do not require issuers to set a fixed price, as suggested by one
commenter. 1467 While such an alternative might reduce an investor’s cost of evaluating the
investment, it would reduce flexibility for issuers while providing only limited benefits to
investors in light of other disclosures required in the final rules. Further, the required disclosure
of the pricing method used and the final prices for the securities before an offering closes, 1468
coupled with the investor’s ability to cancel his or her investment commitment, 1469 can mitigate
potential concerns that dynamic pricing can be used to provide preferential treatment to certain
investors (e.g., when an issuer offers better prices to relatives or insiders). We also believe that
the cancellation rights afforded by the rules will help to address the concerns about time pressure
on the investment decision because investors will have the opportunity to cancel their investment
commitments if they decide to do so.

h.

Types of Securities Offered and Valuation

The final rules do not limit the type of securities that may be offered in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6). This provision gives issuers the flexibility to offer the types of securities that are
most compatible with their desired capital structure and financing needs. Such flexibility may
benefit issuers to the extent that capital structure decisions can be relevant for an issuer’s firm
value.
The final rules do not prescribe a method for valuing the securities but instead require
issuers to describe the terms of the securities and the valuation method in their offering materials.
The required disclosure of valuation method is intended to facilitate informed investment
decisions. As an alternative, as suggested by commenters, we could have prescribed the use of
particular valuation standards, 1470 required issuers to base the valuation of their securities on the
price at which the issuer previously sold securities, 1471 or considered other standards designed to
ensure that securities are fairly valued and that approaches to valuation that put investors at a
disadvantage are prohibited. 1472 If we required a specific valuation methodology, such as one of
the suggested alternatives, and it were appropriate for a particular issuer, it could mitigate the
likelihood of inaccurate valuations and result in more informed decisions by investors. However,
specific valuation requirements that do not accommodate inherent differences among companies,
particularly in light of the uncertainty related to the valuation of early-stage companies, might
result in inaccurate valuations and less informed investor decisions. Also, potential additional
calculations and analysis that might be required to implement a prescribed valuation methodology

1472

See Consumer Federation Letter.

436

could impose additional costs on issuers, compared to letting issuers select a valuation method
that fits the particular circumstances of their offering.
i.

Restrictions on Resales

The statute and the final rules include restrictions on the transfer of securities for one year,
subject to limited exceptions (e.g., for transfers to the issuer of the securities, in a registered
offering, to an accredited investor or to certain family members). 1473 As we discussed in the
proposal, we believe that including such proposed restrictions is important for investor protection.
By restricting the transfer of securities for a one-year period, the final rules give investors in a
business a defined period to observe the performance of the business and to potentially obtain
more information about the potential success or failure of the business before trading occurs. The
final rules permit transfers to trusts controlled by, or held for the benefit of, covered family
members. 1474 In a change from the proposed rules, the restrictions apply to any purchasers and
not only to the initial purchasers, consistent with the suggestions of commenters. 1475 This change
addresses the possibility of the initial purchaser selling securities to an eligible purchaser and such
eligible purchaser reselling them to the public within the first year, resulting in the securities
becoming widely traded within the first year.
We recognize that resale restrictions will impose costs. The one-year restriction on
transfers of securities purchased in a transaction conducted in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) may
impede price discovery, raise capital costs to issuers and limit investor participation, particularly
among investors who are unable or unwilling to risk locking up their investments for this period.
The illiquidity cost resulting from the resale restriction may be mitigated, in part, by provisions
1473

See Section 4A(e). See also Rule 501(a) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

1474

See Rule 501(a)(4) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

1475

See CrowdCheck Letter 3; Moskowitz Letter.

437

that allow investors to transfer the securities within one year of issuance by reselling the securities
to accredited investors, back to the issuer or in a registered offering or transferring them to certain
family members or trusts of those family members. The effect of resale restrictions on the extent
to which investors make informed investment decisions is unclear. While resale restrictions may
disincentivize investors from continuing to gather and analyze information about the issuer after
investing while the resale restrictions are in effect, resale restrictions may also strengthen the
incentive to conduct due diligence on the issuer and gather and analyze information before the
initial investment. Nevertheless, at the investment amounts involved in these transactions, a
typical purchaser’s incentives to gather and analyze information before or after investing likely
will remain limited, regardless of the presence of resale restrictions.
4.

Intermediary Requirements

The statute and the final rules require that offerings in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) be
conducted through an intermediary that is a registered broker-dealer or registered funding portal.
The use of a registered intermediary to match issuers and investors will cause issuers to incur
certain transaction costs associated with the intermediation activity1476 but also will provide
centralized venues for crowdfunding activities that are expected to lower investor and issuer
search costs. As discussed earlier, existing lending-based, reward-based, and donation-based
crowdfunding platforms already engage in a large volume of transactions in North America, 1477
demonstrating that the use of platforms for crowdfunding may be familiar to investors and issuers.
We believe that existing non-securities-based crowdfunding platforms will initially be the
primary funding portals in the securities-based crowdfunding market. The entry of registered

1476

See Section III.B.3.a above for a discussion of intermediary fees.

1477

See Section III.A.3 above.

438

broker-dealers and new funding portals in the securities-based crowdfunding market will increase
competition among existing non-securities-based crowdfunding intermediaries and potentially
lower the cost of intermediation to issuers. One commenter stated that it has “a serious concern
with Broker/Dealers having an unfair advantage in the market, by already being regulated and
registered with the Commission as well as FINRA. Therefore, they may be able to service the
market well ahead of Portals.” 1478
We acknowledge that, to the extent that it may take less time and cost for registered
broker-dealers to comply with the requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding as compared to
funding portals, registered broker-dealers may be at a competitive advantage compared to new
entities that seek to register as funding portals and enter the crowdfunding market. However, as
we discuss below, the registration requirements for funding portals are tailored to the more limited
scope of funding portal activities and are thus expected to result in a lower compliance cost for
these entities. Further, the effective dates of the final rules are expected to provide time for
funding portals to register and comply with the other requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding
before crowdfunding offerings can occur. 1479 We recognize, however, that registered brokerdealers can retain a competitive advantage relative to funding portals due to their ability to engage
in a wider range of activities in the securities-based crowdfunding market. 1480 In this regard we
note that the final rules permit funding portals to compensate a registered broker-dealer and to
receive compensation from a registered broker-dealer for services in connection with the funding
1478

See RocketHub Letter. Several other commenters expressed concern about funding portals being at a
competitive disadvantage to registered broker-dealers. See, e.g., Joinvestor Letter; City First Letter;
Seed&Spark Letter; Guzik Letter 1.

1479

The time period between the effective date of the final rules pertaining to funding portal registration as
compared to the later effective date for rules governing crowdfunding offerings is expected to mitigate some
of these effects. See also Section II.C.2.a above.

1480

See also note 607.

439

portal’s offer or sale of securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6), 1481 which may enable funding
portals to partly mitigate the impact of restrictions on funding portal activities in the statute and
final rules. Moreover, even if funding portals remain at a competitive disadvantage to registered
broker-dealers in the securities-based crowdfunding market, overall the expected participation of
multiple registered broker-dealers as intermediaries in offerings in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) may
nevertheless result in a considerable level of competition in the securities-based crowdfunding
marketplace.
Both existing non-securities-based crowdfunding platforms and registered broker-dealers
will need to invest resources to comply with the requirements of the statute and final rules. In
addition, registered broker-dealers will need to develop Internet-based crowdfunding platforms
while existing non-securities-based crowdfunding platforms will need to register as funding
portals or broker-dealers and modify their existing platforms to conform to the requirements of the
statute and the final rules. Although the eventual extent of broker-dealer involvement in the
securities-based crowdfunding market is difficult to estimate, we believe that some broker-dealers
may acquire or form partnerships with funding portals to obtain access to a new and diverse
investor base. In addition, some existing non-securities-based crowdfunding platforms may
eventually form partnerships with registered broker-dealers or funding portals. It is challenging to
exactly predict the future number of persons (or entities) who will register as either broker-dealers
or funding portals to act as intermediaries in securities-based crowdfunding transactions. For
purposes of the PRA, 1482 we estimate that intermediaries will number approximately 110,
including approximately 10 intermediaries that will register as broker-dealers in order to engage in

1481

See Rule 402(b)(7) and Rule 402(b)(8) of Regulation Crowdfunding. See also Section II.D.3.g.

1482

See Section IV.B.2 and Section IV.B.3 below.

440

securities-based crowdfunding; approximately 50 intermediaries that are already registered as
broker-dealers and that will choose to serve as crowdfunding intermediaries; and approximately
50 intermediaries that are not already registered as broker-dealers and that will register as funding
portals. 1483 It is possible that the actual number of participants will deviate significantly from
these estimates, and it is likely that there will be significant competition between existing
crowdfunding venues and new entrants that may result in further changes in the number and types
of intermediaries as the market develops and matures. It also is likely that there will be significant
developments in the types and ranges of crowdfunding products and services offered by
intermediaries to potential issuers and investors, particularly as competitors gain additional
experience in this new marketplace. Moreover, the business models of successful crowdfunding
intermediaries are likely to change over time as they grow in size or market share or if they are
forced to differentiate from other market participants in order to maintain their position in the
market.
As a result of the uncertainty over how the market may develop, any estimates of the
potential number of market participants, their services or fees charged are subject to significant
estimation error. While we recognize that there are benefits as well as costs associated with the
statutory requirements and the final rules pertaining to intermediaries, there are significant

1483

These estimates are based, in part, on recent indications of interest, which may change as the market
develops. According to FINRA, as of October 3, 2013, approximately 36 entities have submitted the
voluntary Interim Form for Funding Portals to FINRA to indicate their intention to act as funding portals
under Title III of the JOBS Act. See Press Release, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, FINRA Issues
Voluntary Interim Form for Crowdfunding Portals (Jan. 10, 2013), available at
http://www.finra.org/Newsroom/NewsReleases/2013/P197636; Financial Industry Regulatory Authority,
Crowdfunding Portals, available at http://www.finra.org/industry/issues/crowdfunding. Based on these
recent indications of interest, we expect that the number of funding portals that will ultimately register with
the Commission will be approximately 50.
We note that these estimates are the same as the estimates of potential crowdfunding intermediaries set forth
in the Proposing Release. We did not receive comments about these estimates.

441

limitations to our ability to estimate these potential benefits and costs.
The statute requires that the offer or sale of securities in reliance on Securities Act
Section 4(a)(6) be conducted through a broker-dealer or a funding portal that complies with the
requirements of Securities Act Section 4A(a). 1484 Among other things, the intermediary must
register with the Commission as a broker-dealer or a funding portal, and it also must register with
a registered national securities association. 1485 The final rules implement these statutory
requirements, including by requiring an intermediary to be a member of FINRA or any other
applicable registered national securities association.
While the benefits and costs are described in further detail below, the following tables
summarize the estimated direct costs to intermediaries, including broker-dealers and funding
portals. Some of the direct costs of the rules will be incurred by all intermediaries, while others
are specific to whether the intermediary is a new entrant (registering as a broker-dealer or a
funding portal) or is already registered as a broker-dealer.
Although we have attempted to estimate the direct costs of the statute and the final rules on
intermediaries, we recognize that some costs can vary significantly across intermediaries, and
within categories of intermediaries. For example, some intermediaries may choose to leverage
existing platforms or systems and so may not need to incur significant additional expenses to
develop a platform or comply with specific requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding. In the
Proposing Release we provided cost estimates for the various intermediary requirements and
requested comment on our estimates. Several commenters discussed the estimates of the costs

1484

See Section 4(a)(6)(C).

1485

See Section 4A(a)(2).

442

associated with intermediaries or provided cost estimates of their own. 1486 Below we discuss the
comments received on each of these costs and any revisions to our estimates made in response.
We estimate that the cost for an entity to register as a broker-dealer and become a member
of a national securities association in order to engage in crowdfunding pursuant to Section 4(a)(6)
will be approximately $275,000, with an ongoing annual cost of approximately $50,000 to
maintain this registration and membership. 1487 In addition, we estimate that the cost to comply
with the various requirements that apply to registered broker-dealers engaging in transactions
pursuant to Section 4(a)(6) for these new registrants will be approximately $245,000 initially and
approximately $180,000 in each year thereafter. In making this estimate, we assume that brokerdealers acting as intermediaries in transactions pursuant to Section 4(a)(6) will provide a full
range of brokerage services in connection with these transactions, including certain services such
as providing investment advice and recommendations, soliciting investors, and managing and
handling customer funds and securities, that funding portals cannot provide. 1488

1486

See, e.g., ASSOB Letter (suggesting that the cost to establish a funding portal would run at least $480,000);
Arctic Island Letter 8 (referring to the cost of establishing and managing escrow accounts); CapSchedule
Letter (citing costs of managing securityholder records); Joinvestor Letter (suggesting in reference to records
to be kept by funding portals that “[u]nder the expectation that crowdfunding portals will be online
operations and will almost certainly retain records through digital methods, the burden of collection should
be minimal” but not providing a specific estimate of the cost of compliance). Various commenters expressed
concern with the cost imposed on intermediaries. See, e.g., Heritage Letter (suggesting that the “costs
incurred by the intermediary in dealing with an issuer, doing the required due diligence and background
screening, establishing a web page describing the offering and so on do not vary linearly with the offering
size”); Seed&Spark Letter; SBEC Letter (suggesting that there will be “extensive staff, technology and
operational costs” in addition to the compliance costs estimated in the Proposing Release).

1487

We recognize that the cost of registering and becoming a member of a national securities association varies
significantly among broker-dealers, depending on facts and circumstances. The cost can vary, among other
factors, based on the number of associated persons of the broker-dealer entity and their licensing
requirements, the scope of the brokerage activities, and the means by which the broker-dealer administers the
registration process (e.g., it may choose to hire outside counsel to assist with the process). We also
recognize that the time required for a broker-dealer to become a member of a national securities association
varies and can take six months to one year. We estimate the range of this cost to be between $50,000 and
$500,000, and so we have chosen the average amount of $275,000 for purposes of this analysis.

1488

Among other things, a broker-dealer providing recommendations and investment advice is required to
comply with FINRA rules on suitability. See FINRA Rule 2111. A broker-dealer soliciting through

443

If instead an entity were to register as a funding portal and become a funding portal
member of a national securities association, we estimate the initial registration and membership
cost will be approximately $100,000, with an ongoing cost of approximately $10,000 in each year
thereafter to maintain this registration and membership. 1489 We estimate that the initial cost for a
registered funding portal to comply with the requirements of the final rules will be approximately
$67,000, with an ongoing cost of approximately $40,000 in each year thereafter.
Finally, we estimate that the incremental initial cost for an intermediary that is already
registered as a broker-dealer to comply with the requirements of the final rules will be
approximately $45,000, with an ongoing cost of approximately $30,000 in each year thereafter.
These estimated costs are consistent with those set forth in the Proposing Release and are
exclusive of the cost of establishing and maintaining a platform and related functionality. For
purposes of the PRA, we estimate that for the average intermediary, the mid-range initial external
platform development cost will be approximately $425,000 and the ongoing cost will be

advertisements is required to comply with FINRA rules relating to communications with the public. See
FINRA Rule 2210. Broker-dealers handling customer funds and securities also are required to maintain net
capital, segregate customer funds and comply with Exchange Act Rule 15c2-4. See Exchange Act Rules
15c3-1, 15c3-3 and 15c2-4 [17 CFR 240.15c3-1, 15c3-3 and 15c2-4].
1489

In making these estimates, we assume that the membership process will take approximately sixty days and
that there will be no related licensing requirement for associated persons of the funding portal. In the
Proposing Release, we estimated that the membership process will take approximately one month. While it
does not affect our estimate of direct costs, we note that a longer membership process can result in
incremental indirect costs to funding portals (e.g., opportunity costs due to not being able to serve as an
intermediary in crowdfunding offerings while registration requirements are not met and competitive costs
due to requiring additional time to register compared to registered broker-dealers. The time period between
the effective date of the final rules pertaining to funding portal registration as compared to the later effective
date for rules governing crowdfunding offerings is expected to mitigate these effects.
We also only include domestic entities in these estimates, which do not need to comply with the
requirements in Regulation Crowdfunding that apply to nonresident funding portals. Nonresident funding
portals are subject to an additional cost of completing Schedule C to Form Funding Portal, hiring and
maintaining an agent for service of process and providing the required opinion of counsel. See Section
IV.C.2.a. below (discussing burden estimates of these additional requirements for purposes of the PRA).

444

approximately $85,000 per year. 1490 However, we anticipate considerable variation among
intermediaries depending on whether they already have in place platforms and systems that can be
adapted to meet the requirements of the final rules. We expect that intermediaries (whether
broker-dealers or funding portals) that already have in place platforms and related systems that
will need only to tailor their existing platform and systems to comply with the requirements of
Regulation Crowdfunding, resulting in a lower initial cost on average of $250,000. We expect the
ongoing cost to remain approximately $85,000 per year for an intermediary that already has in
place a platform and related systems. Commenters did not provide estimates of the cost of
establishing a platform or tailoring an existing platform to comply with the requirements of Title
III. One commenter suggested that the cost of operating a funding portal and regulatory
compliance would be at least $480,000 per year but did not break out this estimate into separate
cost components. 1491

These estimates are based on intermediaries that use a third party to develop the platform. Intermediaries that
develop the platform in-house may incur lower costs. For purposes of the PRA, we estimate that
intermediaries that develop the platform in-house instead of using a third-party provider will spend an
average of 1,500 hours for initial planning, programming and implementation and 300 hours per year in
ongoing internal burden. For purposes of the PRA we estimate that approximately half of the intermediaries
will use a third party to develop the platform and the other half will develop their platforms in-house. See
Section IV.C.2.b below.

1491

See ASSOB Letter.

Commenters suggested that funding portals should not be required to register with the
Commission or become FINRA members (or members of any other registered national securities
association), because unlike broker-dealers, they serve only as an “information delivery
service.” 1499 One commenter stated that the Commission’s estimates in initial costs of registration
as a funding portal and for ongoing expenses create a significant burden given that potential
funding portals operate on modest budgets and with thin margins. 1500 As we note above, however,
registration is a statutory requirement under Securities Act Section 4A(a)(1). 1501 While the
registration requirements will necessarily impose costs on intermediaries, we believe they also
will be effective in providing investor protection for the crowdfunding market while taking into
account the more limited activities of funding portals. Among other things, in addition to the
Commission’s oversight and rulemaking functions with regard to broker-dealers, FINRA currently
is responsible for conducting most broker-dealer examinations, mandating certain disclosures by
its members, writing rules governing the conduct of its members and associated persons, and
informing and educating the investing public. Similarly, we believe that in addition to the benefits
of the Commission’s oversight with regard to funding portals, the regulatory framework that a
registered national securities association – initially FINRA – will be required to create for funding
portals will play an important role in the oversight of these entities.

The estimated costs in the tables above reflect the direct costs that intermediaries will incur
in connection with registering as a broker-dealer on Form BD or as a funding portal on Form
Funding Portal, submitting amendments to registrations and withdrawing registrations. For the
purposes of the PRA, we estimate that approximately 50 intermediaries will be broker-dealers that
have already registered with the Commission1502 and, as such, these broker-dealers will not incur
additional SEC registration costs associated with the final rules. Additionally, intermediaries that
are not otherwise registered with FINRA or any other registered national securities association
will need to register, and the estimated cost for such registration is included in the tables above.
We anticipate that the cost for a funding portal to become a member of a registered national
securities association will be lower than the cost for a broker-dealer to do so because of the more
limited nature of a funding portal’s permissible activities and the streamlined set of rules that an
association is likely to impose on funding portals. In this regard, we note that FINRA has solicited
public comment on a set of proposed rules and related forms for registered funding portals that
become FINRA members pursuant to the crowdfunding provisions of the JOBS Act. 1503
The final rules also require that an intermediary execute transactions exclusively through
its online platform. This requirement may lower the potential for abusive sales practices.
However, it may also prevent investors who lack Internet access from investing through
crowdfunding, as suggested by one commenter. 1504 We believe that the use of an online platform

448

will enhance the ability of issuers and investors to communicate transparently as compared to the
alternative of allowing transactions to occur offline. This requirement also is expected to help
issuers gain exposure to a wide range of investors, who also may benefit from having numerous
investment opportunities aggregated in one place, resulting in lower search costs or burdens
related to identifying suitable investment opportunities.
The final rules further require that an issuer conduct an offering or concurrent offerings in
reliance on Section 4(a)(6) using a single intermediary. 1505 We recognize that this requirement
may impose costs by limiting the set of investors, as well as communication about a transaction, to
the extent that some investors do not use a specific crowdfunding platform. 1506 However, it may
also enhance communication between issuers and investors, as suggested by some
commenters, 1507 and enable investors to access investor discussions about a particular transaction
on a single platform. This requirement may also reduce the risk of issuers circumventing the
aggregate offering limit.
Some commenters suggested that the statutory and rule requirements for establishing a
funding portal and ongoing maintenance and compliance expenses create a significant burden on
funding portals. 1508 Among other concerns, commenters highlighted potential liability for
intermediaries 1509 under Securities Act Section 4A(c) and the cost of conducting background

checks 1510 pursuant to Rule 301(c) as particularly burdensome for funding portals. We are
mindful of the potentially significant costs as a percentage of offering size incurred by
intermediaries, especially funding portals, in securities-based crowdfunding offerings. However,
intermediary requirements are designed to provide a measure of investor protection from the risk
of fraud in small offerings by relatively unknown issuers. Concentration of certain due diligence
tasks at the intermediary level may yield efficiency gains relative to having each small investor
incur the cost to perform such tasks. In addition, although funding portals may be subject to
issuer liability, the changes we have implemented in the final rules will give them greater ability
to control which issuers conduct offerings on their platforms and thus to mitigate to some degree
the risks of liability arising from such offerings.
a.

Disclosure and Dissemination Requirements

The statute and final rules include disclosure and dissemination provisions designed to
provide information to security-based crowdfunding investors. These provisions, together with
the issuer disclosure provisions discussed above, are expected to limit information asymmetries
and promote the efficient allocation of capital amongst crowdfunding offerings. These provisions
also will provide information intended to ensure that investors are aware of the risks associated
with their investment, which can enhance investor protection. As discussed above, many of the
costs and benefits of these provisions are difficult to quantify or estimate with any degree of
certainty, especially considering that securities-based crowdfunding will constitute a new method
for raising capital in the United States. Although we are not able to quantify the direct costs
specifically associated with each of these requirements, these costs are reflected in our general
estimates of the initial and ongoing costs for intermediaries to register, comply with their
1510

See, e.g., RocketHub Letter; Anonymous Letter 4; Zhang Letter. See also Section II.C.3.c above.

450

obligations under the final rules and develop a crowdfunding platform, as reflected in the tables
above.
The final rules prohibit an intermediary or its associated persons from accepting an
investment commitment until the investor has opened an account with the intermediary and the
intermediary has obtained the investor’s consent to electronic delivery of materials. 1511 This
requirement will help ensure that certain basic information about the investor is on file with the
intermediary and that all investors are on notice of the primary method of delivery for
communications from the intermediary. To the extent that an intermediary uses a third party to
establish account opening functionality, the costs relevant to this requirement will be incorporated
into the cost to develop the platform. 1512
The statute requires intermediaries to provide disclosures related to risks and other investor
education materials. The final rules implement this statutory mandate by requiring intermediaries
to deliver educational materials that explain how the offering process works and the risks
associated with investing in crowdfunding securities. 1513 The educational requirements will help
make investors aware of the limits and risks associated with purchasing crowdfunding securities
and facilitate the selection of investments suited to their level of risk tolerance. They also may
help ensure that offerings proceed more efficiently as investors will be better informed by the time
they decide to make their investment commitments and receive required notices. However, we
recognize that the effectiveness of the educational materials in enhancing investor protection will
vary depending upon the quality of the educational materials and the education and experience of

1511

1512

See also Section IV.C.2.d below.

1513

See Rule 302(b) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

451

retail investors. 1514 In addition, materials that highlight the risks of securities-based crowdfunding
can discourage investor participation, which may limit potential capital formation.
Under the final rules, the educational materials can be in any electronic format, including
video format, and the intermediary will have the flexibility to determine how best to communicate
the contents of the educational material. Accordingly, the cost for intermediaries to develop
educational materials is expected to vary widely. For purposes of the PRA, we estimate that the
initial cost for an intermediary using a third-party firm to develop and produce educational
materials will be approximately $10,000 to $30,000 and the ongoing cost will be approximately
$5,000 to $15,000 per year. 1515
The final rules also require that intermediaries obtain representations from investors about
their review of the investor education materials and their understanding of the risks. 1516 This
requirement is expected to improve investors’ understanding of investments in securities-based
crowdfunding offerings. The direct costs of this requirement to an intermediary are reflected in
the tables above as part of the costs of developing a crowdfunding platform, and we believe that
the ongoing burden to comply will be minimal after the intermediary has systems in place to
obtain such representations. This requirement also may limit capital formation to the extent that it
deters investors from making investment commitments or otherwise participating in offerings
made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6).

1515

For the purposes of the PRA, we estimate that development of educational materials in-house will be
associated with an average initial burden of approximately 20 hours and an average annual burden of
approximately 10 hours. See Section IV.C.2.e below.

1516

See Rule 303(b)(2) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

452

Under the final rules, an intermediary must clearly disclose the manner in which the
intermediary is compensated in connection with offers and sales of securities in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6). 1517 As explained above, we believe that investors will benefit by having
information about how intermediaries are compensated, such as through compensation
arrangements with affiliates. We believe that the costs of complying with this requirement
generally will be included in the overall cost for intermediaries to develop their platforms, as it
will entail adding an item of disclosure to the functionality of their platforms. 1518 While the
requirement to disclose compensation arrangements may give rise to indirect costs due to the
intermediary’s competitors learning about the compensation arrangements, we do not expect such
indirect costs to be significant since the intermediary’s competitors can generally infer
information about the intermediary’s compensation arrangements from other sources.
The statute and the final rules further require that intermediaries make available certain
issuer-provided information. 1519 We recognize that requiring intermediaries to provide
prospective investors with information about the issuer will impose costs. We expect that
intermediaries will incur costs to develop the functionality that will allow the uploading and
downloading of issuer information. We believe that the direct costs of complying with this
requirement will be included in the overall cost to intermediaries to develop their platforms and
that this requirement will impose only nominal incremental costs on intermediaries on an ongoing
basis, primarily because the functionality necessary to upload the required issuer disclosure

See Rule 303(a) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

453

information is a standard feature offered on many websites and would not require frequent
updates. 1520
The issuer disclosure requirements are expected to benefit investors by enabling them to
better evaluate the issuer and the offering. Requiring intermediaries to make the issuer
information publicly available and easily accessible on their platforms will reduce information
asymmetries between issuers and investors and will enhance both transparency and efficiency of
the crowdfunding market. Greater accessibility of issuer information may reduce incremental
costs to investors of locating issuer information and may increase their willingness to participate
in a securities-based crowdfunding offering, thereby enhancing capital formation.
The final rules also require an intermediary to provide communication channels on its
platform, meeting certain conditions, which will allow investors who have opened accounts with
intermediaries and representatives of the issuer to interact and exchange comments about the
issuer’s offering on that intermediary’s platform, and which will be publicly available for viewing
(i.e., by those who may not have opened accounts with the intermediary). 1521
Compared with the alternative of not requiring intermediaries to provide communication
channels, we believe this requirement will allow investors, particularly those who may be less
familiar with online social media, to participate in online discussions about ongoing offerings
without having to actively search for such discussions on external websites. Moreover, the
requirement that promoters be clearly identified on these channels will enhance transparency,
allowing those investors that draw information from an intermediary’s online platform to make
potentially better informed investment decisions. The direct costs of this requirement are reflected

1520

See also Section IV.C.2.g below.

1521

See Rule 303(c) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

454

in the tables above as part of costs of developing a crowdfunding platform, and we believe that
once the platform has been set up, the ongoing burden to comply will be minimal. We recognize,
however, that this requirement will not assure that participants in online discussions on the
intermediary’s online platform convey accurate or relevant information in their postings, and it
will not preclude investors from participating in discussions on external websites or other external
social media.
The final rules also require intermediaries, upon receipt of an investment commitment
from an investor, promptly to provide or send to the investor a notification of that investment
commitment. 1522 This requirement will provide investors with key information about their
investment commitments, including notice of the opportunity, as relevant, to cancel their
investment commitments. Investors will benefit from these requirements because they will be
provided with additional information with which to evaluate their investment commitments, their
securities transactions and the intermediaries that are effecting those transactions. The direct costs
of these requirements are reflected in the tables above as part of the costs of developing a
crowdfunding platform. 1523
The final rules implement the statutory requirement for intermediaries to allow investors to
cancel their commitments to invest, by requiring investors to have until 48 hours prior to the
deadline identified in the issuer’s offering materials to cancel their investment commitments.1524
If an issuer reaches its target offering amount prior to the target offering deadline, the final rules
permit early closing of the offering under certain conditions, including a requirement that the
intermediary send notices to investors informing them of the closing and the deadline for the
1522

See Rule 303(d) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

1523

See also Section IV.C.2.h below.

1524

See Rule 304(a) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

455

opportunity to cancel. 1525 The final rules also set forth notice requirements and requirements
related to the intermediary directing payments in the event of cancellations and material changes
to offerings. 1526 Additionally, the final rules impose specific obligations on intermediaries related
to informing investors about their right to cancel an investment commitment. 1527
We believe that investors will benefit from receiving these notices because the
notifications and accompanying information will keep investors informed about the status of the
offering and thereby facilitate better investment decisions. This approach also will benefit
investors by providing them with a specified period of time to review and assess information and
communications about the issuer.
We recognize that allowing investors to cancel their investment commitments up to 48
hours prior to the deadline identified in the issuer’s offering materials may impose a cost on
issuers who, because of investors cancelling commitments late in the offering period, may fall
below the target offering amount and so decide to cancel the offering or to extend the offering
period. Accordingly, we recognize that this requirement may reduce the overall amount of capital
raised in offerings in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) and thus have an adverse effect on capital
formation. Intermediaries are expected to incur direct costs in developing and maintaining
systems to send the relevant notices to investors. These costs are reflected in the tables above as
part of the cost of developing a crowdfunding platform. 1528

b.

Measures to Reduce the Risk of Fraud

The statute and final rules require intermediaries to have a reasonable basis for believing
that an issuer seeking to offer and sell securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) through the
intermediary’s platform complies with the requirements in the final rules 1529 and has established
means to keep accurate records of holders of the securities. 1530 Under the final rules, an
intermediary must deny access to an issuer if it has a reasonable basis for believing that the issuer
or the offering presents the potential for fraud or otherwise raises concerns about investor
protection 1531 or that the issuer or any of its officers, directors (or any person occupying a similar
status or performing a similar function) or 20 Percent Beneficial Owners was subject to a
disqualification under the final rules. 1532 The intermediary also must conduct a background and
securities enforcement check on each of these persons. 1533 We believe that these requirements
will increase investor protection in connection with the offering. 1534
As noted above, the specific costs and benefits of these provisions are difficult to quantify
or estimate with any degree of certainty. However, we have attempted to reflect the direct costs of
these provisions in the tables above as part of our general estimates for the cost of complying with
requirements to act as an intermediary in transactions pursuant to Section 4(a)(6). For purposes of
the PRA, the cost for an intermediary to fulfill the required background checks and securities

enforcement regulatory history checks is estimated to be approximately $13,818 to $34,546 in the
first year and approximately the same in subsequent years. 1535
Each of these requirements is intended to help reduce the risk of fraud in securities-based
crowdfunding. As a result of these requirements, investors will be able to rely on the efforts of the
intermediary that conducted a background and securities enforcement check, solving a collective
action problem that would be prohibitively costly if left to individual investors. To the extent that
these checks help prevent fraudulent activity, they may increase investor willingness to participate
in crowdfunding offerings, thereby facilitating capital formation. We anticipate that most
intermediaries will employ third parties to perform these background checks.
We received several suggestions from commenters aimed at reducing or scaling the costs
of the proposed requirements. One commenter suggested that the checks be required only after an
issuer has met its target offering amount, so as to prevent unnecessary expense to the
intermediary. 1536 Requiring a background check only after an issuer has reached its target may
reduce the total cost of performing background checks for intermediaries; however, it also may
result in intermediaries having to cancel offerings by issuers who fail the background checks,
resulting in additional transactional and reputational costs for the intermediary. Overall, relative
to this alternative, we believe that an intermediary performing a background check on an issuer
prior to the securities offering will improve investor confidence in using a given intermediary.
While intermediaries are required to take certain steps to reduce the risk of fraud, the final
rules provide intermediaries with the flexibility to decide the specific steps to take, consistent with

1535

See Section IV.C.2.c below.

1536

Anonymous Letter 4.

458

some of the commenters’ suggestions. 1537 We believe this may reduce intermediary costs relative
to establishing a more stringent or more specific standard for intermediaries. For example,
deeming an intermediary to have satisfied the Rule 301(b) requirement if the issuer has engaged
the services of a transfer agent that is registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act will
reduce the intermediary cost while at the same time potentially improving investor protection. 1538
In addition, intermediaries may rely on the representations of the issuer unless they have reason to
question the reliability of those representations. Overall, a more rigorous review requirement
represents a tradeoff between enhanced investor confidence in the portal and higher compliance
costs for intermediaries. We recognize that permitting an intermediary to rely on an issuer’s
representations unless the intermediary has reason to question the reliability of the representations
can potentially lessen the incentive for an intermediary to thoroughly investigate the issuers and
securities to be offered on its platform. Such an outcome may result in higher levels of fraud
compared to a requirement that intermediaries perform an independent investigation to ensure that
the issuer complied with all the requirements. A higher level of fraud will negatively affect both
investors in crowdfunding offerings and non-fraudulent issuers. While we recognize this potential
adverse effect, we note that intermediaries may be subject to liability as “issuers,” and this
liability, together with potential reputational harm, is expected to provide significant incentives for
intermediaries to monitor and investigate the offerings on their platforms. We also note that the
communication channels provided on these platforms can provide a potential source of
information for intermediaries, further facilitating their evaluation of prospective issuers.
1537

See, e.g., StartupValley Letter; Vann Letter.

1538

We note that while for purposes of this provision, the issuer is not required to continue to engage the services
of a registered transfer agent on an ongoing basis, since the use of a registered transfer agent is a condition
for the Section 12(g) exemption, issuers with a large number of shareholders of record are expected to have
an incentive to continue to engage the services of a registered transfer agent. See Section III.B.8. below.

459

c.

Other Limitations on Intermediaries

The statute and final rules place certain limitations on intermediaries. These limitations
are expected to increase investor protection in the securities-based crowdfunding market.
The final rules require an intermediary before accepting an investment commitment to
have a reasonable basis for believing that an investor has not exceeded the final rules’ investment
limits but permit an intermediary to rely on investor representations concerning compliance unless
the intermediary has reason to question the reliability of the representations. 1539 While we realize
that investors may make inaccurate representations, we believe that this provision represents a
reasonable approach to implement the statutory requirement, appropriately considering the need
for investors to adhere to investment limitations while mitigating the costs incurred by
intermediaries. The cost to update the required functionality for processing issuer disclosure and
investor acknowledgment information is reflected in the tables above as part of the costs to
develop a crowdfunding platform, and we believe that the ongoing burden to comply would be
minimal.
Under the final rules, intermediaries must require any person, when posting a comment in
the communication channels, to clearly disclose with each posting whether he or she is a founder
or an employee of an issuer engaging in promotional activities on behalf of the issuer or a
compensated promoter 1540 We believe that these disclosure requirements will benefit investors by
promoting a transparent information sharing process. We further believe that intermediaries are in
an appropriate position to take such steps as part of designing communication channels on their
platform.

1539

See Rule 303(b)(1) of Regulation Crowdfunding. See also Section II.C.5.b above.

1540

See Rule 303(c)(4) of Regulation Crowdfunding. See also Section II.C.5.c above.

460

Under the final rules, intermediaries will incur direct costs in complying with the
requirements to disclose compensation to promoters, and certain additional costs from time to
time to ensure continued compliance. These costs are reflected in the table above as part of the
costs of complying with the requirements to act as an intermediary in a Section 4(a)(6)
transaction. In addition, if this requirement discourages the use of promoters by issuers, it may
limit the investor pool for an offering made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6), thus limiting the ability
of an issuer to raise capital. 1541
The statute prohibits the directors, officers or partners of an intermediary, or any person
occupying a similar status or performing a similar function, from having any financial interest in
an issuer that uses the services of the intermediary. The final rules implement this statutory
requirement. In a change from the proposed rules, the final rules provide exceptions to the
prohibition on an intermediary having a financial interest in a crowdfunding issuer. The
intermediary may hold a financial interest in the crowdfunding issuer if the financial interest
represents compensation for the services provided to or for the benefit of the issuer in connection
with the offer or sale of securities in a crowdfunding offering and consists of securities of the
same class and having the same terms, conditions and rights as the securities being offered or sold
in the crowdfunding offering through the intermediary’s platform. By not extending the
prohibition from having any financial interest in an issuer to intermediaries in all instances, the
final rules allow for more flexibility in the payment arrangements between issuers and
intermediaries. This additional option by which the issuer may pay an intermediary for its
services may be beneficial for issuers by allowing them to use more of the capital raised in an
offering for future investments rather than paying a portion of it as a fee to the intermediaries. It
1541

See Rule 300(b) of Regulation Crowdfunding and Section II.C.2.b.

461

also allows funding portals to share in the upside of successful issuers, generating potentially
larger revenue than the offering fee. While allowing intermediaries to have a financial interest in
issuers can align incentives between intermediaries and investors, 1542 it can alternatively lead to
potential conflicts of interest between intermediaries and investors. 1543 While we believe that such
conflicts of interest are possible and may reduce investor protection, they will be significantly
mitigated by the requirement that an intermediary’s financial interest in an issuer consist of
securities of the same class and having the same terms, conditions and rights as the securities
being offered or sold in the crowdfunding offering through the intermediary’s platform. Such
limitations on an intermediary’s financial interest, combined with reputational concerns and the
accompanying disclosure requirements, will likely curb the incentives of intermediaries to act in a
way that harms the interests of crowdfunding investors.
The statute requires that intermediaries ensure that all offering proceeds are provided to
the issuer only when the aggregate capital raised from all investors is equal to or greater than a
target offering amount. 1544 The final rules implement this requirement by requiring intermediaries
that are registered as broker-dealers to comply with the existing requirements of Exchange Act
Rule 15c2-4 and by requiring intermediaries that are registered funding portals to direct investors
to transmit the funds or other consideration directly to a qualified third party that has agreed in
writing to hold the funds for the benefit of the investors and the issuer and to promptly transmit or

1542

See, e.g., AngelList Letter (“So long as the program was consistently applied without judgment by the
intermediary, the net effect would purely be to align the interests of the intermediary with the investor.”).

return the funds to the persons entitled to such funds. 1545 Based on several commenters’
suggestions, 1546 we modified the proposed definition of qualified third parties in Rule 303(e) also
to include registered broker-dealers that carry customer or broker or dealer accounts and hold
funds or securities for those persons and credit unions insured by the NCUA. 1547 The final rules
also require a funding portal to direct the qualified third party to transmit funds to the issuer once
the target offering amount is reached and the cancellation period has elapsed; to return funds to an
investor when an investment commitment has been cancelled; and to return funds to investors
when the offering has not been completed.
These requirements will benefit investors and issuers by helping ensure that funds are
appropriately refunded or transmitted in accordance with the terms of the offering. In particular,
the requirement that the account in which funds are deposited be exclusively for the benefit of
investors and the issuer will help prevent the intermediary or other parties from claiming or
otherwise unlawfully appropriating funds from that account. Expanding the definition of
“qualified third parties” will increase the number of third parties available to hold funds in an
escrow or in an account for the benefit of investors and the issuer, potentially reducing the cost of
the service due to increased competition. We do not expect any significant costs due to this
change from the proposed rules because credit unions insured by the NCUA offer similar
protections to banks while registered broker-dealers that carry customer or broker or dealer
accounts and hold funds or securities for those persons are subject to various regulatory

obligations, which are designed to provide protection of investor funds through the imposition of
capital and other requirements. 1548
Under the statute, intermediaries may not compensate promoters, finders or lead
generators for providing broker-dealers or funding portals with the personally identifiable
information of any potential investor. The final rules implement this statutory requirement by
prohibiting an intermediary from compensating any person for providing the personally
identifiable information of any crowdfunding investor to intermediaries. 1549 Investors will
benefit from the privacy protection provided by this prohibition. Intermediaries will incur a cost
because the rule will not allow them to use personally identifiable information to target and seek
out specific investors, thus reducing the potential investor pool for certain offerings. However,
subject to this restriction, the final rules permit an intermediary to compensate a person for
directing issuers or investors to the intermediary’s platform in certain situations. 1550 This
provision will provide intermediaries with an alternative means to attract more investors to their
crowdfunding platforms, thereby mitigating some of the costs associated with the restriction on
paying for personally identifiable information.
5.

Additional Funding Portal Requirements

Under the final rules, a funding portal must register with the Commission by filing a
complete Form Funding Portal with information concerning the funding portal’s operation. 1551
The final rules also include the statutory requirement that a funding portal be a member of a
registered national securities association. In the table above, we estimate the costs that
1548

See note 868.

1549

See Rule 305(a) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

1550

See Rule 305(b).

1551

See Rule 400(a) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

464

intermediaries will incur related to registering as a funding portal on Form Funding Portal and
becoming a member of a national securities association to be approximately $100,000 in the initial
year and $10,000 thereafter.
The requirement that funding portals register with the Commission and become a member
of a national securities association will benefit investors by providing regulatory oversight for
these new entities, which will help to reduce the risk for fraud. Although there are costs
associated with this requirement, we believe that the protections deriving from this requirement
will benefit investors, issuers and potentially intermediaries by helping to create a marketplace in
which investors are more willing to participate and issuers are more comfortable using this
method of capital formation.
The final rules also require that funding portals use Form Funding Portal to provide
updates whenever information on file becomes inaccurate for any reason, to register successor
funding portals and to withdraw from funding portal registration. Although funding portals would
incur time and compliance costs to update Form Funding Portal, we expect funding portals will
have experience with the filing process for Form Funding Portal from their registration and, as a
result, will be familiar with the filing process by the time they update the form. In the tables
above, this cost is reflected in the $10,000 annual compliance cost associated with registering on
Form Funding Portal and becoming a member of a registered national securities association.
The final rules allow nonresident funding portals to register with the Commission,
provided that certain conditions are met. 1552 The final rules require a nonresident funding portal to
appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and to certify both that it can, as a
matter of law, and will provide the Commission and any national securities association of which it
1552

See Rule 400(f) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

465

becomes a member with prompt access to its books and records and submit to onsite inspection
and examination by the Commission and the national securities association. The funding portal
also must provide an opinion of counsel attesting to the funding portal’s ability to comply with
these requirements under home country law. As discussed above, the final rules condition
nonresident funding portal registration on the presence of an information sharing arrangement
between the Commission and the regulator in the funding portal’s jurisdiction. 1553 This provision
is expected to facilitate Commission oversight of registered nonresident funding portals, with the
potential benefit of stronger protection of investors in offerings conducted on such portals.
However, it may limit the ability of some nonresident funding portals to register, potentially
resulting in adverse competitive effects on nonresident portals in jurisdictions without an
information sharing agreement.
Compared to the alternative of not allowing nonresident entities to operate as funding
portals in the U.S. crowdfunding market, the final rules may increase competition among
crowdfunding intermediaries, which in turn may reduce the fees that intermediaries charge to
issuers. Lower costs of raising capital can also attract more potential issuers to the crowdfunding
market, thus enhancing capital formation. Due to lack of data, we are not able to estimate the
magnitude of these potential effects.
Although the requirements with respect to the appointment of an agent for service of
process, a certification and a legal opinion will impose costs on nonresident funding portals, these
requirements are expected to enhance investor protection by requiring steps designed to ensure
that the books and records of funding portals that are not based in the United States, or that are
subject to laws other than those of the United States, nevertheless are accessible to the
1553

See Rule 400(f) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

466

Commission and other relevant regulators for purposes of conducting examinations of, and
enforcing U.S. laws and regulations against these entities. For PRA purposes, we estimate that
nonresident intermediaries will face an additional cost for outside professional services of $25,179
per intermediary to retain an agent for service of process and provide an opinion of counsel to
register as a nonresident funding portal. 1554
The statute also provides an exemption from broker-dealer registration for funding portals.
The final rules implement the statutory requirement by stating that a registered funding portal is
exempt from the broker-dealer registration requirements of Exchange Act Section 15(a)(1) in
connection with its activities as a funding portal. 1555 We believe this approach of exempting
funding portals from broker-dealer registration and its accompanying regulations will benefit the
market and its participants. The activities of funding portals will be more limited than those of
broker-dealers. Thus, the final rules require funding portals to comply with registration
requirements that are more appropriate for their limited, permissible activities, rather than the
more extensive and higher cost requirements that accompany broker-dealer registration. Lower
registration costs for funding portals may translate into lower fees charged to issuers that use these
portals, thus possibly benefiting issuers of crowdfunding securities and potentially increasing
capital formation. Due to lack of data, we are unable to quantify these potential benefits.
a.

Safe Harbor for Certain Activities

Exchange Act Section 3(a)(80) prohibits funding portals from (1) offering investment
advice or recommendations, (2) soliciting purchases, sales or offers to buy securities offered or

1554

For the purposes of the PRA, we estimate that entities that register as nonresident funding portals also will
incur an additional internal burden of half an hour to complete Schedule C, half an hour to hire an agent for
the service of process, and one hour to provide an opinion of counsel. See Section IV.C.2.a.

1555

See Rule 401 of Regulation Crowdfunding.

467

displayed on the funding portal’s platform, (3) compensating employees, agents or other such
persons for solicitation or based on the sale of securities displayed or referenced on the funding
portal’s platform, or (4) holding, managing, possessing or otherwise handling investor funds or
securities. The final rules give funding portals, their associated persons, affiliates and business
associates, a measure of clarity on activities that are permissible without violating these statutory
prohibitions, while also helping to protect investors from activities that create potential conflicts
of interest. 1556 Thus, compared with the alternative that we could have chosen, that of not
providing the safe harbor, the safe harbor provisions in the final rules may facilitate regulatory
compliance for funding portals, potentially with corresponding benefits for both issuers and
investors. Some safe harbor provisions have additional benefits and costs, which we discuss
below. Other safe harbor provisions may facilitate the implementation of other provisions of the
final rules in instances where the crowdfunding intermediary is a funding portal, in which case the
benefits and costs of such safe harbor provisions will be inseparable from the benefits and costs of
the other provisions of the final rules as applied to instances where the crowdfunding intermediary
is a funding portal.
The safe harbor for a funding portal to provide communication channels on its platform 1557
will facilitate the realization of the benefits of the provision in the final rules that requires the
intermediary to provide communication channels on its platform 1558 in instances where the
crowdfunding intermediary is a funding portal. The provision of communication channels by the
funding portal has the potential to attract a greater number of investors to crowdfunding
transactions through funding portals than otherwise would be the case, thereby encouraging
1556

See Rule 402 of Regulation Crowdfunding.

1557

See Rule 402(b)(4) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

1558

See Rule 303(c) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

468

capital formation. The provision of communication channels may enhance information sharing
among investors, although the relevance and accuracy of the information shared by investors on
these communication channels will likely vary from offering to offering.
In a change from the proposal, the final rules include a conditional safe harbor that will
permit funding portals, consistent with the prohibitions under Exchange Act Section 3(a)(80), to
determine whether and under what circumstances to allow an issuer to offer and sell securities in
reliance on Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) through their platforms. 1559
Allowing funding portals to decide which securities to offer through their platforms will
potentially decrease compliance costs for funding portals because limiting the offerings available
on their platform can help decrease the risk of statutory liability under Section 4A(c) of the
Securities Act, consistent with the suggestions of some commenters. 1560 The ability to determine
which issuers may offer and sell securities through their platforms may also make it easier for
funding portals to bar potentially fraudulent offerings from their platforms, thereby potentially
enhancing investor protection, consistent with the suggestions of various commenters, 1561 as well
as screen out offerings by issuers that are unprepared or not “crowdfund-ready.” 1562 A reduction
in the prevalence of potentially fraudulent offerings, in turn, may increase investor confidence and
facilitate capital formation in the securities-based crowdfunding market. However, we recognize
that, depending on the funding portal, the ability to exercise discretion with respect to which
offerings to include on the platform may result in the exclusion of some issuers that do not pose a
risk of fraud, potentially limiting capital formation and investor access to crowdfunding

1562

See EMKF Letter; SBEC Letter.

469

investment opportunities in those instances. This concern is expected to be mitigated, in part, by
the reputational incentives of intermediaries and competition within the crowdfunding market.
We also recognize that, while funding portals remain subject to more limitations concerning their
activities in the crowdfunding market relative to registered broker-dealers, the ability to exercise
discretion with respect to which offerings to include on their platforms is expected to partly
mitigate the competitive disadvantage of funding portals relative to registered brokers, as
suggested by several commenters. 1563
The final rules also allow a funding portal to highlight particular issuers or offerings of
securities made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) on its platform based on objective criteria, for
example: (1) the type of securities being offered (e.g., common stock, preferred stock or debt
securities); (2) the geographic location of the issuer; (3) the industry or business segment of the
issuer; (4) the number or amount of investment commitments made; (5) the progress in meeting
the target offering amount or, if applicable, the maximum offering amount, and (6) the minimum
or maximum investment amount. 1564 The final rules require that these criteria be objective and
reasonably designed to highlight a broad selection of issuers and offerings and be applied
consistently to all potential issuers and offerings. They also specify that such criteria may not be
related to the advisability of investing in the issuer or offering and may not give the impression of
an investment recommendation. 1565 Under the final rules, funding portals may provide search

1565

470

functions or other tools on its platform that users may use to search, sort or categorize available
offerings according to objective criteria. 1566
A funding portal may choose to categorize offerings into general subject areas or provide
search functions that, for example, allowing an investor to sort through offerings based on a
combination of different objective criteria. We believe that these safe harbor provisions will
benefit investors by facilitating investor access to information about offerings characterized by
certain broad, objective criteria, to the extent that funding portals provide such features and tools
in reliance on the final rules. By enabling issuers to utilize technology to lower the costs of each
investor to search for information about a particular category of offerings, these provisions also
may enhance efficiency. To the extent that the availability of these features and tools encourages
investor participation in crowdfunding offerings, these provisions may have a beneficial effect on
capital formation in the crowdfunding market.
The final rules prohibit a funding portal from receiving any special or additional
compensation for highlighting (or offering to highlight) one or more issuers or offerings on its
platform. 1567 This prohibition is expected to benefit investors by helping prevent conflicts of
interest and incentives for funding portals to favor certain issuers over others. The final rules also
make clear that such objective criteria may not include the advisability of investing in the issuer or
its offering or an assessment of any characteristic of the issuer, its business plan, its management,
or risks associated with an investment. 1568
Under the final rules, funding portals are permitted to provide advice to an issuer on the
structure and content of its offerings, including assistance to the issuer in preparing offering
1566

See Rule 402(b)(3) Regulation Crowdfunding.

471

documentation. 1569 This will allow issuers to obtain guidance that may not typically be available
to them and thereby help to lower funding costs. Many potential issuers seeking to offer and sell
crowdfunding securities are unlikely to be familiar with how to structure offerings so as to raise
capital in the most cost effective manner, and they may not have the capital, knowledge or
resources to hire outside advisors. Given that an issuer will be required to conduct its securitiesbased crowdfunding offerings through an intermediary, we believe that permitting funding portals
to provide these services to issuers will lower overall transaction costs for issuers, as they will not
need to engage additional parties to provide these services. This effect will in turn help enhance
market efficiency.
The final rules also provide a safe harbor for a funding portal to compensate a third party
for referring a person to the funding portal in certain circumstances. 1570 This enables funding
portals to realize the benefits of the provision in the final rules that permits an intermediary to
compensate a person for directing issuers or investors to the intermediary’s platform in certain
circumstances. 1571 This provision is expected to benefit intermediaries by providing them with a
means to attract more investors to their crowdfunding platforms, thereby encouraging capital
formation. Investors also will benefit from the condition of this safe harbor prohibiting
transaction-based compensation (other than to registered broker-dealers), which is expected to
reduce the incentive for abusive practices.
The final rules also provide a safe harbor for a funding portal to pay or offer to pay
compensation to a registered broker-dealer for services provided in connection with the offer or

1569

See Rule 402(b)(5) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

1571

See Rule 305(b) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

472

sale of securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6), subject to conditions set forth in the rule. 1572
Similarly, a funding portal can, subject to certain conditions, receive compensation from a
registered broker-dealer for services provided in connection with the offer or sale of securities by
the funding portal in reliance on Section 4(a)(6). 1573 We note that some commenters expressed
concern that such relationships between funding portals and broker-dealers could create conflicts
of interest. 1574 However, funding portals are expected to benefit from being able to enter into
these types of arrangements with registered broker-dealers who can provide services that the
funding portals otherwise are prohibited from providing, such as engaging a broker-dealer to serve
as a qualified third party for the transmission of investor funds. Broker-dealers also will benefit
from the additional business that funding portals may be able to attract through the funding
portals’ platforms, as well as from services, such as those related to technology, that funding
portals can provide. We anticipate that these types of service arrangements will ultimately benefit
investors.
The final rules permit a funding portal to advertise its existence and identify one or more
issuers or offerings available through its platform subject to certain conditions. 1575 This provision
will benefit funding portals by allowing them to potentially attract more investors to their
crowdfunding platforms. This provision also may enhance market efficiency as investors become
more aware of available offerings through advertisements by funding portals and are thus able to
better match their investments with projects that are better suited to their risk preferences and
investment strategies. The conditions on advertising by funding portals in the final rules aim to

See Rule 402(b)(7) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

1573

See Rule 402(b)(8) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

1574

See e.g., Commonwealth of Massachusetts Letter; RocketHub Letter.

1575

See Rule 402(b)(9) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

473

consider informational benefits and investor protection concerns. For instance, while a funding
portal advertising its existence may also identify one or more issuers or offerings available on its
platform, it must do so on the basis of objective criteria that are reasonably designed to identify a
broad selection of issuers and offerings and are applied consistently to all potential issuers and
offerings. In addition, advertisements sent by a funding portal must not suggest that it is a
recommendation to purchase a security or advice as to the advisability in investing in any
security. 1576 While we believe these conditions are appropriate to protect the integrity of the
crowdfunding market, we recognize that they may impose costs on funding portals. For example
these conditions may limit the utility of advertising for the funding portal while the prohibition on
special or additional compensation for identifying the offering in an advertisement may reduce the
funding portal’s revenue.
As discussed above, the final rules require an intermediary to deny access to its platform to
an issuer that the intermediary has a reasonable basis for believing presents the potential for fraud
or otherwise raises concerns about investor protection. 1577 The final rules also provide a
conditional safe harbor to intermediaries that are funding portals to deny access to the platform or
cancel an offering in such instances. 1578 These provisions are expected to enhance investor
protection by giving funding portals greater ability to deny potentially fraudulent offerings.
Funding portals are expected to benefit from the ability to deny access to certain issuers to protect
the integrity of the offering process and the market reputation of their crowdfunding platforms,
without fear of violating the statutory prohibition on providing investment advice.

1576

1577

See Rule 301(c) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

1578

See Rule 402(b)(10) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

474

The final rules specify that a funding portal may accept, on behalf of an issuer, investment
commitments for crowdfunding offerings from investors. 1579 Under the final rules funding portals
also can direct investors where to transmit funds or remit payment in connection with the purchase
of securities offered and sold in reliance on Section 4(a)(6). 1580 Similarly, a funding portal can
direct a qualified third party to release proceeds of a successful offering to the issuer upon
completion of the offering or to return investor proceeds when an investment commitment or
offering is cancelled. 1581 These provisions will facilitate the implementation of the requirements
of the final rules regarding the maintenance and transmission of investor funds 1582 for
intermediaries that are funding portals and give both funding portals and entities with which they
do business a measure of legal certainty that funding portals accepting investment commitments
for crowdfunding offerings and providing direction for funds to and from qualified third parties in
compliance with the final rules will not be in violation of the statutory prohibitions on holding,
managing, possessing or otherwise handling investor funds or securities. While we agree with the
commenter that stated that the requirement to use a qualified third party to handle customer funds
creates an additional cost, 1583 Section 3(a)(80)(D) of the Exchange Act explicitly prohibits
funding portals from handling customer funds and securities.
b.

Compliance Requirements

The final rules require that a funding portal implement written policies and procedures,
reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and

1579

See Rule 402(b)(11) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

1580

See Rule 402(b)(12) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

1582

See Rule 303(e) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

1583

See Stephenson, et al., Letter.

475

regulations thereunder, relating to its business as a funding portal. 1584 This requirement will
provide a benefit to investors and funding portals alike, as written policies and procedures will
enhance compliance with the final rules. Funding portals will incur costs associated with the
requirement to develop their own procedures and implement written policies and procedures, as
well as to update and enforce them. These costs are reflected in the tables above as part of the
costs to comply with requirements to act as an intermediary in transactions pursuant to
Section 4(a)(6).
In contrast to the proposal, the final rules do not impose anti-money laundering (AML)
obligations for funding portals. Some commenters generally suggested that since funding portals
are prohibited from handling customer funds and securities, they should not be required to comply
with AML provisions. 1585 As noted above, we believe it would be appropriate to work with other
regulators to develop consistent and effective AML obligations for funding portals. 1586 By not
imposing AML requirements in the final rules, we may avoid the possibility of conflicting or
overlapping requirements. Registered broker-dealers that serve as intermediaries in securitiesbased crowdfunding transactions continue to have AML obligations, as do certain other parties
involved in transactions conducted pursuant to Section 4(a)(6), such as a bank acting as a qualified
third party to hold investor funds. 1587 To the extent that this difference in compliance obligations
between funding portals and registered broker-dealers affects compliance costs and persists in the
future, it may place funding portals at a relative competitive advantage. If this difference in
compliance obligations between funding portals and registered broker-dealers persists in the
1584

See Rule 403(a) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

1586

See Section II.D.4.b.

1587

Id.

476

future, it may also potentially expose investors in those securities-based crowdfunding offerings
for which the intermediary is a funding portal to additional risks.
Additionally, the statute requires that intermediaries take such steps to protect the privacy
of information collected from investors as we determine appropriate. In the final rules, we
implement this statutory provision by requiring a funding portal to comply with Regulation S-P,
S-ID and Regulation S-AM, as they apply to broker-dealers. 1588 We recognize that compliance
with these privacy requirements will impose costs on funding portals. However, we believe that
requiring a funding portal to comply with privacy obligations will help protect the personally
identifiable information of investors, consistent with how it is required to be protected by other
financial intermediaries. These privacy protections can give investors the confidence to
participate in offerings made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6), which will facilitate capital formation
and benefit the markets generally. As an alternative, we could have developed a more limited
privacy regime applicable only to funding portals. Such an alternative would result in inconsistent
treatment of funding portals and broker-dealers with respect to privacy obligations and could
reduce the willingness of investors to participate in securities-based crowdfunding offerings. This
alternative might also affect competition between funding portals and registered broker-dealers in
the market for securities-based crowdfunding offerings.
As a condition to exempting funding portals from the requirement to register as brokerdealers under Exchange Act Section 15(a)(1), Exchange Act Section 3(h)(1)(A) requires that
registered funding portals remain subject to, among other things, the Commission’s examination
authority. Under the final rules, a funding portal is required to permit the examination and
inspection of all its business and business operations relating to its activities as a funding portal,
1588

See Rule 403(b) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

477

such as its premises, systems, platforms and records, by Commission representatives and by
representatives of the registered national securities association of which it becomes a member. 1589
Although funding portals will face time and compliance costs in submitting to Commission and
registered national securities association examinations, inspections or investigations, and
potentially responding to any issues identified, funding portals, investors and issuers will benefit
from the enhanced compliance with legal obligations due to this oversight, as well as the sanctions
or other disciplinary actions that may follow upon findings of violations through such inspections,
examinations or investigations.
Further, the final rules require a registered funding portal to maintain and preserve certain
books and records relating to its business for a period of not less than five years and in an easilyaccessible place for the first two years. 1590 Recordkeeping requirements can assist registrants with
compliance. They are a well-established and important element of the approach to broker-dealer
regulation, as well as the regulation of investment advisers and others, and are designed to
maintain the effectiveness of our inspection program for regulated entities, facilitating our review
of their compliance with statutory mandates and with our rules. These requirements will enable
the Commission and registered national securities organizations to more effectively gather
information about the activities in which a funding portal has been engaged to discern whether the
funding portal and the other parties are in compliance with the requirements of Regulation
Crowdfunding and other relevant regulatory requirements. Standardized recordkeeping practices
for intermediaries will enable regulators to perform more efficient, targeted inspections and
1589

See Rule 403(c) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

1590

See Rule 404(a) of Regulation Crowdfunding. We note that registered broker-dealers already are required to
comply with Exchange Act Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 pertaining to books and records (17 CFR 240.17a-3 and
17a-4). Thus, all intermediaries, whether registered as broker-dealers or as funding portals, are required to
make and preserve books and records.

478

examinations and thereby increase the likelihood of identifying improper conduct at earlier stages
of the inspection or examination, which ultimately will benefit investors and the marketplace as a
whole. To the extent that these requirements result in better regulatory oversight, they may
increase investor confidence in funding portals and may also benefit funding portals by promoting
issuer reliance on funding portals in crowdfunding offerings.
Funding portals may incur costs in establishing the systems necessary to comply with the
books and records requirements. We note that the records required to be made and preserved
under the final rules are those that would ordinarily be made and preserved in the ordinary course
of business by a regulated broker-dealer engaging in these activities. Entities that newly register
as broker-dealers will be subject to the recordkeeping requirements of Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4.
While these costs will constitute part of the cost of compliance for entities that choose to become
intermediaries in crowdfunding transactions by registering as broker-dealers, the cost of brokerdealer compliance with recordkeeping requirements of Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 is not by itself a
result of the final rule. Entities solely intending to serve as intermediaries in crowdfunding
transactions for which the cost of compliance with broker-dealer recordkeeping requirements is
too high may elect to register as funding portals. Funding portals will be required to make and
keep records related to their activities to facilitate transactions in reliance on Section 4(a)(6),
which we estimate for the purposes of the PRA to result in an initial burden of 325 hours and an
initial cost of $5,350 per funding portal. We estimate that ongoing recordkeeping burden and cost
will be similar to the initial burden and cost. 1591 We also note that some commenters stated that
the cost burden for a funding portal to maintain the proposed books and records would not be

1591

See Section IV.C.2.n.

479

significant. 1592 We recognize that there may be a slight competitive advantage for funding portals
over broker-dealers to the extent that the recordkeeping rule for funding portals is less
burdensome for than the requirements applicable to broker-dealers. At the same time, we believe
that the recordkeeping rule for funding portals is consistent with the narrow range of their
permitted activities.
6.

Insignificant Deviations

We are providing a safe harbor for issuers for certain insignificant deviations from a term,
condition or requirement of Regulation Crowdfunding. 1593 This safe harbor will provide that
insignificant deviations from a term, condition or requirement of Regulation Crowdfunding will
not result in a loss of the exemption, so long as the issuer relying on the exemption can show that:
(1) the failure to comply was insignificant with respect to the offering as a whole; (2) the issuer
made a good faith and reasonable attempt to comply with all applicable terms, conditions and
requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding; and (3) the issuer did not know of the failure to
comply, where the failure to comply with a term, condition or requirement was the result of the
failure of the intermediary to comply with the requirements of Section 4A(a) and the related rules,
or such failure by the intermediary occurred solely in offerings other than the issuer’s offering.
The safe harbor is expected to decrease the costs incurred by issuers compared to the
alternative of not providing a safe harbor. In the absence of a safe harbor, issuers might be
hesitant to participate in this new marketplace for fear of inadvertently violating an applicable
regulatory requirement, thereby reducing the benefits of Regulation Crowdfunding on efficiency,
competition and capital formation. We recognize that providing a safe harbor can impose costs on

1592

See CFIRA Letter 1; Joinvestor Letter.

1593

See Rule 502(a) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

480

investors, intermediaries and regulators, compared with the alternative of not providing a safe
harbor, to the extent that issuers lessen the vigor with which they develop and implement systems
and controls to achieve compliance with the requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding, which
may result in a decrease in investor protection. Accordingly, we have designed the conditions of
the safe harbor – specifically, the issuer must show that the failure to comply was insignificant
with respect to the offering as a whole; it made a good faith and reasonable attempt to comply;
and it did not know of the failure or such failure occurred solely in offerings other than the
issuer’s offering – to lessen the potential impact on investor protection.
Several commenters suggested that the safe harbor for insignificant deviations should not
apply with respect to state regulatory enforcement actions. 1594 Adopting such an alternative could
have significantly undermined the utility of the Section 4(a)(6) exemption by subjecting issuers to
loss of state law preemption 1595 and potential state enforcement action for insignificant deviations
from Regulation Crowdfunding’s requirements.

Relationship with State Law

Section 305 of the JOBS Act amended Securities Act Section 18(b)(4) 1596 to preempt the
ability of states to regulate certain aspects of crowdfunding conducted pursuant to Section 4(a)(6).
This statutory amendment will benefit issuers by preempting any registration requirements in
states in which they offer or sell securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6), thereby reducing the
costs for these transactions. It also can benefit investors because these cost savings ultimately
may be passed on to investors. Absent preemption of state registration requirements, an offering
made through the Internet in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) and the final rules could result in an

issuer potentially violating state securities laws. Some evidence in donation-based and rewardbased crowdfunding campaigns suggests that contributions are not exclusively local. 1597 The
statutory preemption of state registration requirements will reduce issuer uncertainty about the
necessity of state registration. On the other hand, state registration requirements may provide an
additional layer of investor protection, and their preemption will remove a potential layer of
review that may help to deter fraud. This potential cost of state law preemption, however, may be
offset by some of the statutory and final rule requirements that are designed to protect investors,
such as public disclosure, 1598 investment limits,1599 the use of a registered intermediary, 1600
provisions regarding measures to reduce the risk of fraud, 1601 and disqualification provisions. 1602
The requirement in the final rules that issuers file information on EDGAR also helps to ensure that
information about issuers is available to individual state regulators, which retain the authority to
bring enforcement actions for fraud.

Exemption from Section 12(g)

Rule 12g-6 provides that securities issued pursuant to an offering made under Section
4(a)(6) are exempted from the record holder count under Section 12(g) provided the issuer is
current in its ongoing annual reports required pursuant to Rule 202 of Regulation Crowdfunding,
has total assets as of the end of its last fiscal year not in excess of $25 million, and has engaged

For example, in crowdfunding campaigns for early stage musical projects, the average distance between
artist-entrepreneurs and contributors was 3,000 miles. See Ajay Agrawal, Christian Catalini and Avi

the services of a transfer agent registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 17A of the
Exchange Act. The issuer size test is broadly consistent with some commenters’ suggestions. 1603
An issuer that exceeds the $25 million total asset threshold in addition to exceeding the
thresholds in Section 12(g) will be granted a two-year transition period before it is required to
register its class of securities pursuant to Section 12(g), provided it timely files all its ongoing
reports due pursuant to Rule 202 of Regulation Crowdfunding during such period. 1604 Section
12(g) registration will be required only if, on the last day of the fiscal year in which the company
exceeded the $25 million total asset threshold, the company has total assets of more than $10
million and the class of equity securities is held by more than 2,000 persons or 500 persons who
are not accredited investors. 1605 In such circumstances, an issuer that exceeds the thresholds in
Section 12(g) and has total assets of $25 million or more is required to begin reporting under the
Exchange Act the fiscal year immediately following the end of the two-year transition period. 1606
An issuer entering Exchange Act reporting will be considered an “emerging growth company” to
the extent the issuer otherwise qualifies for such status.
The conditional 12(g) exemption will defer the more extensive Exchange Act reporting
requirements until the issuer either sells securities in a registered transaction or registers a class of
securities under the Exchange Act. Consequently, smaller issuers will not be required to become
an Exchange Act reporting company as a result of a Section 4(a)(6) offering. These offerings may
have a large number of investors due to the limits on the amount each investor may invest and the
absence of investor eligibility restrictions, or as a result of secondary market transactions in

crowdfunding securities after the expiration of resale restrictions. Given the $1 million offering
limitation, the potential cost of becoming an Exchange Act reporting company could have made
many offerings in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) prohibitively costly.
The condition that the issuer remain current in its ongoing reporting, as suggested by one
commenter, 1607 is intended to provide sufficient disclosure to help investors make informed
decisions. We believe that the ongoing disclosures required of crowdfunding issuers in the final
rules accomplish this objective and provide an appropriate consideration of investor protection
and capital formation. This condition is expected to increase the level of investor protection by
strengthening the incentives of securities-based crowdfunding issuers that exceed the Section
12(g) thresholds related to issuer size and the number of shareholders of record to comply with the
ongoing reporting requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding. The extent of additional investor
protection benefits from this condition is difficult to estimate, given a separate provision in the
final rules that conditions the use of the Section 4(a)(6) exemption for future offerings on
compliance with Regulation Crowdfunding’s ongoing reporting requirements.
The issuer size limit condition is designed to be broadly consistent with the crowdfunding
exemption being tailored to facilitate small company capital formation and the likely small size of
a typical issuer in the crowdfunding market. This condition is expected to strengthen investor
protection by reducing the likelihood that an issuer will grow and accumulate a significant number
of investors as a result of multiple offerings in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) while remaining
permanently exempt from the more extensive reporting requirements of the Exchange Act that
would otherwise be required pursuant to Section 12(g) (unless the issuer registers a class of
securities). The size limit condition will require larger issuers to provide investors with the more
1607

See Joinvestor Letter.

484

extensive disclosures required by the Exchange Act for reporting companies. However, we
recognize that this condition also may subject crowdfunding issuers that are larger than the size
threshold or that have a higher rate of growth, and are thus more likely to exceed the size
threshold in the future, to the costs of Section 12(g) registration and Exchange Act reporting,
potentially placing them at a competitive disadvantage to issuers that are close to but below the
size threshold. It may also discourage some high-growth issuers from relying on Section 4(a)(6)
or may lead issuers approaching the size threshold to divest assets to remain under the threshold,
potentially resulting in inefficient investment decisions.
While the condition requiring an issuer to use a registered transfer agent to rely on the
exemption will impose costs on issuers, 1608 it is designed to provide investor protection benefits
by introducing a regulated entity with experience in maintaining accurate shareholder records,
thus helping to ensure that security holder records and secondary trades will be handled
accurately.

9.

Disqualification

The statute and the final rules impose disqualification provisions under which an issuer is
not eligible to offer securities pursuant to Section 4(a)(6) and an intermediary is not eligible to
effect or participate in transactions pursuant to Section 4(a)(6). 1609 The disqualification provisions
for issuers are substantially similar to those imposed under Rule 262 of Regulation A and Rule
1608

See STA Letter (stating that strong competition in the registered transfer agent industry may result in
monthly fees of $75 - $300 for transfer agent services, depending on a number of factors). See also
CapSchedule Letter (stating that there exist cost-effective ways to keep records of security holders, such as
“Software-As-A-Service” products, that costs $0 to set up initial records regardless of the number of
investors, then pricing from $5 per month for up to 100 investors, $15 per month up to 1,000 investors and
$25 per month for over 1,000 investors).

3(a)(39), which is an established standard for broker-dealers, are substantially similar to the
provisions of Rule 262.
a.

Issuers

The final rules are expected to induce issuers to implement measures to restrict bad actor
participation in offerings made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6). This will help reduce the potential
for fraud in the market for such offerings, which in turn may reduce the cost of raising capital to
issuers that rely on Section 4(a)(6), to the extent that disqualification standards lower the risk
premium associated with the presence of bad actors in securities offerings. In addition, the
requirement that issuers determine whether any covered persons are subject to disqualification
may obviate the need for investors to do their own investigations and eliminate redundancies that
may exist in otherwise separate investigations. This is expected to help reduce informationgathering costs to investors, to the extent that issuers are at an advantage in accessing much of the
relevant information and to the extent that issuers can do so at a lower cost than investors.
The final rules will, however, impose costs on some issuers, other covered persons and
investors. If issuers are disqualified from relying on Section 4(a)(6) to make their offerings, they
may experience increased costs in raising capital through alternative methods that do not require
bad actor disqualification, if available, or they may be precluded from raising capital altogether.
This can result in negative effects on capital formation. In addition, issuers may incur costs in
connection with internal personnel changes that issuers may make to avoid the participation of
those covered persons who are subject to disqualifying events. Issuers also may incur costs
associated with restructuring share ownership positions to avoid having 20 Percent Beneficial
1610

See Disqualification Adopting Release, note 1182. See also Regulation A Adopting Release, note 506.

486

Owners who are subject to disqualifying events. Finally, issuers may incur costs in connection
with seeking waivers of disqualification from the Commission or determinations by other
authorities that existing orders do not give rise to disqualification.
The final rules provide a reasonable care exception whereby an issuer will not lose the
benefit of the Section 4(a)(6) exemption if it is able to show that it did not know, and in the
exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of a disqualification. 1611 A
reasonable care exception may encourage capital formation by eliminating any hesitation issuers
may otherwise experience under a strict liability standard. However, such an exception also may
encourage issuers to take fewer steps to inquire about the existence of a disqualification than they
would if a strict liability standard applied, increasing the potential for fraud in the market for
offerings made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6). Nevertheless, some issuers, in exercising
reasonable care, may incur costs associated with conducting and documenting their factual inquiry
into possible disqualifications. The lack of specificity in the rule, while providing flexibility to
the issuer to tailor its factual inquiry as appropriate to a particular offering, may increase these
costs because uncertainty can drive issuers to do more than necessary under the rule.
The requirement under the final rules that issuers disclose matters that would have
triggered disqualification, had they occurred after the effective date of Regulation
Crowdfunding, 1612 also will impose costs and benefits. The disclosure requirement will reduce
costs associated with covered persons who would be disqualified under the final rules but for the
fact that the disqualifying event occurred prior to the effective date of the rules. However, this
approach will allow the participation of past bad actors, whose disqualifying events occurred prior

1611

See Rule 503(b)(4) of Regulation Crowdfunding. See also Section II.E.6.a.iii.

1612

See Rule 201(u) of Regulation Crowdfunding. See also Section II.E.6.a.v.

487

to the effective date of the final rules, which can expose investors to the risks that arise when bad
actors are associated with an offering. Nevertheless, investors will benefit by having access to
such information that can inform their investment decisions. Issuers also may incur costs
associated with the factual inquiry, preparing the required disclosure and making any internal or
share ownership changes to avoid the participation of covered persons that trigger the disclosure
requirement. Disclosure of triggering events also may make it more difficult for issuers to attract
investors, and issuers may experience some or all of the impact of disqualification as a result.
We believe the inclusion of Commission cease-and-desist orders in the list of disqualifying
events will not impose a significant, incremental cost on issuers and other covered persons
because many of these actors may already be subject to disqualifying orders issued by the states,
federal banking regulators and the National Credit Union Administration. 1613
Under the final rules, orders issued by the CFTC will trigger disqualification to the same
extent as orders of the regulators enumerated in Section 302(d)(2)(B)(i) of the JOBS Act (e.g.,
state securities, insurance and banking regulators, federal banking agencies and the National
Credit Union Administration). We believe that including orders of the CFTC will result in the
similar treatment, for disqualification purposes, of comparable sanctions. In this regard, we note
that the conduct that will typically give rise to CFTC sanctions is similar to the type of conduct
that will result in disqualification if it were the subject of sanctions by another financial services
industry regulator. This is likely to enable the disqualification rules to more effectively screen out
bad actors.
As discussed above, the baseline for our economic analysis of Regulation Crowdfunding,
including the baseline for our consideration of the effects of the final rules on efficiency,
1613

See Disqualification Adopting Release, note 1182.

488

competition and capital formation, is the situation in existence today, in which startups and small
businesses seeking to raise capital through securities offerings must register the offer and sale of
securities under the Securities Act unless they can comply with an existing exemption from
registration under the federal securities laws. Relative to the current baseline, we believe that the
disqualification provisions will not impose significant incremental costs on issuers and other
covered persons because the final rules are substantially similar to the disqualification provisions
under existing exemptions.
As an alternative, we could have specified that pre-existing events are subject to the
disqualification rules, as suggested by some commenters. 1614 As another alternative, we could
have expanded the list of covered persons to include transfer agents and lawyers, as suggested by
one commenter. 1615 By expanding the range and categories of potentially disqualified persons,
both of these alternatives could have the benefit of strengthening investor protection. At the same
time, they would increase the compliance costs for issuers and disqualified persons described
above. Overall, we believe that preserving consistency with the disqualification criteria of Rule
262 and Rule 506, as we do in the final rules, can potentially yield compliance cost savings for
issuers that undertake multiple types of exempt offerings while still maintaining appropriate
investor protections.
b.

Intermediaries

With regard to intermediaries, the final rules apply the disqualification provisions under
Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act, rather than a standard based on Rule 262. 1616 The Section

1614

See, e.g., Guzik Letter 1; NASAA Letter.

1615

See Brown J. Letter (also recommending the Commission adopt similar bad actor provisions under Rule
504).

1616

See Rule 503(d) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

489

3(a)(39) standard is an established one among broker-dealers and their regulators, and we believe
that, despite the differences, Section 3(a)(39) and Rule 262 are substantially similar with regard to
the persons and events they cover, their scope and their purpose. 1617 We believe that imposing
any new or different standard, including one based on Rule 262, for those intermediaries that
engage in crowdfunding transactions would likely create confusion and unnecessary burdens, as
currently-registered broker-dealers and their associated persons would become subject to two
distinct standards for disqualification. Moreover, adopting a more stringent disqualification
standard may reduce the number of intermediaries eligible under the final rules and decrease
competition among intermediaries in the securities-based crowdfunding market. By contrast,
consistent standards for all broker-dealers and funding portals will assist a registered national
securities association in monitoring compliance and enforcing its rules.
The final rules implement the statutory requirement for intermediaries by providing that a
person subject to a statutory disqualification, as defined in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(39), may
not act as, or be an associated person of, an intermediary in a transaction involving the offer or
sale of securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) unless so permitted by Commission rule or order.
While this requirement will potentially reduce the number of intermediaries for Section 4(a)(6)
transactions, we expect that it will strengthen investor protection by preventing bad actors from
entering the securities-based crowdfunding market, thereby reducing the potential for fraud and
other abuse.
As discussed above, the baseline for our economic analysis of Regulation Crowdfunding,
including the baseline for our consideration of the effects of the final rules on efficiency,
competition and capital formation, is the situation in existence today, in which intermediaries
1617

See discussion in Section II.E.6.b above.

490

intending to facilitate securities transactions are required to register with the Commission as
broker-dealers under Exchange Act Section 15(a). Relative to this baseline, we believe that the
disqualification provisions will not impose significant incremental costs to broker-dealers because
the final rules include the same disqualification provisions that are already imposed on brokerdealers.
IV.

PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT
A.

Background

Certain provisions of the final rules contain “collection of information” requirements
within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”). 1618 We published a notice
requesting comment on the collection of information requirements in the Proposing Release, and
we submitted the proposal to the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) for review in
accordance with the PRA. 1619
In the Proposing Release, we solicited comment on the assumptions and estimates in our
PRA analysis. We received no comments on our estimates of and assumptions about the number
of issuers and intermediaries that will participate in securities-based crowdfunding transactions or
the size and frequency of those transactions. We received several comments on our estimates of
the time and expense required of issuers to meet their filing obligations. 1620 We also received
several comments on our estimates of the costs incurred by intermediaries. 1621 One commenter
recommended a lessened paperwork burden in general. 1622 These comments are discussed in

491

further detail below, and where appropriate, we have revised our burden estimates in response to
commenters’ suggestions and to reflect changes in the final rules, as adopted.
The titles for the collections of information are:
(1) “Form ID” (OMB Control Number 3235-0328);
(2) “Form C” (OMB Control Number 3235-0716) (a new collection of information);
(3) “Form BD” (OMB Control Number 3235-0012); and
(4) “Crowdfunding Rules 300-304 – Intermediaries” (OMB Control Number 32350726) 1623 (a new collection of information) and
(5) “Crowdfunding Rules 400-404 – Funding Portals” (OMB Control Number 32350727) 1624 (a new collection of information).
An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a
collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. We applied
for OMB control numbers for the new collections of information in accordance with
44 U.S.C. 3507(j) and 5 CFR 1320.13, and as of the date of this release, OMB has assigned a
control number to each new collection as specified above. Responses to these new collections of
information will be mandatory for issuers raising capital under Regulation Crowdfunding and
intermediaries participating in offerings under Regulation Crowdfunding.
The hours and costs associated with preparing disclosure, filing forms, and retaining
records constitute reporting and cost burdens imposed by the collections of information. In
deriving estimates of these hours and costs, we recognize that the burdens likely will vary among
individual issuers and intermediaries based on a number of factors, including the stage of
1623

This includes burdens for compliance with privacy rules (Reg. S-P, Reg. S-AM and Reg S-ID) as required by
Rule 403(b).

1624

This includes burdens for Form Funding Portal.

492

development of the business, the amount of capital an issuer seeks to raise, the number of
offerings an intermediary hosts on its platform, and the number of years since inception of the
business. We believe that some issuers and intermediaries will experience costs in excess of the
average and some issuers and intermediaries may experience less than the average costs.
B.

Estimate of Issuers and Intermediaries
1.

Issuers

The number, type and size of the issuers that will participate in securities-based
crowdfunding transactions are uncertain, but data on current market practices may help identify
the number and characteristics of potential issuers that may offer and sell securities in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6). 1625 While it is not possible to predict the number of future offerings made in
reliance on Section 4(a)(6), particularly because rules governing securities-based crowdfunding
are not yet in effect, for purposes of this analysis, we estimate that approximately 1,900 issuers
will seek to offer and sell securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) per year. We base this estimate
on the average number of issuers (excluding issuers that are pooled investment vehicles) per year
that conducted a new Regulation D offering of up to $1 million from 2009 to 2014 and had no
revenues or less than $1 million in revenues. 1626 We believe those issuers will be similar in size to
the potential issuers that may participate in securities-based crowdfunding, and we assume that
each issuer will conduct one offering per year.

1625

See Section III.A.5.a for a discussion of the data regarding current market practices.

1626

Id. This estimate differs from our estimate in the proposal. It uses more recent data than the proposal and is
based on the average number of issuers per year rather than the average number of unique issuers.
According to filings made with the Commission, an average of approximately 4,559 issuers per year
conducted new Regulation D offerings of up to $1 million from 2009 to 2014. 22%, or 1,003, of those
issuers reported having no revenues. (0.22 x 4,559 = 1,003). 19%, or 866, of those issuers reported having
less than $1 million in revenues. (0.19 x 4,559 = 866). Therefore, the average number of issuers per year is
1,003 + 866 = 1,869, or approximately 1,900 issuers.

493

We received no comments on our estimate of the number of issuers expected to participate
in securities-based crowdfunding transactions or the number of offerings in reliance on Section
4(a)(6) we expect those issuers to conduct. In developing the estimate for the number of issuers in
the final rule, we refined the methodology used in the Proposing Release and applied that
methodology to more recent data, resulting in an updated estimate that we believe is reasonable
and appropriate.
2.

Intermediaries that are Registered Brokers

The final rules require intermediaries to register with us as either a broker-dealer or as a
funding portal. Consistent with the Proposing Release, we estimate that the collection of
information requirements in the final rules will apply to approximately 10 intermediaries per year
that are not currently registered with the Commission and that will choose to register as brokers,
rather than as funding portals, to act as intermediaries for offerings made in reliance on Section
4(a)(6). However, we believe that, given the cost that an unregistered entity will incur to register
as a broker compared with the lower cost of becoming a funding portal, unregistered entities that
choose to act as crowdfunding intermediaries will generally be more likely to register as funding
portals than as brokers.
Consistent with the Proposing Release, we further estimate that approximately 50
intermediaries per year that are already registered as brokers with the Commission will choose to
add to their current service offerings by also serving as crowdfunding intermediaries. These
entities will not have to file a new application for registration with us, and if currently doing
business with the public, they will already be members of FINRA (the applicable national
securities association registered under Exchange Act Section 15A). We note, however, that given
the nascent nature of the equity-based crowdfunding market, we do not have any data or other
494

evidence indicating the number of currently-registered brokers that will be interested in becoming
crowdfunding intermediaries. Therefore, we recognize that the number of brokers per year that
may engage in crowdfunding activities could differ significantly from our current estimate. We
received no comments on our estimates of the number of broker-dealers that will act as
intermediaries.
3.

Funding Portals

Consistent with the Proposing Release, we estimate that on average approximately 50
intermediaries per year that are not already registered as brokers will choose to be registered as
funding portals during the first three years following effectiveness of the final rules. This estimate
assumes that, upon effectiveness of the final rules, about 15% of the approximately 200 U.S.based crowdfunding portals 1627 currently in existence will participate in securities-based
crowdfunding and that the number of crowdfunding portals will grow at 60% per year over the
next three years. 1628 Therefore, we estimate that an average of approximately 50 respondents will
be registered as funding portals annually. 1629 Of those 50 funding portals, we estimate that two

1627

This estimate is based in part on an industry estimate that, as of April 2012, there were approximately 200
non-securities-based crowdfunding portals operating in the United States. See Massolution 2012 at 16. We
did not receive comment on these estimates and therefore continue to believe our estimates in the Proposing
Release are appropriate. See also Massolution 2015 at 84 (estimating that, as of December 2014, there were
approximately 375 crowdfunding portals operating in North America, not just the United States).

1628

A worldwide survey of crowdfunding portals indicated that, in 2011, approximately 14.8% of the surveyed
crowdfunding portals (mostly based in Europe) participated in “equity-based” crowdfunding. Id. Also, the
total number of crowdfunding portals worldwide grew by an estimated 60% from 2011 to 2012. Id. at 13.
We did not receive comment on these estimates and therefore continue to believe our estimates in the
Proposing Release are appropriate. See also Massolution 2015 at 82-83 (estimating that, as of December
2014, there were approximately 1250 crowdfunding portals worldwide compared to 813 worldwide in 2012,
which represents an increase of approximately 54%).

1629

200 U.S.-based crowdfunding portals x 15% (estimated percentage of crowdfunding portals that will
participate in securities-based crowdfunding) = 30 funding portals that will participate in securities-based
crowdfunding. Assuming 60% growth over three years, the number of registered funding portals will be 30
during the first year, 48 during the second year and 77 during the third year. The average number of
registered funding portals over three years is (30 + 48 + 77) / 3 = 52 funding portals (or approximately 50
funding portals per year).

495

will be nonresident funding portals. These estimates are based in part on indications of interest
expressed in responses to FINRA’s voluntary interim form for funding portals. We received no
comments on our estimates on the number of funding portals that will act as intermediaries

Issuers

Form C: Offering Statement and Progress Update

Under the final rules, an issuer conducting a transaction in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) will
be required to file with us specified disclosures on a Form C: Offering Statement. 1630 An issuer
also will be required to file with us amendments to Form C to disclose any material change in the
offer terms or disclosure previously provided to investors. 1631 Form C is similar to the Form 1-A
offering statement under Regulation A, but it requires fewer disclosure items (e.g., it does not
require disclosure about the plan of distribution, the compensation of officers and directors,
litigation or a discussion of federal tax aspects). We note that offerings made in reliance on
Regulation A allow issuers to offer up to $50 million, involve review by SEC staff and, in the case
of Tier 1 offerings, require filings at the state level. 1632 In light of these factors, we expect that
issuers seeking to raise capital pursuant to a Regulation A offering generally will be at a more
advanced stage of development than issuers likely to raise capital pursuant to Section 4(a)(6), so
the complexity of the required disclosure and, in turn, the burden of compliance with the
requirements of Form C will be significantly less than for Form 1-A. 1633 In the Proposing Release
we estimated that the burden to prepare and file Form C would be approximately 60 hours per

We estimated that 75% of the burden, or 45 hours, would be carried internally and the remaining
25% of the burden would be carried by outside professionals at a cost of $6,000 per issuer.
As discussed in more detail in the Economic Analysis, above, we received a number of
comments concerning the burdens and costs of the proposed rules. 1635 Many of these commenters
provided monetary estimates without distinguishing between internal burden hours and outside
professional costs. Some commenters suggested that the Proposing Release underestimated the
time and expense that would be required to prepare and file Form C. 1636 In contrast, one
commenter stated that it was a third-party service provider that could prepare Form C at much
lower costs than those estimated by the Commission. 1637 Another commenter suggested that the
cost of preparing and filing these forms and the associated compliance costs would range from
$3,000 to $9,000. 1638 Additionally, we received a number of comments about the costs of the
audit and review of financial statements, as proposed. We believe that these costs would be a
component of the outside professional costs associated with Form C. In the Economic Analysis,
we have set forth our monetized estimates of the various cost components, grouped into categories

See, e.g., Heritage Letter (stating that the costs to prepare the required disclosures will likely exceed $10,500,
except in cases of start-ups with no operating history); NSBA Letter (stating that issuers and intermediaries
will likely incur higher attorney and accounting fees and financial and administrative burdens than estimated
in the proposed rules but without providing estimates); SeedInvest Letter 2 (estimating upfront compliance
costs to be “potentially hundreds of hours [in internal company time] and $20,000 to $50,000 [in outside
professional costs]”).

FundHub Letter 2 (stating that the commenter will prepare Form C and all disclosure documents, do all bad
actor checks, verify investor status and perform all other necessary compliance measures for a $100,000
offering for $2,500 total, and that, in most cases, its services and associated legal fees will cost an issuer
between $2,500 and $5,000 for an offering up to $500,000 and between $5,000 and $10,000 for an offering
between $500,000 and $1,000,000).

based on the size of the offering. Our Form C estimates range from $2,500 for the smallest
offerings (up to $100,000); to a range of $2,500 to $5,000 for somewhat larger offerings (more
than $100,000 but not more than $500,000) and a range of $5,000 and $20,000 for the largest
offerings (more than $500,000). Additionally, our estimates of the cost of financial statement
review or audit range from $0 for the smallest offerings; to between $1,500 and $18,000 for
larger offerings and for first-time crowdfunding issuers conducting offerings between $500,000
and $1,000,000; and $2,500 to $30,000 for other issuers that are conducting an offering in the
largest offering amount category. Accordingly, in our Economic Analysis we estimate a cost
range estimate for Form C and the financial statement review of: $2,500 for the smallest
offerings, $4,000 to $23,000 for the larger offerings, $6,500 to $38,000 for first-time
crowdfunding issuers conducting offerings between $500,000 and $1,000,000, and $7,500 to
$50,000 for other issuers conducting an offering in the largest offering amount category. For
purposes of the PRA, however, we must provide a single estimate, comprised of both burden
hours and outside professional costs, for an average issuer.
Based on these comments and our Economic Analysis, we have revised our estimate of the
burden associated with the preparation and filing of Form C. We acknowledge that a number of
commenters suggested that we underestimated the burdens of the proposed rule, but believe that
changes in the final rule, particularly with respect to the financial statement requirements for firsttime crowdfunding issuers, may mitigate the impact of those costs. Accordingly, we estimate that
the average total burden to prepare and file the Form C, including any amendment to disclose any
material change, will be approximately 100 hours, which, while higher than our proposed
estimate, is still substantially less than the burden to prepare a Form 1-A for an offering under
Regulation A, as recently amended. We continue to estimate that 75 percent of the burden of
498

preparation will be carried by the issuer internally and that 25 percent will be carried by outside
professionals 1639 retained by the issuer at an average cost of $400 per hour. 1640

This reflects 75

internal burden hours per issuer and $10,000 in external professional costs. While for PRA
purposes, we must present this estimate in terms of hours and costs, we believe that this estimate
is consistent with the monetary ranges that we set forth in the Economic Analysis.
Under the final rules, the issuer also will be required to file with us regular updates on the
progress of the issuer in meeting the target offering amount. 1641 In a change from the proposal,
the rules permit issuers to satisfy the progress update requirement by relying on the relevant
intermediary to make publicly available on the intermediary’s platform frequent updates about the
issuer’s progress toward meeting the target offering amount. Nevertheless, an issuer relying on
the intermediary’s reports of progress must still file a progress update at the end of the offering to
disclose the total amount of securities sold in the offering. The issuer is required to make the
filing under cover of a Form C-U: Progress Update. Form C-U is similar to a Form D Notice of
Exempt Offering of Securities under Regulation D. 1642 Form C-U will require significantly less
disclosure than the Form D, however, as it will require disclosure only of the issuer’s progress in
meeting the target offering amount, rather than compensation and use of proceeds disclosures or
other information about the issuer and the offering. Thus, the complexity of the required

1639

For example, an issuer could retain an outside professional to assist in the preparation of the financial
statements, but could decide to address the remaining disclosure requirements internally.

1640

We estimate the average external cost of preparing Form C to be 0.25 x 100 hours x $400 per hour =
$10,000.
We recognize that the costs of retaining outside professionals may vary depending on the nature of the
professional services, but for purposes of this PRA analysis, we estimate that such costs would be an average
of $400 per hour. This is the rate we typically estimate for outside legal services used in connection with
public company reporting.

1641

See Rule 203(a)(3) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

1642

We currently estimate the burden per response for preparing and filing a Form D to be 4.00 hours.

499

disclosure and the burden to prepare and file Form C-U will be significantly less than for Form D.
We continue to estimate that the burden to prepare and file each progress update will be 0.50
hours. In light of the change from the proposal, we expect most issuers will rely on the relevant
intermediary to provide interim progress updates and therefore will be required to file an average
of one progress update during each offering rather than the two progress updates that we estimated
in the Proposing Release. 1643 As in the Proposing Release, we estimate that the entirety of this
burden will be borne internally by the registrant.
Overall, we estimate that compliance with the requirements of a Form C filed in
connection with offerings made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) will require 190,000 burden hours
(1,900 offering statements x 100 hours/offering statement) in aggregate each year, which
corresponds to 142,500 hours carried by the issuer internally (1,900 offering statements x 100
hours/offering statement x 0.75) and costs of $19,000,000 (1,900 offering statements x 100
hours/offering statement x 0.25 x $400) for the services of outside professionals. We also
estimate that compliance with the requirements of Form C-U filed during an offering will require
950 burden hours (1,900 offering statements x 1 progress update per offering x 0.50 hours per
progress update) in aggregate each year.
b.

Form C-AR: Annual Report

Under the final rules, unless the reporting has been terminated, any issuer that sells
securities in a transaction made pursuant to Section 4(a)(6) will be required to file annually with
us an annual report on Form C-AR: Annual Report. 1644 Form C-AR will require disclosure
substantially similar to the disclosure provided in the Form C: Offering Statement, except that

1643

See Rule 203(a)(3) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

1644

See Rule 202 of Regulation Crowdfunding.

500

offering-specific disclosure will not be required and the issuer may be able to update disclosure
previously provided in the Form C. In addition, in a change from the proposal, instead of
requiring financial statements in the annual report that meet the highest standard of review
previously provided (either reviewed or audited), the final rules require financial statements of the
issuer certified by the principal executive officer of the issuer to be true and complete in all
material respects. 1645 Therefore, we estimate that the burden to prepare and file Form C-AR will
be less than that required to prepare and file Form C.
As discussed in the Economic Analysis, we received some comments on the costs of Form
C-AR. 1646 One commenter that submitted comments concerning both Form C and Form C-AR
provided several cost estimates or ranges for Form C-AR that varied but were ranges or amounts
that were lower than the commenter’s estimates for Form C. 1647 Our analysis of the cost of Form
C-AR in our Economic Analysis reflects these comments, and in that analysis, we estimate that
the cost of Form C-AR represents two-thirds of the cost of Form C (exclusive of the financial
statement review).
Additionally, in light of the change to the final rules for Form C-AR to require financial
statements that are certified by the principal executive officer of the issuer to be true and complete
in all material respects, rather than requiring financial statements that meet the highest level of
review previously provided, we estimate that for Form C-AR there will be a further reduction of
PRA burden compared with the burden of Form C. Accordingly, we estimate that compliance

1645

See Rule 202(a) of Regulation Crowdfunding. However, issuers that have available financial statements that
have been reviewed or audited by an independent certified public accountant because they prepare them for
other purposes shall provide them and will not be required to have the principal executive officer
certification. Id.

1646

See Section III.B.3.a.

1647

See SeedInvest Letter 1; SeedInvest Letter 4

501

with Form C-AR will be approximately one-half of the burden of Form C, resulting in a burden of
50 hours per response. We further estimate that 75 percent of the burden of preparation will be
carried by the issuer internally and that 25 percent will be carried by outside professionals 1648
retained by the issuer at an average cost of $400 per hour. 1649
We estimate that compliance with the requirements of Form C-AR in the first year after
issuers sell securities pursuant to Section 4(a)(6) will require 95,000 burden hours (1,900 issuers x
50 hours/issuer) in the aggregate, which corresponds to 71,250 hours carried by the issuer
internally (1,900 issuers x 50 hours/issuer x 0.75) and costs of $9,500,000 (1,900 issuers x 50
hours/issuer x 0.25 x $400) for the services of outside professionals.
c.

Form C-TR: Termination of Reporting

Under the final rules, any issuer terminating its annual reporting obligations will be
required to file a notice under cover of Form C-TR: Termination of Reporting to notify investors
and the Commission that it no longer will file and provide annual reports pursuant to the
requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding. 1650 We estimate that eight percent of the issuers that
sell securities pursuant to Section 4(a)(6) will file a notice under cover of Form C-TR during the
first year. 1651 The Form C-TR will be similar to the Form 15 that issuers file to provide notice of
termination of the registration of a class of securities under Exchange Act Section 12(g) or to
provide notice of the suspension of the duty to file reports required by Exchange Act Sections

1648

See note 1639.

1649

See note 1640.

1650

See Rule 203(b)(2) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

1651

For purposes of this PRA analysis, we estimate that eight percent of issuers will not survive past their first
year, based on a recent study that found that of a random sample of 4,022 new high-technology businesses
started in 2004, 92.3% survived past their first year. See Kauffman Firm Survey, note 1302 at 13.

502

13(a) or 15(d). 1652 Therefore, we estimate that compliance with the Form C-TR will result in a
similar burden as compliance with Form 15, that is, a burden of 1.50 hours per response. We
estimate that compliance with Form C-TR will result in a burden of 228 hours (1,900 issuers x
0.08 issuers filing Form C-TR x 1.50 hours/issuer) in the aggregate during the first year for issuers
terminating their reporting obligations. As in the Proposing Release, we estimate that the entirety
of this burden will be borne internally by the registrant. We received no comments on our
estimates with respect to Form C-TR and continue to believe that these estimates are reasonable.
d.

Form ID Filings

Under the final rules, an issuer will be required to file specified disclosures with us on
EDGAR. 1653 We anticipate that the majority of first-time issuers seeking to offer and sell
securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) will not previously have filed an electronic submission
with us and so will need to file a Form ID. Form ID is the application form for access codes to
permit filing on EDGAR. The final rules will not change the form itself, but we anticipate that the
number of Form ID filings will increase due to new issuers seeking to offer and sell securities in
reliance on Section 4(a)(6). One commenter stated that it would take approximately 70 minutes to
complete a Form ID, considerably more time than the estimated 0.15 hours. 1654 However, the
information required by Form ID is very limited, primarily the name and address of the filer, so
we continue to believe the estimated 0.15 hours per response is appropriate. For purposes of this
PRA analysis, we estimate that all of the issuers who will seek to offer and sell securities in
reliance on Section 4(a)(6) will not have filed an electronic submission with us previously and
will, therefore, be required to file a Form ID. As noted above, we estimate that approximately
1652

We currently estimate the burden per response for preparing and filing a Form 15 to be 1.50 hours.

1653

See Rules 201-203 of Regulation Crowdfunding.

1654

Angel Letter 1.

503

1,900 issuers per year will seek to offer and sell securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6), which
will correspond to 1,900 additional Form ID filings. As a result, we estimate the additional annual
burden associated with this form will be approximately 285 hours (1,900 filings x 0.15
hours/filing). 1655
2.

Brokers and Funding Portals

Below, we discuss our estimates of the internal burdens and professional costs associated
with the collections of information required under the final rules as they relate to intermediaries.
Where relevant, we discuss any comments received on these estimates and any changes to
estimates, including changes made in response to comments on them.
a.

Registration Requirements
(1)

Time Burden

The final rules will require intermediaries to register with us as either a broker or as a
funding portal. As noted above, we believe that some intermediaries for transactions made in
reliance on Section 4(a)(6) and Regulation Crowdfunding will already be registered as brokers.
Therefore, this registration requirement will impose no new requirement on these entities and no
additional burden for purposes of this PRA analysis. Entities that are not already registered as
brokers may decide to register either as brokers or as funding portals and to become members of a
registered national securities association (if they are not already a member) pursuant to the final
rules. We estimate that each year, on average, approximately 10 entities may decide to be
registered as brokers and approximately 50 entities may decide to be registered as funding portals
by filing Form Funding Portal. 1656 In addition, we estimate that of those 50 entities that register as

1655

We currently estimate the burden per response for preparing and filing with Form ID to be 0.15 hours.

1656

As noted above, funding portals will have to complete and file Form ID in order to obtain access codes to file
on EDGAR. Based on our estimates, 50 funding portals per year will newly register through EDGAR, which

504

funding portals, two will be nonresident funding portals and subject to the additional requirements
under Rule 400(f) of completing Schedule C (including the required certifications), requirements
related to the agent for service of process in the United States, and obtaining an opinion of
counsel.
We estimate the burden for registering with the Commission as a broker based upon the
existing burdens for completing and filing Form BD, currently estimated as 2.75 hours. 1657
Consequently, we estimate that the total annual burden hours required for all crowdfunding
intermediaries, including brokers and funding portals, to register with us under the final rules will
be approximately 165 hours (2.75 hours/respondent x (10 brokers + 50 funding portals)). In
addition, those entities that register as nonresident funding portals will face an additional burden
of half an hour to complete Schedule C and make the required certifications, half an hour to
document the appointment of an agent for the service of process, and one hour to obtain an
opinion of counsel. Consequently, we estimate that, of the 50 registered funding portals, two will
each face an additional burden of two hours to register, for a total additional annual burden of four
hours.
We have taken into consideration that brokers that register to engage in crowdfunding
transactions conducted in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) may eventually decide to withdraw their

will correspond to 50 additional Form ID filings. As a result, we estimate the additional annual burden
associated with this form will be approximately 7.5 hours (50 filings x 0.15 hours/filing).
1657

While it is likely that the time necessary to complete Form BD varies depending on the nature and
complexity of the entity’s securities business, we currently estimate the average time necessary for a brokerdealer to complete and file an application for broker-dealer registration on Form BD to be approximately
2.75 hours. We also estimate that the time burden to register as a funding portal on Form Funding Portal will
be, for purposes of this PRA analysis, the same as the time required to complete and file Form BD because
the information required for that form is similar.

505

registration. Withdrawal requires an entity to complete and file with us a Form BDW. 1658 We
further estimate that approximately 430 broker-dealers withdraw from Commission registration
annually 1659 and, therefore, file a Form BDW. Of them, we estimate that approximately one
broker who had registered in order to facilitate crowdfunding offerings made in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6) will decide to withdraw in each year following adoption of the rules. 1660
Therefore, the one broker-dealer that withdraws from registration by filing Form BDW will incur
an aggregate annual reporting burden of approximately 0.25 hours (0.25 hours/respondent x 1
broker). Similarly, we estimate that approximately five funding portals will choose to withdraw
from registration each year 1661 and that each withdrawal, as with Form BDW, will take
approximately 0.25 hours. This will result in an aggregate annual reporting burden of
approximately 1.25 hours (0.25 hours/respondent x 5 funding portals).

1658

The time necessary to complete Form BDW varies depending on the nature and complexity of the
applicant’s securities business. We currently estimate that it takes a broker-dealer approximately 0.25
burden hours to complete and file a Form BDW to withdraw from Commission registration, as required by
Exchange Act Rule 15b6-1 (17 CFR 240.15b6-1).

1659

This estimate is based on Form BDW data collected over the past five years and may be high as a result of
the impact of the financial crisis on broker-dealers. For the past five fiscal years (from 10/1 through 9/30),
the number of broker-dealers that withdrew from registration was as follows: 524 in 2011 and 428 in 2012,
434 in 2013, 454 in 2014 and 306 by September 15, 2015. We thus estimate the number of broker-dealers
that withdraw from the Commission annually to be 430 ((524+428+434+454+306) / 5).

1660

As of September 2015, there were 4,213 broker-dealers registered with the Commission. An average of 430
broker-dealers per year withdraw from registration, or 10% of the number of registered broker-dealers (430
withdrawing broker-dealers / 4,213 registered broker-dealers). We assume that the same percentage of
broker-dealers that withdraw from registration will apply to the population of registered broker-dealers
participating in offerings in reliance on Section 4(a)(6). Of our estimate of 10 registered broker-dealers per
year registering to participate in crowdfunding transactions in reliance on Section 4(a)(6), we estimate that
approximately one broker-dealer per year (10 registered broker-dealers x 0.10) will withdraw from
registration.

1661

We estimate that the percentage of registered funding portals participating in crowdfunding transactions in
reliance on Section 4(a)(6) that will withdraw from registration annually would be the same as the
percentage of broker dealers that withdraw from registration annually because of the similarity of these
entities’ businesses. Of our estimate of 50 registered funding portals participating in crowdfunding
transactions in reliance on Section 4(a)(6), we estimate that approximately five funding portals per year (50
registered funding portals x 0.10) will withdraw from registration. For funding portals, a decision to
withdraw registration will be required to be reported to us in the same way as an amendment; however, for
brokers, withdrawal requires the filing of Form BDW.

506

In the Proposing Release, we also included an estimate of PRA burdens and costs for
newly-registered intermediaries to become members of FINRA or any other registered national
securities association. Specifically, the Proposing Release included a discussion of an estimate of
the paperwork burdens and costs that would be incurred by an intermediary to register with a
national securities association as well as an estimate of the ongoing fees (e.g., FINRA annual
assessment fees) that would be incurred by an intermediary to remain registered with a national
securities association. However, after further consideration, we do not believe the hour burdens
and costs associated with FINRA’s membership constitute paperwork burdens and costs
attributable to the Commission’s rules. Accordingly, we are not providing estimates of burdens
and costs resulting from membership in a registered national securities association in this PRA
analysis. We have, however, considered the costs of such membership, both initial and ongoing,
in our Economic Analysis above. 1662
Once registered, a broker must promptly file an amended Form BD when information
originally reported on Form BD changes or becomes inaccurate. Similarly, a registered funding
portal must file amendments relating to changes in information filed in a Form Funding Portal
filing. 1663 Based on the number of amended Forms BD that we received from October 1, 2011
through September 15, 2015, we estimate that the total number of amendments that we will
receive on Form BD from the 10 brokers that register under Regulation Crowdfunding will be
approximately 32. 1664 Therefore, we estimate that the total additional annual burden hours
1662

See Section III.B.4.

1663

We currently estimate that the average time necessary to complete an amended Form BD to be
approximately 20 minutes, or 0.33 hours. We estimate that an amendment to Form Funding Portal will take
the same amount of time as an amendment to Form BD because the forms are similar.

1664

We received 15,491, 13,271, 12,902, 14,330 and 10,848 amended Forms BD during the fiscal years ending
2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, reflecting an average of 13,368 amendment filings per year
(15,491 + 13,271+12,902+ 14,330+10,848) / 5 years). As of September 15, 2015, there were 4,213 broker-

507

necessary for broker-dealers to complete and file amended Forms BD will be approximately 10.6
hours (32 amended Forms BD per year x 0.33 hours). Using the same ratios, we estimate that the
total annual burden hours for funding portals to complete and file amended Forms Funding Portal
will be approximately 52.8 hours (50 funding portals x 3.2 amendments per year x 0.33 hours per
amendment).
(2)

Cost

We estimate that two intermediaries will face a cost per intermediary of $25,179 to retain
an agent for service of process and provide an opinion of counsel to register as a nonresident
funding portal. 1665
b.

Development of Intermediary Platform
(1)

Time Burden

The final rules envision that intermediaries will develop electronic platforms to offer
securities to the public in reliance on Section 4(a)(6). We anticipate that an intermediary’s
platform will incorporate related systems functionality to comply with our final rules (including
the collection of information associated with, for example, the requirements of Rules 302, 303 and
304) as well as execute other platform capabilities and system operations. The estimated time
burdens and costs for platform development discussed in this section include the estimated time

dealers registered with the Commission. Therefore, we estimate that there are approximately 3.17
amendments (13,368 amended Forms BD / 4,213 broker-dealers) per registered broker-dealer per year. We
therefore estimate that the 10 broker-dealers who register under Regulation Crowdfunding will file, on
aggregate, approximately 32 amendments per year.
1665

We have altered our cost estimates slightly from the Proposing Release (from $25,130 to $25,179) and note
that the amended estimates are consistent with our recent estimates of what it would cost other types of
nonresident entities to retain an agent for service of process and provide an opinion of counsel. See
Registration Process for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants,
Exchange Act Release No. 34-75611, 80 FR 48964, 48994 (Aug. 14, 2015). We inadvertently included the
costs to non-resident funding portals of completing Schedule C in the Proposing Release. We anticipate,
however, that nonresident funding portals will incur a time burden rather than a cost burden to complete
Schedule C.

508

burdens and costs for the functionalities that will allow funding portals to comply with their
disclosure, communication channel, and investor notification requirements. 1666
Intermediaries that develop their platforms in-house will incur an initial time burden
associated with setting up their systems. Based on our discussions with potential intermediaries
prior to the publication of our proposed rules, we estimate that intermediaries creating the initial
platform in-house will typically have a team of approximately four to six developers that will
work on all aspects of platform development, including, but not limited to, front-end
programming, data management, systems analysis, communication channels, document delivery,
and Internet security. 1667 We estimate, based on our discussions with potential intermediaries
prior to the publication of our proposed rules, that in developing a platform in-house,
intermediaries will spend an average of 1,500 hours for planning, programming, and
implementation. 1668
It is difficult to estimate the number of intermediaries that will develop their initial
platforms in-house, but assuming that half of the 110 newly-registered intermediaries 1669 do so,
the total initial time burden on those intermediaries will be 82,500 hours (55 intermediaries x
1,500 hours = 82,500 hours).
We estimate that annually updating the features and functionality of an intermediary’s
platform will require approximately 20% of the hours required to initially develop the platform,
for an average burden of 300 hours per year. If we assume that half of the 110 crowdfunding
1666

See Sections IV.C.2.g. and IV.C.2.h.

1667

See Sections IV.C.2.g. and IV.C.2.h.

1668

This average takes into account intermediaries that will develop a brand new platform and those that will
modify an existing platform to function in accordance with Regulation Crowdfunding.

1669

As discussed above, we anticipate that 10 intermediaries will newly register as brokers, 50 intermediaries
will be brokers that are already registered, and 50 intermediaries will register as funding portals.

509

intermediaries update their systems accordingly each year, the total ongoing time burden will be
16,500 hours per year (55 intermediaries x 300 hours = 16,500 hours).
(2)

Cost

There will be a cost associated with developing a platform for an intermediary that hires a
third-party to develop its platform rather than developing it in-house. Based on our discussions
with potential intermediaries prior to the publication of our proposed rules, we estimate that it will
cost an intermediary approximately $250,000 to $600,000 1670 to build a new Internet-based
crowdfunding portal and all of its basic functionality. 1671 Assuming that half of the 110 newlyregistered intermediaries hire outside developers to build or to tailor their platforms, the total
initial cost will range from $13,750,000 to $33,000,000 (55 intermediaries x $250,000 =
$13,750,000; 55 intermediaries x $600,000 = $33,000,000). For purposes of this PRA analysis,
we estimate the cost to be $23,375,000 (the average of $13,750,000 and $33,000,000).
We estimate that it will typically cost an intermediary approximately one-fifth of the initial
development cost per year to use a third-party developer to provide annual maintenance on an
Internet-based crowdfunding portal, including updating and basic functionality, or $85,000 per
year on average. 1672 If we assume that half of the 110 crowdfunding intermediaries updated their

1670

See, e.g., ASSOB Letter (suggesting that the cost to establish a funding portal would run at least $480,000,
which is within the range of our estimate).

1671

We anticipate that some percentage of intermediaries will already have in place platforms and related
systems that will need to be tailored to comply with the requirements of Title III of the JOBS Act and
Regulation Crowdfunding. We anticipate that these intermediaries will hire outside developers to tailor their
platforms. We estimate an average cost of approximately $250,000 in the first year in order to tailor the
current systems for an intermediary that already has in place a platform and related systems. Thus, this
amount is already covered in our range of costs above -- $250,000 to $600,000.
Our estimate of the average initial external cost per intermediary to develop a crowdfunding platform is the
average of the cited range of $250,000 to $600,000, or $425,000 (($250,000 + $600,000)/ 2). One-fifth of
the cost of $425,000 is $85,000.

1672

510

systems accordingly, the total ongoing cost will be $4,675,000 per year (55 intermediaries x
$85,000 = $4,675,000).
c.

Measures to Reduce the Risk of Fraud
(1)

Time Burden

The final rules will require intermediaries to have a reasonable basis for believing that an
issuer seeking to offer and sell securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) through the intermediary’s
platform complies with the requirements in Section 4A(b) and the related requirements in
Regulation Crowdfunding. 1673 The final rules will also require intermediaries to have a
reasonable basis for believing that an issuer has established means to keep accurate records of the
holders of the securities it will offer and sell through the intermediary’s platform. 1674 For both
requirements, an intermediary may reasonably rely on the representations of the issuer, unless the
intermediary has reason to question the reliability of those representations. For the purposes of
this PRA analysis, we expect that 100% of intermediaries will rely on the representations of
issuers. Based on our industry knowledge and discussions with participants prior to the
publication of our proposed rules, we calculate that this requirement will impose a time burden in
the first year of five hours per intermediary to establish standard representations it will request
from issuers, and six minutes per intermediary per issuer to obtain the issuer representation,
which is consistent with estimates we have used for other regulated entities to obtain similar
documentation, such as consents, from customers.
Based on our estimate that there will be approximately 1,900 offerings per year, that each
issuer will conduct one offering per year, and that there will be 110 intermediaries, we estimate

1673

See Rule 301(a) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

1674

See Rule 301(b) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

511

that each intermediary will facilitate an average of approximately 17 offerings per year (1,900
offerings/(10 newly registered broker-dealers + 50 previously registered broker-dealers + 50
funding portals)). Therefore, we estimate that the total initial burden hours will be approximately
740 hours ((5 hours/intermediary x (10 newly-registered broker-dealers + 50 previously-registered
broker-dealers + 50 funding portals)) + (0.1 hours/issuer x 17 offerings x 110 intermediaries).
We believe that the ongoing time burdens for this requirement will be approximately one
hour per intermediary per year to review and confirm that the standard representations it requests
from issuers remain appropriate, and six minutes (0.1 hours) per intermediary per issuer to obtain
an issuer’s representation. Therefore, we estimate that the ongoing total burden hours necessary
for intermediaries to rely on the representations of the issuers will be approximately 300 hours per
year ((1 hour/intermediary x (10 newly-registered broker-dealers + 50 previously-registered
broker-dealers + 50 funding portals)) + (0.1 hours/issuer x 17 offerings x 110 intermediaries).
(2)

Cost

The final rules will require intermediaries to conduct a background and securities
enforcement regulatory history check on each issuer and each officer, director or 20 Percent
Beneficial Owner of an issuer to determine whether the issuer or such person is subject to a
disqualification. We anticipate that most intermediaries will employ third parties to perform
background and securities enforcement regulatory history checks in light of the costs of
developing an in-house capability to conduct such checks. Therefore, for the purposes of this
PRA analysis, we assume that 100% of intermediaries will use these third-party service providers.

512

The cost for a third party to perform a background check is estimated to be between $200
and $500, depending on the nature and extent of the information provided. 1675 We recognize that
some issuers will require more than one background check (e.g., for officers or directors of the
issuer), and we estimate that intermediaries will perform four background checks per issuer, on
average. We base this number on the assumption that most crowdfunding issuers will be startups
and small businesses with small management teams and few owners. Assuming an average of
approximately 1,900 offerings made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) per year, the total estimated
initial cost for all intermediaries to fulfill the required background and securities enforcement
regulatory history checks will range from approximately $1,520,000 to $3,800,000 per year, 1676 or
approximately $13,818 to $34,546 per intermediary per year. 1677 For purposes of this PRA
analysis, we average this cost to $24,182 per intermediary per year.
One commenter noted, as a general matter, that the “costs incurred by the intermediary in
dealing with an issuer, doing the required due diligence and background screening, establishing a
web page describing the offering and so on do not vary linearly with the offering size. As a
percentage of the offering amount, they will be disproportionately high for smaller offerings.” 1678
This commenter did not, however, question our underlying assumptions or our estimates of these
costs. For purposes of this PRA analysis and as discussed above, we believe that these cost

1675

See, e.g., A Matter of Fact, Background Check FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions, available at
http://www.amof.info/faq.htm (Matter of Fact is a background check provider accredited by the National
Association of Professional Background Screeners and the Background Screening Credentialing Council.
This source states that the cost for a comprehensive background check is $200 to $500).

1676

1,900 securities-based offerings made in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) per year x ($200 to $500 per background
and securities enforcement regulatory history check) x 4 checks per offering = $1,520,000 to $3,800,000 per
year.

1677

$1,520,000/110 intermediaries = approximately $13,818 per intermediary; $3,800,000/110 intermediaries =
approximately $34,546 per intermediary.

1678

Heritage Letter.

513

estimates are reasonable. We also believe that intermediaries are in a better position to make their
own business decisions as to whether such costs would be disproportionately high for smaller
offerings. 1679
We believe that, on an ongoing basis, intermediaries will continue to use third-party
services to conduct background and securities enforcement regulatory history checks. We also
believe that the total estimated ongoing cost for all intermediaries to fulfill the required
background and securities enforcement regulatory history checks will be the same as the estimated
initial cost, or on average $24,182 per intermediary per year.
d.

Account Opening: Accounts and Electronic Delivery

The final rules provide that no intermediary or associated person of an intermediary may
accept an investment commitment in a transaction involving the offer or sale of securities made in
reliance on Section 4(a)(6) until an investor has opened an account with the intermediary and
consented to electronic delivery of materials. 1680 This requirement will impose certain
information gathering and recordkeeping burdens on intermediaries. For the purposes of this PRA
analysis, we expect that the functionality required to allow an investor to open an account with an
intermediary and obtain consents will result in an initial time burden of approximately 10 hours
per intermediary in the first year. Therefore, we estimate that the total initial burden hours
resulting from this functionality will be approximately 1,100 hours (10 hours/intermediary x (10
newly-registered broker-dealers + 50 previously-registered broker-dealers + 50 funding portals)).

1679

As noted above, we agree with the commenter’s suggestion that there is likely to be a fixed component to
these costs that reflects a certain necessary level of due diligence and background screening, which will
result in these costs, as a percentage of offering size, being higher for smaller offerings.

1680

See Rule 302(a) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

514

We believe that the ongoing time burdens for this requirement will be significantly less
than the initial time burden, and thus we estimate approximately two hours per intermediary per
year to review and assess the related processes. Therefore, we estimate that the ongoing total
burden hours necessary for this functionality will be approximately 220 hours per year (2
hours/intermediary x (10 newly-registered broker-dealers + 50 previously-registered brokerdealers + 50 funding portals)).
e.

Account Opening: Educational Materials
(1)

Time Burden

The final rules require intermediaries to provide educational materials to investors, 1681
about the risks and costs of investing in securities offered and sold in reliance on Section 4(a)(6).
Because the intermediary will determine what electronic format will prove most effective in
communicating the requisite contents of the educational material, the expected costs for
intermediaries to develop the educational material are expected to vary widely and are difficult to
estimate. For the purposes of this PRA analysis, we assume that half of the intermediaries will
develop their educational materials in-house, potentially including online presentations and
written documents, and that the other half will employ third parties to produce educational
materials, such as professional-quality online video presentations. We estimate that to develop
their educational materials in-house, each intermediary will incur an initial time burden of
approximately 20 hours. Therefore, the total initial burden will be approximately 1,100 hours (55
intermediaries x 20 hours/intermediary). 1682
1681

See Rule 302(b) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

1682

In the Proposing Release we did not take into account in our estimated time burden and cost calculations our
assumption that half of the intermediaries would develop educational materials in-house. Therefore, we have
re-calculated the estimated total initial and ongoing time burdens and costs for the development of in-house
materials in this release based on 55 (rather than 110) intermediaries.

515

Assuming that half of the intermediaries will develop their educational materials in-house,
we also expect that these intermediaries will update their educational materials in-house, as
needed. We estimate that to update their educational materials in-house, each intermediary will
incur an ongoing time burden of approximately 10 hours per year. Therefore, the total ongoing
burden will be approximately 550 hours per year (55 intermediaries x 10 hours/intermediary).
(2)

Cost

As stated above, for the purposes of this PRA analysis, we assume that half of the
intermediaries will employ third-party firms to produce educational materials, such as
professional-quality online video presentations, instead of developing materials in-house. Public
sources indicate that the typical cost to produce a professional corporate training video ranges
from approximately $1,000 to $3,000 per production minute. 1683 Based on discussions with
industry participants prior to the publication of our proposed rules, we assume that, on average,
each intermediary will produce a series of short educational videos that will cover all of the
requirements of the final rules and that the video material will be 10 minutes long in total. Based
on this assumption, we estimate that the average initial cost for an intermediary to develop and
produce educational materials will range from approximately $10,000 to $30,000. The total initial
cost across all intermediaries estimated to employ a third party per year will be $550,000 to
$1,650,000. 1684 For purposes of this PRA analysis, we average the cost to $20,000 per
intermediary per year. We note that the estimated initial cost may be significantly lower, because
not all intermediaries that outsource the development of educational materials may choose to
1683

See, e.g., Lee W. Frederiksen, What Is the Cost of Video Production for the Web?, Hinge Marketing,
available at http://www.hingemarketing.com/library/article/what-is-the-cost-of-video-production-for-theweb.

1684

55 intermediaries x $10,000 production cost = $550,000. 55 intermediaries x $30,000 production cost =
$1,650,000.

516

produce professional-quality online video presentations; others may produce videos of shorter
length or use other types of educational materials.
We estimate that, on an ongoing basis, when using a third-party company to update their
video educational materials, each intermediary will spend approximately half of the initial average
cost. We estimate, therefore, that the average ongoing annual cost for an intermediary to update
its video educational materials will range from approximately $5,000 to $15,000 and that the total
ongoing annual cost across all intermediaries will range from approximately $275,000 to
$825,000 per year. 1685 For purposes of this PRA analysis, we average the cost to $10,000 per
intermediary per year.
f.

Account Opening: Promoters

The final rules require an intermediary, at the account opening stage, to disclose to users of
its platform that any person who receives compensation to promote an issuer’s offering, or who is
a founder or employee of an issuer engaging in promotional activities on behalf of the issuer, must
clearly disclose the receipt of compensation and his or her engagement in promotional activities
on the platform. 1686 We expect that this requirement will result in an estimated time burden of
five hours per intermediary in the first year, to prepare this particular disclosure and incorporate it
into the account opening process. Therefore, we estimate that the total initial burden hours
necessary for intermediaries to comply with this requirement will be approximately 550 hours (5
hours/intermediary x (10 newly-registered broker-dealers + 50 previously-registered brokerdealers + 50 funding portals)).

1685

$550,000 total cost x 0.50 = $275,000. $1,650,000 total cost x 0.50 = $825,000.

1686

See Rule 302(c) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

517

We believe that the ongoing time burdens for this requirement will be approximately one
hour per intermediary per year to review and check that the disclosures remain appropriate.
Therefore, we estimate that the ongoing total burden hours necessary for intermediaries to comply
with this requirement will be approximately 110 hours per year (1 hour/intermediary x (10 newlyregistered broker-dealers + 50 previously-registered broker-dealers + 50 funding portals)).
g.

Issuer Disclosures to be Made Available
(1)

Time Burden

The final rules require an intermediary to make publicly available on its platform the
information that an issuer of crowdfunding securities is required to provide to investors, in a
manner that reasonably permits a person accessing the platform to save, download or otherwise
store the information, until the offer and sale of securities is completed or cancelled. 1687
For purposes of the PRA, our estimate of the hourly burdens related to the public
availability of the issuer information is included in our estimate of the hourly burdens associated
with overall platform development, discussed above in Section IV.C.2.b. We note that the
platform functionality will include not only the ability to display, upload and download issuer
information as required under the final rules, but also the ability to provide users with required
online disclosures
We recognize that, over time, intermediaries may need to update their systems that allow
issuer information to be uploaded to their platforms. We do not expect a significant ongoing
burden related to the requirement for providing issuer disclosures, primarily because the

1687

See Rule 303(a) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

518

functionality required for required issuer disclosure information to be uploaded is a standard
feature offered on many websites and will not require frequent or significant updates.
(2)

Cost

We do not expect a significant ongoing cost for providing issuer disclosures, primarily
because the functionality required to upload required issuer disclosure information is a standard
feature offered on many websites and will not require frequent updates. To the extent an
intermediary uses a third party to develop the functionality for this requirement, the initial costs
relevant to this requirement will be incorporated into the cost of hiring a third party to develop the
platform, discussed above in subsection IV.C.2.b.2.
h.

Other Disclosures to Investors
(1)

Time Burden

Intermediaries will be required to implement and maintain systems to comply with the
information disclosure, communication channels, and investor notification requirements of
Regulation Crowdfunding, including providing disclosure about compensation at account
opening, obtaining investor acknowledgments to confirm investor qualifications and review of
educational materials, providing investor questionnaires, maintaining communication channels
with third parties and among investors, notifying investors of investment commitments,
confirming completed transactions and confirming or reconfirming offering cancellations.
For purposes of the PRA analysis, our estimate of the hourly burdens related to these
information disclosure, communication channel and investor notification requirements of
Regulation Crowdfunding is included in our estimate of the hourly burdens associated with
overall platform development, discussed above in Section IV.C.2.b. Based on our discussions
with industry participants, we expect that these functionalities will generally be part of the overall
platform development process and costs. We discuss the burdens of platform development above,
519

and note that these will include developing the functionality that will allow intermediaries to
comply with disclosure and notification requirements. 1688
We do not expect a significant ongoing burden for providing disclosures, as required by
the final rules, because the functionality required to provide information and communication
channels will likely not require frequent updates. We incorporate the total burden to update the
required functionality for processing investor disclosures and investor acknowledgment
information in the total burden estimates relating to platform development discussed above. 1689
(2)

Cost

We recognize that some intermediaries may implement the required functionality for
processing investor disclosures and investor acknowledgments by using a third-party developer.
The total cost for issuers to use third-party developers to add the required functionality for
processing investor disclosures and investor acknowledgments, as well as to update the required
functionality for processing investor disclosures and investor acknowledgments, is incorporated
into our discussion of the total cost estimates relating to platform development in Section
IV.C.2.b.
We also do not expect there to be a significant ongoing cost for developing the
functionality to process these disclosures and acknowledgments, primarily because this
functionality will likely not require frequent updates by third-party developers.
i.

Maintenance and Transmission of Funds

The final rules contain requirements related to the maintenance and transmission of funds.
A registered broker will be required to comply with the requirements of Rule 15c2-4 of the

1688

See Section IV.C.2.b.1.

1689

See Section IV.C.2.b.1.

520

Exchange Act (Transmission or Maintenance of Payments Received in Connection with
Underwritings). 1690 A registered funding portal will be required to enter into a written agreement
with a qualified third party that has agreed in writing to hold the client funds. 1691 It also will be
required to send directions to the qualified third party depending on whether an investing target is
met or if an investment commitment or offering is cancelled. For purposes of the PRA, we are
providing an estimate for the hour burden that a funding portal will incur to enter into a written
agreement with the qualified third party on an initial basis, and to review and update that
agreement on an ongoing basis.
Based on discussion with industry participants, we estimate that funding portals will incur
an initial burden of approximately 20 hours each to comply with these requirements, for a total
burden of 1,000 hours (20 hours per funding portal x 50 funding portals). We expect that the
burden associated with the website functionality required to send directions to third parties will be
included as part of the platform development discussed above. 1692
We expect that, on an ongoing basis, a registered funding portal will have to periodically
review and update its written agreement with the qualified third party to hold its client funds. A
registered funding portal will also be required to send directions on an ongoing basis to a qualified
third party depending on whether an investing target is met or an investment commitment or
offering is cancelled. Based on discussion with industry participants, we estimate that funding

1690

See Rule 303(e)(1) of Regulation Crowdfunding. See also 17 CFR 240.15c2-4. For purposes of this PRA
discussion, any burdens associated with Rule 15c2-4, as well as for any other rule to which brokers are
subject regardless of whether they engage in transactions pursuant to Section 4(a)(6), are not addressed here;
rather, they are included in any OMB approvals for the relevant rules.

1691

See Rule 303(e)(2) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

1692

See Section IV.C.2.b.

521

portals will incur an ongoing annual burden of approximately 5 hours each to comply with these
requirements, or 250 hours total (5 hours per funding portal x 50 funding portals).
j.

Compliance: Policies and Procedures

The final rules require a funding portal to implement written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder, relating to its business as a funding portal. We anticipate that funding
portals will comply with this requirement by using internal personnel and internal information
technology resources integrated into their platforms. Based on discussion with industry
participants, we estimate that a funding portal will spend approximately 40 hours to establish
written policies and procedures to achieve compliance with these requirements. This will result in
a total aggregate initial recordkeeping burden of 2,000 hours (40 hours x 50 funding portals).
We estimate that, on an ongoing basis, funding portals will spend approximately 5 hours
per year updating, as necessary, the policies and procedures required by the final rules. This will
result in an aggregate ongoing recordkeeping burden of 250 hours (5 hours x 50 funding portals).
k.

Compliance: Privacy

Funding portals will be required to comply with the Privacy Rules as they apply to brokerdealers, including Regulation S-P, S-AM and S-ID. 1693
Under Rule 403(b), a funding portal will be required to comply with Regulation S-P,
which will require the funding portal to provide notice to investors about its privacy policies and
practices; describe the conditions under which a broker may disclose nonpublic personal
information about investors to nonaffiliated third parties; and provide a method for investors to
prevent a funding portal from disclosing that information to most nonaffiliated third parties by
1693

See Rule 403(b) of Regulation Crowdfunding.

522

“opting out” of that disclosure, subject to certain exceptions. For funding portals, we expect that
the privacy and opt-out notices will be delivered electronically, thereby reducing the delivery
burden as compared to paper delivery.
We estimate that under the final rules all 50 funding portals will be subject to the
requirements of Regulation S-P pursuant to Rule 403(b). In developing an estimate of the burden
relating to the Regulation S-P requirements under Rule 403(b), we have considered: (1) the minimal
recordkeeping burden imposed by Regulation S-P; 1694 (2) the summary fashion in which
information must be provided to investors in the privacy and opt-out notices required by
Regulation S-P; 1695 and (3) the availability of the model privacy form and online model privacy
form builder. Given these considerations, we estimate that each funding portal will spend, on an
ongoing basis, an average of approximately 12 hours per year complying with the information
collection requirement of Regulation S-P, for a total of approximately 600 annual burden-hours
(12 hours/respondent x 50 funding portals).
Funding portals will be required to comply with Regulation S-AM, which will require
funding portals to provide notice to each affected individual informing the individual of his or her
right to prohibit such marketing before a receiving affiliate may make marketing solicitations
based on the communication of certain consumer financial information from the broker. Based on
our discussions with industry participants, we estimate that approximately 20 funding portals will
have affiliations that will subject them to the requirements of Regulation S-AM under the final rules,

1694

Regulation S-P has no recordkeeping requirement, and records relating to customer communications already
must be made and retained by broker-dealers pursuant to other Commission rules. The estimates of the
burdens relating to recordkeeping requirements for funding portals are discussed below in Section IV.C.2.l.

1695

The model privacy form adopted by the Commission and the other agencies in 2009, designed to serve as
both a privacy notice and an opt-out notice, is only two pages.

523

and that they will incur an average one-time burden of one hour to review affiliate marketing
practices, for a total of 20 burden hours (1 hour/respondent x 20 funding portals).
We estimate that these 20 funding portals will be required to provide notice and opt-out
opportunities to consumers pursuant to the requirements of Regulation S-AM, as imposed by Rule
403(b), and that they will incur an average initial burden of 18 hours to do so, for a total estimated
initial burden of 360 hours (18 hours/respondent x 20 funding portals). We also estimate that
funding portals will incur an ongoing burden related to Regulation S-AM’s requirements for
providing notice and opt-out opportunities of approximately four hours per respondent per year.
This burden will cover the creation and delivery of notices to new investors and the recording of
any opt-outs that are received on an ongoing basis, for a total of approximately 80 annual burdenhours (4 hours/respondent x 20 funding portals).
Funding portals will be required to comply with rule S-ID, which will require funding
portals to develop and implement a written identity theft prevention program that is designed to
detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with certain existing accounts or the
opening of new accounts. We estimate that the initial burden for funding portals to comply with the
applicable portions of Regulation S-ID, as imposed by Rule 403(b), will be (1) 25 hours to develop
and obtain board approval of a program; (2) four hours to train staff; and (3) two hours to conduct an
initial assessment of relevant accounts, for a total of 31 hours per funding portal. We estimate that all
50 funding portals will incur these initial burdens, resulting in an aggregate time burden of 1,550
hours ((25 + 4 + 2 hours / respondent) x 50 funding portals).
With respect to the requirements of Rule 403(b) relating to Regulation S-ID, we estimate
that the ongoing burden per year will include: (1) two hours to periodically review and update the
program, review and preserve contracts with service providers and review and preserve any
524

documentation received from service providers; (2) four hours to prepare and present an annual
report to a compliance director; and (3) two hours to conduct periodic assessments to determine if
the entity offers or maintains covered accounts, for a total of eight hours, of which we estimate 7
seven hours will be spent by internal counsel and 1 one hour will be spent by a compliance
director. We estimate that all 50 funding portals will incur these ongoing burdens, for a total
ongoing burden 400 hours (8 hours/respondent x 50 funding portals).
l.

Records to be Made and Kept by Funding Portals
(1)

Time Burden

All funding portals will be required to make and keep records related to their activities to
facilitate transactions in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) and the related rules. 1696 These books and
records requirements are based generally on Exchange Act Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4, which apply to
broker-dealers. To estimate the initial burden for funding portals, we base our analysis upon the
current annual burdens of Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4.
We currently estimate the annual recordkeeping burden for broker-dealer compliance with
Rule 17a-3 to be 394.16 hours per respondent, and the most recently approved annual
recordkeeping burden for broker-dealer compliance with Rule 17a-4 to be 249 hours per
respondent.
Given the more limited scope of a funding portal’s business as compared to that of a
broker, the more targeted scope of the books and records rules, and the fact that funding portals
will be required to make, deliver and store records electronically, we expect the burden of the final
rules will likely be less than that of Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4. For the purposes of the PRA, we
assume that the recordkeeping burden, on average, for a funding portal to comply with the final
1696

See Rule 404 of Regulation Crowdfunding.

525

rules will be 50% of the burdens of a broker-dealer to comply with Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4.
Therefore, we estimate the initial burden to be approximately 325 hours per respondent, 1697 or
16,250 hours total (325 hours/respondent x 50 respondents). We expect the ongoing
recordkeeping burden for funding portals will be the same as the initial burden because the
requirements regarding maintaining such records will be consistent each year.
(2)

Cost

We currently estimate the annual recordkeeping cost for broker-dealer compliance with
Rule 17a-3 to be $5,706.67 per respondent. These ongoing recordkeeping costs reflect the costs
of systems and equipment development. We currently estimate the annual recordkeeping cost for
broker-dealer compliance with Rule 17a-4 to be $5,000 per respondent.
Given the more limited scope of a funding portal’s business as compared to that of a
broker, the more targeted scope of the books and records rules, and the fact that funding portals
will be required to make, deliver and store records electronically, we expect the annual
recordkeeping cost of the final rule requirements will likely be less than that of Rules 17a-3 and
17a-4. For purposes of the PRA, we assume that the annual recordkeeping cost on average for a
funding portal to comply with the requirements that records be made and kept will be about 50%
less than burdens of a broker-dealer to comply with Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4. We expect the initial
recordkeeping cost for funding portals, therefore, to be approximately $5,350 per respondent, 1698
or $267,500 total ($5,350 per respondent x 50 respondents). We expect the ongoing

1697

394.16 hours (recordkeeping burden for Rule 17a-3) + 249 hours (recordkeeping burden for Rule 17a-4) =
643.16 hours. 638.16 hours/2 = 321.58 hours.

1698

$5,706.67 (recordkeeping cost for Rule 17a-3) + $5,000 (recordkeeping cost for Rule 17a-4) = $10,706.67.
$10,706.67 / 2 = $5,353.34.

526

recordkeeping cost burden for funding portals will be the same as the initial burden because the
requirements regarding maintaining such records will be consistent each year.
One commenter stated that “[u]nder the expectation that crowdfunding portals will be
online operations and will almost certainly retain records through digital methods, the burden of
collection should be minimal.” 1699 We agree that digital recordkeeping can help to minimize
costs, and our estimates reflect this assessment.
D.

Collections of Information are Mandatory

The collections of information required under Rules 201 through 203 will be mandatory
for all issuers. The collections of information required under Rules 300 through 304 will be
mandatory for all intermediaries. The collections of information required under Rules 400
through 404 will be mandatory for all funding portals.
E.

Confidentiality

Responses on Form C, Form C-A, Form C-U, Form C-AR and Form C-TR will not be
kept confidential. Responses on Form ID will be kept confidential by the Commission, subject to

FINAL REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT ANALYSIS
The Commission has prepared the following Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis

(“FRFA”), in accordance with the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 1702 regarding
Regulation Crowdfunding. It relates to the rules for securities-based crowdfunding being adopted
today. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (“IRFA”) was prepared in accordance with the
Regulatory Flexibility Act and included in the Proposing Release.
A.

Need for the Rule

The regulation is designed to implement the requirements of Title III of the JOBS Act.
Title III added Securities Act Section 4(a)(6), which provides a new exemption from the
registration requirements of Securities Act Section 5 for securities-based crowdfunding
transactions, provided the transactions are conducted in the manner set forth in new Securities Act
Section 4A. Section 4A includes requirements for issuers that offer or sell securities in reliance
on the crowdfunding exemption, as well as for persons acting as intermediaries in those
transactions. The rules prescribe requirements governing the offer and sale of securities in
reliance on Section 4(a)(6) and provide a framework for the regulation of registered funding
portals and brokers that act as intermediaries in the offer and sale of securities in reliance on
Section 4(a)(6).
As discussed above, the crowdfunding provisions of the JOBS Act, which we implement
through this regulation, are intended to help alleviate the funding gap and accompanying

1701

1702

5 U.S.C. 603.

528

regulatory concerns faced by small businesses by making relatively low dollar offerings of
securities less costly and by providing crowdfunding platforms a means by which to facilitate the
offer and sale of securities without registering as brokers, with a framework for regulatory
oversight to protect investors.
B.

Significant Issues Raised by Public Comments

In the Proposing Release, we requested comment on every aspect of the IRFA, including
the number of small entities that would be affected by the proposed amendments, the existence or
nature of the potential impact of the proposals on small entities discussed in the analysis, and how
to quantify the impact of the proposed rules.
Some commenters expressed concern that the IRFA did not comply with the Regulatory
Flexibility Act because it did not, in their view, adequately describe the costs of the proposed rule
on small entities, and did not set forth significant alternatives which accomplish the rule’s
objectives and which minimize the significant economic impact of the proposal on small
entities. 1703 These commenters recommended that the Commission republish for public comment
a supplemental IRFA to address these concerns. One commenter stated that the IRFA did not set
forth significant alternatives which accomplish the Commission’s stated objectives because the
IRFA only considered alternatives related to exempting small business from the proposed
rules. 1704 One commenter believed that the Commission should exercise its discretion and
eliminate the need for two years of audited financial statements, 1705 whereas another commenter
viewed the audit requirement as a “heavy-handed” regulatory approach. 1706

529

Commenters suggested several alternatives which in their view could reduce costs while
accomplishing the rule’s objectives. 1707 Commenters suggested that the Commission use its
discretion to raise the threshold amount above which issuers would be required to provide audited
financial statements, 1708 with one commenter specifically recommending a threshold of
$900,000. 1709 One commenter also suggested that the Commission adopt a “question and answer”
format for nonfinancial disclosures similar to the format used in Regulation A offerings. 1710 This
same commenter also recommended that the Commission could develop “standard, boilerplate
disclosures” for some of the “more complicated” nonfinancial disclosures such as risk factors.
This commenter stated that the nonfinancial disclosures are not required under the JOBS Act and
encouraged the Commission to develop alternatives that would be less burdensome for small
issuers. One commenter recommended that the Commission revise the ongoing financial
reporting requirements for small issuers to require the disclosure of reviewed rather than audited
financial statements, even if such issuers were previously required to disclose audited financial
statements pursuant to Section 4A(b)(1)(D). 1711 This commenter also supported a requirement
that issuers submit annually an updated statement of financial condition, similar in nature to an
abbreviated management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations. 1712 This commenter also suggested that issuers with total revenue below $5 million
should be permitted to use either cash-based or accrual-based methods of accounting, so that

530

businesses using cash accounting will not be required to create two sets of accounting records in
order to access crowdfunding. 1713
One commenter suggested that smaller entities tend to be more volatile and more illiquid
than larger entities. 1714 This commenter explained that this illiquidity needs to be considered
when crafting regulations for small entity intermediaries and small entity issuers. This commenter
also stated that, regardless of whether an intermediary has internal compliance personnel, or uses a
third party, these compliance costs ultimately will have to be borne by the investors and issuers
using the intermediary service. Another commenter expressed concern that the statutory liability
standard of Section 4A(c) will be particularly burdensome for funding portals and noted that the
IRFA does not account for the large expense statutory liability will impose on intermediaries. 1715
Similarly, one commenter thought it was appropriate to apply the same level of liability that is
reserved for issuers to broker-dealers, but not funding portals. 1716 This commenter urged the
Commission to either eliminate liability for funding portals, or create regulatory alternatives for
funding portals such as allowing them to limit the offerings on their platforms. 1717 One
commenter stated that the IRFA did not account for the cost of prohibiting funding portals from

See SBA Office of Advocacy Letter (stating that the liability standard is especially burdensome for funding
portals because broker-dealers already have procedures in place for conducting due diligence on issuers in
order to meet FINRA requirements, and funding portals will have to establish these procedures anew).

Commission create a safe harbor for funding portals that allows them to limit such offerings. 1718
C.

Small Entities Subject to the Rules

For purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, under our rules, an issuer (other than an
investment company) is a “small business” or “small organization” if it has total assets of $5
million or less as of the end of its most recently completed fiscal year and is engaged or proposing
to engage in an offering of securities which does not exceed $5 million. 1719 We believe that many
issuers seeking to offer and sell securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) will be at a very early
stage of their business development and will likely have total assets of $5 million or less. Also, to
qualify for the exemption under Section 4(a)(6), the amount raised by an issuer must not exceed
$1 million in a 12-month period. Therefore, we estimate that all issuers who offer or sell
securities in reliance on the exemption will be classified as a “small business” or “small
organization.”
For purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act when used with reference to a broker or
dealer, the Commission has defined the term “small entity” to mean a broker-dealer that: (1) had
total capital (net worth plus subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the date in the prior
fiscal year as of which its audited financial statements were prepared pursuant to Rule 17a-5(d) or,
if not required to file such statements, a broker or dealer that had total capital (net worth plus
subordinated debt) of less than $500,000 on the last business day of the preceding fiscal year (or
in the time that it has been in business if shorter); and (2) is not affiliated with any person (other
than a natural person) that is not a small business or small organization as defined in this

532

release.” 1720 Currently, based on FOCUS Report 1721 data, there are 871 broker-dealers that are
classified as “small” entities for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 1722 Because of some
overlap in permitted functions of funding portals and brokers, we look to the definition of a small
broker-dealer to quantify the estimated numbers of small funding portals that will likely register
under the new regulation. Based on discussions with industry participants prior to the publication
of the proposed rules, we estimate that, of the anticipated 50 funding portals we expect to register
under the new regulation, 30 will be classified as “small” entities for purposes of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act.
D.

Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping and other Compliance Requirements

As discussed above, the final rules include reporting, recordkeeping and other compliance
requirements. In particular, the final rules impose certain disclosure requirements on issuers
offering and selling securities in a transaction relying on the exemption provided by Section
4(a)(6). The final rules require that issuers relying on the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(6)
file with the Commission certain specified information about the issuer and the offering, including
information about the issuer’s contact information; directors, officers and certain beneficial
owners; business and business plan; current number of employees; financial condition; target
offering amount and the deadline to reach the target offering amount; use of proceeds from the
offering and price or method for calculating the price of the securities being offered; ownership
and capital structure; material factors that make an investment in the issuer speculative or risky;
indebtedness; description of other offerings of securities; and transactions with related parties.
1720

17 CFR 240.0-10(c).

1721

FOCUS Reports, or “Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single” Reports, are monthly, quarterly,
and annual reports that broker-dealers generally are required to file with the Commission and/or selfregulatory organizations pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 17a-5 (17 CFR 240.17a-5).

1722

See 17 CFR 240.0-10(a).

533

Issuers also will be required to file updates with the Commission to describe the progress of the
issuer in meeting the target offering amount, unless the issuer relies on the intermediary to include
this information on its platform, and to disclose the total amount of securities sold in the offering.
In addition, any issuer that sells securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) also will be required to
file with the Commission an annual report to update the previously provided disclosure about the
issuer’s contact information; directors, officers and certain beneficial owners; business and
business plan; current number of employees; financial condition; ownership and capital structure;
material factors that make an investment in the issuer speculative or risky; indebtedness;
description of other offerings of securities; and transactions with related parties.
Intermediaries will be required to register with the Commission as either brokers or as
funding portals. Intermediaries also will be required to provide quarterly reports to the
Commission. Funding portals will be required to make and keep certain records in accordance
with the rules. Registered broker-dealers are already required to make and keep certain records in
accordance with existing Exchange Act Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4. In addition, the final rules impose
specific compliance requirements on intermediaries, such as the maintenance of written policies
and procedures.
In adopting this regulation, we took into account that the regulation, as mandated by the
JOBS Act, aimed to address difficulties encountered by small entities. Accordingly, we designed
the final rules for intermediaries, to the extent possible in light of investor protection concerns,
with the needs and constraints of small entities in mind, including small intermediaries. We
believe that the reporting, recordkeeping and other compliance requirements of the final rules
applicable to intermediaries will impact, in particular, small entities that decide to register as
funding portals. We believe that most of these requirements will be performed by internal
534

compliance personnel of the broker or funding portal, but we expect that at least some funding
portals may decide to hire outside counsel and third-party service providers to assist in meeting
the compliance requirements. Given the statutory limitations on crowdfunding, we believe that
the potential impact of the final rules on larger brokers and funding portals will be proportionally
less than on small brokers and small intermediaries.
E.

Agency Action to Minimize Effect on Small Entities

In response to comments, the final rules include a number of changes from the proposal,
many of which were made to minimize the effect of the rules on small entities. These changes are
outlined in detail above in the discussions of the rules adopted.
1.

Issuers

To address commenters’ concerns about the cost of the rules to small issuers, we have
considered the alternatives suggested by commenters and are adopting final rules which
implement certain alternatives we believe will minimize the cost of the final rules to small issuers
while also preserving necessary investor protection measures.
First, the final rules include an accommodation for issuers conducting an offering for the
first time in reliance on Regulation Crowdfunding. Under the final rules, issuers conducting an
offering of more than $500,000 but not more than $1,000,000 that have not previously sold
securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) will not be required to provide audited financial
statements, unless audited financial statements are otherwise available. Instead, the final rules
permit these issuers to provide reviewed financial statements. As discussed above, this is a
change from the proposal that is responsive to concerns raised by many commenters about the
expense of obtaining audited financial statements, especially for start-up issuers without a track

535

record of successfully raising capital. 1723 We believe that requiring reviewed financial statements
for issuers using Regulation Crowdfunding for the first time to raise more than $500,000 but not
more than $1 million, rather than audited financial statements, will minimize costs for issuers
while providing sufficient investor protection by maintaining the benefit of an independent
review.
As suggested by one commenter, 1724 and as discussed above, the final Form C includes an
optional question-and-answer format that issuers may elect to use to provide the disclosures that
are not required to be filed in XML format. Issuers opting to use this format would prepare their
disclosures by answering the questions provided and filing that disclosure as an exhibit to the
Form C. Given our expectation that issuers engaged in offerings in reliance on Section 4(a)(6)
will encompass a wide variety of industries at different stages of business development, we do not
believe it would be practical or useful to develop standard, predetermined disclosure, as suggested
by one commenter, for such a variety of issuers. Also, as discussed above, we do not believe that
financial statements prepared in accordance with other comprehensive bases of accounting, such
as cash or accrual-based accounting, as suggested by one commenter, provide investors with a fair
representation of a company’s financial position and results of operations, and it may be difficult
for investors to determine whether the issuer complied with such basis. Although we
acknowledge, as some commenters observed, that other bases of accounting may be less
expensive than U.S. GAAP, we believe the benefit of a single standard that will facilitate
comparison among securities-based crowdfunding issuers justifies any incremental expenses
associated with U.S. GAAP. We also note that financial statements prepared in accordance with

1723

See, e.g., SBA Office of Advocacy Letter.

1724

Id.

536

U.S. GAAP are generally self-scaling to the size and complexity of the issuer, which we expect to
reduce the burden of preparing financial statements for many early stage issuers, including small
issuers.
The final rules also maintain the progress update requirement, but with a significant
modification from the proposed rule which is intended to reduce duplicative disclosure and
minimize the burden on small issuers. The final rules will require an issuer to file a Form C-U at
the end of the offering to disclosure the total amount of securities sold in the offering, but the rules
permit issuers to satisfy the 50% and 100% progress update requirements by relying on the
relevant intermediary to make publicly available on the intermediary’s platform frequent updates
about the issuer’s progress toward meeting the target offering amount.
With respect to ongoing reporting requirements, rather than requiring an issuer to provide
financial statements in the annual report that meet the highest standard previously provided, as
proposed, the final rules require financial statements of the issuer certified by the principal
executive officer of the issuer to be true and complete in all material respects. We expect that
reducing the required level of public accountant involvement will minimize the costs and burdens
for all issuers, including small issuers, associated with preparing reviewed and audited financial
statements on an ongoing basis.
In addition, the final rules provide for termination of the ongoing reporting obligation in
two additional circumstances: (1) the issuer has filed at least one annual report and has fewer than
300 holders of record, or (2) the issuer has filed the annual reports for at least the three most
recent years and has total assets not exceeding $10,000,000. We believe the addition of these
termination events should help reduce related costs for issuers that may not have achieved a level
of financial success that would sustain an ongoing reporting obligation.
537

Overall, we considered whether to establish different compliance or reporting
requirements or timetables or to clarify, consolidate or simplify compliance and reporting
requirements for small issuers. As noted above, we have made significant revisions to the final
rules to address commenters’ concerns about compliance and reporting burdens faced by issuers,
especially small issuers. With respect to using performance rather than design standards, we used
performance standards to the extent appropriate under the statute. For example, issuers have the
flexibility to customize the presentation of certain disclosures in their offering statements. 1725 We
also considered whether there should be an exemption from coverage of the rule, or any part of the
rule, for small issuers. However, because the rules have been designed to implement
crowdfunding, which focuses on capital formation by issuers that are small entities, while at the
same time provide appropriate investor protections, we do not believe that small issuers should be
exempt, in whole or in part, from the proposed rules.
2.

Intermediaries

In response to comments, we have made a number of changes from the proposal with
respect to intermediaries that will help to alleviate the compliance burdens faced by small entities.
Most significantly, and in response to commenters’ concerns about the application of Section
4A(c) liability, 1726 as discussed above, Rule 402(b)(1) has been modified from the proposal to
include a safe harbor that provides a funding portal the ability to determine whether and under
what terms to allow an issuer to offer and sell securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) of the
Securities Act through its platform; provided that a funding portal otherwise complies with
Regulation Crowdfunding. This change is expected to allow intermediaries, including small

1725

See Section II.B.3.

1726

See, e.g., SBA Office of Advocacy Letter.

538

entities, to reduce their exposure to such liability by denying access to issuers that present risk of
fraud or other investor protection concerns. In addition, in a change from the proposed rules, we
are not requiring a fidelity bond for intermediaries and also are expanding the definition of
qualified third party. These changes should reduce costs for all intermediaries, including small
entities.
The final rules have been tailored to the more limited role intermediaries will play in
offerings made pursuant to Securities Act Section 4(a)(6) (as compared to the wide range of
services that a traditional broker-dealer may provide). Registered brokers and funding portals will
engage in similar activities related to crowdfunding and must comply with the adopted rules. The
effective date for the registration provisions for funding portals will allow funding portals to be in
a position to engage in crowdfunding at the same time as registered brokers once the rest of the
rules become effective. These effective dates are designed to accommodate competitiveness
concerns related to funding portals’ and registered broker dealers’ abilities to begin crowdfunding
concurrently. While registered broker-dealers may perform services that a funding portal is
prohibited from performing, the Exchange Act and rules thereunder, as well as SRO rules, already
govern those activities. Therefore, we believe that the adopted rules are appropriate and properly
tailored for the permissible activities of all brokers and funding portals.
We also considered whether, for small brokers or small funding portals, to establish
different compliance, reporting or timing requirements, or whether to clarify, consolidate or
simplify those requirements in our rules. While the final rules are based in large part on existing
compliance requirements applicable to registered brokers to the extent they are applicable to
activities permitted for funding portals, we do not believe we should establish different
requirements for small entities (whether registered brokers or funding portals) that engage in
539

crowdfunding because such activities are limited in scope and, as such, the adopted rules are
tailored to that more limited activity.

§227.400 Registration of funding portals.
(a) Registration. A funding portal must register with the Commission, by filing a complete
Form Funding Portal (§ 249.2000 of this chapter) in accordance with the instructions on the form,
and become a member of a national securities association registered under section 15A of the
Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-3). The registration will be effective the later of:
(1) Thirty calendar days after the date that the registration is received by the Commission;
or
(2) The date the funding portal is approved for membership by a national securities
association registered under section 15A of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-3).
(b) Amendments to registration. A funding portal must file an amendment to Form
Funding Portal (§ 249.2000 of this chapter) within 30 days of any of the information previously
submitted on Form Funding Portal becoming inaccurate for any reason.
(c) Successor registration. (1) If a funding portal succeeds to and continues the business of
a registered funding portal, the registration of the predecessor will remain effective as the
registration of the successor if the successor, within 30 days after such succession, files a
registration on Form Funding Portal (§ 249.2000 of this chapter) and the predecessor files a
withdrawal on Form Funding Portal; provided, however, that the registration of the predecessor

542

funding portal will be deemed withdrawn 45 days after registration on Form Funding Portal is
filed by the successor.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if a funding portal succeeds to and
continues the business of a registered funding portal and the succession is based solely on a
change of the predecessor’s date or state of incorporation, form of organization, or composition of
a partnership, the successor may, within 30 days after the succession, amend the registration of the
predecessor on Form Funding Portal (§ 249.2000 of this chapter) to reflect these changes.
(d) Withdrawal. A funding portal must promptly file a withdrawal of registration on Form
Funding Portal (§ 249.2000 of this chapter) in accordance with the instructions on the form upon
ceasing to operate as a funding portal. Withdrawal will be effective on the later of 30 days after
receipt by the Commission (after the funding portal is no longer operational), or within such
longer period of time as to which the funding portal consents or which the Commission by order
may determine as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
(e) Applications and reports. The applications and reports provided for in this section shall
be considered filed when a complete Form Funding Portal (§ 249.2000 of this chapter) is submitted
with the Commission. Duplicate originals of the applications and reports provided for in this

section must be filed with surveillance personnel designated by any registered national securities
association of which the funding portal is a member.
(f) Nonresident funding portals. Registration pursuant to this section by a nonresident
funding portal shall be conditioned upon there being an information sharing arrangement in place
between the Commission and the competent regulator in the jurisdiction under the laws of which
the nonresident funding portal is organized or where it has its principal place of business, that is
applicable to the nonresident funding portal.
543

(1) Definition. For purposes of this section, the term nonresident funding portal shall
mean a funding portal incorporated in or organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside of the
United States or its territories, or having its principal place of business in any place not in the
United States or its territories.
(2) Power of attorney. (i) Each nonresident funding portal registered or applying for
registration pursuant to this section shall obtain a written consent and power of attorney
appointing an agent in the United States, other than the Commission or a Commission member,
official or employee, upon whom may be served any process, pleadings or other papers in any
action under the federal securities laws. This consent and power of attorney must be signed by the
nonresident funding portal and the named agent(s) for service of process.
(ii) Each nonresident funding portal registered or applying for registration pursuant to this
section shall, at the time of filing its application on Form Funding Portal (§ 249.2000 of this
chapter), furnish to the Commission the name and address of its United States agent for service of
process on Schedule C to the Form.
(iii) Any change of a nonresident funding portal’s agent for service of process and any
change of name or address of a nonresident funding portal’s existing agent for service of process
shall be communicated promptly to the Commission through amendment of the Schedule C to
Form Funding Portal (§ 249.2000 of this chapter).
(iv) Each nonresident funding portal must promptly appoint a successor agent for service
of process if the nonresident funding portal discharges its identified agent for service of process or
if its agent for service of process is unwilling or unable to accept service on behalf of the
nonresident funding portal.

544

(v) Each nonresident funding portal must maintain, as part of its books and records, the
written consent and power of attorney identified in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section for at least
three years after the agreement is terminated.
(3) Access to books and records; inspections and examinations(i) Certification and
opinion of counsel. Any nonresident funding portal applying for registration pursuant to this
section shall:
(A) Certify on Schedule C to Form Funding Portal (§ 249.2000 of this chapter) that the
nonresident funding portal can, as a matter of law, and will provide the Commission and any
registered national securities association of which it becomes a member with prompt access to the
books and records of such nonresident funding portal and can, as a matter of law, and will submit
to onsite inspection and examination by the Commission and any registered national securities
association of which it becomes a member; and
(B) Provide an opinion of counsel that the nonresident funding portal can, as a matter of
law, provide the Commission and any registered national securities association of which it
becomes a member with prompt access to the books and records of such nonresident funding
portal and can, as a matter of law, submit to onsite inspection and examination by the Commission
and any registered national securities association of which it becomes a member.

regulatory framework that would impact the nonresident funding portal’s ability to provide, or the
manner in which it provides, the Commission, or any registered national securities association of

Subpart A – General
§ 227.100 Crowdfunding exemption and requirements.
(a) Exemption. An issuer may offer or sell securities in reliance on section 4(a)(6) of the
Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)), provided that:
(1) The aggregate amount of securities sold to all investors by the issuer in reliance on
section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) during the 12-month period preceding
the date of such offer or sale, including the securities offered in such transaction, shall not exceed
$1,000,000;
(2) The aggregate amount of securities sold to any investor across all issuers in reliance on
section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) during the 12-month period preceding
the date of such transaction, including the securities sold to such investor in such transaction, shall
not exceed:
547

(i) The greater of $2,000 or 5 percent of the lesser of the investor’s annual income or net
worth if either the investor’s annual income or net worth is less than $100,000; or
(ii) 10 percent of the lesser of the investor’s annual income or net worth, not to exceed an
amount sold of $100,000, if both the investor’s annual income and net worth are equal to or more
than $100,000;
Instruction 1 to paragraph (a)(2). To determine the investment limit for a natural person,
the person’s annual income and net worth shall be calculated as those values are calculated for
purposes of determining accredited investor status in accordance with § 230.501 of this chapter.
Instruction 2 to paragraph (a)(2). A person’s annual income and net worth may be
calculated jointly with that person’s spouse; however, when such a joint calculation is used, the
aggregate investment of the investor spouses may not exceed the limit that would apply to an
individual investor at that income or net worth level.
Instruction 3 to paragraph (a)(2). An issuer offering and selling securities in reliance on
section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) may rely on the efforts of an
intermediary required by § 227.303(b) to ensure that the aggregate amount of securities purchased
by an investor in offerings pursuant to section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act will not cause the
investor to exceed the limit set forth in section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act and § 227.100(a)(2),
provided that the issuer does not know that the investor has exceeded the investor limits or would
exceed the investor limits as a result of purchasing securities in the issuer’s offering.
(3) The transaction is conducted through an intermediary that complies with the
requirements in section 4A(a) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d-1(a)) and the related
requirements in this part, and the transaction is conducted exclusively through the intermediary’s
platform; and
548

Instruction to paragraph (a)(3). An issuer shall not conduct an offering or concurrent
offerings in reliance on section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) using
more than one intermediary.
(4) The issuer complies with the requirements in section 4A(b) of the Securities Act (15
U.S.C. 77d-1(b)) and the related requirements in this part; provided, however, that the failure to
comply with §§ 227.202, 227.203(a)(3) and 227.203(b) shall not prevent an issuer from relying on
the exemption provided by section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)).
(b) Applicability. The crowdfunding exemption shall not apply to transactions involving
the offer or sale of securities by any issuer that:
(1) Is not organized under, and subject to, the laws of a State or territory of the United
States or the District of Columbia;
(2) Is subject to the requirement to file reports pursuant to section 13 or section 15(d) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) (15 U.S.C. 78m or 78o(d));
(3) Is an investment company, as defined in section 3 of the Investment Company Act of
1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-3), or is excluded from the definition of investment company by section 3(b)
or section 3(c) of that Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-3(b) or 80a-3(c));
(4) Is not eligible to offer or sell securities in reliance on section 4(a)(6) of the Securities
Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) as a result of a disqualification as specified in § 227.503(a);
(5) Has sold securities in reliance on section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C.
77d(a)(6)) and has not filed with the Commission and provided to investors, to the extent required,
the ongoing annual reports required by this part during the two years immediately preceding the
filing of the required offering statement; or
Instruction to paragraph (b)(5). An issuer delinquent in its ongoing reports can again rely
549

on section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) once it has filed with the
Commission and provided to investors both of the annual reports required during the two years
immediately preceding the filing of the required offering statement.
(6) Has no specific business plan or has indicated that its business plan is to engage in a
merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies.
(c) Issuer. For purposes of §227.201(r), calculating aggregate amounts offered and sold in
§227.100(a) and §227.201(t), and determining whether an issuer has previously sold securities in
§227.201(t)(3), issuer includes all entities controlled by or under common control with the issuer
and any predecessors of the issuer.
Instruction to paragraph (c). The term control means the possession, direct or indirect, of
the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the entity, whether
through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.

uses, the issuer should identify and describe each probable use and the factors the issuer may

practicable, the approximate amount of his or her interest in the transaction. The amount of such
interest shall be computed without regard to the amount of the profit or loss involved in the
transaction. Where it is not practicable to state the approximate amount of the interest, the
approximate amount involved in the transaction shall be disclosed.

not limited to, any financial transaction, arrangement or relationship (including any indebtedness

changes or trends known to management in the financial condition and results of operations of the
issuer subsequent to the period for which financial statements are provided.
Instruction 2 to paragraph (s). For issuers with no prior operating history, the discussion
should focus on financial milestones and operational, liquidity and other challenges. For issuers
with an operating history, the discussion should focus on whether historical results and cash flows
are representative of what investors should expect in the future. Issuers should take into account
the proceeds of the offering and any other known or pending sources of capital. Issuers also
should discuss how the proceeds from the offering will affect the issuer’s liquidity, whether
receiving these funds and any other additional funds is necessary to the viability of the business,
and how quickly the issuer anticipates using its available cash. In addition, issuers should
556

describe the other available sources of capital to the business, such as lines of credit or required
contributions by shareholders.
Instruction 3 to paragraph (s). References to the issuer in this paragraph and its
instructions refer to the issuer and its predecessors, if any.
(t) For offerings that, together with all other amounts sold under section 4(a)(6) of the
Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) within the preceding 12-month period, have, in the aggregate,
the following target offering amounts:
(1) $100,000 or less, the amount of total income, taxable income and total tax, or the
equivalent line items, as reported on the federal income tax returns filed by the issuer for the most
recently completed year (if any), which shall be certified by the principal executive officer of the
issuer to reflect accurately the information reported on the issuer’s federal income tax returns, and
financial statements of the issuer, which shall be certified by the principal executive officer of the
issuer to be true and complete in all material respects. If financial statements of the issuer are
available that have either been reviewed or audited by a public accountant that is independent of
the issuer, the issuer must provide those financial statements instead and need not include the
information reported on the federal income tax returns or the certifications of the principal
executive officer;
(2) More than $100,000, but not more than $500,000, financial statements of the issuer
reviewed by a public accountant that is independent of the issuer. If financial statements of the
issuer are available that have been audited by a public accountant that is independent of the issuer,
the issuer must provide those financial statements instead and need not include the reviewed
financial statements; and

557

(3) More than $500,000, financial statements of the issuer audited by a public accountant
that is independent of the issuer; provided, however, that for issuers that have not previously sold
securities in reliance on section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)), offerings that
have a target offering amount of more than $500,000, but not more than $1,000,000, financial
statements of the issuer reviewed by a public accountant that is independent of the issuer. If
financial statements of the issuer are available that have been audited by a public accountant that
is independent of the issuer, the issuer must provide those financial statements instead and need
not include the reviewed financial statements.
Instruction 1 to paragraph (t). To determine the financial statements required under this
paragraph (t), an issuer must aggregate amounts sold in reliance on section 4(a)(6) of the
Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) within the preceding 12-month period and the offering
amount in the offering for which disclosure is being provided. If the issuer will accept proceeds in
excess of the target offering amount, the issuer must include the maximum offering amount that
the issuer will accept in the calculation to determine the financial statements required under this
paragraph (t).
Instruction 2 to paragraph (t). An issuer may voluntarily meet the requirements of this
paragraph (t) for a higher aggregate target offering amount.
Instruction 3 to paragraph (t). The financial statements must be prepared in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and include balance sheets, statements of
comprehensive income, statements of cash flows, statements of changes in stockholders’ equity
and notes to the financial statements. If the financial statements are not audited, they must be
labeled as “unaudited.” The financial statements must cover the two most recently completed
fiscal years or the period(s) since inception, if shorter.
558

Instruction 4 to paragraph (t). For an offering conducted in the first 120 days of a fiscal
year, the financial statements provided may be for the two fiscal years prior to the issuer’s most
recently completed fiscal year; however, financial statements for the two most recently completed
fiscal years must be provided if they are otherwise available. If more than 120 days have passed
since the end of the issuer’s most recently completed fiscal year, the financial statements provided
must be for the issuer’s two most recently completed fiscal years. If the 120th day falls on a
Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the next business day shall be considered the 120th day for purposes
of determining the age of the financial statements.
Instruction 5 to paragraph (t). An issuer may elect to delay complying with any new or
revised financial accounting standard that applies to companies that are not issuers (as defined
under section 2(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7201(a)) until the date that such
companies are required to comply with such new or revised accounting standard. Issuers electing
this accommodation must disclose it at the time the issuer files its offering statement and apply the
election to all standards. Issuers electing not to use this accommodation must forgo this
accommodation for all financial accounting standards and may not elect to rely on this
accommodation in any future filings.
Instruction 6 to paragraph (t). An issuer required to provide information from a tax return
under paragraph (t)(1) of this section before filing a tax return with the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service for the most recently completed fiscal year may provide information from its tax return
for the prior year (if any), provided that the issuer provides information from the tax return for the
most recently completed fiscal year when it is filed with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (if the
tax return is filed during the offering period). An issuer that requested an extension from the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service would not be required to provide information from the tax return until
559

the date the return is filed, if filed during the offering period. If an issuer has not yet filed a tax
return and is not required to file a tax return before the end of the offering period, then the tax
return information does not need to be provided.
Instruction 7 to paragraph (t). An issuer providing financial statements that are not
audited or reviewed and tax information as specified under paragraph (t)(1) of this section must
have its principal executive officer provide the following certification:
I, [identify the certifying individual], certify that:
(1)

the financial statements of [identify the issuer] included in this Form are true and

complete in all material respects; and
(2)

the tax return information of [identify the issuer] included in this Form reflects

accurately the information reported on the tax return for [identify the issuer] filed for the
fiscal year ended [date of most recent tax return].
[Signature and title].
Instruction 8 to paragraph (t). Financial statement reviews shall be conducted in
accordance with the Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services issued by the
Accounting and Review Services Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. A signed review report must accompany the reviewed financial statements, and an
issuer must notify the public accountant of the issuer’s intended use of the review report in the
offering. An issuer will not be in compliance with the requirement to provide reviewed financial
statements if the review report includes modifications.
Instruction 9 to paragraph (t). Financial statement audits shall be conducted in
accordance with either auditing standards issued by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants (referred to as U.S. Generally Accepted Auditing Standards) or the standards of the
560

Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. A signed audit report must accompany audited
financial statements, and an issuer must notify the public accountant of the issuer’s intended use
of the audit report in the offering. An issuer will not be in compliance with the requirement to
provide audited financial statements if the audit report includes a qualified opinion, an adverse
opinion, or a disclaimer of opinion.
Instruction 10 to paragraph (t). To qualify as a public accountant that is independent of
the issuer for purposes of this part, the accountant must satisfy the independence standards of
either:
(i) 17 CFR 210.2-01 of this chapter, or
(ii) The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The public accountant that
audits or reviews the financial statements provided by an issuer must be:
(A) Duly registered and in good standing as a certified public accountant under the
laws of the place of his or her residence or principal office; or
(B) In good standing and entitled to practice as a public accountant under the laws
of his or her place of residence or principal office.
Instruction 11 to paragraph (t). Except as set forth in § 227.100(c), references to the
issuer in this paragraph (t) and its instructions (2) through (10) refer to the issuer and its
predecessors, if any.
(u) Any matters that would have triggered disqualification under § 227.503(a) but occurred
before May 16, 2016. The failure to provide such disclosure shall not prevent an issuer from
continuing to rely on the exemption provided by section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C.
77d(a)(6)) if the issuer establishes that it did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care,
could not have known of the existence of the undisclosed matter or matters;
561

Instruction to paragraph (u). An issuer will not be able to establish that it could not have
known of a disqualification unless it has made factual inquiry into whether any disqualifications
exist. The nature and scope of the factual inquiry will vary based on the facts and circumstances
concerning, among other things, the issuer and the other offering participants.
(v) Updates regarding the progress of the issuer in meeting the target offering amount, to
be provided in accordance with § 227.203;
(w) Where on the issuer’s website investors will be able to find the issuer’s annual report,
and the date by which such report will be available on the issuer’s website;
(x) Whether the issuer or any of its predecessors previously failed to comply with the
ongoing reporting requirements of § 227.202; and
(y) Any material information necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
Instruction to §227.201. If disclosure provided pursuant to any paragraph of this section
also satisfies the requirements of one or more other paragraphs of this section, it is not necessary
to repeat the disclosure. Instead of repeating information, an issuer may include a cross-reference
to disclosure contained elsewhere in the offering statement or report, including to information in
the financial statements.
§ 227.202 Ongoing reporting requirements.
(a) An issuer that has offered and sold securities in reliance on section 4(a)(6) of the
Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) and in accordance with section 4A of the Securities Act (15
U.S.C. 77d-1) and this part must file with the Commission and post on the issuer’s website an
annual report along with the financial statements of the issuer certified by the principal executive
officer of the issuer to be true and complete in all material respects and a description of the
562

financial condition of the issuer as described in § 227.201(s). If, however, an issuer has available
financial statements that have either been reviewed or audited by a public accountant that is
independent of the issuer, those financial statements must be provided and the certification by the
principal executive officer will not be required. The annual report also must include the
disclosure required by paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (m), (p), (q), (r), and (x) of § 227.201.
The report must be filed in accordance with the requirements of § 227.203 and Form C (§ 239.900
of this chapter) and no later than 120 days after the end of the fiscal year covered by the report.
Instruction 1 to paragraph (a). Instructions (3), (8), (9), (10), and (11) to paragraph (t) of §
227.201 shall apply for purposes of this section.
Instruction 2 to paragraph (a). An issuer providing financial statements that are not
audited or reviewed must have its principal executive officer provide the following certification:
I, [identify the certifying individual], certify that the financial statements of [identify the
issuer] included in this Form are true and complete in all material respects.
[Signature and title].
(b) An issuer must continue to comply with the ongoing reporting requirements until one
of the following occurs:
(1) The issuer is required to file reports under section 13(a) or section 15(d) of the

§ 227.301 Measures to reduce risk of fraud.
An intermediary in a transaction involving the offer or sale of securities in reliance on
section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) must:
(a) Have a reasonable basis for believing that an issuer seeking to offer and sell securities
in reliance on section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) through the
intermediary’s platform complies with the requirements in section 4A(b) of the Act (15 U.S.C.
77d-1(b)) and the related requirements in this part. In satisfying this requirement, an intermediary
may rely on the representations of the issuer concerning compliance with these requirements
unless the intermediary has reason to question the reliability of those representations;
(b) Have a reasonable basis for believing that the issuer has established means to keep
accurate records of the holders of the securities it would offer and sell through the intermediary’s
platform, provided that an intermediary may rely on the representations of the issuer concerning
its means of recordkeeping unless the intermediary has reason to question the reliability of those
representations. An intermediary will be deemed to have satisfied this requirement if the issuer
has engaged the services of a transfer agent that is registered under Section 17A of the Exchange
Act (15 U.S.C. 78q-1(c)).
(c) Deny access to its platform to an issuer if the intermediary:
(1) Has a reasonable basis for believing that the issuer or any of its officers, directors (or
any person occupying a similar status or performing a similar function) or beneficial owners of 20
percent or more of the issuer’s outstanding voting equity securities, calculated on the basis of
voting power, is subject to a disqualification under § 227.503. In satisfying this requirement, an
571

intermediary must, at a minimum, conduct a background and securities enforcement regulatory
history check on each issuer whose securities are to be offered by the intermediary and on each

equity securities, calculated on the basis of voting power.
(2) Has a reasonable basis for believing that the issuer or the offering presents the potential
for fraud or otherwise raises concerns about investor protection. In satisfying this requirement, an
intermediary must deny access if it reasonably believes that it is unable to adequately or
effectively assess the risk of fraud of the issuer or its potential offering. In addition, if an
intermediary becomes aware of information after it has granted access that causes it to reasonably
believe that the issuer or the offering presents the potential for fraud or otherwise raises concerns
about investor protection, the intermediary must promptly remove the offering from its platform,
cancel the offering, and return (or, for funding portals, direct the return of) any funds that have
been committed by investors in the offering.
§ 227.302 Account opening.
(a) Accounts and electronic delivery.
(1) No intermediary or associated person of an intermediary may accept an investment

posted on intermediary’s platform, or through an electronic message that provides notice of what
the information is and that it is located on the intermediary’s platform or on the issuer’s website.
Electronic messages include, but are not limited to, e-mail, social media messages, instant
messages or other electronic media messages.

of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6));
(ii) The types of securities offered and sold in reliance on section 4(a)(6) of the Securities
Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) available for purchase on the intermediary’s platform and the risks
associated with each type of security, including the risk of having limited voting power as a result
of dilution;
(iii) The restrictions on the resale of a security offered and sold in reliance on section
4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6));

573

(vi) The limitations on an investor’s right to cancel an investment commitment and the

investor;
(viii) That following completion of an offering conducted through the intermediary, there
may or may not be any ongoing relationship between the issuer and intermediary; and
(ix) That under certain circumstances an issuer may cease to publish annual reports and,
therefore, an investor may not continually have current financial information about the issuer.
(2) An intermediary must make the most current version of its educational material
available on its platform at all times and, if at any time, the intermediary makes a material revision
to its educational materials, it must make the revised educational materials available to all

in all communications on the intermediary’s platform, respectively, the receipt of the
compensation and that he or she is engaging in promotional activities on behalf of the issuer.
(d) Compensation disclosure. When establishing an account for an investor, an
intermediary must clearly disclose the manner in which the intermediary is compensated in

limitations established by section 4(a)(6)(B) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)(B)) and this part. An
575

intermediary may rely on an investor’s representations concerning compliance with the
investment limitation requirements concerning the investor’s annual income, net worth, and the
amount of the investor’s other investments made pursuant to section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act
(15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) unless the intermediary has reason to question the reliability of the
representation.
(2) Obtain from the investor:

(ii) A questionnaire completed by the investor demonstrating the investor’s understanding
that:

and obtain a return of his or her investment;

Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) involves risk, and the investor should not invest any funds in an
offering made in reliance on section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act unless he or she can afford to
lose the entire amount of his or her investment.
(c) Communication channels. An intermediary must provide on its platform
communication channels by which persons can communicate with one another and with

change of the predecessor’s date or state of incorporation, form of organization, or composition of
582

a partnership, the successor may, within 30 days after the succession, amend the registration of the
predecessor on Form Funding Portal (§ 249.2000 of this chapter) to reflect these changes.

longer period of time as to which the funding portal consents or which the Commission by order
may determine as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.

registration pursuant to this section shall obtain a written consent and power of attorney
appointing an agent in the United States, other than the Commission or a Commission member,
official or employee, upon whom may be served any process, pleadings or other papers in any
action under the federal securities laws. This consent and power of attorney must be signed by the
nonresident funding portal and the named agent(s) for service of process.
(ii) Each nonresident funding portal registered or applying for registration pursuant to this
section shall, at the time of filing its application on Form Funding Portal (§ 249.2000 of this

and any registered national securities association of which it becomes a member.
(ii) Amendments. The nonresident funding portal shall re-certify, on Schedule C to Form
Funding Portal (§ 249.2000 of this chapter), within 90 days after any changes in the legal or
regulatory framework that would impact the nonresident funding portal’s ability to provide, or the
manner in which it provides, the Commission, or any registered national securities association of
which it is a member, with prompt access to its books and records or that would impact the
Commission’s or such registered national securities association’s ability to inspect and examine
the nonresident funding portal. The re-certification shall be accompanied by a revised opinion of
counsel describing how, as a matter of law, the nonresident funding portal can continue to meet its
obligations under paragraphs (f)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section.

§ 227.401 Exemption.
A funding portal that is registered with the Commission pursuant to § 227.400 is exempt
from the broker registration requirements of section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C.
78o(a)(1)) in connection with its activities as a funding portal.
§ 227.402 Conditional safe harbor.
(a) General. Under section 3(a)(80) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(80)), a funding
portal acting as an intermediary in a transaction involving the offer or sale of securities in reliance
on section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) may not: offer investment advice or
recommendations; solicit purchases, sales, or offers to buy the securities offered or displayed on
its platform or portal; compensate employees, agents, or other persons for such solicitation or
based on the sale of securities displayed or referenced on its platform or portal; hold, manage,
possess, or otherwise handle investor funds or securities; or engage in such other activities as the
Commission, by rule, determines appropriate. This section is intended to provide clarity with
respect to the ability of a funding portal to engage in certain activities, consistent with the
prohibitions under section 3(a)(80) of the Exchange Act. No presumption shall arise that a
funding portal has violated the prohibitions under section 3(a)(80) of the Exchange Act or this part
by reason of the funding portal or its associated persons engaging in activities in connection with
the offer or sale of securities in reliance on section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act that do not meet
the conditions specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The antifraud provisions and all other
applicable provisions of the federal securities laws continue to apply to the activities described in
paragraph (b) of this section.

(ii) The criteria may include, among other things, the type of securities being offered (for
example, common stock, preferred stock or debt securities); the geographic location of the issuer;
the industry or business segment of the issuer; the number or amount of investment commitments

offering amount; and the minimum or maximum investment amount; provided that the funding

its offering; and
(iii) The funding portal does not receive special or additional compensations for
highlighting one or more issuers or offerings on its platform;
(3) Provide search functions or other tools that investors can use to search, sort, or

communication and remove abusive or potentially fraudulent communications;
(ii) Permits public access to view the discussions made in the communication channels;
(iii) Restricts posting of comments in the communication channels to those persons who
have opened an account on its platform; and

promotional activities on behalf of the issuer, or is otherwise compensated, whether in the past or
prospectively, to promote an issuer’s offering;
(5) Advise an issuer about the structure or content of the issuer’s offering, including
assisting the issuer in preparing offering documentation;
(6) Compensate a third party for referring a person to the funding portal, so long as the
third party does not provide the funding portal with personally identifiable information of any
potential investor, and the compensation, other than that paid to a registered broker or dealer, is

588

not based, directly or indirectly, on the purchase or sale of a security in reliance on section 4(a)(6)
of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) offered on or through the funding portal’s platform;
(7) Pay or offer to pay any compensation to a registered broker or dealer for services,

(i) The criteria are reasonably designed to identify a broad selection of issuers offering
securities through the funding portal’s platform, and are applied consistently to all potential
issuers and offerings;
(ii) The criteria may include, among other things, the type of securities being offered (for
example, common stock, preferred stock or debt securities); the geographic location of the issuer;
the industry or business segment of the issuer; the expressed interest by investors, as measured by
number or amount of investment commitments made, progress in meeting the issuer’s target
offering amount or, if applicable, the maximum offering amount; and the minimum or maximum
investment amount; and
(iii) The funding portal does not receive special or additional compensation for identifying
the issuer or offering in this manner;
(10) Deny access to its platform to, or cancel an offering of an issuer, pursuant to §

offering presents the potential for fraud or otherwise raises concerns about investor protection;
(11) Accept, on behalf of an issuer, an investment commitment for securities offered in
reliance on section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) by that issuer on the funding

affiliated entity at the time of such events.

A crowdfunding investment involves risk. You should not invest any funds in this offering unless you can

In making an investment decision, investors must rely on their own examination of the issuer and the terms

literature.
These securities are offered under an exemption from registration; however, the U.S. Securities and

by any federal or state securities commission or regulatory authority. Furthermore, these authorities have not
passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this document.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission does not pass upon the merits of any securities offered or the

INSTRUCTION TO QUESTION 10: An issuer must provide a reasonably detailed description of any intended
use of proceeds, such that investors are provided with an adequate amount of information to understand how the
offering proceeds will be used. If an issuer has identified a range of possible uses, the issuer should identify and
describe each probable use and the factors the issuer may consider in allocating proceeds among the potential uses. If
the issuer will accept proceeds in excess of the target offering amount, the issuer must describe the purpose, method
for allocating oversubscriptions, and intended use of the excess proceeds with similar specificity.
11.

How will the issuer complete the transaction and deliver securities to the investors?

12.

How can an investor cancel an investment commitment?
NOTE: Investors may cancel an investment commitment until 48 hours prior to the deadline
identified in these offering materials.

If the issuer reaches the target offering amount prior to the deadline identified in the
offering materials, it may close the offering early if it provides notice about the new
offering deadline at least five business days prior to such new offering deadline (absent a
material change that would require an extension of the offering and reconfirmation of the
investment commitment).
If an investor does not cancel an investment commitment before the 48-hour period prior to
the offering deadline, the funds will be released to the issuer upon closing of the offering
and the investor will receive securities in exchange for his or her investment.
If an investor does not reconfirm his or her investment commitment after a material change
is made to the offering, the investor’s investment commitment will be cancelled and the
committed funds will be returned.

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

1.

EXPLANATION OF FORM
•

•

2.

This is the form that a funding portal must use to register with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC” or “Commission”), to amend its registration and
to withdraw from registration.
The Commission may make publicly accessible all current Forms Funding Portal,
including amendments and registration withdrawal requests, which may be searchable
by the public, with the exception of certain personally identifiable information or other
information with significant potential for misuse (including the contact employee’s
direct phone number, fax number and e-mail address and any IRS Tax Number, IRS
Employer Identification Number, social security number, date of birth, or any other
similar information). If the applicant submits any attachments to Form Funding Portal
in PDF format it is the responsibility of the applicant to redact certain personally
identifiable information or other information with significant potential for misuse
(including the contact employee’s direct phone number, fax number and e-mail address
and any IRS Tax Number, IRS Employer Identification Number, social security
number, date of birth, or any other similar information) from the PDF.
WHEN TO FILE FORM FUNDING PORTAL

•

A funding portal’s registration must become effective before offering or selling any
securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6) through a platform. Under Rule 400, a funding
portal’s registration will be effective the later of: (1) 30 calendar days after the date a
complete Form Funding Portal is received by the Commission or (2) the date the
funding portal is approved for membership by a national securities association
registered under Section 15A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange
Act”).

•

A registered funding portal must promptly file an amendment to Form Funding Portal
when any information previously submitted on Form Funding Portal becomes
inaccurate or incomplete for any reason.

•

A successor funding portal may succeed to the registration of a registered funding
portal by filing a registration on Form Funding Portal within 30 days after the
succession.

•

If a funding portal succeeds to and continues the business of a registered funding portal
and the succession is based solely on a change of the predecessor’s date or state of
incorporation, form of organization, or composition of a partnership or similar reason,
the successor may, within 30 days of the succession, amend the registration on Form
Funding Portal to reflect these changes.
659

•

A funding portal must also file a withdrawal on Form Funding Portal (and complete
Schedule D) promptly upon ceasing to operate as a funding portal. Withdrawal will be
effective on the later of 30 days after receipt by the Commission, after the funding
portal is no longer operational, or within such longer period of time as to which the
funding portal consents or which the Commission by order may determine as necessary
or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.

•

A Form Funding Portal filing will not be considered complete unless it complies with
all applicable requirements.

ELECTRONIC FILING – The applicant must file Form Funding Portal
electronically, and must utilize this system to file and amend Form Funding Portal
electronically to assure the timely acceptance and processing of those filings.

make certain information collected through the form publicly available. The SEC will
not accept forms that do not include the required information.

•

Section 4A(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. §77d-1(a)] and Sections 3(h) and
23(a) the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§78c(h) and 78w(a)] authorize the SEC to collect
the information required by Form Funding Portal. The SEC collects the information for
regulatory purposes. Filing Form Funding Portal is mandatory for persons that are
registering as funding portals with the SEC.

•

Any member of the public may direct to the Commission any comments concerning the
accuracy of the burden estimate on this Form and any suggestions for reducing this
burden. This collection of information has been reviewed by the Office of Management
and Budget in accordance with the clearance requirements of 44 U.S.C. §3507. The
