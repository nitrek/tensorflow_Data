Investment Company Reporting Modernization
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Proposed rule.
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission is proposing new rules and
forms as well as amendments to its rules and forms to modernize the reporting and
disclosure of information by registered investment companies. The Commission is
proposing new Form N-PORT, which would require certain registered investment
companies to report information about their monthly portfolio holdings to the
Commission in a structured data format. In addition, the Commission is proposing
amendments to Regulation S-X, which would require standardized, enhanced disclosure
about derivatives in investment company financial statements, as well as other
amendments. The Commission is also proposing new rule 30e-3, which would permit
but not require registered investment companies to transmit periodic reports to their
shareholders by making the reports accessible on a website and satisfying certain other
conditions. The Commission is proposing new Form N-CEN, which would require
registered investment companies, other than face amount certificate companies, to
annually report certain census-type information to the Commission in a structured data
format. Finally, the Commission is proposing to rescind current Forms N-Q and N-SAR
and to amend certain other rules and forms. Collectively, these amendments would,
among other things, improve the information that the Commission receives from

investment companies and assist the Commission, in its role as primary regulator of
investment companies, to better fulfill its mission of protecting investors, maintaining fair,
orderly and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation. Investors and other
potential users could also utilize this information to help investors make more informed
investment decisions.

BACKGROUND
A.

Changes in the Industry and Technology

As the primary regulator of the asset management industry, the Commission relies
on information included in reports filed by registered investment companies (“funds”) 1
and investment advisers for a number of purposes, including monitoring industry trends,
informing policy and rulemaking, identifying risks, and assisting Commission staff in
examination and enforcement efforts. Over the years, however, as assets under
management and complexity in the industry have grown, so too has the volume and
complexity of information that the Commission must analyze to carry out its regulatory
duties.
Commission staff estimates that there were approximately 16,619 funds registered
with the Commission, as of December 2014. 2 Commission staff further estimates that
there were about 11,500 investment advisers registered with the Commission, along with
another 2,845 advisers that file reports with the Commission as exempt reporting
advisers, as of January 2015. 3 At year-end 2014, assets of registered investment

For purposes of the preamble of this release, we use “funds” to mean registered investment
companies other than face amount certificate companies and any separate series thereof—i.e.,
management companies and unit investment trusts. In addition, we use the term
“management companies” or “management investment companies” to refer to registered
management investment companies and any separate series thereof. We note that “fund” may
be separately and differently defined in each of the proposed new forms or rules, or proposed
rule or form amendments.

Based on Investment Adviser Registration Depository system data. In 2010, Congress
charged the Commission with implementing new reporting and registration requirements for
certain investment advisers to private funds (known as “exempt reporting advisers”). See
Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376, 1570–80.

companies exceeded $18 trillion, having grown from about $4.7 trillion at the end of
1997. 4 At the same time, the industry has developed new product structures, such as
exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) 5, new fund types, such as target date funds with asset
allocation strategies, 6 and increased its use of derivatives and other alternative strategies. 7

Form ADV is used by registered investment advisers to register with the Commission and
with the states and by exempt reporting advisers to report information to the Commission.
Information on Form ADV is available to the public through the Investment Adviser Public
Disclosure System, which allows the public to access the most recent Form ADV filing made
by an investment adviser and is available at http://www.adviserinfo.sec.gov. Today, in a
contemporaneous release, we are proposing a limited set of amendments to Form ADV and
certain rules under the Advisers Act to fill certain data gaps and to enhance current reporting
requirements, to incorporate “umbrella registration” for private fund advisers, and to make
clarifying, technical and other amendments. See Amendments to Form ADV and Investment
Advisers Act Rules, Investment Advisers Act Release No. 4091 (May 20, 2015).

These products and strategies can offer greater opportunities for investors to achieve their
investment goals, but they can also add complexity to funds’ investment strategies,
amplify investment risk, or have other risks, such as counterparty credit risk.
While these changes have been taking place in the fund industry, there has also
been a significant increase in the use of the Internet as a tool for disseminating
information and advances in the technology that can be used to report and analyze
information. As discussed below, we have allowed the use of the Internet as a platform
for providing required disclosure to investors. We have also started to use structured and
interactive data formats to collect, aggregate, and analyze data reported by registrants and
other filers. These data formats for information collection have enabled us and other data
users, including investors and other industry participants, to better collect and analyze
reported information and have improved our ability to carry out our regulatory functions.
We have historically acted to modernize our forms and the manner in which
information is filed with the Commission and disclosed to the public in order to keep up
with changes in the industry and technology. For example, in 1985, the Commission
replaced five different reporting forms with Form N-SAR, which was designed to require
reporting of data in a structured manner so that the Commission could construct a
comprehensive database of information about the fund industry. 8 In 2000, we adopted
new rules and rule amendments under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers
Act”) to require advisers registered with the Commission to make filings under the
work-and-should-you-invest/ (noting that “alternative mutual fund products grew at a neckbreaking 43% [in 2013]….”).
8

See Semi-Annual Report Form for Registered Investment Companies, Exchange Act Release
No. 21633 (Jan. 4, 1985) [50 FR 1442 (Jan. 11, 1985)]. Reports on Form N-SAR are publicly
available on the Commission’s EDGAR website.

11

Advisers Act with the Commission electronically through the Investment Adviser
Registration Depository (IARD). 9 In 2007, we sought to enhance the ability of investors
to make informed voting decisions and to expand the use of the Internet to ultimately
lower the costs of proxy solicitations by requiring Internet availability of proxy
materials. 10
In 2009, we amended Form N-1A, the registration form for open-end funds, to
enhance the information provided to investors by requiring these funds to include a
summary of key information in the front of their prospectuses. 11 The 2009 amendments
to Form N-1A also sought to harness the benefits of technological advances and
increased Internet usage by allowing mutual funds to satisfy their prospectus delivery
obligations by delivering a summary prospectus to investors and posting the statutory
prospectus and other materials on an Internet website.
Also in 2009, the Commission sought to take advantage of new technology by
adopting amendments requiring open-end funds to file their prospectus risk/return
summaries in eXtensible Business Reporting Language (“XBRL”). 12 In doing so, the

See Interactive Data for Mutual Fund Risk/Return Summary, Investment Company Act
Release No. 28617 (Feb. 11, 2009) [74 FR 7748 (Feb. 19, 2009)]. Just prior to adopting the
XBRL requirements for mutual fund risk/return summaries, the Commission also adopted
amendments requiring operating companies to provide their financial statement information
in XBRL format. See Interactive Data to Improve Financial Reporting, Securities Act
Release No. 33-9002 (Jan. 30, 2009) [74 FR 6776 (Feb. 10, 2009)]. In adopting these
requirements, the Commission noted that “[i]n this format, financial statement information

12

Commission noted that this interactive data format would make “risk/return summary
information easier for investors to analyze [and] assist in automating regulatory filings
and business information processing.” Additionally, in 2010, the Commission adopted
Form N-MFP, which requires money market funds to report detailed portfolio holdings
information on a monthly basis in Extensible Markup Language (“XML”). 13 Because
these disclosures and reports are filed in a structured data format using XBRL or XML,
Commission staff, investors and other potential users are able to aggregate and analyze
the data in a much less labor-intensive manner than plain text or hypertext filing formats
would allow. The Commission also now uses the XML data format to collect and
analyze certain information from advisers to private funds on Form PF 14 and has
modernized the reporting of securities holdings by institutional investment managers on
Form 13F, 15 which we believe resulted in efficiencies for data users. 16

could be downloaded directly into spreadsheets, analyzed in a variety of ways using
commercial off-the-shelf software, and used within investment models in other software
formats.” Id.

Release No. 31166 (July 23, 2014) [79 FR 47736 (Aug. 14, 2014)] (“Money Market Fund
Reform 2014 Release”) (adopting amendments to Form N-MFP). The information in Form
N-MFP allows the Commission, investors, and other potential users to monitor compliance
with rule 2a-7 and to better understand and monitor the underlying risks of money market
fund portfolios. Additionally, pursuant to the 2010 and 2014 amendments, money market
funds are required to disclose certain information, including portfolio holdings, on their
websites.

contexts. See, e.g., Mandated Electronic Filing and Website Posting For Forms 3, 4 and 5,

13

As these industry changes and technological advances have occurred over the
years, we recognize a need to improve the type and format of the information that funds
provide to us and to investors. We also recognize the need to improve the information
that the Commission receives from funds in order to improve the Commission’s
monitoring of the fund industry in its role as the primary regulator of funds and
investment advisers. As discussed below, today we are proposing a set of reporting and
disclosure reforms designed to take advantage of the benefits of advanced technology and
to modernize the fund reporting regime in order to help the Commission, investors, and
other market participants better assess different fund products and to assist us in carrying
out our mission to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and
facilitate capital formation. Our proposed reforms seek to (1) increase the transparency
of fund portfolios and investment practices both to the Commission and to investors, (2)
take advantage of technological advances both in terms of the manner in which
information is reported to the Commission and how it is provided to investors and other
potential users, and (3) where appropriate, reduce duplicative or otherwise unnecessary
reporting burdens on the industry.

information in reports on Form N-Q under the Investment Company Act and the
Exchange Act as of the end of each first and third fiscal quarter, 20 and in reports on Form
N-CSR under those Acts as of the end of each second and fourth fiscal quarter. 21
As discussed in Parts II.A and II.B of this release, we propose to rescind Form
N-Q and adopt a new portfolio holdings reporting form, Form N-PORT, which would be
filed by all registered management investment companies and unit investment trusts
(“UITs”) that operate as ETFs, 22 other than money market funds and SBICs. 23 We are
proposing that reports on Form N-PORT would be filed with the Commission on a
monthly basis, with every third month available to the public 60 days after the end of the
fund’s fiscal quarter. The reports on Form N-PORT would include a fund’s complete
portfolio holdings in a structured data format. Additionally, as discussed below,
proposed Form N-PORT would include additional information concerning fund portfolio
holdings that are not currently provided on Forms N-Q and N-CSR, but that would
facilitate risk analyses and other Commission oversight. For example, Form N-PORT
would require reporting of additional information relating to derivative investments. It
would also include certain risk metric calculations that would measure a fund’s exposure

20

Rule 30b1-5 under the Investment Company Act [17 CFR 270.30b1-5]. While SBICs file
reports on Form N-CSR, SBICs are not required to file reports on Form N-Q.

21

See rule 30b2-1 under the Investment Company Act [17 CFR 270.30b2-1].

22

Under the proposal, all ETFs would be required to file reports on Form N-PORT, regardless
of whether they are organized as management companies or UITs. UITs are a type of
investment company which (a) are organized under a trust indenture contract of custodianship
or agency or similar instrument, (b) do not have a board of directors, and (c) issue only
redeemable securities. See section 4(2) of the Investment Company Act.

23

Money market funds file reports on Form N-MFP on a monthly basis and, thus, would not be
required to file reports on Form N-PORT.

16

and sensitivity to changing market conditions, such as changes in asset prices, interest
rates, or credit spreads.
We believe that more timely and frequent reporting of portfolio holdings
information, as well as the additional information we are proposing to require, would
enable the Commission to further its mission to protect investors by assisting the
Commission and Commission staff in carrying out its regulatory responsibilities related
to the asset management industry. These responsibilities include its examination,
enforcement, and monitoring of funds, the Commission’s formulation of policy, and the
staff’s review of fund registration statements and disclosures.
While Form N-PORT is primarily designed to assist the Commission and
Commission staff, we believe that information in Form N-PORT would be beneficial to
investors and other potential users. In particular, we believe that both sophisticated
institutional investors and third-party users that provide services to investors may find the
information we propose to require on Form N-PORT useful. For example, Form
N-PORT’s structured format would allow the Commission, investors, and other potential
users to better collect and analyze portfolio holdings information. The portfolio holdings
information currently filed on Form N-Q, in contrast, is filed in a plain text or hypertext
format, which often requires labor-intensive manual reformatting by Commission staff
and other potential users in order to prepare the reported data for analysis. While we do
not anticipate that many individual investors would analyze data using Form N-PORT,
although some may, we believe that individual investors would benefit indirectly from
the information collected on reports on Form N-PORT, through enhanced Commission

17

monitoring and oversight of the fund industry and through analyses prepared by thirdparty service providers.
In addition, we are proposing amendments to Regulation S-X that would require
standardized enhanced derivatives disclosures in fund financial statements, as well as
other amendments. Currently, Regulation S-X does not prescribe specific information for
most types of derivatives, including swaps, futures, and forwards. While we recognize
that many fund groups provide disclosures regarding the terms of their derivatives
contracts, the lack of standard disclosure requirements has resulted in inconsistent
disclosures in fund financial statements.
We believe our proposed amendments to Regulation S-X to enhance and
standardize derivatives disclosures in financial statements would allow comparability
among funds and help all investors better assess funds’ use of derivatives. We are
proposing to require reports on Form N-PORT to contain similar derivatives disclosures
to facilitate analysis of derivatives investments across funds. Because Form N-PORT is
not primarily designed for individual investors, the proposed amendments to Regulation
S-X would require disclosures concerning the fund’s investments in derivatives, as well
as other disclosures related to liquidity and pricing of investments, in the financial
statements that are provided to investors. We have endeavored to mitigate burdens on the
industry by conforming the derivatives disclosures that would be required by both
Regulation S-X and Form N-PORT.
Finally, we are also proposing a rule that would provide funds with an optional
method to satisfy shareholder report transmission requirements by posting such reports
online if they meet certain conditions. In order to rely on the rule, funds would be

18

required to make the report and other required materials publicly accessible and free of
charge at a website address specified in a notice to shareholders, and meet certain
conditions relating to shareholder consent, and notice to shareholders of the website
availability of shareholder reports and of the methods by which shareholders would be
able to request a paper copy of the materials. This optional method is intended to
modernize the manner in which periodic information is transmitted to shareholders,
which we believe would improve the information’s overall accessibility while reducing
burdens such as the costs associated with printing and mailing shareholder reports.
2.

Form N-CEN

Currently, the Commission collects census-type information on management
investment companies and UITs on reports on Form N-SAR. 24 As discussed above,
Form N-SAR was adopted in 1985 and, at that time, was intended to reduce reporting
burdens and better align the information that was required to be reported with the
characteristics of the fund industry. While Commission staff has indicated that the
census-type information reported on Form N-SAR is useful in its support of the
Commission’s regulatory functions, staff has also indicated that in the thirty years since
Form N-SAR’s adoption, changes in the industry have reduced the utility of some of the
currently required data elements. Additionally, the filing format that is required for
reports on Form N-SAR limits our ability to use the reported information for analysis.
Commission staff also believes that obtaining certain additional census-type information

24

See rules 30a-1 and 30b1-1 under the Investment Company Act [17 CFR 270.30a-1 and 17
CFR 270.30b1-1].

19

not currently collected by Form N-SAR would improve the staff’s ability to carry out
regulatory functions, including risk monitoring and analysis of the industry.
Accordingly, we are proposing to rescind Form N-SAR and replace it with Form
N-CEN, a new form on which funds will report census-type information to the
Commission. Form N-CEN would include many of the same data elements as Form
N-SAR, but, in order to improve the quality and utility of information reported, would
replace those items that are outdated or of limited usefulness with items that we believe
to be of greater relevance today. Where possible, we are also proposing to eliminate
items that are reported on other Commission forms, or are available elsewhere. In
addition, we are proposing to require that reports on Form N-CEN be filed in a structured
XML format, which, we believe, could reduce reporting burdens for current Form NSAR filers and yield data that can be used more effectively by the Commission and other
potential users. Finally, we are proposing that reports on new Form N-CEN be filed
annually, rather than semi-annually as is required for reports on Form N-SAR by
management companies, which would further reduce current burdens on funds.
II.

DISCUSSION
A.

Form N-PORT

As discussed above, we are proposing to create a new monthly portfolio reporting
form, Form N-PORT. Our proposal would require registered management investment
companies and ETFs organized as UITs, other than money market funds and SBICs, to
electronically file with the Commission monthly portfolio investments information on
new Form N-PORT in an XML format no later than 30 days after the close of each

20

month. 25 As discussed below in Part II.A.4, only information reported for the third
month of each fund’s fiscal quarter on Form N-PORT would be publicly available, and
that information would not be made public until 60 days after the end of the fiscal
quarter. 26
As the primary regulator of the fund industry, the Commission relies on
information that funds file with us, including their registration statements, shareholder
reports, and various reporting forms such as Form N-SAR, Form N-CSR, and Form N-Q.
The Commission and its staff use this information to understand trends in the fund
industry and carry out regulatory responsibilities, including formulating policy and
guidance, reviewing fund registration statements, and assessing and examining a fund’s
regulatory compliance with the federal securities laws and Commission rules thereunder.
Information on fund portfolios is currently filed with the Commission quarterly
with up to a 70-day delay. 27 Moreover, the reports are currently filed in a format that
does not allow for efficient searches or analyses across portfolios, and even limits the
25

See proposed rule 30b1-9.

26

As used throughout this section, the term “fund” generally refers to investment companies
that would file reports on Form N-PORT.

27

Funds currently file with the Commission portfolio schedules for the fund’s first and third
fiscal quarters on Form N-Q, and shareholder reports, including portfolio schedules for the
fund’s second and fourth fiscal quarters, on Form N-CSR. These reports are available to the
public and the Commission with either a 60- or 70-day delay. See rule 30b1-5 (requiring
management companies, other than SBICs, to file reports on Form N-Q no more than 60 days
after the close of the first and third quarters of each fiscal year); rule 30b2-1 (requiring
management companies to file reports on Form N-CSR no later than 10 days after the
transmission to stockholders of any report required to be transmitted to stockholders under
rule 30e-1). See also rules 30e-1 and 30e-2 under the Investment Company Act [17 CFR
270.30e-1 and 17 CFR 270.30e-2] (requiring management companies and certain UITs to
transmit to stockholders semi-annual reports containing, among other things, the fund’s
portfolio schedules, no more than 60 days after the close of the second and fourth quarters of
each fiscal year). These reports include portfolio holdings information as required by
Regulation S-X. See rule 12-12 of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.12-12], et seq.

21

ability to search or analyze a single portfolio. Based on staff experience with data
analysis of funds, including staff experience using Form N-MFP, we believe that more
frequent and timely information concerning fund portfolios than we currently receive
through registration statements, shareholder reports on Form N-CSR, and reports on
Form N-Q will assist the Commission in its role as the primary regulator of funds, as
discussed further below.
The information we are proposing to collect on Form N-PORT would be
important to the Commission in analyzing and understanding the various risks in a
particular fund, as well as risks across specific types of funds and the fund industry as a
whole. These risks can include the investment risk that the fund is undertaking as part of
its investment strategy, such as interest rate risk, credit risk, volatility risk, other market
risks, or risks associated with specific types of investments, such as emerging market
debt or commodities. Additionally, the information is helpful to understanding liquidity
risks and counterparty risks, and determining whether a fund’s exposure to price
movements is leveraged, either through borrowings or the use of derivatives. We believe
that information we are proposing to require on Form N-PORT will assist the
Commission in better understanding each of these risks in the fund industry. We believe
that the ability to understand the risks that funds face will help our staff better understand
and monitor risks and trends in the fund industry as a whole, facilitating our informed
regulation of the fund industry.
We also believe that information obtained from Form N-PORT filings would
facilitate our oversight of funds and assist Commission staff in examination, enforcement,
and monitoring, as well as in formulating policy and in its review of fund registration

22

statements and disclosures. In this regard, we expect that Commission staff would use
the data reported on Form N-PORT for many of the same purposes as Commission staff
has used data reported on Form N-MFP by money market funds. The data received on
Form N-MFP has been used extensively by Commission staff, including for purposes of
assessing regulatory compliance, identifying funds for examination, and risk monitoring.
Form N-MFP data has also informed Commission policy; for example, staff used Form
N-MFP data in analyses that informed the Commission’s considerations when it proposed
and adopted money market fund reform rules in 2013 and 2014. 28
We recognize that, unlike money market funds, which as cash management
vehicles generally share common investment objectives and strategies and thus invest in a
relatively small number of common security types, other funds invest in a much more
diverse manner. Accordingly, Form N-PORT, as proposed, would require reporting of
additional information relative to Form N-MFP, in order to facilitate understanding and
analysis of the investment strategies that funds pursue, as well as the large variety of
securities, commodities, currencies, derivatives, and other investments that funds may
invest in.
In addition to assisting the Commission in its regulatory functions, we believe that
investors and other potential users could benefit from the periodic public disclosure of the
information reported on Form N-PORT. Proposed Form N-PORT is primarily designed
28

See, e.g., Money Market Fund Reform; Amendments to Form PF, Investment Company Act
Release No. 30551 (June 5, 2013) [78 FR 36834 (June 19, 2013)]; Money Market Fund
Reform 2014 Release, supra note 13 at n.502 and accompanying text (citing use of Form NMFP data in discussing the Commission’s decision to require basis point rounding); and at
n.651 and accompanying text (citing use of Form N-MFP data in discussing the
Commission’s decision regarding the size of the non-government securities basket for
government money market funds).

23

for use by the Commission and its staff, and not for disclosing information directly to
individual investors. This is because the form’s structured format, while needed for
quantitative analysis within a fund and across funds, is not an easily human-readable
format. Additionally, the information we are proposing to require on Form N-PORT is
more voluminous than on a schedule of investments. We believe, however, that some
investors, particularly institutional investors, could directly use the data from the
information on proposed Form N-PORT for their own quantitative analysis of funds,
including to better understand the funds’ investment strategies and risks, and to better
compare funds with similar strategies. Additionally, we believe that entities providing
services to investors, such as investment advisers, broker-dealers, and entities that
provide information and analysis for fund investors, could also utilize and analyze the
information that would be required by proposed Form N-PORT to help all investors make
more informed investment decisions. Accordingly, whether directly or through third
parties, we believe that the periodic public disclosure of the information on proposed
Form N-PORT could benefit all fund investors. As discussed further below, in order to
mitigate the risk that the information on Form N-PORT could be used in ways that might
ultimately result in investor harm, we are proposing to limit the public availability of
Form N-PORT reports to those reports filed as of quarter end, as well as delay public
availability of those reports by 60 days after quarter end.
We intend to increase transparency of fund investments through proposed Form
N-PORT in several ways. First, N-PORT would improve reporting of fund derivative
usage. As the Commission has previously noted, we have observed significant increases
in the use of derivatives by funds, which have highlighted the need for more robust and

24

standardized derivatives disclosures. 29 Additionally, funds that are considered
“alternative” funds, which often use derivatives for implementing their investment
strategy, are becoming increasingly popular among investors. 30 Although Regulation
S-X establishes general disclosure requirements for financial statements in fund
registration statements, based on staff review of fund filings, the lack of standardized
requirements as to the terms of derivatives that must be reported has sometimes led to
inconsistent approaches to reporting derivatives information and, in some cases,
insufficient information concerning the terms and underlying reference assets of
derivatives to allow the Commission or investors to understand the investment. This
hinders both an analysis of a particular fund’s investments, as well as comparability
among funds. 31 The information requested in Form N-PORT would create a more
detailed, uniform, and structured reporting regime. This would allow the Commission
and investors to better analyze and compare funds’ derivatives investments and the
29

See Derivatives Concept Release, supra note 7, at n.7 and accompanying text.

30

While there is no clear definition of “alternative” in the fund industry, an alternative fund is
generally understood to be a fund whose primary investment strategy falls into one or more of
the three following categories: (1) non-traditional asset classes (for example, currencies); (2)
non-traditional strategies (such as long/short equity positions); and/or (3) less liquid assets
(such as private debt).
At the end of December 2014, alternative mutual funds had almost $200 billion in assets.
Although alternative mutual funds only accounted for 1.19% of the mutual fund market as of
December 2014, the almost $20.1 billion of inflows into these funds in 2014 represented
4.3% of the inflows for the entire mutual fund industry in that year. These statistics were
obtained from staff analysis of Morningstar Direct data, and are based on fund categories as
defined by Morningstar.

31

See, e.g., rule 12-13 of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.12-13] (requiring funds to generally
disclose derivatives together with “other” investments); rule 6-03 of Regulation S-X [17 CFR
210.6-03] (applying articles 1-4 of Regulation S-X to investment companies, but not
specifying where derivative disclosures should be made for funds); ASC 815, Disclosures
about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (discussing general derivative
disclosure) (“ASC 815”); ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements (requiring disclosure of
valuation information for major categories of investments) (“ASC 820”). See also Part II.C.

25

exposures they create, which can be important to understanding funds’ investment
strategies, use of leverage, and potential for risk of loss.
Furthermore, as discussed further below, proposed Form N-PORT would require
funds to report certain risk metrics that would provide measurements of a fund’s
exposure to changes in interest rates, credit spreads and asset prices, whether through
investments in debt securities or in derivatives. Financial statement information provides
historical information over a particular time period (e.g., a statement of operations), or
information about values of assets at a particular point in time (e.g., a balance sheet
including, for funds, a schedule of investments). Risk metrics, on the other hand,
measure the change in value of an investment in response to small changes in the
underlying reference asset of an investment, whether the underlying reference asset is a
security (or index of securities), commodity, interest rate, or credit spread over an interest
rate. Based on staff experience, as well as staff outreach to asset managers and entities
that provide risk management services to asset managers, discussed further below, we
believe that fund portfolio managers and risk managers commonly calculate these risk
metrics to analyze the exposures in their portfolios. 32 The Commission believes that staff
can use these risk measures to better understand the exposures in the fund industry,
thereby facilitating better monitoring of risks and trends in the fund industry as a whole.
Form N-PORT would also require information about certain fund activities such
as securities lending, repurchase agreements, and reverse repurchase agreements,
32

See generally John C. Hull, OPTIONS, FUTURES, AND OTHER DERIVATIVES, SEVENTH
EDITION (2009) (discussing, for example, the function of duration, convexity, delta, and other
calculations used for measuring changes in the value of bonds or derivatives as a result in
changes in underlying asset prices or interest rates); Sheldon Natenberg, OPTION VOLATILITY
AND PRICING (1994) (same).

26

including information regarding the counterparties to which the fund is exposed in those
transactions, as well as in over-the-counter derivatives transactions. Such information
would increase transparency concerning these activities and would provide better
information regarding counterparty information, which would be useful in assessing both
individual and multiple fund exposures to a single counterparty. 33
Proposed Form N-PORT also requires information that would assist the
Commission in assessing fund liquidity risk by, for example, requiring funds to provide
information about the market liquidity and pricing of portfolio investments, as well as
information regarding fund flows, which is helpful to understanding the liquidity
pressures a fund might experience due to investor redemption activity.
Finally, as discussed further below, Form N-PORT would be filed electronically
in a structured, XML format. This format would enhance the ability of the Commission,
as well as investors and other potential users, to analyze portfolio data both on a fund-byfund basis and also across funds. As a result, although we are proposing to collect certain
information on Form N-PORT that may be similarly disclosed or reported elsewhere
(e.g., portfolio investments would continue to be included as part of the schedules of
investments contained in shareholder reports, and filed on a semi-annual basis with the
Commission on Form N-CSR), we believe that it is appropriate to also collect this
33

See, e.g., Report by Task Force on Tri-Party Repo Infrastructure, May 17, 2010 (concluding
that insufficient transparency of the tri-party repurchase agreement market contributed to the
build-up of exposures and the lack of prior concerted action to address the issues that led to
financial turmoil during 2007-2009). The Task Force on Tri-Party Repo Infrastructure was
formed in September 2009 under the purview of the Payments Risk Committee, a private
sector body sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Task Force
membership includes representatives from multiple types of market participants that
participate in the tri-party repo market, as well as relevant industry associations. Federal
Reserve and Commission staff participated in meetings of the Task Force as observers and
technical advisors.

27

information in a structured format for analysis by our staff as well as investors and other
potential users.
1.

Who Must File Reports on Form N-PORT

Our proposal would require a report on Form N-PORT to be filed by each
registered management investment company and each ETF organized as a UIT. 34
Registrants offering multiple series would be required to file a report for each series
separately, even if some information is the same for two or more series. Money market
funds and SBICs would not be required to file reports on Form N-PORT. 35
As indicated above, our proposal would require all ETFs to file reports on Form
N-PORT, regardless of their form of organization. Although most ETFs today are
structured as open-end management investment companies, there are several ETFs that
are organized as UITs. 36 ETFs organized as UITs have significant numbers of investors
who we believe could benefit from the disclosures required in Form N-PORT. 37
We request comment on the entities that would be required to file reports on Form
N-PORT.

34

See proposed rule 30b1-9.

35

Money market funds already file their monthly portfolio investments with the Commission.
See Form N-MFP. SBICs are unique investment companies that operate differently than
other management investment companies. They are “privately owned and managed
investment funds, licensed and regulated by [the Small Business Administration (“SBA”)],
that use their own capital plus funds borrowed with an SBA guarantee to make equity and
debt investments in qualifying small businesses.” See SBIC Program Overview available at
https://www.sba.gov/content/sbic-program-overview. As of December 31, 2014, only one
SBIC had publicly offered securities outstanding.

36

There are currently eight ETFs organized as UITs that have registered with the Commission.

37

Commission staff estimates that as of December 2014, ETFs organized as UITs represented
14% of all assets invested in ETFs. This analysis is based on data from Morningstar Direct.

28

•

Should any funds that we are proposing to require to file reports on Form
N-PORT not be required to do so? If so, what types of funds?

•

Should we require SBICs to file reports on Form N-PORT? How useful would
the information reported on Form N-PORT be for investors?

•

Our proposal would allow investors in different types of ETFs to compare their
portfolio investments by means of identical disclosures on reports on Form NPORT, regardless of whether an ETF was organized as an open-end management
investment company or as a UIT. Should ETFs organized as UITs not be required
to file reports on Form N-PORT? If so, why?
2.

Information Required on Form N-PORT

Form N-PORT would require a fund to report certain information about the fund
and the fund’s portfolio investments as of the close of the preceding month, including: (a)
general information about the fund; (b) assets and liabilities; (c) certain portfolio-level
metrics, including certain risk metrics; (d) information regarding securities lending
counterparties; (e) information regarding monthly returns; (f) flow information;
(g) certain information regarding each investment in the portfolio; (h) miscellaneous
securities (if any); (i) explanatory notes (if any), and (j) exhibits. Each of these is
discussed in more detail below.
a.

General Information and Instructions

Part A of Form N-PORT would require general identifying information about the
fund, including the name of the registrant, name of the series, and relevant file numbers. 38

38

See Form N-PORT, Items A.1 and A.2. Funds would provide the name of the registrant, the
Investment Company Act and CIK file numbers for the registrant, and the address and

29

Funds would also report the date of their fiscal year end, the date as of which information
is reported on the form, and indicate if they anticipated that this would be their final filing
on Form N-PORT. 39 This information would be used to identify the registrant and series
filing the report, track the reporting period, and identify final filings.
Additionally, we are proposing that funds provide the Legal Entity Identifier
(“LEI”) number of the registrant and series. 40 The LEI is a unique identifier associated
with a single corporate entity and is intended to provide a uniform international standard
for identifying counterparties to a transaction. 41 Fees are not imposed for the usage of or
access to LEIs, and all of the associated reference data needed to understand, process, and
utilize the LEIs are widely and freely available and not subject to any usage restrictions.
Funds or registrants that have not yet obtained an LEI would be required to obtain one,
which would entail a modest fee. 42 The inclusion of LEI information on Form N-PORT,
however, would facilitate the ability of investors and the Commission to link the data
telephone number of the registrant. Funds would also provide the name of and EDGAR
identifier for the series.
39

See Form N-PORT, Items A.3 and A.4.

40

See Form N-PORT, Items A.1.d and A.2.c. The Commission has begun to require disclosure
of the LEI in other contexts. See, e.g., Form PF Adopting Release, supra note 14; Regulation
SBSR-Reporting and Dissemination of Security-Based Swap Information, Securities
Exchange Act Release No. 74244 (Feb. 11, 2015) [80 FR 14438 (Mar. 19, 2015)]
(“Regulation SBSR Adopting Release”).

41

The global LEI system operates under an LEI Regulatory Oversight Committee (“ROC”) that
currently includes members that are official bodies from over 40 jurisdictions. The
Commission is a member of the ROC and currently serves on its Executive Committee. The
Commission notes that it would expect to revisit the proposed requirement to report LEIs if
the operation of the LEI system were to change significantly.

42

As of December 26, 2014, the cost of obtaining an LEI from the Global Markets Entity
Identifier (“GMEI”) Utility in the United States was $200, plus a $20 surcharge for the LEI
Central Operating Unit. The annual cost of maintaining an LEI from the GMEI Utility was
$100, plus a $20 surcharge for the LEI Central Operating Unit. See
https://www.gmeiutility.org/frequentlyAskedQuestions.jsp.

30

reported on Form N-PORT with data from other filings or sources that is or will be
reported elsewhere as LEIs become more widely used by regulators and the financial
industry. 43
Form N-PORT would also include general filing and reporting instructions, as
well as definitions of specific terms referenced in the form. 44 These instructions and
definitions are intended to provide clarity to funds and to assist them in filing reports on
Form N-PORT. 45
We seek comment on these proposed disclosures and instructions.

Is there any additional or alternative information that should be required to
facilitate identification of funds and analysis of the reported information with
information from other filings or otherwise available elsewhere?

Should the Commission require funds to obtain LEIs? Is it appropriate for the
Commission to require LEIs, which are only available through the global LEI
system? Why or why not? In the case of funds that have not obtained an LEI,
will those funds seek to obtain an LEI in the future absent any regulatory
requirement to do so? In addition to the fees for obtaining and maintaining an
LEI, would there be other costs associated with funds obtaining LEIs? 46

Are there any instructions or definitions that should be revised? If so, how?
Should any instructions or definitions be added to provide additional clarity, or
deleted to avoid confusion with conflicting instructions, definitions, or industry
practices?
b.

Information Regarding Assets and Liabilities.

Part B of proposed Form N-PORT would seek certain portfolio level information
about the fund. Part B would include questions requiring funds to report their total assets,
total liabilities, and net assets. 47 Funds would separately report certain assets and
liabilities, as follows. First, funds would report the aggregate value of any
“miscellaneous securities” held in their portfolios. 48 Currently, Regulation S-X permits

46

See supra note 42 (discussing the costs of obtaining and maintaining an LEI identifier in the
United States). The Commission has further estimated the one-time burden associated with
obtaining an LEI is one hour, with ongoing administration of an LEI corresponding to one
hour per year. See SBSR Adopting Release, supra note 40, at nn. 1109-1111 and
accompanying text.

47

See Form N-PORT, Item B.1.

48

See Form N-PORT, Items B.1.a and B.2.a. As discussed further below, we are proposing that
funds would also report information about miscellaneous securities on an investment-byinvestment basis, although such information would be nonpublic and would be used for
Commission use only. We also request comment below on whether funds should continue to
be permitted to categorize investments as “miscellaneous securities.” See infra note 151 and
accompanying text.

32

funds to report an aggregate amount not exceeding five percent of the total value of the
portfolio investments in one amount as “Miscellaneous securities,” provided that
securities so listed are not restricted, have been held for not more than one year prior to
the date of the related balance sheet, and have not previously been reported by name to
the shareholders, or set forth in any registration statement, application, or annual report or
otherwise made available to the public, and, as discussed further below, we are proposing
the same conditions for Form N-PORT. 49
Funds would also report any assets invested in a controlled foreign corporation for
the purpose of investing in certain types of investments (“controlled foreign corporation”
or “CFC”). 50 Some funds use CFCs for making certain types of investments, particularly
commodities and commodity-linked derivatives, often for tax purposes. Our proposal
would require funds to disclose each underlying investment in a CFC, rather than just the
investment in the CFC itself, which would increase transparency on fund investments
through CFCs. 51 These disclosures would allow investors to look through CFCs and
understand the specific underlying holdings that they are investing in, which would in
turn allow investors to better analyze their fund holdings and risk associated with CFC
investments, and hence enable investors to make more informed investment decisions. In
addition, as discussed further below in Part II.E.4, we believe it would be beneficial for
the Commission to have certain information about funds’ use of CFCs. The information
49

See rule 12-12 of Regulation S-X.

50

See Form N-PORT, Instruction E (providing that “controlled foreign corporation” has the
meaning defined in section 957 of the Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C. 957]) and Item
B.2.b (requiring funds to report assets invested in controlled foreign corporations).

51

See Form N-PORT, Part B Instruction (“Report the following information for the Fund and
its consolidated subsidiaries.”).

33

we are proposing to obtain in Form N-PORT, combined with additional information we
are proposing to require on Form N-CEN regarding CFCs, discussed below, would help
the Commission better monitor funds’ compliance with the Investment Company Act and
assess funds’ use of CFCs, including the extent of their use by reporting of total assets in
CFCs. 52
Second, we are proposing to require that funds report the amount of certain
liabilities, in particular: (1) borrowings attributable to amounts payable for notes
payable, bonds, and similar debt, as reported pursuant to rule 6-04(13)(a) of Regulation
S-X [17 CFR 210.6-04(13)(a)]; (2) payables for investments purchased either (i) on a
delayed delivery, when-delivered, or other firm commitment basis, or (ii) on a standby
commitment basis; and (3) liquidation preference of outstanding preferred stock issued
by the fund. 53 This information would allow Commission staff, as well as investors and
other potential users, to better understand a fund’s borrowing activities and payment
obligations for assets that have been already received, which would facilitate analysis of
the fund’s use of financial leverage, as well as the fund’s liquidity and ability to meet
redemptions, which are important to understanding the risks such borrowings might
create.
We request comment on the reporting of assets and liabilities proposed on Form
N-PORT.
•

As discussed above, our proposal would require funds to disclose each underlying
investment in a CFC. Should we consider modifying the information we propose

52

See infra note 467 and accompanying and following text.

53

See Form N-PORT, Items B.2.c to B.2.e.

34

to require, or require additional information? How commonly do funds invest in
CFCs that in turn invest their assets in underlying investments? Should we
provide instructions to clarify how funds should report investments in this
situation? If so, should the Commission permit funds to disclose only the ultimate
underlying investments, or should the Commission require disclosure of each
layer of investment?
•

Are there other methods of reporting the assets (including assets in CFCs) and
liabilities described above that we should consider?

•

Are there other assets and liabilities that funds should be required to separately
report? If so, why? For example, should the Commission require funds to
separately break out categories of assets and liabilities similar to what is currently
required by Form N-SAR? 54 What would be the costs associated with providing
such information on a monthly basis?
c.

Portfolio Level Risk Metrics

One of the purposes of Form N-PORT is to provide the Commission with
information regarding fund portfolios to help us better monitor trends in the fund industry,
including investment strategies funds are pursuing, the investment risks that funds
undertake, and how different funds might be affected by changes in market conditions.
As discussed above, the Commission uses information from fund filings, including a
54

See Form N-SAR, Item 74 (requiring funds to report consolidated balance sheet data,
including cash, repurchase agreements, debt-securities, preferred stock, common stock,
options, other investments, receivables, other assets, total assets, payables for portfolio
instruments purchased, amounts owed to affiliated persons, senior long-term debt, other
liabilities, senior equity, net assets of common shareholders, number of shares outstanding,
net asset value per share, total number of shareholder accounts, and total value of assets in
segregated accounts).

35

fund’s registration statement and reports on Form N-CSR (which includes the fund’s
shareholder report) and Form N-Q, to inform its understanding and regulation of the fund
industry. Additionally our staff reviews fund disclosures—including registration
statements, shareholder reports, and other documents—both on an ongoing basis as well
as retroactively every three years. 55
The disclosures in a fund’s registration statement about its investment objective,
investment strategies, and risks of investing in the fund, as well as the fund’s financial
statements, are fundamental to understanding a fund’s implementation of its investment
strategies and the risks in the fund. However, the financial statements and narrative
disclosures in fund registration statements and shareholder reports do not always provide
a complete picture of a fund’s exposure to changes in asset prices, particularly as fund
strategies and fund investments become more complex. The financial statements,
including a fund’s schedule of portfolio investments, provide data regarding investments’
values as of the end of the reporting period – a “snapshot” of data at a particular point in
time – or, in the case of the statement of operations, for example, historical data over a
specified time period. By contrast, based on staff experience and outreach to funds, we
understand that funds commonly internally use multiple risk metrics that provide
calculations that measure the change in the value of fund investments assuming a
specified change in the value of underlying assets or, in the case of debt instruments and
derivatives that provide exposure to interest rates and debt instruments, changes in
interest rates or in credit spreads above the risk-free rate.
55

See, e.g., section 408 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107-204, 116 Stat. 745
(2002) (requiring the Commission to engage in enhanced review of periodic disclosures by
certain issuers every three years).

36

Accordingly, we believe it is appropriate to propose requiring funds to report
quantitative measurements of certain risk metrics that would provide information beyond
the narrative, often qualitative disclosures about investment strategies and risks in the
fund’s registration statement, as well as a fund’s historical financial statement disclosures.
Monthly reporting on these risk measures, in particular, would help provide the
Commission with more current information on how funds are implementing their
investment strategies through particular exposures. Receiving this information on a
monthly basis could help the Commission, for example, more efficiently analyze the
potential effects of a market event on funds.
Specifically, we are proposing to require certain funds to provide portfolio level
measures on Form N-PORT that will help Commission staff better understand and
monitor funds’ exposures to changes in interest rates and credit spreads across the yield
curve. As discussed in Part II.A.2.g below, we are also proposing to require risk
measures at the investment level for options and convertible bonds. We believe that the
staff can use these measures, for example, to determine whether additional guidance or
policy measures are appropriate to improve disclosures in order to help investors better
understand how changes in interest rate or credit spreads might affect their investment in
a fund.
Additionally, as we discussed above, we believe that institutional investors, as
well as entities that provide services to both institutional and individual investors, would
be able to use these risk metrics to conduct their own analyses in order to help them
better understand fund composition, investment strategy, and interest rate and credit
spread risk the fund is undertaking. This would complement the risk disclosures that are

37

contained in the registration statement, thereby potentially helping all investors to make
more informed investment choices. We believe that our proposal to require these funds
to publicly disclose these measures quarterly, like other information in the schedule of
investments, will also help provide investors with more specific, quantitative information
regarding the nature of a fund’s exposure to particular asset classes than they do currently.
Providing this more specific and current information through periodic public disclosure
of such risk metrics could be especially important for investors with respect to funds that
continuously offer new shares to the public, because such funds are generally required to
maintain an updated or “evergreen” prospectus that must precede or accompany delivery
of those securities. 56
In particular, for funds that invest in debt instruments, or in derivatives that
provide exposure to debt or debt instruments, we believe it is important for the
Commission staff, investors, and other potential users to have measures that would help
them analyze how portfolio values might change in response to changes in interest rates
or credit spreads. 57 To improve the ability of the Commission staff, investors, and other
potential users to analyze how changes in interest rates and credit spreads might affect a
fund’s portfolio value, we are proposing that a fund that invests in debt instruments, or
derivatives that provide exposure to debt instruments or interest rates, representing at

56

See section 5(b)(2) of the Securities Act.

57

As discussed further below, the Commission also believes that there would be a benefit to
collecting risk measures for derivatives that provide exposure to certain assets, such as
equities and commodities. Due to the nature of these instruments, however, we believe that
such information should be provided on an instrument-by-instrument basis, instead of as a
portfolio level calculation.

38

least 20% of the fund’s notional exposure, provide a portfolio level calculation of
duration and spread duration across the applicable maturities in the fund’s portfolio.
We are proposing to limit this requirement to funds that invest in debt instruments
or derivatives that provide exposure to debt instruments or interest rates that represent at
least 20% of the fund’s notional value as of the reporting date. 58 We are proposing the
20% threshold because we believe that at this level, the Commission would still receive
measurements of duration and spread duration from funds that make investments in debt
instruments as a significant part of their investment strategy, while providing an
appropriate threshold so that funds that do not invest in debt to achieve their investment
strategy would not have to monitor each month whether they trigger the requirement for
making such calculations. Funds that primarily invest in assets other than debt
instruments, such as equities, might have some level of investments in debt instruments
for cash management or other purposes. We do not believe that requiring such funds to
provide monthly calculations of duration or spread duration would be helpful for
understanding such funds’ investment strategy or risk exposures, and we believe that the
20% threshold will provide a de minimis level to relieve the burden of calculating these
measures for such funds. We believe that information would be most useful from funds
58

Specifically, we are proposing to calculate notional value as the sum of the absolute values
of: (i) the value of each debt security, (ii) the notional amount of each swap, including, but
not limited to, total return swaps, interest rate swaps credit default swaps, for which the
underlying reference asset or assets are debt securities or an interest rate; and (iii) the deltaadjusted notional amount of any option for which the underlying reference asset is an asset
described in clause (i) or (ii). See Form N-PORT, Item B.3, Instruction.
The delta-adjusted notional value of options is needed to have an accurate measurement of
the exposure that the option creates to the underlying reference asset. See, e.g., Comment
Letter of Morningstar (Nov. 7, 2011) (“Morningstar Derivatives Concept Release Comment
Letter”) (submitted in response to the Derivatives Concept Release, supra note 7, which
sought comment regarding the use of derivatives by management investment companies).

39

that actually use debt exposures as part of their investment strategy. Based on staff
experience, we believe that such funds have a debt exposure of at least 20%, and
commonly greater than that. As discussed below, we request comment on the proposed
de minimis threshold.
For duration, we are proposing to require that a fund calculate the change in value
in the fund’s portfolio from a 1 basis point change in interest rates (commonly known as
DV01) for each applicable key rate along the risk-free interest rate curve, i.e., 1 month, 3
month, 6 month, 1 year, 2 year, 3 year, 5 year, 7 year, 10 year, 20 year, and 30 year
interest rate, for each applicable currency in the fund. We realize that funds might not
have exposures for every applicable key rate. For example, a short-term bond fund is
unlikely to have debt exposures with longer maturities. Accordingly, a fund would only
report the key rates that are applicable to the fund. Funds would report zero for
maturities to which they have no exposure. 59 For exposures outside of the range of listed
maturities listed on Form N-PORT (i.e., maturities shorter than one month or longer than
30 years), funds would be instructed to include those exposures in the nearest maturity.
We believe that requiring funds to provide further detail about their exposures to
interest rate changes along the risk-free rate curve would provide the Commission with a
better understanding of the risk profiles of funds with different strategies for achieving
debt exposures. For example, funds targeting an effective duration of five years could
achieve that objective in different ways – one fund could invest predominantly in
intermediate-term debt; another fund could create a long position in longer-term bonds,
59

For funds with exposures that fall between any of the listed maturities in the form, funds
would be instructed to use linear interpolation to approximate exposure to each maturity
listed above.

40

matched with a short position in shorter-term bonds. While both funds would have an
intermediate-term duration, the risk profiles of these two funds, that is, their exposures to
changes in long-term and short-term interest rates, are different. Having the proposed
DV01 calculations along the risk-free interest rate curve would clarify this difference.
The Commission staff could use this information to better understand how funds are
achieving their exposures to interest rates, and use this information to perform analysis
across funds with similar strategies to identify outliers for potential further inquiry, as
appropriate.
Additionally, we are proposing to require that the same funds provide a measure
of spread duration (commonly known as SDV01) at the portfolio level for each of the
same maturities listed above, aggregated by non-investment grade and investment grade
exposures. 60 This would measure the fund’s sensitivity to changes in credit spreads, i.e.,
a measure of spread above the risk-free interest rate. This is helpful for analyzing shifts
in credit spreads for non-investment grade and investment grade debt, respectively, over
the yield curve, as credit spreads for investment grade and non-investment grade debt do
not always shift in parallel or in lock step, particularly during times of market stress. 61
Because credit spreads can also vary based on the maturity of the bonds, we believe that

60

Form N-PORT would include instructions stating that “Investment Grade” refers to an
investment that is sufficiently liquid that it can be sold at or near its carrying value within a
reasonably short period of time and is subject to no greater than moderate credit risk, and
“Non-Investment Grade” refers to an investment that is not Investment Grade. See Form
N-PORT, General Instruction E. These instructions are consistent with the definitions of
“Investment Grade” and “Non-Investment Grade” used in Form PF.

61

See, e.g., Frank K. Reilly, David J. Wright, and James A. Gentry, Historic Changes in the
High Yield Bond Market, Journal of Applied Corporate Finance, Volume 21, No. 3, 65-79
(Summer 2009) (discussing the historical performance, including the credit spreads of the
high yield bond market compared to the investment grade bond market).

41

providing credit spread measures for the key rates along the yield curve, as with DV01,
would help the Commission better analyze credit spreads of investments in funds. 62
Again, similar to the example above regarding the potential use of the DV01 metric,
SDV01 can provide more precise information regarding funds’ exposures to credit
spreads when they engage in a strategy investing in investment-grade or non-investment
grade debt.
In determining the methodology for the proposed measures of duration and spread
duration, staff engaged in outreach to asset managers and risk service providers that
provide risk management and other services to asset managers and institutional investors.
The methodology proposed is both based on staff experience in using duration and spread
duration, as well as this outreach to better understand common fund practices for
calculating such measures. The Commission recognizes that particular funds might
currently vary their methodology for calculating duration and spread duration by, for
example, only providing a single measure of duration or spread duration or by only
reporting key rate durations for particular maturities. Based on staff experience and
outreach, the Commission believes that the proposed methodologies for reporting
duration and spread duration will allow for better comparability across funds.
Also, based on outreach, Commission staff believes that service providers that
provide risk management services to funds generally use a “bottom up” approach to
calculating duration and spread duration, meaning that such measures are first calculated

62

The delineation between non-investment grade and investment grade debt is similar to
information regarding private fund exposures gathered on Form PF, which could be helpful
for comparing and analyzing credit spreads between public and private funds. See, e.g., Item
26 of Form PF.

42

at the position level and then aggregated at the portfolio level. Accordingly, we believe
that providing the specific methodology for aggregation of duration and spread duration
would not significantly increase the burden of calculating such metrics by funds, even if
funds analyze such measures at the portfolio level using a methodology different from
what we are proposing. As discussed below, however, we request comment on the
proposed methodologies, including whether such methodologies should be modified.
For both duration and spread duration, we are proposing to require that funds
provide the change in value in the fund’s portfolio from a 1 basis point change in interest
rates or credit spreads, rather than a larger change, such as 5 basis points or 25 basis
points. Based on staff’s outreach, we believe that a 1 basis point change is the
methodology that many funds currently use to calculate these risk measures at the
position level for internal risk monitoring and would provide sufficient information to
assist the Commission in analyzing fund exposures to changes in interest rate or credit
spreads. We believe that requiring funds to calculate such measures based on a larger
basis point change could require more customized calculations, and therefore increase
costs to funds, relative to the approach proposed. We request comment on this aspect of
the proposed methodology.
While the Commission is proposing that funds provide a calculation of each of
these measures at a portfolio level, the Commission has considered whether to propose,
instead, that funds report these risk metrics for each debt instrument or derivative that has
an interest rate or credit exposure. This would provide more precise data for analysis of
various movements in interest rates and credit spreads. Additionally, as discussed above,
the Commission believes that most funds currently calculate these risk metrics at a

43

position level; however, we recognize that even if such calculations are available at a
position level, reporting these metrics could cause funds to make additional systems
changes to collect such position-level data for reporting, as well as potential burdens
related to increased review time and quality control in submitting the reports. Based on
staff’s outreach and staff’s experience, the Commission believes that requiring funds to
provide this information for each maturity at the portfolio level would provide a
sufficient level of granularity for purposes of Commission staff analysis. Finally, we
believe that there would be certain efficiencies for the Commission, investors, and other
potential users to having funds report the portfolio-level calculations relative to reporting
position-level calculations, as this could allow for more timely and efficient analysis of
the data by not requiring the Commission or other potential users to calculate the
portfolio-level measures from the position-level measures. We request comment below
on the relative burdens and benefits of providing portfolio level and position level data.
The Commission also considered whether to require funds to report a portfolio
level measure (or, for the same reasons discussed immediately above in connection with
how risk measures are calculated, position level measures) for convexity, which
facilitates more precise measurement of the change in a bond price with larger changes in
interest rates. 63 We have preliminarily determined not to require reporting of this metric,
however, because we believe, based on staff outreach, that funds more commonly
analyze non-linear changes to interest rates through stress testing, rather than through
calculating convexity. We request comment, however, on whether requiring funds to
63

More specifically, convexity measures the non-linearities in a bond’s price with respect to
changes in interest rates. See Frank J. Fabozzi, THE HANDBOOK OF FIXED INCOME
SECURITIES 149-152 (8th ed. 2012).

44

report a portfolio-level measure of convexity would be useful to the Commission,
investors, and other potential users, and the relative burdens and benefits of reporting
convexity.
We request comment on the proposed requirements to provide risk measures at
the portfolio level.
•

We are proposing a 20% threshold because, based on staff experience, we believe
that this would require funds that use debt and exposure to debt or interest rate
changes as part of their investment strategy to provide those metrics, while
providing a minimum threshold so that funds that invest in debt for cash
management or other purposes unrelated to implementing their investment
strategy would not be required to collect, calculate, or report such data. Given
this objective, is 20% the appropriate threshold for determining which funds must
provide these risk metrics? Should this threshold be lower, such as 5% or 10% or
higher, such as 30% or 35%? Are there alternative methodologies that the
Commission should consider for determining which funds should be required to
provide this information? Should we, instead, base the threshold directly on the
net asset value (“NAV”) of the fund’s debt securities and interest rate
investments, rather than the fund’s notional exposure to debt securities or interest
rates as a percentage of the fund’s NAV?

•

We are proposing to require reporting information on DV01 and SDV01 at the
portfolio level because we believe that this can provide the Commission and
investors with useful information regarding funds’ exposures to changes in
interest rate and credit spreads, without imposing a potential burden that might be

45

involved in providing such risk metrics at a position level. We believe, however,
based on staff outreach that funds or their service providers generally do calculate
such information at a position level. We request comment on the relative burdens
and benefits of requiring funds to report portfolio level calculations of duration
and spread duration, as opposed to providing those for each relevant instrument in
the portfolio. What, if any, would be the added costs and burdens associated with
adapting systems in order to centrally collect and report such information? What
would be the benefits to the Commission, investors, and other potential users to
having more precise information in order to evaluate such exposures?
Conversely, are there benefits to having funds report these measures at the
portfolio level rather than the position level, even if reporting at the position level
would not significantly increase costs?
•

To what extent would the values reported for these risk metrics be affected by the
inputs and assumptions underlying the methodologies by which funds would
calculate these metrics, including assumptions regarding the valuation of the
investments or underlying securities of investments, particularly for investments
that have pre-payment options, such as mortgage-backed securities? Specifically,
how would the comparability of information reported by different funds be
affected if funds used different inputs and assumptions in their methodologies?
Do funds have concerns regarding reporting measures that include such
assumptions, such as proprietary or liability concerns? Are there ways the
Commission could improve the standardization of the calculation of these risk
metrics? If so, how?

46

•

To the extent that funds are calculating such measures using a methodology other
than what the Commission is proposing, what would the associated costs and
other burdens be for funds to calculate and report these measures according to a
different methodology than that typically used by the fund?

•

Are there any alternatives or modifications to the methodologies that the
Commission is proposing that the Commission should consider? 64 For example,
should the Commission require, or permit, funds to report duration and spread
duration only for the maturities that represent the highest exposures in the fund,
such as the top three or the top five (or another quantity)? Should the
Commission require, or permit, funds to report duration and spread duration based
on a larger change in interest rates or credit spreads, such as 5 basis points or 25
basis points? How would these methodologies affect the burden on funds of
reporting duration and credit spread duration? Are there more efficient ways for
the Commission to collect information to increase the transparency of funds’
duration and spread duration?

•

Should we provide a de minimis amount for exposure to different currencies,
under which level a fund would not have to report the DV01 or SDV01 for
exposures in that currency? For example, should we only require funds with
exposure to a currency equal to 5% or more of the fund’s NAV to provide a DV01

64

As discussed further below, we separately propose and request comment on additional and
alternative risk metrics. See, e.g., infra note 127 and accompanying and following text
(proposing that funds report delta for certain derivative contracts), text following note 142
(requesting comment on vega, gamma, and other risk metrics), and Part II.A.4.k (generally
requesting comment on additional risk measures).

47

and SDV01 calculation for such currency? If we were to provide a de miminis,
should the threshold be higher or lower?
d.

Securities Lending

To increase the rate of return on their portfolios, some funds engage in securities
lending activities whereby a fund lends certain of its portfolio securities to other financial
institutions such as broker-dealers. In return for the security lent, funds receive collateral
and sometimes a fee. To protect the fund from the risk of borrower default, the borrower
generally posts collateral with the fund in an amount at least equal to the value of the
borrowed securities, and this amount of collateral is adjusted daily as the value of the
borrowed securities is marked to market. 65 Funds generally receive cash as collateral. A
fund will typically invest cash collateral that it receives in short-term, highly liquid
instruments, such as money market funds or similar pooled investment vehicles, or
directly in money market instruments. 66
The fund’s income from these activities may come from fees paid by the
borrowers to the fund and/or from the reinvestment of collateral. Many funds engage an
external service provider—commonly called a “securities lending agent”—to administer
the securities lending program. The securities lending agent is typically compensated by
65

See Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Master Securities Loan
Agreement (2000 Version) §§4, 9, available at http://www.sifma.org/services/standardforms-and-documentation/. See also Division of Investment Management, Securities and
Exchange Commission, Securities Lending by U.S. Open-End and Closed-End Investment
Companies (“Securities Lending Summary”), available at http://www.sec.gov/divisions/
investment/securities-lending-open-closed-end-investment-companies.htm.

66

Lending funds and borrowers may negotiate the collateral that the borrower posts to the
lender, and a cash collateral fee, commonly called a “rebate,” that the lender pays to the
borrower. The rebate is negotiated and can be negative (i.e., a fee paid from the borrower to
the lender) when demand for the loan of a particular security is especially great or its supply
especially constrained. See id. at §5.

48

being paid a share of the fund’s securities lending revenue after the counterparty has been
paid any rebate due to it. 67
Securities lending implicates certain provisions of the Investment Company Act,
and funds that engage in securities lending do so in reliance on Commission staff noaction letters, and in some circumstances, exemptive orders. 68 These letters and orders
address a number of areas, including loan collateralization and termination, fees and
compensation, board approval and oversight, and voting of proxies.
Currently, the information that funds are required to report about securities
lending activity, whether in a structured format or otherwise, is limited. For example,
funds disclose on Form N-SAR whether they are permitted under their investment
policies to, and whether they did engage during the reporting period in, securities lending
activities. 69 Funds generally also disclose additional information regarding their
securities lending programs in their registration statements. 70 In addition, consistent with
current industry practices, many funds voluntarily identify particular securities that are on
loan in their schedules of portfolio investments prepared pursuant to Regulation S-X.
These requirements do not address other pertinent considerations, such as the extent to
which a fund lends its portfolio securities, the counterparties to which the fund is
67

See Securities Lending Summary, supra note 65.

68

For example, the transfer of a fund’s portfolio securities to a borrower implicates section
17(f) of the Investment Company Act, which generally requires that a fund’s portfolio
securities be held by an eligible custodian. A fund’s obligation to return collateral at the
termination of a loan implicates section 18 of the Investment Company Act, which governs
the extent to which a fund may incur indebtedness. See id.

Item 70.N of Form N-SAR.

70

See, e.g., Form N-1A, Items 9(c) (disclosures regarding risks), 16(b) (disclosures of
investment strategies and risks), 17(f) (disclosures of proxy voting policy), and 28(h)
(exhibits of other material contracts).

exposed, the fees and revenues associated with those activities, and the significance of
securities lending revenue to the investment performance of the fund.
To address these data gaps and provide additional information to the Commission,
investors, and other potential users regarding a fund’s securities lending activities, we are
proposing that funds report certain counterparty information and position-level
information monthly on Form N-PORT. 71 Also, as to other information for which annual
reporting would be sufficient because it is unlikely to change on a frequent basis (e.g.,
name and other identifying information for a fund’s securities lending agent), we are
proposing that funds report this information annually on Form N-CEN as discussed
below in Part II.E. We are also proposing, as discussed below in Part II.C.5, to require
that certain information about the income from and fees paid in connection with
securities lending activities, and the monthly average of the value of portfolio securities
on loan, be disclosed as part of the notes to funds’ financial statements. 72
Our proposals today are intended, in part, to increase the transparency of
information available related to the lending and borrowing of securities with respect to

71

See infra text following note 74 (discussing the reporting of counterparty information); Part
II.A.2.g (discussing the proposed requirements regarding position-level information).
Commenters to the FSOC Notice also suggested that enhanced securities lending disclosures
could be beneficial to investors and counterparties. See, e.g., SIFMA/IAA FSOC Notice
Comment Letter, supra note 43 (“Disclosures related to securities lending practices, if
appropriately tailored, could potentially assist investors and counterparties in making
informed choices about where they deploy their assets and how they engage in lending
practices.”); Comment Letter of the Vanguard Group, Inc. (Mar. 25, 2015) (“Vanguard FSOC
Notice Comment Letter”) (asserting that securities lending as a whole suffers from a lack of
readily available data, and supporting further efforts to gather data and study the practice of
securities lending).

72

See infra text following note 276 (discussing proposed disclosures in the notes to funds’
financial statements that would allow investors to better understand the income generated
from, as well as the expenses associated with, securities lending activities).

funds as a subset of the universe of market participants engaged in securities lending
activities. 73
Counterparty Information. One risk that funds engaging in securities lending are
exposed to is counterparty risk because borrowers could fail to return the loaned
securities. In this event, the lender would keep the collateral. Collateral is generally
posted in cash and, in practice, the loan is generally over-collateralized. The collateral
requirements thereby mitigate the extent of a fund’s counterparty risk. In some cases,
this risk is further mitigated for the fund if the fund’s securities lending agent indemnifies
the fund against default by the borrower.
While we believe there is value to having information concerning securities
lending counterparties to monitor risk, as well as to monitor compliance with conditions
set forth in staff no-action letters and exemptive orders, 74 we are proposing to require that
funds report, for each of their securities lending counterparties as of the reporting date,
the full name and LEI of the counterparty (if any), as well as the aggregate value of all
securities on loan to the counterparty, rather than at the loan level. 75 We believe that
disclosure of counterparty information at an aggregate portfolio level would provide the
Commission and investors with information to better understand the level of potential
counterparty risk assumed as part of the fund’s securities lending program, with a lower
relative burden on funds than requesting such information on a per loan level.
73

See, e.g., section 984(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, Pub. L. No 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010)
(directing the Commission to promulgate rules designed to increase the transparency of
information available to brokers, dealers, and investors, with respect to the loan or borrowing
of securities).

74

See generally Securities Lending Summary, supra note 65.

75

Form N-PORT, Item B.4.

51

We request comment on the portfolio level securities lending information
requirements we are proposing.
•

As discussed above, Form N-PORT would require funds to disclose the aggregate
value of all securities on loan to each securities lending counterparty and the
name and LEI (if any) of the counterparty. Should we instead require funds to
report this information on a loan-by-loan or security-by-security basis? To what
extent, if any, would such information be used by investors and other potential
users? What, if any, additional issues would funds face in tracking and reporting
such information on a loan-by-loan or security-by-security basis? Do funds
currently track or have the ability to readily determine their counterparty exposure
on a loan-by-loan or security-by-security basis? If securities lending counterparty
information should be reported on a loan-by-loan or security-by-security basis, is
there any additional or alternative information we should require funds to report,
such as the rebate or compensation to the securities lending agent?

•

Instead of requiring funds to report the aggregate value of all securities on loan to
each securities lending counterparty, should we limit such disclosures to
counterparties to which the fund has the greatest exposure, such as the top five or
top ten counterparties? 76 Alternately, should we require funds to report aggregate
exposure to a given counterparty only if such exposure constitutes more than a
certain percentage of the NAV of the fund (e.g., one percent)? Would either
approach more appropriately consider the costs of tracking and reporting such

76

Cf. Form PF, Section 1c, Item 22 (requiring advisers to private funds to report exposures to
the five counterparties to which the reporting fund has the greatest mark-to-market net
counterparty credit exposure).

52

information and the benefits that increased transparency would provide to the
Commission and other potential users?
•

Alternately, or in addition, should the Commission request information regarding
other types of counterparty exposures? For example, should the Commission
require funds to report counterparty exposures based on the amount of unsettled
trades with each counterparty? If so, should such information be reported in
terms of aggregate or net exposure, and why?
e.

Return Information

We are proposing to require funds to provide monthly total returns for each of the
preceding three months. 77 If the fund is a multiple class fund, it would report returns for
each class. 78 Funds with multiple classes would also report their class identification
numbers. 79 Funds would calculate returns using the same standardized formulas required
for calculation of returns as reported in the performance table contained in the risk-return
summary of the fund’s prospectus and in fund sales materials. 80
We are proposing to require this information on Form N-PORT because we
believe it would be useful to have such information in a structured format to facilitate
comparisons across funds. For example, analysis of return information over time among
similar funds could reveal outliers that might merit further inquiry by Commission staff.

77

See Form N-PORT, Item B.5.a.

78

See id.

79

See Form N-PORT, Item B.5.b.

80

See Form N-1A, Item 26(b)(1); Form N-2, Item 4, Instruction 13; Form N-3, Item 26(b)(i).

53

Additionally, performance that appears to be inconsistent with a fund’s investment
strategy or other benchmarks can form a basis for further inquiry and monitoring. 81
Because only quarter-end reports on Form N-PORT would be made public, we
are proposing that funds provide return information for each of the preceding three
months. 82 This would provide investors and other potential users with monthly return
information, so that they would have access to each month’s return on a quarterly basis.
Otherwise, we are concerned that investors might potentially confuse the month’s
disclosed return as representing the return for the full quarter.
We are also proposing that funds report, for each of the preceding three months,
monthly net realized gain (or loss) and net change in unrealized appreciation (or
depreciation) attributable to derivatives for each of the following categories: commodity
contracts, credit contracts, equity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, interest rate
contracts, and other derivatives contracts. 83 This item is modeled after disclosure
requirements in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards
Codification (“ASC”) 815, which governs the accounting disclosure for derivatives and
hedging. This information would help the Commission staff, investors, and other
81

Similar risk analytics were used in the Commission’s Aberrational Performance Inquiry, an
initiative by the Division of Enforcement’s Asset Management Unit to identify hedge funds
with suspicious returns. See, e.g., Press Release, SEC Charges Hedge Fund Adviser and Two
Executives with Fraud in Continuing Probe of Suspicious Fund Performance (Oct. 17, 2012),
available at http://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1365171485332.

82

See Form N-PORT, Item B.5.a. Although generally only information reported on Form NPORT for the third month of each fund’s fiscal quarter would be publicly available, the
concerns associated with more frequent public disclosure are related to the disclosure of
portfolio holdings information and would not apply to the disclosure of fund return
information. See generally note 170 and accompanying and following text (discussing the
risks of predatory trading practices such as front-running and the ability of outside investors
to reverse engineer and copycat fund’s investment strategies).

83

See Form N-PORT, Item B.5.c.

54

potential users better understand how a fund is using derivatives in accomplishing its
investment strategy and the impact of derivatives on the fund’s returns. In order to
provide a point of comparison, we are also proposing that funds report, for each of the
last three months, monthly net realized gain (or loss) and net change in unrealized
appreciation (or depreciation) for investments other than derivatives. 84
We request comment on the return information we are proposing in Form
N-PORT.
•

Should the Commission consider, as an alternative, requiring funds to provide
monthly return information annually on Form N-CEN, rather than on Form
N-PORT? Would this significantly reduce the burden of reporting such
information?

•

We are proposing to require that funds report three months of returns so that
investors and other potential users, who would only observe reports on Form
N-PORT on a quarterly basis, would still receive return data for each month of the
year. Do commenters agree that such disclosure of monthly returns would be
helpful to investors? Are there preferable alternatives for providing such
information to investors? Are there potential negative consequences of reporting
monthly returns? For example, could the availability of this information cause
investors to emphasize short-term returns?

84

See Form N-PORT, Item B.5.d. Our proposal would also amend Regulation S-X to require
funds to report similar information in their financial statements, although Regulation S-X
would require such information to be aggregated by type of derivative contract, rather than by
category of exposure as required by Form N-PORT. We discuss below our reasons for
proposing information to be reported based on contract type on Regulation S-X. See infra
Part II.C.

55

•

We request comment on alternative requirements for fund reporting of return
information. For example, the Commission requests comment on whether to
require reporting by funds of gross returns. Would gross information, with or
without accompanying fee information for each class, be confusing for investors?
If so, are there ways to mitigate the risk of investor confusion? Instead of
requiring reporting of returns for all classes, should the Commission, for example,
require funds to report return information for a single class, such as the class with
the highest expense ratio or the largest share class in terms of assets under
management? What would be the relative benefits and burdens of only requiring
disclosure of a single class?

•

Are there alternative methods that the Commission should consider for requiring
funds to report the effect of derivatives on the return of the fund? For example,
should the Commission require that funds report the monthly net realized gain or
loss and net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation attributable to
derivatives by type of derivative (i.e., forward, future, option, swap), rather than
by category of exposure? What would be the burden and benefits of reporting
such information relative to the proposed requirement?
f.

Flow Information

Form N-PORT would require funds to separately report, for each of the preceding
three months, the total net asset value of: (1) shares sold (including exchanges but
excluding reinvestment of dividends and distributions); (2) shares sold in connection with
reinvestments of dividends and distributions; and (3) shares redeemed or repurchased

56

(including exchanges). 85 This information is similar to what is currently reported on
Form N-SAR, and would be generally reported subject to the same guidelines that
currently govern reporting of flow information on that form. 86 We propose to require this
information on Form N-PORT because we believe that this information would be more
helpful if reported on a monthly basis rather than retrospectively on an annual basis on
Form N-CEN.
We believe that having flow information reported to us monthly will help us
better monitor trends in the fund industry. For example, it could help us analyze types of
funds that are becoming more popular among investors and areas of high growth in the
industry. It could help us better examine investor behavior in response to market events.
Finally, in combination with other information reported on Form N-PORT regarding
liquidity of fund positions, it could also help us identify funds that might be at risk of
experiencing liquidity stress due to increased redemptions.
•

What would be the costs and burdens of providing flow information on a monthly
basis on Form N-PORT? Should the Commission consider, as an alternative,

85

See Form N-PORT, Item B.6.

86

Similar to Form N-SAR, Form N-PORT would instruct funds to report amounts after any
front-end sales loads had been deducted and before any deferred or contingent deferred sales
loads or charges had been deducted. Shares sold would include shares sold by the fund to a
registered UIT. Funds would also include as shares sold any transaction in which the fund
acquired the assets of another investment company or of a personal holding company in
exchange for its own shares. Funds would include as shares redeemed any transaction in
which the fund liquidated all or part of its assets. Exchanges would be defined as the
redemption or repurchase of shares of one fund or series and the investment of all or part of
the proceeds in shares of another fund or series in the same family of investment companies.
Cf. Form N-PORT, Item B.6 and Item 28 of Form N-SAR (requiring reporting of monthly
sales and repurchases of the Registrant’s/Series’ shares for the past six months).

57

requiring funds to provide monthly flow information annually on Form N-CEN,
rather than on Form N-PORT?
•

To what extent would the usefulness of the flow information be affected by the
fact that omnibus accounts, which generally have significant amounts of
purchases and redemptions, typically net their transactions prior to executing with
the funds’ transfer agents? Should the Commission revise the proposed flow
disclosures to address this issue and, if so, how?

•

Form N-SAR currently also requires funds to report flow information related to
“other” shares sold (i.e., other than through new sales and exchanges and
reinvestments of dividends and distributions). 87 Should the Commission also
require funds to report this category of flow information on Form N-PORT?
What would be the utility of requesting flow information to be separately reported
in this additional category?

•

Should we require that flow information be reported as to each class of the fund?
Would such additional information be helpful to investors and other potential
users? What would be the burdens to funds with multiple classes of reporting
such information?
g.

Schedule of Portfolio Investments

Part C of proposed Form N-PORT would require funds to report certain
information on an investment-by-investment basis about each investment held by the
fund and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the close of the preceding month. Funds
would respond to certain questions that would apply to all investments (i.e., the
87

See id.

58

investment’s identification, amount, payoff profile, asset and issuer type, country of
investment or issuer, and fair value level, and whether the investment was a restricted
security or illiquid asset). Funds would also respond, if relevant, to additional questions
related to specific types of investments (i.e., debt securities, repurchase and reverse
repurchase agreements, derivatives, and securities lending).
Funds would have the option of identifying any investments that are
“miscellaneous securities.” 88 Unless otherwise indicated, funds would not report
information related to those investments in Part C, but would instead report such
information in Part D. 89
i.

Information for All Investments

Proposed Form N-PORT would require funds to report certain basic information
about each investment. In particular, funds would report the name of the issuer and title
of issue or description of the investment, as they are currently required to do on their
reported schedules of investments. 90
To facilitate analysis of fund portfolios, it is important for Commission staff to be
able to identify individual portfolio securities, as well as the reference instruments of
derivative investments through the use of an identifying code or number, which is not
currently required to be reported on the schedule of investments. Fund shareholders and
potential investors that are analyzing fund portfolios or investments across funds could
similarly benefit from the clear identification of a fund’s portfolio securities across funds.

88

See Form N-PORT, Part D. See also supra note 49 and accompanying text.

89

See infra note 150 and accompanying and following text.

90

See Form N-PORT, Items C.1.a and C.1.c.

59

The staff has found that some securities reported by funds lack a securities identifier, and
this absence has reduced the usefulness of other information reported. 91
To address this issue, we propose to require that funds report additional
information about the issuer and the security. Funds would report certain securities
identifiers, if available. 92 For example, for swaps and security-based swaps, funds could
report the product identification number used for reporting such instrument to a swap
data repository or securities-based swap data repository, if available. 93 If a unique
identifier is reported, funds would also indicate the type of identifier used. 94 Such an
identifier may be internally generated by the fund or provided by a third party, but should
be consistently used across the fund’s filings for reporting that investment so that the
Commission, investors, and other potential users of the information can track the
investment from report to report.
We also propose to require funds to report the amount of each investment as of
the end of the reporting period, as is currently required under Regulation S-X. 95 Funds
would report the number of units or principal amount for each investment, as well as the
value of each investment at the close of the period, and the percentage value of each

91

Our inability to identify specific securities has limited our ability in other contexts to compare
ownership of the securities across multiple funds and monitor issuer exposure. For example,
during the month of February 2013, money market funds reported 6,821 securities without
CUSIPs (approximately 10% of all securities reported on Form N-MFP).

92

See Form N-PORT, Item C.1.b and C.1.d to C.1.e (requiring reporting of identifiers such as
LEI of the issuer, CUSIP, ISIN, ticker or other unique identifier).

93

See infra notes 138-140 (discussing product identifiers for security-based swaps and swaps,
as addressed in rulemakings by the Commission and Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, respectively).

See Form N-PORT, Item C.2. See rule 12-12 of Regulation S-X.

60

investment when compared to the net assets of the fund. 96 Funds would also report the
currency in which the investment was denominated, and, if not denominated in U.S.
dollars, the exchange rate used to calculate value.
Our proposal would also require funds to report the payoff profile of the
investment, indicating whether the investment is held long, short, or N/A, which would
serve the same purpose as the current requirement in Regulation S-X to disclose
investments sold short. 97 Funds would respond N/A for derivatives and would respond to
relevant questions that indicated the payoff profile of each derivative in the derivatives
portion of the form. These disclosures would identify short positions in investments held
by funds.
Funds would also report the asset type for the investment: short-term investment
vehicle (e.g., money market fund, liquidity pool, or other cash management vehicle),
repurchase agreement, equity-common, equity-preferred, debt, derivative-commodity,
derivative-credit, derivative-equity, derivative-foreign exchange, derivative-interest rate,
structured note, loan, ABS-mortgage backed security, ABS-asset backed commercial
paper, ABS-collateralized bond/debt obligation, ABS-other, commodity, real estate,
other) and issuer type (corporate, U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agency, U.S.
government sponsored entity, municipal, non-U.S. sovereign, private fund, registered
fund, other). 98 We have based these categories in part on staff review of how funds
currently categorize investments on their schedule of investments, and in part on the
96

See Form N-PORT, Item C.2.a to C.2.d. For derivatives, as appropriate, funds would provide
the number of contracts.

97

See Form N-PORT, Item C.3. See rule 12-12A of Regulation S-X.

98

See Form N-PORT, Item C.4.a and C.4.b.

61

categories of investments required by private funds under Form PF. 99 These disclosures
would allow the Commission, investors, and other potential users to assess the
composition of fund portfolios in terms of asset and issuer types and also facilitate
comparisons among similar types of investments.
Our proposal would also require funds to report, for each investment, whether the
investment is a restricted security and whether the investment is an illiquid asset. 100
These disclosures would provide investors and the Commission staff with more
information about liquidity risks associated with the fund’s investments.
Each fund would also report whether the investment is categorized by the fund as
a Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 fair value measurement in the fair value hierarchy under
U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”). 101 Commission staff

99

See, e.g., Form PF, Item 26 (requiring filers to report exposures by asset type); Form N-Q,
Item 1 (requiring filers to report the schedules of investments required by sections 210.12-12
to 12-14 of Regulation S-X); Form N-CSR, Item 1 (requiring filers to attach a copy of the
report transmitted to shareholders, which would include schedules of investments required by
sections 210.12-12 to 12-14 of Regulation S-X).

100

See Form N-PORT, Items C.6 and C.7. “Restricted security” would have the definition
provided in rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act [17 CFR 230.144(a)(3)]. See Form NPORT, General Instruction E. See also proposed rule 12-13, nn.6 and 8 of Regulation S-X,
which would require similar disclosures in funds’ schedules of investments to identify
securities that are restricted or illiquid.
Form N-PORT would define “illiquid asset” as “an asset that cannot be sold or disposed of by
the Fund in the ordinary course of business within seven calendar days, at approximately the
value ascribed to it by the Fund.” See Form N-PORT, General Instruction E. This definition
is the same definition used in the liquidity guidance issued by the Commission for open-end
funds. See Revisions of Guidelines to Form N-1A, Investment Company Act Release No.
18612 (Mar. 12, 1992) [57 FR 9829 (Mar. 20, 1992)] (“1992 Release”). As recently stated by
Chair Mary Jo White, the Division of Investment Management is considering a
recommendation that the Commission update liquidity standards for open-end funds and
ETFs, which may result in updated guidance on this issue. See Speech by Securities and
Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White (Dec. 11, 2014), available at
http://www.sec.gov/News/Speech/Detail/Speech/1370543677722.

101

See ASC 820. An investment is categorized in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as
the lowest level input that is significant to its fair value measurement. Level 1 inputs include

62

could use this information to identify and monitor investments that may be more
susceptible to increased valuation risk and identify potential outliers that warrant
additional monitoring or inquiry. 102 In addition, Commission staff would be better able
to identify anomalies in reported data by aggregating all fund investments industry-wide
into the various level categories. Currently, funds are required to evaluate the fair value
level measurement of each investment as part of the fair value level hierarchy disclosure
in their financial statements. 103 We believe that based on this requirement, funds should
have pricing information available to determine the categorization of their portfolio
investments as Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.
Form N-PORT would also require funds to report the country that corresponds to
the country of investment or issuer based on the concentrations of the risk and economic
exposure of the investment. Additionally, funds would be required to report the country
in which the issuer is organized if that is different from the country of risk and economic
exposure. 104

quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical investments in an active market (e.g., active
exchange-traded equity securities). Level 2 inputs include other observable inputs, such as:
(i) quoted prices for similar securities in active markets; (ii) quoted prices for identical or
similar securities in non-active markets; and (iii) pricing models whose inputs are observable
or derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or
other means for substantially the full term of the security. Level 3 inputs are unobservable
inputs. We are proposing amendments to Regulation S-X to require that funds identify level
3 securities in their schedules of investments. See infra Part II.C.3.
102

For a discussion of some of the challenges regulators may face with respect to Level 3
accounting, see, e.g., Konstantin Milbradt, Level 3 Assets: Booking Profits and Concealing
Losses, in 25 Rev. Fin. Stud. 55-95 (2011).

103

ASC 820-10-50-2 requires for each class of assets and liabilities measured at fair value, the
level of the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurements are categorized in
their entirety (Level 1, 2, or 3).

104

See Form N-PORT, Item C.5. Currently, funds are required to report the related industry,
country, or geographic region of the investment in their schedules of investments. As

63

These disclosures would provide the Commission staff and investors with more
information about country-specific exposures associated with the fund’s investments.
Specifically, the Commission believes that providing both the country based on
concentrations of risk and economic exposure and also the country in which the issuer is
organized would assist the Commission, investors, and other potential users in
understanding the country-specific risks associated with such investments. For example,
knowing the country of risk and economic exposure is important for understanding the
effect of such investments in a portfolio when that country might be going through times
of economic or political stress, regardless of whether the investment is issued in a
different country. Knowing the country in which the issuer is organized would be
important information for analyzing the effect of any events that could affect the country
in which the issuer is organized, such as sanctions or monetary controls, as this could
affect the ability of the fund to liquidate the investment.
We request comment on our proposed disclosure requirements.
•

Our proposal would require funds to report certain identifiers for their
investments. Should the Commission include additional specific identifiers in
Form N-PORT, such as the Financial Instrumental Global Identifier (“FIGI”) or
other similar identifier, if available? 105 If so, which identifier or identifiers would
be expected to be reported? Are there any special considerations relating to the

discussed below, we are proposing to amend Regulation S-X to require funds to report the
industry and the country or geographic region of the investment. See infra Part II.C.3.
105

Information about the FIGI is available on the Object Management Group’s website, a notfor-profit technology standards consortium. See generally Object Management Group,
Documents Associated With Financial Industry Global Identifier (FIGI) Version 1.0 – Beta 1,
available at http://www.omg.org/spec/FIGI/1.0/Beta1/.

64

use of any identifiers (e.g., licensing fees associated with certain identifiers, the
prevalence of a particular identifier as adopted by the marketplace, etc.) that could
be addressed through these reporting requirements? If so, how should the
requirements be restructured to address those considerations while still providing
the Commission and investors the necessary identifying information?
•

We request comment on our proposal to require funds to provide other unique
identifiers for investments that do not have ISIN or ticker identifiers. Should the
Commission require, in certain circumstances, specific identifiers to be reported
as other unique identifiers? For example, in the case of security-based swaps,
should the Commission require funds to report unique product identifiers? 106 If
so, why?

•

How, if at all, should we modify our proposed disclosures for the amount of each
investment at the end of the reporting period (as well as the currency in which it is
denominated)? Likewise, should we modify our proposed disclosures for the
payoff profile of each investment and the restricted/illiquid nature of securities?
If so, why?

•

Would our proposed asset and issuer categories allow funds to readily categorize
the investments typically held in fund portfolios? Should we include additional or
alternative categories, and if so why? For example, are there any specific asset
subcategories with sufficiently unique features as to warrant their own asset
category? To the extent that funds currently are not categorizing their

106

See infra note 139 and accompanying and following text.

65

investments as proposed in Form N-PORT, what costs would be associated with
providing such information?
•

Should any of these disclosures be aggregated and reported on a portfolio basis,
rather than at an individual investment level? Alternately, should any of the
proposed portfolio level information be reported on an individual investment
level?

•

We request comment on the incremental burden of reporting this information for
each investment held by the fund, relative to the current burden of reporting the
total value of each class of investments categorized in each level of the fair value
hierarchy, as currently required by U.S. GAAP. Are there other ways in which a
fund could identify and disclose investments that do not have readily available
market quotations or observable inputs as an alternative to disclosing each
investment’s categorization as a Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 measurement?

•

Are there additional items that should be included on Form N-PORT in order to
improve the transparency regarding the liquidity and valuation of investments?
For example, should the Commission require additional disclosure regarding the
fund’s valuation of its investments, such as the primary pricing source used (e.g.,
exchange, broker quote, third-party pricing service, internal fair value), the name
of any third-party pricing source, or whether an independent consultant or
appraiser assisted with development of internal fair value? If so, should such
information be disclosed on an individual security basis? Would such
information increase the transparency of the pricing of thinly traded securities?

66

Would investors benefit from such information and, if so, how? What costs and
burdens would be associated with providing such information?
•

Should the Commission require funds to report both the country in which the
issuer is organized and also the country with the greatest concentrations of risk
and economic exposure of the investments? What is the burden of reporting both
elements, if different? Should the Commission provide specific guidance or
instructions for determining the country with the greatest concentration of risks
and economic exposure? Should funds have the option of reporting more than
one country of economic risk, or a geographic region of economic risk?

•

Should funds not be required to report country codes for U.S. investments?
Would such an exclusion result in reduced burdens for funds that held only
domestic securities? On the other hand, would such an exclusion result in
investor confusion or complicate data validation efforts, by, for example,
rendering it unclear whether an investment with N/A reported for its country code
was a U.S. investment or was instead a foreign investment for which a country
code had not been properly reported?
ii.

Debt Securities

In addition to the information required above, Form N-PORT would require
additional information about each debt security held by the fund in order to gain
transparency into the payment flows and convertibility into equity of such investments, as
such information can be used to better understand the payoff profile and credit risk of
these investments. First, funds would report the maturity date and coupon (reporting

67

annualized rate and indicating whether fixed, floating, variable, or none). 107 Funds would
also indicate whether the security is currently in default, whether interest payments for
the security are in arrears or whether any coupon payments have been legally deferred by
the issuer, as well as whether any portion of the interest is paid in kind. 108
Finally, we are proposing to require additional information for convertible
securities, to indicate whether the conversion is mandatory or contingent. 109 We are also
proposing to require funds to disclose for each convertible security the conversion ratio,
information about the asset into which the debt is convertible, and the delta, which is the
ratio of the change in the value of the option to the change in the value of the asset into
which the debt is convertible. This reflects the sensitivity of the debt’s value to changes
in the price of the asset into which the debt is convertible. The proposed requirement to
provide the delta would also be required for options, as discussed further below, because
convertible securities have optionality. 110 For similar reasons discussed below regarding
options, the Commission believes that providing the delta for convertible securities is
important to understand the extent of both the credit exposure of the debt portion of the
convertible bond as well as the market price exposure relative to the underlying security
into which it can be converted or exchanged.
We request comment on our proposed disclosure requirements for debt securities.

107

See Form N-PORT, Items C.9.a and C.9.b.

108

See Form N-PORT, Items C.9.c to C.9.e.

109

See Form N-PORT, Item C.9.f.

110

See text accompanying and following note 127 (discussing information required for options,
including delta).

68

•

Are there additional or alternative characteristics of debt securities that we should
require to be disclosed to assist the Commission, investors, or other potential
users in understanding the nature and risks of a fund’s debt security investments?
For example, would disclosure of which debt securities are guaranteed, the nature
of such guarantee (e.g., guarantee insurance or letter of credit), and the identity of
the guarantor, be useful to investors? Alternately, or in addition, should the
Commission require disclosure regarding the frequency of coupon payments,
principal payback schedule, priority in security structure (e.g., senior,
subordinated, etc.), embedded options (if any), insurance wrapper (if any), and
whether the debt is secured?

•

We request comment on our proposed disclosure requirements for convertible
securities. With regard to the delta, to what extent would the inputs and
assumptions underlying the methodology by which funds calculate price changes
affect the values reported? Are there liability or other concerns associated with
the reporting of such measures with such inputs and assumptions? How would
the comparability of information reported between funds be affected if funds used
different inputs and assumptions in calculating delta, such as different
assumptions regarding the values of the funds’ portfolios? Are there ways the
Commission could improve the standardization of the calculation of delta? If so,
how? What would the associated costs and other burdens be for funds to calculate
and report these measures according to a different methodology than that typically
used by the fund?

69

iii.

Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements

In addition to the information required above for all investments, Form N-PORT
would require each fund to report additional information for each repurchase and reverse
repurchase agreement held by the fund. The fund would report the category that reflects
the transaction from the perspective of the fund (repurchase, reverse repurchase), whether
the transaction is cleared by a central counterparty—and if so the name of the central
counterparty—or if not the name and LEI (if any) of the over-the-counter counterparty,
repurchase rate, whether the repurchase agreement is tri-party (to distinguish from
bilateral transactions), and the maturity date. 111 Funds would also report the principal
amount and value of collateral, as well as the category of investments that most closely
represents the collateral. 112
These disclosures would enhance the information currently reported regarding
funds’ use of repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements. Information
regarding repurchase agreements would be comparable to similar disclosures currently
required to be made by money market funds on Form N-MFP. The categories used for
reporting collateral would track the categories currently used to report tri-party
repurchase agreement information to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. We
believe that conforming the categories that would be used in Form N-PORT to categories
111

See Form N-PORT, Items C.10.a to C.10.e.

112

See Form N-PORT, Item C.10.f. Funds would report the category of investments that most
closely represents the collateral, selected from among the following (asset-backed securities;
agency collateralized mortgage obligations; agency debentures and agency strips; agency
mortgage-backed securities; private label collateralized mortgage obligations; corporate debt
securities; equities; money market; U.S. Treasuries (including strips); other instrument). If
“other instrument,” funds would also include a brief description, including, if applicable,
whether it is a collateralized debt obligation, municipal debt, whole loan, or international
debt.

70

used in other reporting contexts would ease reporting burdens and enhance
comparability. 113
We request comment on our proposed disclosure requirements above.
•

As discussed above, the reporting requirements contained in Form N-PORT
would be comparable to similar disclosures currently required to be made by
money market funds on Form N-MFP concerning repurchase agreements. Should
we collect different or additional information? For example, should the proposed
reporting requirements be revised to encompass characteristics of bilateral
repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, which are not typically held by
money market funds but we understand are more commonly held by funds that
would be reporting on Form N-PORT? If so, how? Should the categories used
for reporting collateral, which as proposed would track the categories currently
used to report tri-party repurchase agreement information to the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, be revised? If so, how and why?

•

We believe that funds already track the characteristics of their repurchase and
reverse repurchase agreements that we would require to be reported on Form
N-PORT. To the extent this is true, what would be the incremental cost and
burden of reporting such information to the Commission?

113

See Money Market Fund Reform 2014 Release, supra note 13, at nn.1515-1518 and
accompanying text (discussing comment letter stating that the categories used to report
collateral for tri-party repurchase agreements to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
would allow for regular and efficient comparison of current and historical risk factors
regarding repurchase agreements on a standardized basis).

71

•

Are there additional or alternative disclosures that we should require to be
reported to assist investors in understanding counterparty and other risks
associated with the fund’s repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements?
iv.

Derivatives

As discussed above, the current reporting regime for derivatives has led to
inconsistent approaches to reporting derivatives information and, in some cases,
insufficient information concerning the terms and underlying reference assets of
derivatives to allow the Commission or investors to understand the investment.
Additionally, as discussed further below, for options, the Commission believes that it
would be important to have a measurement of “delta,” a measure not reported in the
financial statements or schedule of investments, to better understand the exposure to the
underlying reference asset that the options produce in the portfolio. Currently, the
Commission and investors are sometimes unable to accurately assess funds’ derivatives
investments and the exposures they create, which can be important to understanding
funds' investment strategies, use of leverage, and risk of loss. Our proposal is intended to
increase transparency into funds’ derivatives investments by requiring funds to disclose
certain characteristics and terms of derivative contracts that are important to understand
the payoff profile of a fund’s investment in such contracts, as well as the exposures they
create or hedge in the fund. This would include, for example, exposures to currency
fluctuations, interest rate shifts, prices of the underlying reference asset, and counterparty
credit risk. As discussed further below, we are also amending Regulation S-X to make
similar changes to the reporting regime for derivatives disclosures in fund financial
statements.

72

Consequently, in addition to the information required above for all investments,
Form N-PORT would require additional information about each derivative contract in the
fund’s portfolio. Funds would report the category of derivative that most closely
represents the investment (e.g., forward, future, option, etc.). 114 Funds would also report
the name and LEI (if any) of the counterparty (including a central counterparty). 115 This
identifying information should assist the Commission, investors, and other potential users
in better identifying and monitoring the categories of derivatives held by funds and the
associated counterparty risks. 116
Form N-PORT would also require funds to report terms and conditions of each
derivative investment that are important to understanding the payoff profile of the
derivative. 117 For options and warrants, including options on a derivative (e.g.,

114

See Form N-PORT, Item C.11.a. Funds would report the category of derivative that most
closely represents the investment, selected from among the following (forward, future,
option, swaption, swap, warrant, other). If “other,” funds would provide a brief description.

115

See Form N-PORT, Item C.11.b.

116

Commenters to the FSOC Notice indicated that counterparty data for derivative disclosures is
not often available and discussed the need to have more transparency in this regard. See, e.g.,
Comment Letter of Americans for Financial Reform (Mar. 27, 2015) (“Americans For
Financial Reform FSOC Notice Comment Letter”) (asserting that counterparty data in
derivative disclosures is not often available); Comment Letter of the Systemic Risk Council
(Mar. 25, 2015) (“Systemic Risk Council FSOC Notice Comment Letter”) (discussing the
need to have information about investment vehicles that hold bank liabilities).

117

We are proposing to require similar information on a fund’s schedule of investments. See
Part II.C.2. Commenters to the FSOC Notice were supportive of enhanced derivatives
disclosures. See, e.g., Systemic Risk Council FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 116
(“While most managed funds do not employ leverage to the same degree that banks do, we
encourage regulators to consider carefully whether there are potential improvements to the
current data collection regime (e.g., for registered investment advisers) that would allow
regulators to track the presence and concentration of leverage in the asset management
industry, particularly as it arises from use of derivatives….”); Americans for Financial
Reform FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 116 (stating that regulatory oversight
should include ensuring appropriate transparency of fund positions to both investors and
regulators, asserting that current derivatives disclosure requirements for registered investment
companies “appear very poor,” noting the deficiency of just current accounting values and

73

swaptions), funds would report the type (e.g., put), payoff profile (e.g., written), number
of shares or principal amount of underlying reference instrument per contract, exercise
price or rate, expiration date, and the unrealized appreciation or depreciation of the option
or warrant. 118 Form N-PORT would require funds to provide a description of the
reference instrument, including name of issuer, title of issue, and relevant securities
identifier. 119
We recognize that some derivatives have underlying assets that are indices of
securities or other assets or a “custom basket” of assets, the components of which are not
publicly available. We are proposing requirements to ensure that the Commission,
investors, and other potential users are aware of the components of such indices or
custom baskets. If the reference instrument is an index for which the components are
publicly available on a website and are updated on that website no less frequently than
quarterly, funds would identify the index and provide the index identifier, if any. 120 We

expressing the need for risk and exposure metrics that show the potential losses or gains to
the fund if market prices change, and suggesting that new disclosures should require
derivatives data to be sufficiently granular such that regulators and market participants could
perform their own independent calculations of risk exposure, rather than relying on
aggregated metrics of total risk); Vanguard FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 71
(asserting that regulators would benefit by better understanding how and why mutual funds
use derivatives).
118

See Form N-PORT, Item C.11.c. The type of warrant or option would be selected from
among the following (put or call). The payoff profile of the warrant or option would be
selected from among the following (written or purchased). Funds would respond N/A for
warrants for both type and payoff profile. As discussed above, funds would report the
number of option contracts in Item C.2.a of Form N-PORT. See supra note 96 and
accompanying text.

119

See Form N-PORT, Items C.11.c.iii.2 and C.11.c.iii.3. For the securities identifier, funds
would report, if available, CUSIP of the reference asset, ISIN (if CUSIP is not available),
ticker (if CUSIP and ISIN is not available), or other unique identifier (if CUSIP, ISIN, and
ticker are not available). See also supra note 92 and accompanying and following text.

120

See Form N-PORT, Item C.11.c.iii.2.

74

are proposing to require at least quarterly public disclosure for the components of the
index because it matches the frequency with which funds are currently required and, as
proposed in this release, would continue to be required, to disclose their portfolio
holdings. 121 If the index’s components are not publicly available as provided above, and
the notional amount of the derivative represents 1% or less of the NAV of the fund, the
fund would provide a narrative description of the index. 122 If the index’s components are
not publicly available in that manner, and the notional amount of the derivative represents
more than 1% of the NAV of the fund, the fund would provide the name, identifier,
number of shares or notional amount or contract value as of the trade date (all of which
would be reported as negative for short positions), value, and unrealized appreciation or
depreciation of every component in the index. 123
We are proposing this requirement because we believe that it is important for the
Commission, investors, and other potential users to have transparency into all exposures
to assets that the fund has, regardless of whether the fund directly holds investments in
those assets or chooses to create those exposures through a derivatives contract. 124 We
are proposing the 1% notional amount threshold based on our experience with the
summary schedule of investments, which requires funds to disclose investments for
121

See infra Part II.A.4 (discussing proposed rules concerning the public disclosure of reports on
Form N-PORT).

122

See supra note 120.

123

See id. Short positions in the index, if any, would be reported as negative numbers. The
identifier for each index component would include CUSIP, ISIN (if CUSIP is not available),
ticker (if CUSIP and ISIN are not available), or other identifier (if CUSIP, ISIN, and ticker
are not available. If other identifier is provided, the fund would indicate the type of identifier
used.

124

We are also proposing to modify Regulation S-X to require similar disclosures. See infra Part
II.C.2.a (discussing proposed rule 12-13, n.3 of Regulation S-X).

75

which the value exceeds 1% of the fund’s NAV in that schedule. 125 We believe that,
similar to this threshold in the summary schedule of investments, providing a 1% de
minimis for disclosing the components of a derivative with nonpublic reference assets
considers the need for the Commission, investors, and other potential users to have
transparency into the exposures that derivative contracts create while not requiring
extensive disclosure of multiple components in a non-public index for instruments that
represent a small amount of the fund’s overall value.
If the reference instrument is a derivative, funds would indicate the category of
derivative (e.g., swap) and would provide all information required to be reported on Form
N-PORT for that type of derivative. 126
We are also proposing to require funds to report the delta of the option, which is
the ratio of the change in the value of the option to the change in the value of the
reference instrument. 127 This measure reflects the sensitivity of the option’s value to
changes in the price of the reference instrument. Disclosure of delta for options and
warrants would provide the Commission, investors, and other potential users a more
accurate measure of a fund’s full exposure to the reference instrument than the option’s
notional amount, which we would otherwise not be able to determine. Accordingly,
having the measurement of delta for options is important for the Commission, as well as
investors and other potential users, to measure the impact, on a fund or group of funds

125

See rule 12-12C, n.3 of Regulation S-X.

126

See Form N-PORT, Item C.11.c.iii.1. Funds would report the category of derivative that
most closely represents the investment, selected from among the following (forward, future,
option, swaption, swap, warrant, other). If “other,” funds would provide a brief description.

127

See Form N-PORT, Item C.11.c.vii.

76

that holds options on an asset, of a change in such asset’s price. Also, as the Commission
has previously observed, funds can use options as a form of obtaining a leveraged
position in an underlying reference asset. 128 Having a measurement of exposures created
through this type of leverage can help the Commission, investors, and other potential
users better understand the risks that the fund faces as asset prices change, since the use
of this type of leverage can magnify losses or gains in assets.
For futures and forwards (other than foreign exchange forwards, which share
similarities with foreign exchange swaps and should be reported accordingly as discussed
below), Form N-PORT would require funds to report a description of the reference
instrument, the payoff profile (i.e., long or short), expiration date, aggregate notional
amount or contract value as of the trade date, and unrealized appreciation or
depreciation. 129 The description of the reference instrument would conform to the same
requirements as the description of reference instruments for warrants and options. 130
For foreign exchange forwards and swaps, funds would report the amount and
description of currency sold, amount and description of currency purchased, settlement
date, and unrealized appreciation or depreciation. 131
For swaps (other than foreign exchange swaps), funds would report the
description and terms of payments necessary for a user of financial information to
understand the nature and terms of payments to be paid and received, including, as
applicable: a description of the reference instrument, obligation, or index; financing rate

to be paid or received; floating or fixed rates to be paid and received; and payment
frequency. 132 The description of the reference instrument would conform to the same
requirements as the description of reference instruments for forwards and futures. 133
Funds would also report upfront payments or receipts, unrealized appreciation or
depreciation, termination or maturity date, and notional amount. 134
Finally, for derivatives that do not fall into the categories enumerated in Form
N-PORT, funds would provide a description of information sufficient for a user of
financial information to understand the nature and terms of the investment. This
description would include, as applicable, currency, payment terms, payment rates, call or
put features, exercise price, and a description of the reference instrument, among other
things. 135 The description of the reference instrument would conform to the same
requirements as the description of reference instruments for swaps. 136 Funds would also
report termination or maturity (if any), notional amount(s), unrealized appreciation or
depreciation, and the delta (if applicable). 137 We recognize that new derivative products
will continue to evolve, and thus the disclosures for this category are intended to be
flexible enough to encompass the changing needs and products that may emerge.
We request comment on our proposed disclosure requirements for derivatives.
132

See Form N-PORT, Item C.11.f.i. Funds would separately report the description and terms of
payments to be paid and received. The description of the reference instrument, obligation, or
index would include the information required to be reported for the descriptions of reference
instruments for warrants, options, futures, or forwards.

•

Is there additional or alternative information about derivative contracts that we
should be requiring? Should we modify the information we are proposing to
require for any derivatives contracts? Should other terms and conditions,
categories of derivatives, payoff profiles, or identifiers be included in Form
N-PORT so that all material elements of derivatives contracts can be reported?

•

For options, should funds be required to identify the option exercise type (e.g.,
American, European, Bermudan, Asian, other) or report any additional
information for more exotic option exercise types (e.g., rainbow, barrier,
lookback, etc.)?

•

We recently adopted Regulation SBSR, which will require one of the parties to
security-based swap transactions to report certain information to registered
security-based swaps data repositories or the Commission. 138 The reporting party
will report certain identifying information, including unique product identifiers to
identify each security-based swap, as well as certain primary and secondary trade
information, including the terms of any standardized fixed or floating rate
payments, the frequency of any such payments, and any additional data elements
included in the agreement between the counterparties that are necessary for a
person to determine the market value of the transaction. 139 The Commodities
Futures Trading Commission has engaged in similar efforts with regards to

information for each registered security-based swap transaction to registered security-based
swap data repositories or to the Commission, including unique product identifiers and
transaction identifiers).

See rule 901 of Regulation SBSR [17 CFR 242.901].

79

unique product identifiers that would be reported with regards to swaps. 140 Are
there methods the Commission should consider to harmonize the SBSR reporting
requirements with the proposed reporting requirements on Form N-PORT? For
example, should we consider ways to allow a fund to import the data reported to
swap and security-based swap data repositories automatically into the fund’s
reports on Form N-PORT? How would this affect investors’ ability to analyze
this data for swaps and security-based swaps held by funds? Should we require
funds to report the product identifiers or any other data we are not currently
proposing to require on Form N-PORT that will be required to be reported for
swaps or security-based swaps? If so, why?
•

Proposed Form N-PORT would require funds to list all underlying reference
assets unless the underlying reference asset is an index whose components are
publicly available on a website and are updated on that website no less frequently
than quarterly, in which case funds would identify the index and publisher of the
index, or unless the notional amount of the derivative represents 1% or less of the
NAV of the fund, in which case funds would provide a narrative description of
the index. 141 To the extent such indices are proprietary or subject to licensing
agreements, what would be the effect of this requirement? For example, would
funds incur costs for amending licensing agreements? Would index providers be
willing to amend existing licensing agreements? If not, how would this impact

funds that make such investments and the marketplace of fund options available
to investors generally? Are there other concerns about disclosing the components
of proprietary indices? Should we alter this requirement, and if so how? For
example, should we not require funds to report underlying index components for
derivatives unless the derivative’s notional amount represents at least 5%, or some
other percentage, of the NAV of the fund? Alternatively, should we limit the
required disclosure of index components to the top 50 components and/or
components that represent more than 1% of the index? If the reference asset is a
modified version of an index whose components are publicly available on a
website, for example a version that is customized to exclude certain issuers that
the fund is restricted from owning, would requiring a narrative of those
modifications be preferable to funds and investors rather than requiring each
holding of the modified index to be listed? If so, should such narrative disclosure
be reported in the “explanatory notes” section of Form N-PORT? 142
•

How, if at all, should we modify the proposed requirement to report delta? To
what extent would the inputs and assumptions underlying the methodology by
which funds calculate this measure affect the value reported? Are there potential
liability or other concerns associated with the reporting of such measures
according to such inputs and assumptions? For example, how would the
comparability of information reported between funds be affected if funds used
different inputs and assumptions in their methodologies?

142

See infra note 155 and accompanying and following text.

81

•

Are there additional or alternative metrics that we should consider requiring to be
reported? Would the disclosure of risk metrics such as vega—which measures the
amount that an option contract’s price changes in relation to a 1% change in the
volatility of the underlying asset—or gamma—which measures the sensitivity of
delta in response to price changes in the underlying instrument—enhance the
utility of the derivatives information reported in Form N-PORT? What would be
the costs and burdens to funds and benefits to investors and other potential users
of requiring funds to report such additional or alternative metrics? How would
the comparability of information reported by different funds be affected if funds
used different inputs and assumptions in their methodologies, such as different
assumptions regarding the values of the funds’ portfolios?

We believe that funds already track the characteristics of their derivatives that we
would require to be reported on Form N-PORT. To the extent this is correct,
what would be the incremental cost and burden of reporting such information to
the Commission?

Securities on Loan and Cash Collateral Reinvestment

As discussed above, our proposal would require funds to report on Form
N-PORT, for each of their securities lending counterparties as of the reporting date, the
full name and LEI of the counterparty (if any), as well as the aggregate value of all
securities on loan to the counterparty. 143 We are also proposing that funds report on
Form N-PORT, on an investment-by-investment level, information about securities on
loan and the reinvestment of cash collateral that secures the loans. For each investment
143

See supra note 75 and preceding, accompanying, and following text.

82

held by the fund, a fund would report: (1) whether any portion of the investment was on
loan by the fund, and, if so, the value of the securities on loan; 144 (2) whether any amount
of the investment represented reinvestment of the cash collateral and, if so, the dollar
amount of such reinvestment; 145 and (3) whether any portion of the investment
represented non-cash collateral received to secure loaned securities and, if so, the value
of the securities representing such non-cash collateral. 146
These disclosures would provide information about how funds reinvest the cash
collateral received from securities lending activity and should allow for more accurate
determination of the value of collateral securing such loans. This could improve the
ability of Commission staff, as well as investors, brokers, dealers, and other market
participants to assess collateral reinvestment risks and associated potential liquidity and
loss risks, as well as better understand leverage creation through the reinvestment of
collateral. 147 These disclosures could also help identify those investments that one or
more funds might have to sell or redeem in the event of widespread termination or default
by borrowers. More generally, this information could help to address concerns expressed
by industry participants about the lack of transparency in funds’ securities lending
transactions. 148

lending disclosures could be beneficial to investors and counterparties. See supra note 71.

Sale Roundtable (Sept. 29, 2009), available at http://www.sec.gov/news/openmeetings/

available information to market participants about securities lending transactions).

83

We request comment on our proposed disclosure requirements for securities loans
and cash collateral reinvestment.
•

Should the Commission require funds to report information about securities on
loan or reinvestment of cash collateral at the portfolio level, rather than at the
individual security level? If so, what categories should be used to report such
reinvestment? For example, would it be appropriate to use the same collateral
categories for securities lending that we are proposing to be used for repurchase
and reverse repurchase agreements?

•

As discussed, Form N-PORT would require funds to indicate, for each
investment, whether any portion of the investment represented non-cash collateral
received to secure loaned securities. To what extent would this information be
helpful to brokers, dealers, and investors? To what extent do funds receive
collateral other than cash?

•

Is there additional or alternative information regarding securities lending
transactions that the Commission should require to be disclosed in reports on
Form N-PORT?

•

We believe that funds already track the characteristics of their securities lending
and cash collateral reinvestment transactions that we would require to be reported
on Form N-PORT. Is this belief correct? What would be the burden of reporting
such information to the Commission?

In Part D of Form N-PORT, as currently permitted by Regulation S-X, funds
would have the option of identifying and reporting certain investments as “miscellaneous

84

securities.” 149 Funds electing to separately report miscellaneous securities would use the
same Item numbers and report the same information that would be reported for each
investment if it were not a miscellaneous security. 150 Consistent with the disclosure
regime established by Regulation S-X, all such responses regarding miscellaneous
securities would be nonpublic and would be used for Commission use only,
notwithstanding the fact that all other information reported for the third month of each
fund’s fiscal quarter on Form N-PORT would otherwise be publicly available. 151
Keeping information related to these investments nonpublic may serve to guard against
the premature release of those securities positions and thus deter front-running and other
predatory trading practices, while still allowing the Commission to have a complete
record of the portfolio for monitoring, analysis, and checking for compliance with
Regulation S-X. 152 The only information publicly reported for miscellaneous securities
would be their aggregate value, which would be consistent with current practice as
permitted by Regulation S-X. 153
•

Should funds continue to be allowed to use the category of miscellaneous
securities, either on Form N-PORT or in publicly disclosed schedules of
investments pursuant to instruction 1 to rule 12-12 and instruction 5 to rule 1212C of Regulation S-X? To what extent do funds currently use “miscellaneous

securities” as a line item in their schedule of investments, as opposed to disclosing
all investments in securities of unaffiliated issuers? For what purposes? Should
we continue to allow funds to exclude the full disclosures of such securities from
funds’ schedules of investments? Alternatively, should we consider lowering the
threshold, such as to two percent or one percent of the total value of securities of
unaffiliated issuers?
i.

Explanatory Notes

In Part E of Form N-PORT, funds would have the option of providing explanatory
notes relating to the filing, if any. 154 Any notes provided in public reports on Form
N-PORT (i.e., reports on Form N-PORT for the third month of the fund’s fiscal quarter)
would be publicly available, whereas notes provided in nonpublic filings of Form
N-PORT would remain nonpublic. 155 Funds would also report, as applicable, the Item
number(s) to which the notes are related. 156
These notes, which would be optional, could be used to explain assumptions that
funds made in responding to specific items in Form N-PORT. Funds could also provide
context for anomalous responses or discuss issues that could not be adequately addressed
elsewhere given the constraints of the form. Similar information in other contexts has

See Form N-PORT, Part E. Cf. Form PF, Item 4 (providing advisers to private funds the
option of explaining any assumptions that they made in responding to any questions in the
form).

assisted Commission staff in better understanding the information provided by funds, and
we expect that explanatory notes provided on Form N-PORT would do the same. 157
We request comment on our proposed disclosure requirements.
•

Would the format outlined above for the explanatory notes allow funds to
adequately discuss their responses on Form N-PORT? If not, how should the
format be modified?

•

Should explanatory notes in publicly available filings of Form N-PORT be
nonpublic? If so, why?

Exhibits

In Part F of Form N-PORT, for reports filed for the end of the first and third
quarters of the fund’s fiscal year, a fund would also attach the fund’s complete portfolio
holdings as of the close of the period covered by the report. These portfolio holdings
would be presented in accordance with the schedules set forth in §§210.12-12 to 12-14 of
Regulation S-X.
As discussed further below in Part B, we are proposing to rescind Form N-Q
because reports on Form N-PORT for the first and third fiscal quarters would make
similar reports on Form N-Q unnecessarily duplicative. While we recognize that the
quarterly, publicly disclosed reports on Form N-PORT will provide structured data to
investors and other potential users, we recognize that the amount and structured format of
the data contained in those reports are not primarily designed for individual investors.
We believe that such investors might prefer that portfolio holdings schedules for the first

157

See, e.g., Form N-MFP, Item 43 (“Explanatory notes. Disclose any other information that
may be material to other disclosures related to the portfolio security.”).

87

and third quarters continue to be presented using the form and content specified by
Regulation S-X, which investors are accustomed to viewing in reports on Form N-Q and
in shareholder reports. Therefore, we are proposing to require that, for reports on Form
N-PORT for the first and third quarters of a fund’s fiscal year, the fund would attach its
complete portfolio holdings for that fiscal quarter, presented in accordance with the
schedules set forth in §§210.12-12 to 12-14 of Regulation S-X.
Requiring funds to attach these portfolio holdings schedules to reports on Form
N-PORT would provide the Commission, investors, and other potential users with access
to funds’ current and historical portfolio holdings for those funds’ first and third fiscal
quarters. Our proposal would also consolidate these disclosures in a central location,
together with other fund portfolio holdings disclosures in shareholder reports and reports
on Form N-CSR for funds’ second and fourth fiscal quarters.
Under our proposal, and consistent with current practice, funds would have until
60 days after the end of their second and fourth fiscal quarters to transmit reports to
shareholders containing portfolio holdings schedules prepared in accordance with
Regulation S-X for that reporting period. 158 In contrast, under our proposal, funds would
have 30 days after the end of their first and third fiscal quarters to file reports on Form NPORT that would include portfolio holdings schedules prepared in accordance with
Regulation S-X, although such reports would not be required to be made public until 60
days after the close of the reporting period. Although our proposal would require funds
to prepare Regulation S-X compliant portfolio holdings schedules for their first and third

158

See supra note 27 (discussing current requirements to transmit reports to shareholders); infra
Part II.C (discussing our proposed amendments to Regulation S-X).

88

fiscal quarters 30 days more rapidly than they do currently, we believe that this would be
reasonable given the significant overlap with information that would be required to be
reported on Form N-PORT, and the fact that funds would be required to file reports on
Form N-PORT within 30 days after the end of each month. In addition, the portfolio
schedules attached to Form N-PORT would be neither audited nor certified, which we
believe would significantly reduce the time required for preparation and validation. We
request comment below on the timing of preparing this attachment.
As discussed below, we are proposing to allow funds to transmit reports to
shareholders by posting online those reports, together with the funds’ complete portfolio
holdings for the first and third fiscal quarters presented in accordance with the schedules
set forth in §§210.12-12 to 12-14 of Regulation S-X disclosures. 159 We recognize that
there would be duplication between the portfolio schedules posted online for funds
relying upon proposed rule 30e-3 and the portfolio schedules for funds attached on
reports on Form N-PORT. However, we believe that requiring the Regulation S-X
schedules to be filed as exhibits to Form N-PORT reports would serve the purpose of
making the schedules permanently available on the Commission’s Electronic Data
Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System (“EDGAR”) (even when such schedules are
no longer required to be maintained online pursuant to proposed rule 30e-3).
We request comment on our proposed exhibits.
•

Should funds be required to attach portfolio holdings schedules to reports on
Form N-PORT? Is there an alternative that would be better for funds and

159

See supra Part II.D.3.

89

investors in terms of informing investors’ investment decisions with regards to
current and historical portfolio holdings?
•

As discussed above, the attached portfolio holdings schedules are intended for
investors, but would not be required to be made publicly available to investors
until 60 days after the close of the reporting period; however, as proposed, funds
would be required to prepare and file this attachment within 30 days of the end of
the reporting period. Should funds be allowed to file reports on Form N-PORT
for the first and third fiscal quarters without Regulation S-X compliant schedules,
but then be required to amend those reports on Form N-PORT to attach
Regulation S-X compliant schedules no later than 60 days after the end of the
reporting period?

•

Should the portfolio schedules attached to Form N-PORT, which are similar to
reports funds are providing currently on Form N-Q, be certified, as is currently
required by Form N-Q?

General Request for Comments Regarding the Information on Form
N-PORT

In addition to the requests for comment above, we request general comment on
feasible alternatives to the information we would be requiring funds to report on Form NPORT that would minimize the reporting burdens on funds while maintaining the
anticipated benefits of the reporting and disclosure. 160 We also request comment on the

160

See section 30(c)(2)(A) of the Investment Company Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-29(c)(2)(A)]
(requiring Commission to consider and seek public comment on feasible alternatives to the
required filing of information that minimize reporting burdens on funds).

90

utility of the information proposed to be included in reports to the Commission, investors,
and the public in relation to the costs to funds of providing the reports. 161
•

Would Form N-PORT, as proposed, appropriately consider the usefulness of the
information to the Commission, investors, and other potential users of the
required information and the costs that would be associated with reporting this
information? If not, which data points or items should be enhanced or scaled
back? Are there any proposed items in Form N-PORT that should be revised to
avoid duplication of reporting requirements in different Commission rules or
forms? If so, please explain. On the other hand, are there any elements in Form
N-PORT that the Commission should carry over to other Commission forms or
rules?

•

Are there specific items that the proposed form would require that are
unnecessary or otherwise should not be required in the manner that we propose?
Alternately, is there different or additional information that we have not identified
that could be useful to us or investors in monitoring funds? For example, to the
extent there are fund-specific, sector-specific, or industry-wide risks that would
not be addressed by the information we are proposing to collect today, should we
require additional or alternative information that would be relevant to an
evaluation of the risk characteristics of the fund and its portfolio investments?
Likewise, is there any investment- or entity-specific information that should be
included in Form N-PORT to facilitate analysis of the information that would be

161

See section 30(c)(2)(B) of the Investment Company Act (requiring Commission to consider
and seek public comment on the utility of information, documents and reports to the
Commission in relation to the associated costs).

91

reported? Should the manner in which information would be reported in Form
N-PORT be revised to improve the clarity of disclosures or reduce reporting
burdens?
•

We believe that the information we are proposing to require would be readily
available to funds as a matter of general business practice. Do commenters agree
with this assumption? For example, do fund accounting or financial reporting
systems, or those of a fund’s custodian, generally contain the investment
information that we are requesting in our proposal? What is the feasibility and
burden of requiring funds to report information that is not contained in such
systems? To the extent that any items that we have requested are not contained in
fund accounting or financial reporting systems, are there other types of readily
available data that would provide us with similar information?
3.

Reporting of Information on Form N-PORT

As discussed above, the Commission proposes that funds would report
information on Form N-PORT in XML, so that Commission staff, investors, and other
potential users could create databases of fund portfolio information to be used for data
analysis. Forms N-CSR and N-Q are not currently filed in a structured format, which
results in reports that are comprehensible to a human reader, but are not suitable for
automated processing, and generally require filers to reformat the required information
from the way it is stored for normal business uses. 162 By contrast, requiring that reports
on Form N-PORT be structured would allow the Commission and other potential users to

162

Forms N-CSR and N-Q are required to be filed in HTMA or ASCII/SGML. See rule 301 of
Regulation S-T; EDGAR Filer Manual (Volume II) version 27 (June 2014) at 5-1.

92

combine information from more than one report in an automated way to, for example,
construct a data base of fund portfolio investments without additional formatting. Based
upon our experiences with Forms N-MFP and PF, both of which require filers to report
information in an XML format, we believe that requiring funds to report information on
Form N-PORT in an XML format would provide the information that we seek in the
most timely and cost-effective manner. 163 As discussed further below in the economic
analysis, the XML format may also improve the quality of the information disclosed by
imposing constraints on how the information would be provided, by providing a built-in
validation framework of the data in the reports. 164
•

What would be the costs to funds of providing data conforming to a Form
N-PORT XML Schema? How would costs be affected, if at all, by the size of the
funds and fund complexes reporting this data? How would this affect smaller
fund companies?

•

Should the Commission allow or require the form to be provided in an XML
Schema derived from existing XML based languages, such as Financial products
Markup Language (“FpML”) or XBRL? FpML is an industry standard created by
ISDA for exchanging and reporting the terms and conditions of derivatives
contracts. XBRL is another industry standard used by the Commission for many
reporting forms.

163

We anticipate that the XML interactive data file would be compatible with a wide range of
open source and proprietary information management software applications. Continued
advances in interactive data software, search engines, and other web-based tools may further
enhance the accessibility and usability of the data. See, e.g., Money Market Fund Reform
2010 Release, supra note 13, at n.341.

164

See infra Part IV.B.b.

93

•

Is there another structured format that would allow investors and analysts to easily
download and analyze the data?
The Commission is considering whether reports on Form N-PORT should be

submitted through EDGAR or another electronic filing system, either maintained by the
Commission or by a third-party contractor. If reports on Form N-PORT were required to
be submitted through EDGAR, the electronic filing requirements of Regulation S-T
would apply. 165
We request comment on this aspect of our proposal.
•

Are there specific other capabilities that the Commission should consider in
developing or selecting an electronic filing system? For example, should the
system have the capability to cross-check information reported to other electronic
filing systems, such as the Investment Adviser Registration Depository (where
registration forms for investment advisers are filed)? If so, which platforms and
why?

•

Is EDGAR the optimal vehicle for filing reports on Form N-PORT with the
Commission? If not, what vehicle would be optimal for filing reports and why?
Should the Commission allow the filing of documents in electronic media other
than on EDGAR? If so, please make specific recommendations.

•

Are there any particular concerns with filing such reports on EDGAR as opposed
to a third party system or vice versa? If so, what are those concerns and what are
potential remedies for such concerns? For example, as discussed further below,

165

See generally 17 CFR 232 (governing the electronic submission of documents filed with the
Commission).

94

as proposed, reports on Form N-PORT for the first and second month of each
fiscal quarter would not be made public. Accordingly, any filing would need to
have confidentiality protections to keep the information on such Forms nonpublic. How should EDGAR or an alternative filing platform best address the
confidentiality of this information?
•

How important to investors and other interested parties is the fact that EDGAR
currently serves as the filing system for fund filings with the Commission, and
thus serves as a single repository where investors may examine historical filings
by a given fund on related forms and generally compare reports made by other
funds? To what extent, if at all, could investors become confused by the use of a
new filing system for Form N-PORT and the use of EDGAR for other fund
filings? How should any such investor confusion be mitigated by funds and the
Commission?
Our proposal would require funds to report information on Form N-PORT no later

than 30 days after the close of each month. 166 We request comment on this aspect of our
proposal.
•

Would 30 days be sufficient for funds to gather and report this information to the
Commission? If not, what amount of time would be required and why?
Conversely, could funds easily and reliably gather and report this information in
less than 30 days, which would provide the Commission staff with more timely

166

In contrast, one commenter to the FSOC Notice suggested that funds should report
information to the Commission on a real-time basis. See Comment Letter of Occupy the SEC
to the FSOC Notice (Mar. 25, 2015) (suggesting that asset managers should be required to
provide real-time data, and that the Commission have the capability to monitor all funds’
transactions on a real-time basis).

95

data? 167 If so, what amount of time would be appropriate? To what extent, if at
all, should this determination be affected by the fact that funds would have 60
days to report their schedule of investments in their financial statements prepared
pursuant to Regulation S-X?
As an alternative to monthly reports filed on Form N-PORT, should the Commission
require quarterly reports that include portfolio information for each month of that
quarter? How would the viability of this alternative be affected, if at all, by the
technological challenges and inadvertent disclosure risks associated with combining in a
single form nonpublic portfolio information relating to the first two months of each
quarter with public portfolio information relating to the third month of that quarter? We
note that this alternative would eliminate many of the benefits of monthly reporting, such
as the ability of monthly data to address the staleness of quarterly data and to assist in
monitoring funds by decreasing the delay between reports. However, this alternative
would still provide twelve data points per year, which should improve the Commission
staff’s ability to perform analyses of portfolios, and would discourage various forms of
portfolio manipulation, as discussed above. What, if any, other factors should the
Commission consider in evaluating this alternative?

167

See, e.g., Money Market Fund Reform 2014 Release, supra note 13 (requiring money market
funds to report their holdings and other information to the Commission within five days after
the end of each month).

96

Public Disclosure of Information Reported on Form N-PORT

We are proposing that funds report information on Form N-PORT on a monthly
basis, no later than 30 days after the close of each month. 168 For reasons discussed below,
and consistent with current disclosure practices, only information reported for the third
month of each fund’s fiscal quarter would be publicly available, and such information
would not be made public until 60 days after the end of the third month of the fund’s
fiscal quarter. 169
The quarterly portfolio reports that the Commission currently receives on Forms
N-Q and N-CSR can quickly become stale due to the turnover of portfolio securities and
fluctuations in the values of portfolio investments. Monthly portfolio reporting would
decrease the delay between reports, which should prove useful to the Commission for
fund monitoring, particularly in times of market stress. This would also triple the number
of data points reported to the Commission in a given year, as well as ensure that the
Commission has current information, which should in turn enhance the ability of
Commission staff to perform analyses of funds in the course of monitoring for industry
trends, or identifying issues for examination or inquiry.
As discussed above, the Commission generally believes that public availability of
information, including the types of information that would be collected on Form N-PORT
168

Commission staff understands that certain funds currently report their investments to
shareholders as of the last business day of the reporting period, while other funds report their
investments as of the last calendar day of the reporting period. In recognition of this fact, and
in an effort to avoid disruptions to current fund operations, the information reported on Form
N-PORT may reflect the fund’s investments as of the last business day, or last calendar day,
of the month for which the report is filed.

169

As discussed above, portfolio schedules are currently available to the public in reports that
are mailed to shareholders or filed with the Commission either 60 or 70 days following the
end of each reporting period. See supra note 27 and accompanying text.

97

that may not currently be reported or disclosed by funds, can benefit investors by
assisting them in making more informed investment decisions. Although Form N-PORT
is not primarily designed for disclosing information to individual investors, we believe
that many investors, particularly institutional investors, as well as academic researchers,
financial analysts, and economic research firms, could use the information reported on
Form N-PORT to evaluate fund portfolios and assess the potential for returns and risks of
a particular fund. Accordingly, whether directly or through third parties, we believe that
the periodic public disclosure of the information on proposed Form N-PORT could
benefit all fund investors.
The Commission, however, recognizes that more frequent portfolio disclosure
could potentially harm fund shareholders by expanding the opportunities for professional
traders to exploit this information by engaging in predatory trading practices, such as
trading ahead of funds, often called “front-running.” 170 Similarly, the Commission is
sensitive to concerns that more frequent portfolio disclosure may facilitate the ability of
outside investors to “free ride” on a mutual fund’s investment research, by allowing those
investors to reverse engineer and “copycat” the fund’s investment strategies and obtain
for free the benefits of fund research and investment strategies that are paid for by fund
shareholders. 171 Both front-running and copycatting can reduce the returns of
shareholders who invest in actively managed funds. 172
170

See, e.g., Quarterly Portfolio Holdings Adopting Release, supra note 19, at n.128 and
accompanying text.

171

See, e.g., id. at n.129 and accompanying text.

172

See The Potential Effects of More Frequent Portfolio Disclosure on Mutual Fund
Performance, 7 Investment Company Institute Perspective No. 3 (June 2001), available at
http://www.ici.org/pdf/per07-03.pdf (“Potential Effects of More Frequent Disclosure”).

98

We discussed these concerns when we first proposed and adopted Form N-MFP,
and made the determination to make each monthly report on Form N-MFP public, with a
60 day delay. 173 In that release, however, we noted that, due to the short-term and
restricted nature of money market fund securities, and because shares of money market
funds are ordinarily purchased and redeemed at a stable share price, we believed
opportunities for such activities were curtailed. 174 By contrast, funds other than money
market funds can pursue a variety of investment strategies and invest in a variety of
securities and other investments. Accordingly, we do not believe that the factors that
mitigated our concerns about the potential for front running or free-riding in money
market funds are as equally applicable to mutual funds.
Empirical studies indicate that the portfolio holdings information that investment
companies disclose to the Commission and to shareholders contains information that can
be used by other investors to front-run and copycat the positions of reporting funds. 175
Based on these studies, as well as experience and discussions with fund groups and
market participants, the Commission is sensitive to the possibility that increasing the
frequency of public portfolio disclosures to a monthly basis could further enable others to
discern trading strategies of the funds, potentially subjecting registered investment
companies to such predatory trading practices, resulting in competitive harms to the fund
and its investors.
173

See Money Market Fund Reform 2010 Release, supra note 13 (adopting Form N-MFP with a
60 day delay for public disclosure). In 2014, the Commission eliminated the 60 day delay in
the public disclosure of Form N-MFP. See Money Market Fund Reform 2014 Release, supra
note 13.

174

See Money Market Fund Reform 2010 Release, supra note 13, at text following n.573.

175

See infra notes 663-667 and accompanying and following text.

99

We recognize that some free-riding and front running activity can occur even with
quarterly disclosure, with the potential for investor harm. Conversely, however, investors
previously petitioned for quarterly disclosures, noting numerous benefits that quarterly
disclosure of portfolio schedules could provide, including allowing investors to better
monitor the extent to which their funds’ portfolios overlap, and hence enabling investors
to make more informed asset allocation decisions, and providing investors with greater
information about how a fund is complying with its stated investment objective. 176 The
Commission cited many of these benefits when it adopted Form N-Q, and based on staff
experience and outreach, believes that the current practice of quarterly portfolio
disclosures provides benefits to investors, notwithstanding the opportunities for frontrunning and reverse engineering it might create.
Our proposal is intended to appropriately consider the benefits to the
Commission, investors, and other potential users of public portfolio disclosures,
including the reporting of such disclosures in a structured format and additional portfolio
information that would be required on proposed Form N-PORT and the potential costs
associated with making that information available to the public, which could be
ultimately borne by investors. Accordingly, in an attempt to minimize these potential

176

See Quarterly Portfolio Holdings Adopting Release, supra note 19, at n.32 and accompanying
text (discussing prior investor petitions for rulemaking). Investors that petitioned for
quarterly disclosure also argued that increasing the frequency of portfolio disclosure would
expose ‘‘style drift’’ (when the actual portfolio holdings of a fund deviate from its stated
investment objective) and shed light on and prevent several potential forms of portfolio
manipulation, such as ‘‘window dressing’’ (buying or selling portfolio securities shortly
before the date as of which a fund’s holdings are publicly disclosed, in order to convey an
impression that the manager has been investing in companies that have had exceptional
performance during the reporting period) and ‘‘portfolio pumping’’ (buying shares of stock
the fund already owns on the last day of the reporting period, in order to drive up the price of
the stocks and inflate the fund’s performance results).

100

costs and harms, we propose to require public disclosure of fund reports on Form NPORT once each quarter, rather than monthly, thereby maintaining the status quo
regarding the frequency of public portfolio disclosure. As discussed above, funds are
currently required to disclose their portfolio investments quarterly, via public filings with
the Commission and semi-annual reports distributed to shareholders. Consequently, the
Commission is not currently proposing to make public the information reported for the
first and second months of each fund’s fiscal quarter on Form N-PORT. Only
information reported for the third month of each fund’s fiscal quarter on Form N-PORT
would be made publicly available, and such information would not be made public until
60 days after the end of the third month of the fund’s fiscal quarter. We believe that
maintaining the status quo with regard to the frequency and the time lag of portfolio
reporting would allow the Commission, the fund industry, and the marketplace to assess
the impact of the structured and more detailed data reported on Form N-PORT on the mix
of information available to the public, and the extent to which these changes might affect
the potential for predatory trading, before determining whether more frequent or more
timely public disclosure would be, beneficial to investors in funds.
We are proposing to maintain the status quo of public disclosure of quarterly
information based upon each fund’s fiscal quarters, rather than calendar quarters, to
ensure that public disclosure of information filed on Form N-PORT would be the same as
the portfolio disclosures reported on a semi-annual fiscal year basis on Form N-CSR. We
believe that such overlap would minimize the risks of predatory trading, because
otherwise funds with fiscal year-ends that fall other than on a calendar quarter- or yearend would have their portfolios publicly available more frequently than funds with fiscal

101

year-ends that fall on a calendar quarter- or year-end, thus increasing the risks to those
funds discussed above related to potential front-running or reverse engineering.
We request comment on the proposed frequency and delay of public disclosure of
information reported on Form N-PORT.
•

Should we require information on Form N-PORT reported for the first and second
month of each fund’s fiscal quarter be made public? Are the concerns about
front-running or other possible harms discussed above warranted given the 60-day
delay? Would a different combination of public disclosure frequency and delay
better protect funds and their investors from the risks of predatory trading, while
still providing timely and regular information to investors? To what extent would
investors benefit from receiving monthly data as opposed to quarterly data?

•

Are there alternatives we should consider to provide investors and other potential
users with the information reported on Form N-PORT for the first and second
months of each quarter? For example, would the potential harms discussed above
be mitigated if reports on Form N-PORT for the first and second months were
made public 60 days (or a shorter or longer time period) after the end of each
quarter, or 60 days (or a shorter or longer time period) after the end of each fund’s
fiscal year, thereby increasing the time lag of such information? If monthly
information were to be provided quarterly or annually, how would that affect the
benefits of such information to investors and other potential users?

•

Would Form N-PORT contain the type of information that, if disclosed on a
monthly basis, could reveal information that a fund would consider proprietary or

102

confidential or that could place the fund at a competitive disadvantage? If so,
please explain and provide examples, as applicable.
•

Would restricting public disclosure of the information reported on Form N-PORT
to information reported for the third month of each fund’s fiscal quarter alleviate
concerns about front-running or other possible harms that might be caused by
making the monthly information reported on Form N-PORT public? Should we
instead provide that all or a portion of the requested information on Form NPORT be submitted in nonpublic reports to the Commission? If so, please
identify the specific items that should remain nonpublic and explain why.

•

Do commenters believe that our proposed 60-day delay in making the information
public would be helpful in protecting against possible front running or free riding?
Would a shorter delay (e.g., 45 or 30 days) or a longer delay (e.g., 70 days) be
more appropriate? If so, why? For example, should we provide for a longer
delay to prevent investors other than shareholders from trading along with the
fund, to the possible detriment of the fund and its shareholders? Alternately,
would a shorter delay, for example 30 days, better serve the needs of shareholders
and potential fund investors while still appropriately protecting the interests of
funds?

•

Should information be reported on Form N-PORT as of the third month of each
fund’s fiscal year, as proposed, or should we instead require a uniform public
reporting schedule for all funds to facilitate comparison of information reported
on Form N-PORT (e.g., March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31)?
To what extent would a uniform public disclosure schedule increase burdens to

103

funds, given that one of the purposes for selecting fiscal year-ends that vary from
calendar year-ends is to spread out filing burdens throughout the year for fund
complexes?
B.

Rescission of Form N-Q and Amendments to Certification
Requirements of Form N-CSR

1.

Rescission of Form N-Q

Along with our proposal to adopt new Form N-PORT, we are proposing to
rescind Form N-Q. Management companies other than SBICs are currently required to
report their complete portfolio holdings as of the end of their first and third fiscal quarters
on Form N-Q. Because the data reported on proposed Form N-PORT would include the
portfolio holdings information contained in reports on Form N-Q, we believe that Form
N-PORT, if adopted, would render reports on Form N-Q unnecessarily duplicative.
Therefore, we believe it is appropriate to rescind Form N-Q rather than require funds to
report similar information to the Commission on two separate forms.
However, as noted earlier, we believe that individual investors and other potential
users might prefer that portfolio holdings schedules for the first and third quarters
continue to be presented using the form and content specified by Regulation S-X, which
investors are accustomed to viewing in reports on Form N-Q and in shareholder reports.
Therefore, we are proposing to require that, for reports on Form N-PORT for the first and
third quarters of a fund’s fiscal year, the fund would attach its complete portfolio
holdings for that fiscal quarter, presented in accordance with the schedules set forth in
§§210.12-12 to 12-14 of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.12-12 – 12-14]. Also, as
discussed below, proposed new rule 30e-3 would allow funds to satisfy requirements to

104

transmit reports to shareholders by posting on a website those shareholder reports and
these same portfolio schedules for the funds’ first and third quarters. 177

Amendments to Certification Requirements of Form N-CSR

In connection with the Commission’s implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002, Form N-Q and Form N-CSR require the principal executive and financial
officers of the fund to make quarterly certifications relating to (1) the accuracy of
information reported to the Commission, and (2) disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting. 178 Rescission of Form N-Q would eliminate
certifications as to the accuracy of the portfolio schedules reported for the first and third
fiscal quarters.
Under today’s proposal, the certifications as to the accuracy of the portfolio
schedules reported for the second and fourth fiscal quarters on Form N-CSR would
remain. However, we are proposing to amend the form of certification in Form N-CSR
to require each certifying officer to state that he or she has disclosed in the report any
change in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
most recent fiscal half-year, rather than the registrant’s most recent fiscal quarter as
currently required by the form. 179 Lengthening the look-back of this certification to six
months, so that the certifications on Form N-CSR for the semi-annual and annual reports

See infra Part II.D.

See Item 3 of Form N-Q (certification requirement); Form N-Q Adopting Release, supra note

the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Investment Company Act Release No. 24914 (Jan. 27,

would cover the first and second fiscal quarters and third and fourth fiscal quarters,
respectively, would fill the gap in certification coverage that would otherwise occur once
Form N-Q is rescinded. To the extent that certifications improve the accuracy of the data
reported, removing such certifications could have negative effects on the quality of the
data reported. Likewise, if the reduced frequency of the certifications affects the process
by which controls and procedures are assessed, requiring such certifications semiannually rather than quarterly could reduce the effectiveness of the fund’s disclosure
controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are assessed.
However, we expect such effects, if any, to be minimal because certifying officers would
continue to certify portfolio holdings for the fund’s second and fourth fiscal quarters and
would further provide semi-annual certifications concerning disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting that would cover the entire year.

Request for Comment

We request comments on the proposed rescission of Form N-Q and related rule
and form amendments.
•

Should we rescind Form N-Q, as we have proposed? Should we instead retain
Form N-Q, and not require Regulation S-X compliant schedules to be attached to
reports for the first and third fiscal quarters on Form N-PORT? Why or why not?

•

Would the proposed amendments to the certification requirements in Form
N-CSR be an appropriate substitute for the certification requirements in Form
N-Q? Would the change from quarterly to semiannual certifications have an
effect on the quality of funds’ internal controls or on other costs associated with
certifications? If so, are those changes appropriate?

Amendments to Regulation S-X

1.

Overview

As part of our larger effort to modernize the manner in which funds report
holdings information to investors, today we are proposing amendments to Regulation SX, which prescribes the form and content of financial statements required in registration
statements and shareholder reports. 180 As discussed above, many of the proposed
amendments to Regulation S-X, particularly the amendments to the disclosures
concerning derivative contracts, are similar to the proposed requirements concerning
disclosures of derivatives that would be required on reports on proposed Form N-PORT.
The proposed amendments to Regulation S-X would, among other things, require similar
disclosures in a fund’s financial statements in its shareholder reports and, as applicable,
website disclosures in order to provide investors, particularly individual investors, with
clear and consistent disclosures across funds concerning fund investments in derivatives
in a human-readable format, as opposed to the structured format of proposed Form NPORT.
As outlined below, we are proposing amendments to Articles 6 and 12 of
Regulation S-X that would: (1) require new, standardized disclosures regarding fund
holdings in open futures contracts, open forward foreign currency contracts, and open

180

See rule 1-01, et seq of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.1-01, et seq]. While “funds” are defined
in the preamble as registered investment companies other than face amount certificate
companies and any separate series thereof—i.e., management companies and UITs—we note
that our proposed amendments to Regulation S-X apply to both registered investment
companies and BDCs. See infra notes 264 and 265. Therefore, throughout this section, when
discussing fund reporting requirements in the context of our proposed amendments to
Regulation S-X, we are also including changes to the reporting requirements for BDCs.

107

swap contracts, 181 and additional disclosures regarding fund holdings of written and
purchased option contracts; (2) update the disclosures for other investments, as well as
reorganize the order in which some investments are presented; and (3) amend the rules
regarding the general form and content of fund financial statements. Our amendments
would also require prominent placement of disclosures regarding investments in
derivatives in a fund’s financial statements, rather than allowing such schedules to be
placed in the notes to the financial statements. Finally, our amendments would require a
new disclosure in the notes to the financial statements relating to a fund’s securities
lending activities.
As discussed above, the proposed rules will renumber the current schedules in
Article 12 of Regulation S-X and break out the disclosure of derivatives currently
reported on Schedule 12-13 into separate schedules. These changes are summarized in
Figure 1, below.

181

We recognize that under the federal securities laws, certain derivatives fall under the
definition of securities notwithstanding, for purposes of our proposals to Regulation S-X, we
expect funds to adhere to the requirements of the disclosure schedules for the relevant
derivative investment, regardless of how it would be defined under the federal securities laws.
See, e.g., proposed rule 12-13C of Regulation S-X (Open swap contracts).

We believe the proposed amendments will assist comparability among funds, and
increase transparency for investors regarding a fund’s use of derivatives and the liquidity
of certain investments. We have endeavored to mitigate burdens on the industry by
proposing to require similar disclosures both on Form N-PORT and in a fund’s financial
statements. 182 As a further consideration, we believe that the amendments we are
proposing today are generally consistent with how many funds are currently reporting
investments (including derivatives), and other information according to current industry
practices.

Enhanced Derivatives Disclosures

In 2011, as part of a wider effort to review the use of derivatives by management
investment companies, we issued a concept release and request for comment on a range
182

See discussion supra Part II.A.2.g.iv.

109

of issues. 183 We received comment letters from a variety of stakeholders, including
investors, fund groups, and third-party users of the information, who commented on a
number of issues. Several commenters noted that holdings of derivative investments are
not currently reported by funds in a consistent manner. 184 Commenters also suggested
that more disclosure on underlying risks was necessary, including more information on
counterparty exposure and reporting relating to the notional amount of certain
derivatives. 185 Another commenter specifically requested that we revise Regulation S-X

183

184

Comments submitted in response to the Derivatives Concept Release are available at
http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-33-11/s73311.shtml. See Morningstar Derivatives Concept
Release Comment Letter, supra note 58 (“This is because fund companies are not reporting
derivative holdings in a consistent manner and are not reporting derivative holdings in a
manner that identifies the underlying risk exposure.”); Comment Letter of Rydex|SGI (Nov.
7, 2011) (“Rydex|SGI Derivatives Concept Release Comment Letter”) (“However, the quality
and extent of such derivatives disclosure still varies greatly from registrant to registrant.”).
Commenters to the FSOC Notice made similar observations. See, e.g., Americans for
Financial Reform FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra note 116 (“While full position-level
data on securities portfolios is available periodically for registered funds, current derivatives
disclosure requirements appear very poor.”); Systematic Risk Council FSOC Notice
Comment Letter, supra note 116 (“While most managed funds do not employ leverage to the
same degree that banks do, we encourage regulators to consider carefully whether there are
potential improvements to the current data collection regime [] that would allow regulators to
track the presence and concentrations of leverage in the asset management industry,
particularly as it arises from the use of derivatives . . . .”).

See Morningstar Derivatives Concept Release Comment Letter, supra note 58 (“Notional
exposure ... is a better measure of risk”); Comment Letter of Oppenheimer Funds to
Derivatives Concept Release (Nov. 7, 2011) (“Instead, counterparty risks incurred through

primarily disclosure based.”); Rydex|SGI Derivatives Concept Release Comment Letter,
supra note 184 (recommending that funds that invest in derivatives should disclose notional
exposure for non-exchanged traded derivatives and a fund’s exposure to counterparties).
Commenters to the FSOC Notice made similar observations relating to counterparty
disclosures. See, e.g., Americans for Financial Reform FSOC Notice Comment Letter, supra
note 116 (“Counterparty data is also often not available.”); Systematic Risk Council
Comment Letter, supra note 116 (discussing the need to have information about investment
vehicles that hold bank liabilities).

110

in order to keep “financial reporting current with developments in the financial
markets.” 186
While the rules under Regulation S-X establish general requirements for portfolio
holdings disclosures in fund financial statements, they do not prescribe standardized
information to be included for derivative instruments other than options. Currently, rule
12-13 of Regulation S-X (Investments other than securities) requires limited information
on the fund’s investments other than securities – that is, the investments not disclosed
under rules 12-12, 12-12A, 12-12B, and 12-14. 187 Thus, under Regulation S-X, a fund’s
disclosures of open futures contracts, open forward foreign currency contracts, and open
swap contracts are generally reported in accordance with rule 12-13.
To address issues of inconsistent disclosures and lack of transparency as to
derivative instruments, we are proposing to amend Regulation S-X by proposing new
schedules for open futures contracts, open forward foreign currency contracts, and open
swap contracts. We are also proposing to modify the current disclosure requirements for
purchased and written option contracts. Finally, we are proposing to include certain
instructions regarding the presentation of derivatives contracts that are generally
consistent with instructions that are currently included, or that we are proposing to add, in
either rule 12-12 (Investments in securities of unaffiliated issuers) or rule 12-13
(Investments other than securities). 188

186

Comment Letter of Stephen A. Keen to Derivatives Concept Release (Nov. 8, 2011).

187

The schedule to rule 12-13 requires disclosure of: (1) description; (2) balance held at close of
period – quantity; and (3) value of each item at close of period. See rule 12-13 of Regulation
S-X.

188

See, e.g., proposed rule 12-12, n.2 of Regulation S-X (instructions for categorizing
investments); n.10 (disclosure of illiquid securities); n.12 (disclosure of costs basis for

111

a.

Open Option Contracts Written — Rule 12-13 (Current Rule 12-12B)
and Options Purchased

Our proposed rule would modify the current disclosure of written option
contracts. 189 First, we are adding new columns to the schedule for written option
contracts that would require a description of the contract (replacing the current column
for name of the issuer), the counterparty to the transaction, 190 and the contract’s notional
amount. 191 Thus, under the new rule 12-13, for each open written options contract, funds
would be required to disclose: (1) description; (2) counterparty; (3) number of contracts;
(4) notional amount; (5) exercise price; (6) expiration date; and (7) value. 192 Second, we
are proposing to add an instruction to current rule 12-12, which is the schedule on which
purchased options are required to be disclosed, that would require funds to provide all
information required by proposed rule 12-13 for written option contracts. 193
We are also proposing for options where the underlying investment would
otherwise be presented in accordance with another provision of rule 12-12 or proposed
rules 12-13 through 12-13D that the presentation of that investment must include a

Federal income tax purposes); see also rule 12-13, n.7 of Regulation S-X (current
requirement for disclosure of costs basis for Federal income tax purposes).
189

Under current rule 12-12B, funds are required to report, for open option contracts, the name
of the issuer, number of contracts, exercise price, expiration date, and value. See rule 12-12B
of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.12-12B].

190

See supra note 116. This information should assist investors in identifying and monitoring
the counterparty risks associated with a fund’s investments in over-the-counter derivatives.

191

While rule 12-13 is specific to open option contracts written, the same disclosures also apply
for purchased options as required by proposed instruction 3 to rule 12-12. See also proposed
rule 12-12B, n.5 of Regulation S-X.

192

See proposed rule 12-13 of Regulation S-X.

193

See proposed rule 12-12, n.3 of Regulation S-X.

112

description, as required by those provisions. 194 Thus, if another investment contains
some sort of optionality (e.g., put or call features), the investment’s disclosure must
include both a description of the optionality (as required by proposed rule 12-13), and a
description of the underlying investments, as required by the applicable provisions of
proposed rules 12-12, 12-12A, and 12-13 through 12-13D. For example, reporting for a
swaption would include the disclosures required under both the swaps rule (proposed rule
12-13C) and the options rule (proposed rule 12-13).
As required in proposed Form N-PORT, 195 in the case of an option contract with
an underlying investment that is an index or basket of investments whose components are
publicly available on a website as of the fund’s balance sheet date, 196 or if the notional
amount of the holding does not exceed one percent of the fund’s NAV as of the close of
the period, we are proposing that the fund provide information sufficient to identify the
underlying investment, such as a description. 197 If the underlying investment is an index
whose components are not publicly available on a website as of the fund’s balance sheet
date, or is based upon a custom basket of investments, and the notional amount of the
option contract exceeds one percent of the fund’s NAV as of the close of the period, the
194

See proposed rules 12-12, n.3; 12-12B, n.5; and 12-13, n.3 of Regulation S-X.

195

See Item C.11.c.iii of proposed Form N-PORT.

196

Under the proposal, the components would be required to be publicly available on a website
as of the fund’s balance sheet date at the time of transmission to stockholders for any report
required to be transmitted to stockholders under rule 30e-1. The components would be
required to remain publicly available on a website as of the fund’s balance sheet date until 70
days after the fund’s next fiscal year-end. For example, components of an index underlying
an option contract for a fund’s 12/31/14 annual report must be made publicly available on a
website as of 12/31/14 by the time that the 12/31/14 annual report is transmitted to
stockholders. The components must remain publicly available until 3/10/16.

197

See proposed rule 12-13, n.3 of Regulation S-X. See supra note 120 and accompanying text
(discussing the rationale for similar proposed requirements in Form N-PORT).

113

fund would list separately each of the investments comprising the index or basket of
investments. 198 We believe that disclosure of the underlying investments of an option
contract is an important element to assist investors in understanding and evaluating the
full risks of the investment. We are also proposing to include a similar instruction for
swap contracts. 199 The disclosures in proposed instruction 3 would provide investors
with more transparency into both the terms of the underlying investment and the terms of
the option.
We are also proposing several instructions to rule 12-13 and the other rules we are
proposing concerning derivatives holdings (e.g., open futures contracts, open swap
contracts) in order to maintain consistency with the disclosures required by current rule
12-13. Current rule 12-13 contains an instruction requiring identification of “each
investment not readily marketable.” 200 We are proposing to modify this requirement in
proposed rule 12-13 and the other rules concerning derivatives holdings in order to
increase transparency into the marketability of, and observability of valuation inputs for,
a fund’s investments by requiring separate identification of investments that are restricted
securities, as well as those investments that were fair valued using significant
unobservable inputs. Thus, we are proposing to require funds to indicate if an investment

See id.

199

See proposed rule 12-13C, n.3 of Regulation S-X.

200

See rule 12-13, n.4 of Regulation S-X (“The term ‘investment not readily marketable’ shall
include investments for which there is no independent publicly quoted market and
investments which cannot be sold because of restrictions or conditions applicable to the
investment or the company.”).

114

cannot be sold because of restrictions or conditions applicable to the investment. 201 We
are also proposing to require funds to indicate if a security’s fair value was determined
using significant unobservable inputs. 202
Current rule 12-13 likewise contains an instruction to include tax basis disclosures
for investments other than securities. 203 We are extending this requirement to proposed
rule 12-13, as well as the other rules concerning derivatives holdings. 204 We believe that
this type of tax basis information is important to investors in investment companies,
which are generally pass-through entities pursuant to Subchapter M of the Internal
Revenue Code. 205
In order to provide greater transparency to investors into which investments are
deemed illiquid, we are also proposing to require funds to identify illiquid investments. 206
201

See proposed rule 12-13, n.6 of Regulation S-X; see also proposed rules 12-13A, n.4; 1213B, n.2; 12-13C, n.5; and 12-13D, n.6 of Regulation S-X.

funds to identify each investment categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy in
accordance with ASC Topic 820. See ASC 820-10-20 (defining “level 3 inputs” as
“unobservable inputs for the asset or liability”); see also ASC 820-10-35-37A (“In some
cases, the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorized
within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those cases, the fair value measurement
is categorized in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level
input that is significant to the entire measurement.”) (emphasis added); see also discussion

supra note 100. As previously stated, the staff is reviewing possible recommendations to the
Commission for rulemaking to update liquidity standards for mutual funds and ETFs, which
may result in changes to the Commission’s current guidance on this issue. See supra note
100.

115

Liquidity is an important consideration for a fund’s investors in understanding the risk
exposure of a fund. For example, in times of market stress, illiquid investments may not
be readily sold at their approximate value. Indicating which investments are illiquid
would allow an investor to understand which holdings in a fund are likely to be sold at a
discount if a portion of the fund’s investments must be sold to meet cash needs, such as
redemptions or distributions.
Proposed rule 12-13 would also include other new instructions. 207
b.

Open Futures Contracts — New Rule 12-13A

We are proposing new rule 12-13A, which would require standardized reporting
of open futures contracts. 208 For open futures contracts, funds are currently required to
report under rule 12-13 a description of the futures contract (including its expiration
date), the number of contracts held (under the balance held—quantity column), and any
unrealized appreciation and depreciation (under the value column). 209 In order to allow
investors to better understand the economics of a fund’s investment in futures contracts,
our proposal would also require funds to report notional amount and value. 210 Therefore,
under the proposal, funds with open futures contracts would report: (1) description; (2)
number of contracts; (3) expiration date; (4) notional amount; (5) value; and (6)

207

Instruction 2 would add “description” and “counterparty” to the organizational categories of
options contracts that must be listed separately. See proposed rule 12-13, n.2 of Regulation
S-X. Instruction 4 would clarify that the fund need not include counterparty information for
exchange-traded options. See proposed rule 12-13, n.4 of Regulation S-X.

208

See proposed rule 12-13A of Regulation S-X.

209

See rule 12-13 of Regulation S-X.

210

See proposed rule 12-13A, columns D and E of Regulation S-X.

116

unrealized appreciation and depreciation. 211 In addition, instruction 7 would include the
new requirement that funds should reconcile the total of Column F (unrealized
appreciation/depreciation) to the total variation margin receivable or payable on the
related balance sheet. 212 We believe that proposed instruction 7 would improve
transparency by linking the information in the schedule of open futures contracts with the
related balance sheet.
As discussed above, our proposal also contains certain new instructions for rule
12-13A that are generally the same across all of the schedules for derivatives contracts. 213
Based on staff review of disclosures of open futures contracts of funds, we believe that
these proposed disclosures are generally consistent with current industry practice. 214

211

See proposed rule 12-13A of Regulation S-X.

212

See proposed rule 12-13A, n.7 of Regulation S-X.

213

Instruction 1 would require funds to organize long purchases of futures contracts and futures
contracts sold short separately. See proposed rule 12-13A, n.1 of Regulation S-X.
Instruction 2 would require funds to list separately futures contracts where the descriptions or
expiration dates differ. See proposed rule 12-13A, n.2 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 3
would clarify that the description should include the name of the reference asset or index.
See proposed rule 12-13A, n.3 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 4 would require the fund to
indicate each investment which cannot be sold because of restrictions or conditions
applicable to the investment. See proposed rule 12-13A, n.4 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 5
would require the fund to indicate each investment whose fair value was determined using
significant unobservable inputs. See proposed rule 12-13A, n.5 of Regulation S-X.
Instruction 6 would require the fund to identify each illiquid investment. See proposed rule
12-13A, n.6 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 8 would extend current rule 12-13’s tax basis
disclosure to disclosures of open futures contracts. See proposed rule 12-13A, n.8 of
Regulation S-X.

214

We understand that many funds disclose either value or notional amount for open futures
contracts, but may not disclose both. Our proposal would require disclosure of both value
and notional amount.

117

c.

Open Forward Foreign Currency Contracts — New Rule 12-13B

We are also proposing new rule 12-13B, which would require standardized
disclosures for open forward foreign currency contracts. 215 Currently, under rule 12-13,
funds are required to report a description of the contract (including a description of what
is to be purchased and sold under the contract and the settlement date), the amount to be
purchased and sold on settlement date (under the balance held—quantity column), and
any unrealized appreciation or depreciation (under the value column). 216 In order to
allow investors to better understand counterparty risk for forward foreign currency
contracts, our proposal would additionally require funds to disclose the counterparty to
each transaction. 217 As proposed, funds holding open forward foreign currency contracts
would therefore report the: (1) amount and description of currency to be purchased; (2)
amount and description of currency to be sold; (3) counterparty; (4) settlement date; and
(5) unrealized appreciation/depreciation. 218 Based on staff review of disclosures of open
forward foreign currency contracts of funds, we believe that these proposed disclosures
are generally consistent with current industry practice. Our proposal would also include
certain new instructions to the schedule that are similar to the other derivatives disclosure
requirements we are proposing today. 219

Instruction 1 would require the fund to separately organize forward foreign currency
contracts where the description of currency purchased, currency sold, counterparties, or
settlement dates differ. See proposed rule 12-13B n.1 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 2
would require the fund to indicate each investment which cannot be sold because of
restrictions or conditions applicable to the investment. See proposed rule 12-13B n.2 of

118

d.

Open Swap Contracts — New Rule 12-13C

We are also proposing new rule 12-13C, which would require standardized
reporting of fund positions in open swap contracts. 220 Under rule 12-13, funds currently
report description (including a description of what is to be paid and received by the fund
and the contract’s maturity date), notional amount (under balance held—quantity
column), and any unrealized appreciation or depreciation (under the value column). 221
Our proposal would additionally require funds to report the counterparty to each
transaction (except for exchange-traded swaps), the contract’s value, and any upfront
payments or receipts. 222 This additional information would allow investors to both better
understand the economics of the transaction, as well as its associated risks. 223 Thus, as
proposed, funds would report for each swap the: (1) description and terms of payments
to be received from another party; (2) description and terms of payments to be paid to
another party; (3) counterparty; (4) maturity date; (5) notional amount; (6) value; (7)

Regulation S-X. Instruction 3 would require the fund to indicate each investment whose fair
value was determined using significant unobservable inputs. See proposed rule 12-13B n.3 of
Regulation S-X. Instruction 4 would require the fund to identify each illiquid investment.
See proposed rule 12-13B n.4 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 5 would clarify that Column E
(unrealized appreciation/depreciation) should be totaled and agree with the total of correlative
amounts shown on the related balance sheet. See proposed rule 12-13B n.5 of Regulation SX. Instruction 6 would extend current rule 12-13’s tax basis disclosure to disclosures of open
forward foreign currency contracts. See proposed rule 12-13B n.6 of Regulation S-X.

For example, upfront payments disclose whether cash was paid or received when entering
into a swap contract, allowing investors to better understand the initial cost of the investment,
if any.

upfront payments/receipts; and (8) unrealized appreciation/depreciation. 224 We are
proposing these categories of information in an effort to increase transparency of swap
contracts, while maintaining enough flexibility for the variety of swap products that
currently exist and future products that might come to market. 225
While instruction 3 of proposed rule 12-13C provides specific examples for the
more common types of swap contracts (e.g., credit default swaps, interest rate swaps, and
total return swaps), we recognize that other types of swaps exist (e.g., currency swaps,
commodity swaps, variance swaps, and subordinated risk swaps). 226 For example, a
cross-currency swap has two notional amounts, one for the currency to be received and
one for the currency to be paid. For a cross-currency swap, funds would report for
purposes of Column A of proposed rule 12-13C, a description of the interest rate to be
received and the notional amount that the calculation of interest to be received is based
upon. Column B of proposed rule 12-13C would include a description of the interest rate
to be paid and the notional amount that the calculation of interest to be paid is based
upon. Column E would include both notional amounts and the currency in which each is
denominated, or the same information could be presented in two separate columns.

224

See proposed rule 12-13C of Regulation S-X. The description and terms of payments to be
paid and received (and other information) to and from another party should reflect the
investment owned by the fund and allow an investor to understand the full nature of the
transaction.

225

See id. at n.1 (requiring the fund to list each major category of swaps by descriptive title); n.2
(requiring the fund to list separately each swap where description, counterparty, or maturity
dates differ within each major category).

As required in our proposed disclosures for open option contracts 227 and in
proposed Form N-PORT, 228 in the case of a swap with a referenced asset that is an index
whose components are publicly available on a website as of the fund’s balance sheet date,
or if the notional amount of the holding does not exceed one percent of the fund’s NAV
as of the close of the period, we are proposing that the fund provide information
sufficient to identify the referenced asset, such as a description. 229 If the referenced asset
is an index whose components are not publicly available on a website as of the fund’s
balance sheet date, or is based upon a custom basket of investments, and the notional
amount of the holding exceeds one percent of the fund’s NAV as of the close of the
period, the fund would list separately each of the investments comprising the referenced
assets. 230 As with underlying investments for option contracts, we believe that disclosure
of the underlying referenced assets of a swap would assist investors in better
understanding and evaluating the full risks of investments in swaps.
For swaps which pay or receive financing payments, funds would disclose
variable financing rates in a manner similar to disclosure of variable interest rates on
securities in accordance with instruction 4 to proposed rule 12-12. 231 Our proposal would
also include other instructions to this rule that are similar across all of our proposed rules
for derivatives contracts. 232

Other Investments — Rule 12-13D (Current Rule 12-13)

We are also proposing to amend current rule 12-13 and, for organization and
consistency, renumber it as proposed rule 12-13D. Proposed rule 12-13D is intended to
continue, as is currently required by rule 12-13, to be the schedule by which funds report
investments not otherwise required to be reported pursuant to Article 12. 233 As proposed,
rule 12-13D would require reporting of: (1) description; (2) balance held at close of
period-quantity; and (3) value of each item at close of period. 234 We expect that funds
would report, among other holdings, investments in physical holdings, such as real estate
or commodities, pursuant to proposed rule 12-13D. As discussed above, our proposal
would also modify current rule 12-13’s requirement that funds disclose “each investment
not readily marketable” 235 in favor of disclosures concerning whether an investment is
restricted and if an investment’s fair value was determined using significant unobservable
inputs. 236 Our proposal would also include certain new instructions to the schedule that
are generally the same across all the schedules for derivatives contracts. 237

Instruction 7 would require funds to identify each illiquid investment. See proposed rule 1213C n.7 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 8 would require that columns F (value), G (upfront

We request comment on our proposed amendments to rules 12-13 through
12-13D of Regulation S-X:
•

Many of our proposed portfolio holdings disclosure requirements in Article 12
conform with similar requirements on proposed Form N-PORT. Are our
proposed amendments to Article 12 appropriate for fund financial statements? Is
there information that is currently proposed in Form N-PORT, but not in Article
12, that would benefit investors? For example, to the extent that proposed Form
N-PORT instructs filers to report the country code that corresponds to the country
of investment or issuer based on the concentrations of the risk and economic
exposure of the investments, or, if different, the country where the issuer is
organized, should those same instructions be integrated into Regulation S-X to
standardize how funds report that information in their financial statements and in
Form N-PORT? 238

•

Are there other categories of investments not specifically covered in Article 12
that should be specifically addressed in a new rule or directly addressed in rule
12-13D?

investment); n.7 (requiring the fund to indicate each issue of securities whose fair value was
determined using significant unobservable inputs).
237

Instruction 1 would require the fund to organize each investment separately where any
portion of the description differs. See proposed rule 12-13D n.1 of Regulation S-X.
Instruction 2 would require the fund to categorize the schedule by the type of investment, and
related industry, country, or geographic region, as applicable. See proposed rule 12-13D n.2
of Regulation S-X. Instruction 3 would require that the description of the asset include
information sufficient for a user to understand the nature and terms of the investment. See
proposed rule 12-13D n.3 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 8 would require the fund to identify
each illiquid investment. See proposed rule 12-13D n.8 of Regulation S-X.

238

See supra note 104 and accompanying and following text (discussing how funds would report
country codes for portfolio investments on Form N-PORT).

123

•

To what extent are proposed rules 12-13 through 12-13D consistent with industry
practices? How are our proposed amendments different? Are there other industry
practices that we should include in our proposal with respect to the disclosure of
derivative investments?

•

The schedules to rules 12-13 through 12-13D use the term “description” to require
funds to disclose the information sufficient for a user of financial information to
identify the investment. Should the instructions to any of those rules be enhanced
or modified to clarify what is meant by the term “description?” If so, how should
these be enhanced or modified?

•

The schedules to rules 12-13 (Open option contracts written), 12-13B (Open
forward foreign currency contracts), 12-13C (Open swap contracts), and 12-13D
(Other investments) would require disclosure of the counterparty to the
transaction for non-exchange traded instruments. Should we, as proposed, require
disclosure of the counterparty to certain transactions? Should the exchange or
clearing member be disclosed for exchange-traded derivatives? Are there any
additional counterparty or exchange risks that should be disclosed? If so, why?
Are there any confidentiality or other concerns with requiring the disclosure of
counterparties?

•

We request comment on our proposed amendments to rule 12-13 (Open option
contracts written). Should we require different or additional information about
these contracts? Should any of the proposed information requirements be
excluded? Is it appropriate to require disclosure of “notional amount” for option
contracts? Is this metric useful to investors? Should we require the disclosures of

124

open option contracts written to be grouped or subtotaled? For example, should
we require over-the-counter option contracts to be grouped by counterparty?
•

As proposed, rule 12-13 would require disclosure of each option contract with an
underlying investment that is an index or basket of investments whose
components are not publicly available on a website and the notional amount of the
holding exceeds one percent of the NAV of the fund. Are there better alternatives
to disclose the underlying investments for an options contract if it consists of a
custom basket of securities? If so, what alternatives and why? To the extent such
indices are proprietary or subject to licensing agreements, what would be the
effect of this requirement? For example, would funds incur costs for amending
licensing agreements? Would index providers be unwilling to amend existing
licensing agreements? If so, how would this impact funds that make such
investments and the marketplace generally? Are there other concerns about
disclosing the components of proprietary indices? Should we alter this
requirement, and if so how? Is our exceeding one percent of the NAV disclosure
threshold appropriate? Should there be a different disclosure threshold applied to
an option contract’s underlying investments? If so, what threshold and why? For
example, should there be a disclosure threshold applied to individual holdings
(e.g., if the notional amount of a single underlying investment in a custom basket
is less than a certain percentage of a fund’s net assets)? Should we use a different
percentage for the disclosure threshold, such as exceeding five percent of the
NAV? Alternatively, would summary disclosure be adequate to inform investors,
similar to instruction 3 of rule 12-12C, which requires disclosure of the 50 largest

125

issues and any other issue the value of which exceeded one percent of net asset
value of the fund as of the close of the period? If so, how should such a
disclosure be handled? If the reference asset is a modified version of an index
whose components are publicly available on a website as of the fund’s balance
sheet date, for example a version that is customized to exclude certain issuers that
the fund is restricted from owning, would requiring a narrative of those
modifications be preferable to funds and investors rather than requiring each
holding of the modified index to be listed?
•

We request comment on proposed rule 12-13A (Open futures contracts). Should
we require different or additional information about these contracts? Should any
of the proposed information requirements be excluded? Our proposed rule would
require disclosure of notional amount and value on open futures contracts.
Should we require disclosure of notional amount for futures contracts? Should we
require disclosure of value for futures contracts? Should we require the
disclosures of open futures contracts to be grouped or subtotaled? If so, how?
For example, should we require open futures contracts to be organized by country
of issuance?

•

We request comment on proposed rule 12-13B (Open forward foreign currency
contracts). Should we require different or additional information about these
contracts? Should any of the proposed information requirements be excluded?
Rule 12-13B, as proposed, is limited to forward foreign currency contracts. Are
there other types of forwards that should be addressed in this section that would
not otherwise be presented as other derivative investments, such as swaps?

126

Should we require the disclosures of open forward foreign currency contracts to
be grouped or subtotaled? If so, how? For example, should we require open
forward foreign currency contracts to be organized by currency or type of
transaction (e.g., purchased or sold U.S. dollars)?
•

We request comment on proposed rule 12-13C (Open swap contracts). Should we
require different or additional information about these contracts? Should any of
the proposed information requirements be excluded? Instruction 1 to proposed
rule 12-13C requires the schedule to be organized by descriptive title (e.g., credit
default swaps, interest rate swaps). Should we require additional subgrouping of
the schedules beyond what is already required? For example, should we require
over-the-counter swaps to be grouped by counterparty?

•

Instruction 3 of proposed rule 12-13C contains examples of information that
could be included for credit default swaps, interest rate swaps, and total return
swaps. Is the example contained in proposed rule 12-13C adequate? Is there any
other information that should be disclosed as part of the description for credit
default swaps, interest rate swaps, and total return swaps? Are there other types
of swaps that should be included as examples within proposed rule 12-13C? If so,
what information should be included in the example?

•

As proposed, rule 12-13C would require disclosure of each investment with a
referenced asset that is an index whose components are not periodically publicly
available on a website and the notional amount of the holding exceeds one percent
of the NAV of the fund. Are there better alternatives to disclose the underlying
assets of a swap if it consists of a custom basket of securities? If so, what

127

alternative and why? To the extent such indices are proprietary or subject to
licensing agreements, what would be the effect of this requirement? For example,
would funds incur costs for amending licensing agreements? Would index
providers be unwilling to amend existing licensing agreements? If so, how would
this impact funds that make such investments and the marketplace generally? Are
there other concerns about disclosing the components of proprietary indices?
Should we alter this requirement, and if so how? Is our exceeding one percent of
the NAV disclosure threshold appropriate? Should there be a different disclosure
threshold applied to a swap’s referenced assets? If so, what threshold and why?
For example, should there be a disclosure threshold applied to individual holdings
(e.g., if the notional amount of a single underlying investment in a custom basket
is less than a certain percentage of a fund’s net assets)? Should we use a different
percentage for the disclosure threshold, such as exceeding five percent of the
NAV? Alternatively, would summary disclosure be adequate to inform investors,
similar to instruction 3 of rule 12-12C, which requires disclosure of the 50 largest
issues and any other issue the value of which exceeded one percent of net asset
value of the fund as of the close of the period? If so, how should such a
disclosure be handled? Should we include this disclosure requirement for other
investments? For example, should we require funds to disclose the referenced
asset for futures contracts or forward foreign currency contracts if their
underlying investments are composed of an index or custom basket of securities?
•

We request comment on our proposed amendments in rule 12-13D (Investments
other than those presented in rules 12-12, 12-12A, 12-12B, 12-13, 12-13A,

128

12-13B, and 12-13C). Should we require different or additional information
about these contracts? Should any of the proposed information requirements be
excluded?
•

We request comment on our proposed requirements in rules 12-13 through 1213D that the fund identify investments which cannot be sold because of
restrictions or conditions applicable to the investment. Is this requirement
appropriate? Why or why not? Would this requirement assist investors and other
interested parties with understanding the marketability of an investment? Why or
why not?

•

We request comment on our proposed requirements in rules 12-13 through 1213D that the fund identify investments whose fair value was determined using
significant unobservable inputs. Is this requirement appropriate? Why or why
not? Would this requirement assist investors and other interested parties with
understanding risks associated with valuation?

•

Should we propose a disclosure relating to “investments not readily marketable”
as is currently required by rule 12-13? Why or why not?

•

We request comment on our proposed requirements in rules 12-13 through 1213D that the fund identify investments that are considered to be illiquid. Is this
requirement appropriate? Why or why not? What are the costs and benefits
associated with this requirement? Will independent accountants be able to audit
this disclosure?

•

We request comment on our proposed disclosures based on cost for Federal
income tax purposes under proposed rule 12-12A and rules 12-13 through 12-

129

13D. Do these disclosures provide meaningful information for investors in
addition to tax basis disclosures required under U.S. GAAP? What are the costs
and benefits associated with providing this disclosure? Should our proposed
disclosures be reported in a separate stand-alone disclosure or, as proposed, as a
note to each separate schedule? Should we eliminate the current disclosure
requirement to present tax-basis cost and unrealized appreciation and depreciation
in both semi-annual and annual shareholder reports? Why or why not? As an
alternative, should we make the tax-basis disclosure an annual requirement?

Amendments to Rules 12-12 through 12-12C

While we are not proposing changes to the schedules for rules 12-12, 12-12A, and
12-12C, we are proposing certain additional rule instructions that would include new
disclosures, as well as certain clarifying changes, including renumbering several of the
schedules.
We are proposing several modifications to the instructions to rule 12-12, the rule
concerning disclosure of investments in securities of unaffiliated issuers. We are
proposing to modify instruction 2 to rule 12-12 (and the corresponding instructions to
proposed rules 12-12A, 12-12B, 12-13D, and 12-14) which would require funds to
categorize the schedule by type of investment, the related industry, and the related
country, or geographic region. 239 U.S. GAAP requires investment companies that are
nonregistered investment partnerships to categorize investments in securities by type,

239

See proposed rule 12-12, n.2 of Regulation S-X; see also proposed rules 12-12A, n.2; 1212B, n.2; 12-13D, n.2; and 12-14, n.2 of Regulation S-X.

130

country or geographic region, and industry. 240 In order to provide more transparency
into the industry and the country or geographic region of a fund’s investments in
securities, we believe that the disclosures provided by funds should provide investors
with the same categorization as nonregistered investment partnerships. We also believe
that disclosure of both the industry and the country or geographic region would be
particularly beneficial for investors in global and international funds, where currently
funds are only required to categorize their schedule by industry, country, or geographic
region, as it would provide additional transparency into the investments owned by the
fund.
In order to provide more transparency to a fund’s investments in debt securities,
we are proposing an instruction to rule 12-12 requiring the fund to indicate the interest
rate or preferential dividend rate and maturity rate for certain enumerated debt
instruments. 241 When disclosing the interest rate for variable rate securities, we are
proposing that the fund describe the referenced rate and spread. 242 In proposing
disclosures for variable rate securities, we considered other alternatives, such as periodend interest rate (e.g. the investment’s interest rate in effect at the end of the period).
However, we believe that disclosure of both the referenced rate and spread allow
investors to better understand the economics of the fund’s investments in variable rate
debt securities, such as the effect of a change in the reference rate on the security’s
income. This proposal is intended to result in more consistency across funds in

241

See proposed rule 12-12, n.4 of Regulation S-X.

242

See id.

131

disclosures of the interest rate for variable rate securities. For securities with paymentsin-kind, we are proposing that the fund provide the rate paid in-kind in order to provide
more transparency to investors when the fund is generating income that is not paid in
cash. 243
Our proposal would modify the current instruction to rule 12-12 244 that requires a
fund to identify each issue of securities held in connection with open put or call option
contracts and loans for short sales, by adding the requirement to also indicate where any
portion of the issue is on loan. 245 We believe that this disclosure would increase the
transparency of the fund’s securities lending activities. We are also proposing to modify
current instruction 3 of rule 12-12 concerning the organization of subtotals for each
category of investments, making the instructions consistent with those in proposed rule
12-12B (current rule 12-12C), Summary schedule of investments in securities of
unaffiliated issuers. 246
As in our proposed derivatives disclosures, 247 in order to increase transparency
into the observability of inputs used in determining the value of individual investments,
we are adding the requirement for funds to disclose those investments whose fair value
was determined using significant unobservable inputs. 248 Here, as in our proposed

Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy in accordance with ASC Topic 820. We are also
extending this requirement to proposed rules 12-12A and 12-12B. 249
As in proposed rules 12-13 through 12-13D, 250 proposed instruction 10 to rule
12-12 would contain a requirement to identify each issue of illiquid securities. 251 Like
other proposed rules, we believe that this requirement would provide investors with
greater transparency and understanding of the liquidity of a fund’s investments. 252
Likewise, we are proposing several modifications to rule 12-12A regarding the
presentation of securities sold short, in order to conform the instructions to proposed
rule 12-12. 253
Funds are permitted to include in their reports to shareholders a summary
portfolio schedule, in lieu of a complete portfolio schedule, so long as it conforms with

Instruction 2 would require the fund to organize the schedule in rule 12-12A in the same
manner as is required by instruction 2 of rule 12-12. See proposed rule 12-12A, n.2.
Instruction 3 would require the fund to identify the interest rate or preferential dividend rate
and maturity rate as required by instruction 4 of proposed rule 12-12. See proposed rule 1212A, n.3 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 4 would require the subtotals for each category of
investments be subdivided both by investment type and business grouping or instrument type,
and be shown together with their percentage value compared to net assets, in the same
manner as is required by proposed instruction 5 of rule 12-12. See proposed rule 12-12A, n.4
of Regulation S-X. Instruction 6 would require the fund to identify each issue of securities
whose fair value was determined using significant unobservable inputs. See proposed rule
12-12A, n.6 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 7 would require the fund to identify each issue of
securities held in connection with open put or call option contracts in the same manner as
required by proposed instruction 11 of rule 12-12. See proposed rule 12-12A, n.7 of
Regulation S-X. Instruction 8 would extend rule 12-12’s tax basis disclosure to securities
sold short. See proposed rule 12-12A, n.8 of Regulation S-X.

133

current rule 12-12C (Summary schedule of investments in securities of unaffiliated
issuers). 254 In order to maintain numbering consistency and organization throughout the
regulation, we are proposing to rename current rule 12-12C (Summary schedule of
investments in securities of unaffiliated issuers) as rule 12-12B. As in rule 12-12 and 1212A, we are not proposing to modify the schedule of proposed rule 12-12B (current rule
12-12C), but again added similar changes to its instructions. 255
We request comment on our amendments to proposed rules 12-12 through 12-12B
of Regulation S-X:
•

Are our proposed amendments to rule 12-12 through 12-12B appropriate? Are
there other amendments to rules 12-12 through 12-12B that should be made to
improve disclosures regarding the investments that would be reported under the
rules? If so, what amendments and why?

•

We request comment on proposed amendments to rule 12-12 (Investments in
securities of unaffiliated issuers). For variable rate securities, we propose to
require disclosure of a description of the reference rate and spread (e.g., USD

254

See rule 6-10(c)(2) of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.6-10(c)(2)]; see also Quarterly Portfolio
Holdings Adopting Release, supra note 19.

Instruction 2 would add “type of investment” to the current subtotal requirements for the
summary schedule. See proposed rule 12-12B, n.2 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 3 would
extend rule 12-12’s proposed requirement that funds indicate the interest rate or preferential
dividend rate and maturity rate for certain enumerated securities. See proposed rule 12-12B,
n.3 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 5 would require for options purchased all information that
would be required by rule 12-13 for written option contracts. See proposed rule 12-12B, n.5
of Regulation S-X. Instruction 12 would require the fund to indicate each issue of securities
whose fair value was determined using significant unobservable inputs. See proposed rule
12-12B, n.12 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 13 would require the fund to identify illiquid
securities. See proposed rule 12-12B, n.13 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 14 would extend
rule 12-12’s requirement that the fund indicate where any portion of the issue is on loan. See
proposed rule 12-12B, n.14 of Regulation S-X.

LIBOR 3-month + 2%). Is this requirement appropriate? Should we alternatively
require disclosure of the period end interest rate?
•

We request comment on instruction 2 to proposed rule 12-12 (and the
corresponding instructions to rules 12-12A, 12-12B, and 12-14) which would
require funds to categorize the schedule by type of investment, the related
industry, and the related country, or geographic region. Should we include this
instruction in our proposed rules? What are the costs or benefits associated with
such a requirement?

Investments In and Advances to Affiliates

We are proposing amendments to rule 12-14 (Investments in and advances to
affiliates). 256 Rule 12-14 requires a fund to make certain disclosures about its
investments in and advances to any “affiliates” or companies in which the investment
company owns 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities. 257 The rule currently
requires that a fund disclose the “amount of equity in net profit and loss for the period”
for each controlled company, but does not require disclosure of realized or unrealized
gains or losses. Based upon staff experience, we believe that the presentation of realized
gains or losses and changes in unrealized appreciation or depreciation would assist
investors with better understanding the impact of each affiliated investment on the fund’s
statement of operations. As a result, we are proposing to modify column C of the
schedule to rule 12-14 to require “net realized gain or loss for the period,” 258 and column

256

See proposed rule 12-14 of Regulation S-X.

257

See rule 12-14 of Regulation S-X.

258

See proposed rule 12-14, column C of Regulation S-X. Column C of current rule 12-14
requires disclosure of the “amount of equity in net profit and loss for the period,” which is
derived from the controlled company’s income statement and does not directly translate to the
impact to a fund’s statement of operations. We are proposing to replace this requirement
with “net realized gain or loss for the period.”

136

D to require “net increase or decrease in unrealized appreciation or depreciation for the
period” for each affiliated investment. 259
Likewise, in instruction 6(e) and (f), we are proposing to require disclosure of
total realized gain or loss and total net increase or decrease in unrealized appreciation or
depreciation for affiliated investments in order to correlate these totals to the statement of
operations. 260 Disclosure of realized gains or losses and changes in unrealized
appreciation or depreciation, in addition to the current requirement to disclose the amount
of income, would allow investors to understand the full impact of an affiliated investment
on a fund’s statement of operations.
Additionally, we are proposing a new instruction 7 in order to make the
categorization of investments in and advances to affiliates consistent with the method of
categorization used in proposed rules 12-12, 12-12A, and 12-12B. 261 We are also
proposing several other modifications to the instructions to rule 12-14 in order to, in part,
conform the rule to our proposed disclosure requirements in rules 12-12 and 12-13. 262

259

See id. at column D.

See id. at n.7; see also proposed rule 12-12, n.5, 12-12A. n.4, 12-12B, n.2 of Regulation S-X.

262

Instruction 1 would delete the instruction to segregate subsidiaries consolidated in order to
make the disclosures under rule 12-14 consistent with the fund’s balance sheet. See proposed
rule 12-14, at n.1 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 2 would require the fund to organize the
schedule to rule 12-14 in the same manner as is required by instruction 2 of rule 12-12. See
proposed rule 12-14, at n.2 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 3 would require the fund to
identify the interest rate or preferential dividend rated and maturity rate, as applicable. See
proposed rule 12-14, at n.3 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 4 would add column F to the
columns to be totaled and update the instruction to state that Column F should agree with the
correlative amount shown on the related balance sheet. See proposed rule 12-14, at n.4 of
Regulation S-X. Instruction 5 would update the reference to instruction 8 of rule 12-12 and
reference to rule 12-13 to reflect the changes in the numbering of the instructions for those
rules. See proposed rule 12-14, at n.5 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 6(a) and (b) would
update references to column D to reference Column E in order to reflect our proposed

137

We request comment on our proposed amendments to rule 12-14 of Regulation
S-X:
•

Are our proposed amendments to rule 12-14 appropriate? Are there other
amendments to rule 12-14 that should be made to improve disclosures regarding
the investments that would be reported under the rule? If so, what amendments
and why?

•

In proposed rule 12-14, we are no longer requiring information about the fund’s
equity in the profit or loss of each controlled portfolio company. Instead, we are
proposing to require the realized gain or loss and change in unrealized
appreciation or depreciation for all affiliated investments. Is this change
appropriate? Is it still important to understand the equity in the profit or loss of
each controlled company in addition to the controlled portfolio company’s effect
on the fund’s statement of operations? Would the presentation of realized gains
or losses and changes in unrealized appreciation or depreciation assist investors
with better understanding the impact of each affiliated investment on the fund’s
statement of operations? Why or why not? Are there other changes to the

changes to rule 12-14’s schedule. See proposed rule 12-14, at nn.6(a) and (b) of Regulation
S-X. Instruction 6(d), which proposes to add clarifying language from instruction 7 of rule
12-12, would provide the fund with more detail on the definition of non-income producing
securities. See proposed rule 12-14, at n.6(d) of Regulation S-X. Instruction 8 would require
the fund to identify each issue of securities whose fair value was determined using significant
unobservable inputs. See proposed rule 12-14, at n.8 of Regulation S-X. Instruction 9 would
require the fund to identify illiquid securities. See proposed rule 12-14, at n.9 of Regulation
S-X. Instruction 10 would require the fund to indicate each issue of securities held in
connection with open put or call option contracts, loans for short sales, or where any portion
of the issue is on loan, as required by note 11 to rule 12-12. See proposed rule 12-14, at n.10
of Regulation S-X. Instruction 11 would extend rule 12-12’s tax basis disclosure to
investments in and advances to affiliates. See proposed rule 12-14, at n.11 of Regulation SX.

disclosure of affiliated transactions that would better assist investors with
understanding the impact of affiliated investments on the fund’s statement of
operations?

In addition to those discussed above, what are the costs and benefits associated
with the proposed changes? Would the proposed changes under rule 12-14 reduce
any burdens on filers? If so, how?

•

Are our amendments to proposed rule 12-14 consistent with industry practices? If
not, how are our amendments different? Are there other industry practices that
we should include in our proposal with respect to the disclosure of affiliated
investments?
5.

Form and Content of Financial Statements

Finally, we are proposing revisions to Article 6 of Regulation S-X, which
prescribes the form and content of financial statements filed for funds. Many of the
revisions we are proposing today are intended to conform Article 6 with our proposed
changes to Article 12 and update other financial statement requirements. 263 As part of
these changes, we are proposing to modify the title and description of Article 6 from
“Registered Investment Companies” to “Registered Investment Companies and Business
Development Companies” to clarify that BDCs are subject to Article 6 of Regulation SX. 264 This does not change existing requirements for BDCs. 265

263

We are also proposing to amend the reference in rule 6-03(c) to §210.3A-05, as that section
of Regulation S-X was rescinded in 2011. See Rescission of Outdated Rules and Forms, and
Amendments to Correct References, Securities Act Release No. 33-9273 (Nov. 4, 2011) [76
FR 71872 (Nov. 21, 2011)].

264

See proposed rules 6-01; 6-03; 6-03(c)(1); 6-03(d); 6-03(i); 6-04; and 6-07 of Regulation SX.

139

In order to allow a more uniform presentation of investment schedules in a fund’s
financial statements, we are proposing to rescind subparagraph (a) of rule 6-10 under
Regulation S-X, regarding which schedules are to be filed. 266 We believe that a fund and
its consolidated subsidiaries should present their consolidated investments for each
applicable schedule, without indicating which are owned directly by the fund or which
are owned by the consolidated subsidiaries.
Moreover, current rule 6-10(a) provides that if the information required by any
schedule (including the notes thereto) is shown in the related financial statement or in a
note thereto without making such statement unclear or confusing, that procedure may be
followed and the schedule omitted. 267 We believe that some funds may have interpreted
this guidance as allowing presentation of some Article 12 schedules (e.g., rules 12-13 and
12-14) in the notes to the financial statements, as opposed to immediately following the
schedules required by rules 12-12, 12-12A, and 12-12C, and are therefore proposing to
eliminate rule 6-10(a). In light of the increased use of derivatives by funds, we believe
that all schedules required by rule 6-10 should be presented together within a fund’s
financial statements, and not in the notes to the financial statements. We recognize that

A BDC is a closed-end fund that is operated for the purpose of making investments in small
and developing businesses and financially troubled businesses and that elects to be regulated
as a BDC. See section 2(a)(48) of the Investment Company Act (defining BDCs). BDCs are
not subject to periodic reporting requirements under the Investment Company Act, although
they must comply with periodic reporting requirements under the Exchange Act.
265

See Instruction 1.a to Item 6.c of Form N-2 (“A business development company should
comply with the provisions of Regulation S-X generally applicable to registered management
investment companies. (See section 210.3-18 [17 CFR 210.3-18] and sections 210.6-01
through 210.6-10 of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.6-01 through 210.6-10]).”).

266

See proposed rule 6-10 of Regulation S-X.

267

See rule 6-10 of Regulation S-X.

140

our proposal would change current practice for some funds but believe that, coupled with
more detailed disclosure rules for derivatives, this amendment would provide more
consistent disclosure and improve the usability of financial statements for investors. 268
We are also proposing changes to rules 6-03 and 6-04 to specifically reference the
investments required to be reported on separate schedules in amended Article 12. 269
Additionally, we are proposing to eliminate current rule 6-04.4, which requires disclosure
of “Total investments” on the balance sheet under “Assets,” recognizing that investments
reported under proposed rules 12-13A through 12-13D could potentially be presented
under both assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. 270 For example, a fund may hold a
forward foreign currency contract with unrealized appreciation and a different forward
foreign currency contract with unrealized depreciation. The fund presents on its balance
sheet an asset balance for the contract with unrealized appreciation and a liability balance
for the contract with unrealized depreciation. Totaling the amounts of investments
reported under assets could be misleading to investors in this example, or in other
examples where a fund holds derivatives in a liability position (e.g., unrealized
depreciation on an interest rate swap contract). A “Total investments” amount in the
Assets section of the fund’s balance sheet would include the fund’s investments in
securities and derivatives that are in an appreciated position, but it would not include the
unrealized depreciation on the interest rate swap contract, which would be classified

268

Additionally, in order to conform proposed rule 6-10(b) with the new requirements under
Article 12, we added schedules corresponding to our proposed new schedules of derivatives
investments.

269

See proposed rules 6-03(d), 6-04.3 and 6-04.9 of Regulation S-X.

270

See rule 6-04.4 of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.6-04.4].

141

under the Liabilities section of the fund’s balance sheet. Given the increasing use of
derivatives by funds, we believe eliminating current rule 6-04.4 would provide more
complete information to investors. We are also proposing a corresponding change in rule
6-03(d) to remove the reference to “total investments reported under [rule 6-04.4].” 271
We are also proposing to amend rule 6-04 to refer individually to our derivatives
disclosures in proposed rules 12-13A through 12-13C. 272 As is currently the case, these
proposed amendments are not meant to require gross presentation where netting is
allowed under U.S. GAAP. 273 For example, if a fund held a forward foreign currency
contract which had unrealized appreciation and another forward foreign currency contract
which had unrealized depreciation, the fact that forward foreign currency contracts are
mentioned in proposed rules 6-04.3(b) and 6-04.9(d) is not meant to require both
contracts to be presented gross on the balance sheet if netting were allowed under U.S.
GAAP.
Proposed rule 6-05.3 would also specifically require presentation of items relating
to investments other than securities in the notes to financial statements. 274 Current rule 605.3 only requires presentation in the notes to financial statements of disclosure required
by rules 6-04.10 through 6-04.13, which include information relating to securities sold
short and open option contracts written. 275 Our proposal would also amend rule 6-05.3 to

271

142

require fund financial statements to reflect all unaffiliated investments other than
securities presented on separate schedules under Article 12. 276
We are also proposing to add new disclosure requirements that are designed to
increase transparency to investors about certain investments and activities. First, we are
proposing to add new subsection (m) to rule 6-03 that would require funds to make
certain disclosures in connection with a fund’s securities lending activities and cash
collateral management. 277 Specifically, we are proposing to require disclosure of (1) the
gross income from securities lending, including income from cash collateral
reinvestment; (2) the dollar amount of all fees and/or compensation paid by the registrant
for securities lending activities and related services, including borrower rebates and cash
collateral management services; (3) the net income from securities lending activities; (4)
the terms governing the compensation of the securities lending agent, including any
revenue sharing split, with the related percentage split between the registrant and the
securities lending agent, and/or any fee-for-service, and a description of services
included; (5) the details of any other fees paid directly or indirectly, including any fees
paid directly by the registrant for cash collateral management and any management fee
deducted from a pooled investment vehicle in which cash collateral is invested; and (6)
the monthly average of the value of portfolio securities on loan. 278 We believe that these
proposed disclosures would allow investors to better understand the income generated
from, as well as the expenses associated with, securities lending activities. Second, our

276

277

See supra note 71 and accompanying text.

278

See proposed rule 6-03(m) of Regulation S-X.

143

proposal would also amend rule 6-07 to require funds to make a separate disclosure for
income from non-cash dividends and payment-in-kind interest on the statement of
operations. 279 Our proposed amendment to rule 6-07 is intended to increase transparency
for investors in order to allow them to better understand when fund income is earned, but
not received, in the form of cash.
We are proposing to amend rule 6-07.7(a) in order to conform statement of
operations disclosures of the net realized gains or losses from investments to include our
additional derivatives disclosures in proposed rules 12-13A through 12-13C. 280
Likewise, we are proposing similar changes to proposed 6-07.7(c) (current rule 6-07.7(d))
in order to conform statement of operations disclosures of the net increase or decrease in
the unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments to include our new derivatives
disclosures. 281 We recognize that Regulation S-X, which organizes net realized gains and
losses (and net increases or decreases in the unrealized appreciation or depreciation) by
investment type, diverges from our approach in proposed Form N-PORT, which
organizes net realized gain or loss and net change in unrealized appreciation or
depreciation attributable to derivatives by each instrument’s primary underlying risk
exposure. 282 While we believe that organizing these disclosures by exposure type, which
are derived from ASC Topic 815, are appropriate for Form N-PORT; we also believe that
it is more appropriate for statement of operations disclosures to be organized by major
types of investment transactions, as doing so would be consistent with the types of

See Item B.5.c of proposed Form N-PORT.

144

investments requiring separate schedules in Article 12 and allow investors to relate the
disclosures in the schedule of investments with the statement of operations. 283
We are also proposing to eliminate Regulation S-X’s requirement for specific
disclosure of written options activity under current rule 6-07.7(c). 284 This provision was
adopted prior to FASB adopting disclosures generally applicable to derivatives, including
written options, now required by ASC Topic 815. 285 We are proposing that the
requirement for specific disclosures for written options activity be removed because they
are generally duplicative of the requirements of ASC Topic 815, which include disclosure
of the fair value amounts of derivative instruments, gains and losses on derivative
instruments, and information that would enable users to understand the volume of
derivative activity. 286
We are also proposing to eliminate the exception in Schedule II of current rule
6-10 which does not require reporting under current rule 12-13 if the investments, at both
the beginning and end of the period, amount to one percent or less of the value of total

283

See ASC 815.

284

See rule 6-07.7(c) of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.6-07.7(c)].

285

See ASC 815.

286

Id. Rule 6-07.7(c) requires disclosure in a note to the financial statements of the number and
associated dollar amounts as to option contracts written: (i) At the beginning of the period;
(ii) during the period; (iii) expired during the period; (iv) closed during the period; (v)
exercised during the period; (vi) balance at end of the period. The balances at the beginning
of the period and end of the period are available in the prior period-end and current periodend schedules of open option contracts written, respectively. By eliminating the written
options roll-forward, investors would no longer have information regarding the number of
contracts expired, closed, or exercised during the period. However, disclosures required by
ASC 815 provide gains and losses on derivative instruments, including written options, along
with information that would enable users to understand the volume of derivative activity
during the period.

145

investments. 287 We believe that it is appropriate to propose eliminating this exception,
because a fund may have significant notional amount in its portfolio that could be valued
at one percent or less of the value of total investments. Accordingly, removing this
exception would provide more transparency to investors regarding a fund’s derivatives
activity.
We request comment on our proposed changes to Article 6 of Regulation S-X.

Article 6 of Regulation S-X that we should propose? If so, what amendments and

Are there alternative methods of presentation of derivatives that we should
consider, rather than the proposed requirement that all schedules be presented in

As we discussed above, among others, our basis for proposing to eliminate rule 610(a) was our belief that a fund and its consolidated subsidiaries should present

subsidiaries. Is this proposed change appropriate? Why or why not? Should we
require different or additional information about consolidated investments?

We request comment on our proposal to eliminate rule 6-04.4, which requires

our proposed changes appropriate? Why or why not?

Would the disclosure required under proposed rule 6.03(m) concerning income
and expenses in connection with securities lending activities provide meaningful
information to investors or other potential users? For example, would the
disclosures regarding compensation and other fee and expense information
relating to the securities lending agent and cash collateral manager be useful to
fund boards in evaluating their securities lending arrangements? Would these
disclosures be sufficient for this purpose, or would additional information be
necessary, for example, to put the fee and expense information in context (e.g.,
the nature of the services provided by the securities lending agent and cash
collateral manager)? Should the Commission instead require that these or other
similar disclosures, be provided elsewhere in the fund’s financial statements (e.g.,
the Statement of Operations), or provided as part of other disclosure documents
(e.g., the Statement of Additional Information) or reporting forms (e.g., proposed
Form N-CEN)? Why or why not?

Is the proposed disclosure under rule 6-07.1 for non-cash dividends and paymentin-kind interest on the statement of operations meaningful to investors or other

interest be disclosed?

•

We request comment on our proposal to eliminate Regulation S-X’s requirements
for specific disclosure of written options activity under rule 6-07.7(c). Does the

Option for Website Transmission of Shareholder Reports

1.

Overview

The Commission is proposing new rule 30e-3 under the Investment Company
Act, which would, if adopted, permit, but not require, a fund to satisfy requirements
under the Act and rules thereunder to transmit reports to shareholders if the fund makes
the reports and certain other materials accessible on its website. Reliance on the rule
would be subject to certain conditions, including conditions relating to (1) the availability
of the shareholder report and other required information, (2) prior shareholder consent,
(3) notice to shareholders of the availability of shareholder reports, and (4) shareholder
ability to request paper copies of the shareholder report or other required information.
This new option is intended to modernize the manner in which periodic
information is transmitted to shareholders. We believe it would improve the
information’s overall accessibility while reducing burdens such as printing and mailing
costs borne by funds, and ultimately, by fund shareholders. As described below, today’s
proposal draws on the Commission’s experience with use of the Internet as a medium to
provide documents and other information to investors. The proposal is supported by
recent Commission investor testing efforts and other empirical research concerning
investors’ preferences about report transmission methods and use of the Internet for
financial and other purposes generally. At the same time, the Commission recognizes
that empirical research, discussed below, demonstrates that some investors continue to
prefer to receive paper reports. The proposal therefore incorporates a set of protections

149

intended to avoid investor confusion and protect the ability of investors to choose their
preferred means of communication.
Reliance on the rule would be optional. Funds that do not maintain websites or
that otherwise wish to transmit shareholder reports in paper or pursuant to the
Commission’s existing electronic delivery guidance would continue to be able to satisfy
transmission requirements by those transmission methods. Furthermore, under the rule as
proposed, a fund relying on the rule to satisfy shareholder report transmission obligations
with respect to certain shareholders would not be precluded from transmitting
shareholder reports to other shareholders pursuant to the Commission’s electronic
delivery guidance. We expect that funds would continue to rely on the Commission’s
guidance to electronically transmit reports to shareholders who have elected to receive
reports electronically, and rely on the rule with respect to shareholders who have not so
elected (i.e., those who currently receive printed shareholder reports by mail).
2.

Discussion

Funds are generally required to transmit reports to shareholders on a semiannual
basis. 288 Historically, these reports have been printed and mailed to shareholders. With
advances in technology and, in particular, the increasing use of the Internet as a medium
through which information, financial or otherwise, is made accessible, we have
previously issued guidance describing the circumstances under which transmission of

288

See section 30(e) of the Investment Company Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-29(e)]; rule 30e-1 (reports
to stockholders of management companies); rule 30e-2 (reports to shareholders of unit
investment trusts substantially all the assets of which consist of securities issued by a
management company).

150

disclosure documents may be effected through electronic means. 289 Under that guidance,
funds may transmit documents electronically provided that a number of conditions
related to shareholder notice, access, and evidence of delivery are met. 290
Recent investor testing and Internet usage trends have highlighted that preferences
about electronic delivery of information have evolved, and that many investors would
prefer enhanced availability of fund information on the Internet. For example, investor
testing sponsored by the Commission and conducted in 2011 291 suggested that an investor

documents on matters such as telephonic and global consent; issuer liability for website

More recently, the Division of Investment Management published guidance stating the staff’s
position that electronic delivery of a notice pursuant to rule 19a-1 under the Investment
Company Act, consistent with the Commission’s electronic delivery guidance, would satisfy

In 2011, the Commission engaged a consultant to conduct investor testing regarding
shareholder reports. We have placed the consultant’s report concerning that testing
(“Investor Testing of Mutual Fund Shareholder Reports”) in the comment file for the
proposed rule (available at www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-15/s70815.shtml). Separately,
Commission staff prepared a study of investor financial literacy pursuant to section 917 of the
Dodd-Frank Act. Materials relating to this study, including the staff’s report, are available at
http://www.investor.gov/publications-research-studies/sec-research.
Also, in 2007, the Commission engaged a consultant to conduct focus group interviews and a
telephone survey concerning investors’ views and opinions about various disclosure

151

looking for a fund’s annual report is most likely to seek it out on the fund’s website,
rather than request it by mail or phone or by retrieving it from the Commission’s EDGAR
system. 292 Many investors indicated that they would prefer that fund information be
made available in both electronic and print versions, with a plurality of respondents
preferring electronic transmission by email with the option to easily request a print copy
of a particular report, though a significant minority indicated that they would still prefer
to receive a print copy through the mail. 293
In the time since this investor testing was conducted, access to and use of the
Internet has continued to increase significantly, including among demographic groups
that have previously been less apt to use the Internet. For example, a study conducted by
documents filed by companies, including mutual funds. We have placed the consultant’s
report concerning the focus group testing and related transcripts in the comment file for the
proposed rule (available at www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-15/s70815.shtml). The
consultant’s report concerning the telephone survey (“Telephone Survey Report”) is available
at http://www.sec.gov/pdf/disclosuredocs.pdf. Respondents to the telephone survey who had
received a mutual fund shareholder report, for example, were asked about their preferences
for a mode of delivery of the information contained in a shareholder report, and “an Internet
website” received the highest ratings (with 49% rating it 7 or above on a 10 point scale),
compared with 42% of respondents who rated “a paper copy” 7 or above. See Telephone
Survey Report at 96.
292

See Investor Testing of Mutual Fund Shareholder Reports, supra note 291, at 72. When
asked “If you wanted to see a mutual fund annual report, how would you access/obtain the
report? Please check all that apply.,” 59.5% of respondents selected “look on the mutual fund
company’s website,” compared with 33.3% who selected “ask my financial advisor,” 24.5%
who selected “request by mail,” 21.0% who selected “do a web search (Google, etc.),” 18.8%
who selected “request by phone,” 12.3% who selected “check with my employer’s HR or
employee benefits representative,” 11.3% who selected “look on the SEC’s website or on
EDGAR,” and 2.3% who selected “other.” Id.

See id. at 185. When asked “How would you prefer to receive information about your mutual
fund investments?,” 25.8% of respondents selected “online through a link provided in an
e-mail, with the option to request a print version,” compared with 19.5% of respondents who
selected “in print through the mail, with a web address provided for an online version,”
18.5% who selected “online through a link provided in an e-mail,” 16.5% who selected “a
print summary of the key information through the mail, with a web address provided for a
complete online version,” 13.8% who selected “in print through the mail,” and 6.0% who

the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project in 2013 found that only
15% of American adults ages 18 and older do not use the Internet or email—falling from
26% in 2011, when our investor testing was conducted, and from 39% a decade before in
2001. 294 These researchers also found that for the first time in 2012, more than half of
adults over the age of 64 used the Internet, a figure that climbed to 59% in 2013. 295
These trends have also extended to use of the Internet for financial purposes. For
example, a recent survey by the Investment Company Institute found that in 2014, 94%
of U.S. households owning mutual funds had Internet access (up from 68% in 2000), with
widespread use among various age groups, education levels and income levels. 296 The
year before, the Investment Company Institute found that 82% of U.S. households
owning mutual funds used the Internet for financial purposes. 297
Given the evolving preferences and trends in Internet usage, in particular with
regard to the delivery of financial information, we believe that it is appropriate to propose
a rule that would permit the website transmission of fund shareholder reports, while
maintaining the ability of shareholders who prefer to receive reports in paper to receive
reports in that form. Funds and their shareholders would benefit from the reductions in
related printing and mailing costs. Also, the rule, as proposed, would consolidate current

with respect to Internet access in mutual fund owning households: (1) head of household age
65 or older, 86% have access, (2) education level of high school diploma or less, 84% have
access, and (3) household income of less than $50,000, 84% have access.

and historical portfolio holdings information in one location (i.e., a particular website, as
opposed to having some information on one website and other information on EDGAR),
whereas currently, funds are not required to transmit or otherwise make accessible to
investors holdings information as to the first and third fiscal quarters. 298
Although we believe the proposed rule would benefit many investors, we
recognize that there are concerns associated with how some investors may be affected.
For example, as discussed above, investor testing suggests that a significant minority of
investors prefer to receive paper reports and that some demographic groups of investors
may be less likely to use the Internet. Some of these investors might not fully understand
the actions they would need to take under the proposed rule to continue to receive their
reports in paper. We believe that it is critical that these investors continue to receive
disclosure in a means that is convenient and accessible for them. In addition, there is a
risk that even some investors that prefer to use the Internet might be less likely to review
reports electronically than they would in paper. We also believe it is critical that the
proposed rule communicate the importance of the information that would be made
available on the website.
Accordingly, as discussed below, the proposed rule would include certain
safeguards for investors who wish to continue to receive shareholder reports in paper, by
requiring prior consent of investors, and continuing to make shareholder reports and other
required information available in paper upon request. The proposed rule would also

Currently, funds report their complete portfolio holdings as of the first and third fiscal
quarters on Form N-Q, which is accessible only through EDGAR. There is no separate
requirement for funds to transmit or otherwise make this information available to
shareholders.

154

include requirements intended to emphasize the importance of the information available
on the website. These protections are intended to maintain the ability of investors who
prefer to receive reports in paper to continue to do so without confusion, as well as to
provide to investors clear and prominent printed notifications each time a new
shareholder report is made available online. We request comment below on the potential
concerns articulated above, as well as the steps we are proposing to address them while
capturing the potential benefits for investors and funds of electronic communication.
3.

Rule 30e-3

As proposed, new rule 30e-3 would provide that a fund’s annual or semiannual
report to shareholders would be considered transmitted to a shareholder of record if
certain conditions set forth in the rule are satisfied as to (a) availability of the report and
other materials, (b) shareholder consent, (c) notice to shareholders, and (d) delivery of
materials upon request of the shareholder. 299 As discussed below, these conditions are
generally consistent with similar conditions in other rules adopted by the Commission,
including its rules regarding the use of a summary prospectus, internet delivery of proxy
materials, and “householding” of certain disclosure documents.
a.

Availability of Report and Other Materials

Under the rule as proposed, the fund’s report to shareholders under rule 30e-1 or
30e-2 would be required to be publicly accessible, free of charge, at a specified website
address. 300 The report would need to be accessible beginning no later than the date of the
transmission in reliance on this option, and ending no earlier than the date when the fund

Proposed rule 30e-3(a).

300

Proposed rule 30e-3(b)(1).

155

next “transmits” a report required by rule 30e-1 or 30e-2. 301 This requirement is intended
to provide shareholders with the opportunity for ongoing access from the date of intended
transmission until the date that the fund transmits its next shareholder report. 302
In addition to the most current shareholder report, the rule as proposed would
require that the fund post on its website (1) any previous shareholder report transmitted to
shareholders of record within the last 244 days, 303 and (2) in the case of a fund that is not
a money market fund or an SBIC, the fund’s complete portfolio holdings as of the close
of its most recent first and third fiscal quarters, if any, after the date on which its
registration statement became effective. 304 In addition, a fund that is not a money market
fund or an SBIC would be required to make its portfolio holdings as of the end of the
next fiscal quarter accessible in the same manner within 60 days after the close of that
period. 305 We are proposing exceptions to the posting requirement of first and third fiscal
quarter portfolio holdings schedules for money market funds and SBICs because money

302

See 1995 Release, supra note 289 (noting that to satisfy access requirements under the
Commission’s electronic delivery guidance, “as is the case with a paper document, a recipient
should have the opportunity to retain the information or have ongoing access equivalent to
personal retention).

303

Proposed rule 30e-3(b)(1)(ii). Thus, for example, a fund with a December 31 fiscal year end
wishing to rely on rule 30e-3 to transmit its annual report to shareholders would also be
required to ensure that its semiannual report as of June 30 is similarly accessible. Only those
annual and semiannual reports that are required under rule 30e-1 or rule 30e-2 are required to
be accessible in order to rely on rule 30e-3. Thus, for example, if a fund is transmitting a
report for its first operational semiannual period, the fund could rely on rule 30e-3 to transmit
that report, despite not having made a previous report publicly accessible provided that it
meets the other required conditions.

304

See proposed rule 30e-3(b)(1)(iii).

305

See proposed rule 30e-3(b)(2). For example, a fund with a December 31 fiscal year end
wishing to rely on rule 30e-3 to transmit its annual report to shareholders would also be
required to ensure that its complete portfolio holdings for the first quarter of the next year is
similarly available.

156

market funds are currently required to post certain portfolio holdings and other
information on their websites pursuant to rule 2a-7, 306 and because SBICs are neither
currently required to file reports on Form N-Q, 307 nor would SBICs be required to file
reports on proposed Form N-PORT. 308
These materials would also be required to be publicly accessible in the same
manner and for the same time period as the current shareholder report. 309 We are
proposing this requirement so that shareholders have access to a complete year of
portfolio holdings information in one location (i.e., the website on which the report
transmitted under the proposed rule is made accessible), rather than have to separately
access portfolio holdings information for the first and third quarters by accessing the
fund’s reports on Form N-PORT for those periods.
To conform the form and content of the portfolio holdings schedules for the first
and third quarters to those schedules presented in the fund’s shareholder reports for the
second and fourth quarters, the proposed rule would require the schedules for the first and
third quarters to be presented in accordance with the schedules set forth in §§210.12-12 –
12-14 of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.12-12 – 12-14], which need not be audited. 310 As
discussed above, we have also proposed to require that these materials be filed as exhibits

306

See rule 2a-7(h)(10). In 2014, we adopted certain amendments to the website disclosure
requirements for money market funds under rule 2a-7. The compliance date for these
amendments is April 14, 2016. See Money Market Fund Reform 2014 Release, supra note
13, at sections III.E.9 and III.N.4.

to Form N-PORT, regardless of whether the fund intends to rely on the rule to satisfy its
shareholder report transmission obligations. 311
These website portfolio disclosure requirements would be generally consistent
with funds’ current disclosure obligations under Regulation S-X for reports filed on
Forms N-Q and N-CSR. 312 Accordingly, we anticipate that most funds would have
established procedures in place to report and validate such disclosures, and that funds
would be familiar with these disclosure requirements. These website portfolio disclosure
requirements are also intended to provide disclosures that would be easily understood and
familiar to investors, because these disclosures would contain similar information and
would be presented in a similar manner as those currently included in shareholder reports.
Proposed rule 30e-3 would require compliance with certain conditions designed to
ensure the accessibility of shareholder reports and other required materials. 313 First, the
website address on which the shareholder reports and other required portfolio information
are made accessible could not be the Commission’s website address for electronic
filing. 314 Second, the materials required to be posted on the website would have to be
presented in a format that is convenient for both reading online and printing on paper, and
persons accessing the materials would have to be able to permanently retain (free of

311

See supra Part II.A.2.j.

312

See generally supra note 27.

313

These requirements are largely similar to the accessibility requirements of rule 498 under the
Securities Act, which allows funds to use a summary prospectus, and rule 14a-16 under the
Securities Exchange Act, which requires issuers and other soliciting persons to furnish proxy
materials by posting these materials on a public website and notifying shareholders of the
availability of these materials and how to access them.

See proposed rule 30e-3(b)(3). Currently, the Commission’s electronic filing system for fund
documents is EDGAR.

charge) an electronic copy of the materials in this format. 315 These conditions are
designed to ensure that shareholder reports and other information posted on a fund’s
website pursuant to the proposed rule are user-friendly and allow shareholders the same
ease of reference and retention abilities they would have with paper copies of the
information.
Third, the rule as proposed would include a safe harbor provision that would
allow a fund to continue relying on the rule even if it did not meet the posting
requirements of the rule for a temporary period of time. 316 In order to rely on this safe
harbor, a fund would be required to have reasonable procedures in place to ensure that the
required materials are posted on its website in the manner required by the rule and take
prompt action to correct noncompliance with these posting requirements. 317 We are
proposing this safe harbor because we recognize that there may be times when, due to
events beyond a fund’s control, such as system outages or other technological issues,
natural disasters, acts of terrorism, pandemic illnesses, or other circumstances, a fund is
temporarily not in compliance with the Internet posting requirements of the rule. 318

315

See proposed rules 30e-3(b)(4) and (5).

316

See proposed rule 30e-3(b)(6). The rule provides that the conditions in paragraphs (b)(1)
through (b)(5) of the rule (i.e., the posting requirements) shall be deemed to be met,
notwithstanding the fact that the materials required by paragraph (b)(1) of the rule are not
available for a period of time in the manner required by the posting requirements, so long as
certain conditions are met. See id.

317

See proposed rules 30e-3(b)(6)(i) and (ii). The rule would require prompt action “as soon as
practicable following the earlier of the time at which it knows or reasonably should have
known” that the required documents are not available in the manner prescribed by the posting
requirements of the rule.

318

Compare rule 498(e)(4) of the Securities Act (providing a similar safe harbor under the
summary prospectus rule for the same reasons).

159

b.

Shareholder Consent

While we believe that many investors would prefer electronic transmission of
shareholder reports based on investor testing and Internet usage trends, we also
acknowledge that there likely will be investors that may continue to prefer receiving
shareholder reports in paper. 319 To maintain the ability of those shareholders to receive
paper copies of their shareholder reports, the rule as proposed would require that a fund
obtain shareholder consent prior to relying on the rule to satisfy transmission obligations
with respect to a particular shareholder. 320 Specifically, rule 30e-3 as proposed would
permit electronic transmission of shareholder report to a particular shareholder only if the
shareholder has either previously consented to this method of transmission, 321 or has been
determined to have provided implied consent under certain conditions specified in the

319

See supra notes 291–296 and accompanying text.

320

These conditions are substantially similar to certain of the conditions relating to the
Commission’s rules on “householding” prospectuses, shareholder reports, and proxy
statements and information statements to investors who share an address. See, e.g., rule 154
under the Securities Act [17 CFR 230.154] (permitting householding of prospectuses); rules
30e-1 and 30e-2 under the Investment Company Act (permitting householding of fund
shareholder reports); rules 14a-3 and 14c-3 under the Exchange Act (permitting householding
of proxy statements and information statements). See generally Delivery of Disclosure
Documents to Households, Investment Company Act Release No. 24123 (Nov. 4, 1999) [64
FR 62540 (Nov. 16, 1999)] (adopting householding rules with respect to prospectuses and
shareholder reports); Delivery of Proxy Statements and Information Statements to
Households, Investment Company Release No. 24715 (Oct. 27, 2000) [65 FR 65736 (Nov. 2,
2000) (adopting householding rules with respect to proxy statements and information
statements). For purposes of the householding rules, consent may be written or implied.

321

While the householding rules require that consent be “in writing,” we are not proposing a
similar “in writing” requirement as, consistent with the Commission’s guidance on electronic
delivery, consent may be provided in a number of ways, including in writing, electronically,
or telephonically. See 1995 Release, supra note 289 (noting that one method for satisfying
evidence of delivery is to obtain informed consent from an investor to receive information
through a particular medium); 1996 Release, supra note 289 (stating that informed consent
should be made by written or electronic means); 2000 Release, supra note 289 (stating
Commission’s view that an issuer or market intermediary may obtain an informed consent
telephonically, as long as a record of that consent is retained).

160

rule. 322 Under the proposed rule, each series of a registrant offering multiple series
would need to obtain separate consent as to a shareholder, regardless of whether consent
was obtained from that shareholder by other series offered by that registrant. 323
To obtain implied consent as to a shareholder, the fund would be required to
transmit to the shareholder a separate written statement (“Initial Statement”), at least 60
days before it begins to rely on the rule, notifying the shareholder of the fund’s intent to
make future shareholder reports available on the fund’s website until the shareholder
revokes consent. 324 As proposed, the Initial Statement must be written using plain
English principles so that it will be easily understood by most investors 325 and:
•

state that future shareholder reports will be accessible, free of charge, at a
website; 326

•

explain that the fund will no longer mail printed copies of shareholder reports to
the shareholder unless the shareholder notifies the fund that he or she wishes to
receive printed reports in the future; 327

•

include a toll-free telephone number and be accompanied by a reply form that is
pre-addressed with postage-paid and that includes the information that the fund
would need to identify the shareholder, and explain that the shareholder can use

receive printed reports in the future; 328
•

state that the fund will mail printed copies of future shareholder reports within 30
days after the fund receives notice of the shareholder’s preference; 329 and

•

contain a prominent legend in bold-face type that states: “How to Continue
Receiving Printed Copies of Shareholder Reports.” 330
The Initial Statement is designed to permit funds to infer that a shareholder has

consented to electronic transmission of future shareholder reports by alerting the
shareholder to the fact that the shareholder will no longer receive printed copies in the
future unless the shareholder notifies the fund that he or she wishes to receive print
copies of such reports in the future. Because of the importance of this information, in
addition to the required prominent legend on the envelope in which the Initial Statement
is delivered or on the Initial Statement itself, the proposed rule would require certain
conditions intended to ensure that the Initial Statement is not obscured by other materials.
Specifically, the proposed rule would require that the Initial Statement could not be
incorporated into or combined with another document, 331 nor could it be sent along with
other shareholder communications (with the exception of the fund’s current summary

328

Proposed rule 30e-3(c)(1)(iii).

329

Proposed rule 30e-3(c)(1)(iv).

330

Proposed rule 30e-3(c)(1)(v). This legend would be required to appear on the envelope on
which the Initial Statement is delivered, or alternatively, if the Initial Statement is delivered

Initial Statement or on the envelope in which the Initial Statement is delivered.

162

prospectus, statutory prospectus, statement of additional information, or Notice of
Internet Availability of Proxy Materials under rule 14a-16 under the Exchange Act). 332
If the fund does not receive the reply form or other notification indicating that a
particular shareholder wishes to continue to receive paper reports by mail within 60 days
after the fund sends the Initial Statement, then the fund may begin to transmit shareholder
reports to that shareholder electronically, provided that it meets the other conditions of
the rule. 333
c.

Notice

Proposed rule 30e-3 would require funds relying on the rule with respect to a
shareholder who has consented to electronic transmission pursuant to the conditions of
paragraph (c)(1) of the rule to send a notice (“Notice”) within 60 days of the close of the
fiscal period to which the report relates. 334 The proposed requirements for a Notice
largely mirror the notice requirements under the Commission’s rules mandating the
posting of proxy materials online. 335

332

See proposed rule 30e-3(c)(3). For purposes of the proposed rule, (1) “summary prospectus”
would mean the summary prospectus described in paragraph (b) of rule 498, (2) “statutory
prospectus” would mean a prospectus that satisfies the requirements of section 10(a) of the
Securities Act, and (3) “statement of additional information” means the statement of
additional information required by Part B of the registration form applicable to the fund. See
proposed rule 30e-3(h).

333

Proposed rule 30e-3(c)(4).

334

See proposed rule 30e-3(d). For purposes of the rule, “Notice” would be defined as the notice
described in paragraph (d) of the rule. See proposed rule 30e-3(h)(3).

335

See rule 14a-16 under the Exchange Act [17 CFR 240.14a-16].

163

As proposed, the Notice, like the Initial Statement, would be required to be
written using plain English principles so that it will be easily understood by most
investors. 336 and:
•

contain a prominent legend in bold-face type stating that an important report to
shareholders is available online and in print by request; 337

•

state that each shareholder report contains important information about the fund,
including its portfolio holdings, and is available on the Internet or, upon request,
by mail, and encouraging shareholders to access and review the report; 338

•

include a website address that leads directly to each report the fund is transmitting
to the recipient shareholder in reliance on rule 30e-3; 339

•

include the website address where the shareholder report and other required
portfolio information is posted; 340

•

provide instructions on how a shareholder may request, at no charge, a paper copy
of the shareholder report or other materials required to be made accessible online,

336

See proposed rules 30e-3(d)(1) and (e).

337

Proposed rule 30e-3(d)(1)(i). The rule as proposed would also require that the legend include
the specific fund name to which the Notice relates, or the fund complex name.

338

Proposed rule 30e-3(d)(1)(ii).

339

Proposed rule 30e-3(d)(1)(iii). A fund could send a joint Notice with other funds held by the
same shareholder in a fund complex; however, the Notice would have to include a link to
each of those funds’ shareholder reports. A fund may also send a separate Notice if it so
wishes.

340

Proposed rule 30e-3(d)(1)(iv). The website address would have to be specific enough to lead
investors directly to the documents that are required to be posted online under the rule. The
website address could be a central site with prominent links to each document, but could not
be a home page or section of the website other than where the documents are posted. See id.

164

and an indication that the shareholder will not receive a paper copy of the report
unless requested; 341 and
•

include a toll-free telephone number and must be accompanied by a reply form
that is pre-addressed with postage-paid and that includes the information that the
fund would need to identify the shareholder, and explain that the shareholder can
use either of those two methods at any time to notify the fund that he or she
wishes to receive printed reports in the future. 342
The proposed Notice is designed to alert shareholders to the availability of a

shareholder report online and to provide shareholders with information on how to obtain
a paper copy of the report if they should want one. We believe it is important to limit the
information in the Notice and the other materials sent along with the Notice in order to
ensure that shareholders are made aware of the availability of a shareholder report and so
that the availability of the report does not become obscured. Therefore, the rule as
proposed would limit the information contained in the Notice to the information required
by the rule. 343 The Notice also could not be incorporated into or combined with another
document, 344 nor could it be sent along with other shareholder communications (with the
exception of the fund’s current summary prospectus, prospectus, statement of additional
information, or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials under rule 14a-16
under the Exchange Act). 345

165

Similar to the Commission’s rules on householding prospectuses, shareholder
reports, and proxy statements and information statements, 346 proposed rule 30e-3 also
would allow funds to send one Notice to shareholders who share an address so long as the
fund addresses the Notice to the shareholders individually or as a group. 347 In addition,
the proposed rule would require funds to file a form of the Notice with the Commission
not later than 10 days after the Notice is sent to shareholders. 348 This filing would occur
on a new EDGAR submission type which would be created by the Commission. We
believe the Notice filing requirement would assist us in overseeing compliance with the
rule.

Delivery Upon Request

Proposed rule 30e-3 would also require, as a condition to reliance on the rule to
transmit shareholder reports electronically, that the fund (or a financial intermediary
through which shares of the fund may be purchased or sold) must send, at no cost to the
requestor and by U.S. first class mail or other reasonably prompt means, a paper copy of
any of the materials discussed above—viz., the fund’s most recent annual and semiannual
reports, and the fund’s portfolio holdings as of its most recent first and third fiscal
quarters—to any person requesting such a copy within three business days after receiving
a request for a paper copy. 349 This requirement is intended to allow for investors to

346

See, e.g., rule 154 under the Securities Act (permitting householding of prospectuses); rules
30e-1 and 30e-2 under the Investment Company Act (permitting householding of fund
shareholder reports); rules 14a-3 and 14c-3 under the Exchange Act (permitting householding
of proxy statements and information statements).

347

See proposed rule 30e-3(d)(5).

348

See proposed rule 30e-3(d)(6).

349

Proposed rule 30e-3(f).

166

receive shareholder reports and portfolio information in print format, if they so prefer,
even if they have consented to electronic transmission without revoking the consent. 350
e.

Prospectuses and Statements of Additional Information Transmitted
Under Rule 30e-1(d)

Rule 30e-1(d) under the Investment Company Act permits an open-end
management investment company to transmit a copy of its prospectus or statement of
additional information in place of its shareholder report, if it includes all of the
information that would otherwise be required to be contained in the shareholder report. 351
We recognize that the nature and purpose of the fund prospectus is different from that of
fund shareholder reports. Accordingly, at this time, we are not proposing to permit a
similar regime for fund prospectus delivery obligations under the Securities Act. As a
result, we do not believe that it would be appropriate to permit the transmission of
statutory prospectuses in the manner provided under the proposed rule. Therefore, the
proposed rule would not be available to a fund seeking to transmit a copy of its currently
effective statutory prospectus or statement of additional, or both, as permitted by
paragraph (d) of rule 30e-1. 352
4.

Use of Summary Schedule of Investments

Under the current rules, in lieu of providing a complete schedule of portfolio
investments as part of the financial statements included in its shareholder report, a fund
350

See, e.g., 1995 Release, supra note 289 (stating the Commission’s belief that “as a matter of
policy, where a person has a right to receive a document under the federal securities laws and
chooses to receive it electronically, that person should be provided with a paper version of the
document if any consent to receive documents electronically were revoked or the person
specifically requests a paper copy (regardless of whether any previously provided consent
was revoked.”).

351

See rule 30e-1(d).

352

Proposed rule 30e-3(g).

167

may provide a summary schedule of portfolio investments (“Summary Schedule”). 353
Pursuant to Rule 12-12C of Regulation S-X, the Summary Schedule generally must list
separately the 50 largest issues and any other issue the value of which exceeded one
percent of the net asset value of the fund at the close of the period. 354
We believe that use of the summary schedule may be unnecessary, 355 and in
particular, may be potentially confusing or cumbersome to investors seeking to access the
fund’s complete portfolio holdings. 356 For these reasons, we are proposing amendments
to our registration forms that would restrict funds relying on proposed rule 30e-3 from
providing a Summary Schedule in their shareholder reports in lieu of a complete
schedule. 357
5.

Related Disclosure Amendments

We are also proposing some related amendments to certain of our rules and forms.
First, we are proposing to amend rule 498 under the Securities Act, which concerns the
use of a summary prospectus, 358 to require funds relying on proposed rule 30e-3 to

353

See, e.g., Instruction 1 to Item 27(b)(1) of Form N-1A (permitting the inclusion of Schedule
VI – Summary schedule of investments in securities of unaffiliated issuers under Rule
12-12C of Regulation S-X in lieu of Schedule 1 — Investments of securities of unaffiliated
issuers under Rule 12-12 of Regulation S-X.

354

See rule 12-12C, n.3 Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.12-12C].

355

For example, a fund using the summary schedule for considerations relating to printing and
mailing costs would likely have fewer such concerns if the report is posted on its website in
reliance on the proposed rule.

356

For example, a shareholder consenting to electronic transmission that wishes to view the
complete portfolio holdings would, pursuant to the rule as proposed, first receive a notice of
the availability of the report, then take the step to access the report on the fund’s website,
only to have to take a subsequent step to request or otherwise access the full schedule.

357

See proposed amendments to Item 27(b) of Form N-1A; Item 24, Instruction 7 of Form N-2;
and Item 28(a), Instruction 7(i) of Form N-3.

358

See rule 498 under the Securities Act [17 CFR 230.498].

168

include as part of the legend on the cover page of the fund’s summary prospectus the
website address required to be included in the Notice. 359 As proposed, the website
address that leads to shareholder report information could be the same as the website
address that leads to prospectus information, provided that the other conditions of each
rule are met, but funds would also be permitted to use different website addresses for
each type of material and provide both addresses in the legend. 360 This requirement is
intended to provide investors an additional reminder of the availability of shareholder
report and related portfolio holdings information on the fund’s website.
Second, we are proposing to amend rule 498 under the Securities Act and rule
14a-16 under the Exchange Act to include an Initial Statement or Notice that would be
required by proposed rule 30e-3 among the materials that are permitted to accompany
and have equal or greater prominence than the summary prospectus prepared in reliance
on rule 498 and a notice of Internet availability of proxy materials. 361 These amendments
are intended to permit a fund’s Initial Statement and Notice to be sent with its summary
prospectus or notice of Internet availability of proxy materials if the fund wishes to send
them in that manner. 362

•

To what extent are funds currently relying on the Commission’s guidance on the
use of electronic media to deliver or transmit disclosure documents and other
information to shareholders? To what extent have shareholders elected to receive
disclosure documents and other information in general, and shareholder reports in
particular, through electronic means? In the case of shareholders who have
elected electronic delivery of disclosure documents in general, and delivery of
shareholder reports in particular, to what extent are those shareholders accessing
those materials online? Please provide supportive data to the extent available.

•

If proposed rule 30e-3 is adopted, to what extent would funds (i) choose to rely on
the rule, and (ii) continue to rely on guidance concerning electronic transmission
that we have already issued?

•

Would availability of the rule change in any way current industry practices on
transmitting shareholder reports electronically? For example, we expect that
funds would continue to rely on the Commission’s guidance to electronically
transmit reports to shareholders who have elected to receive reports electronically,
and rely on the rule with respect to shareholders who have not so elected. For
administrative or other purposes, would funds discontinue their reliance on the
Commission’s guidance and instead rely on the rule to transmit reports
electronically with respect to their entire shareholder base? If so, why? What
impact, if any, would the proposed rule have on the transmission of reports to
shareholders of UITs required to transmit reports pursuant to rule 30e-2 under the
Investment Company Act? What impact, if any, would the proposed rule have on
the transmission of reports to shareholders holding fund shares through financial

170

intermediaries or other omnibus type arrangements? Should we permit funds that
rely on rule 30e-3 to continue to rely on prior electronic transmission guidance for
certain of their shareholders? Why or why not?
•

If rule 30e-3 is adopted as proposed, in the case of funds relying on the rule to
transmit reports electronically to one or more shareholders, would funds
nonetheless seek shareholder consent to transmit reports to those shareholders
pursuant to the Commission’s electronic guidance in lieu of the rule? Why or
why not?

•

Should we, as we have proposed, allow funds to transmit reports to shareholders
electronically by making them accessible on a website? Would investors prefer
that these materials be transmitted in this manner? What would be the effect of
proposed rule 30e-3 on the ability of investors to access shareholder reports?
Would the shareholder report information be more useful or less useful if
transmitted in the manner proposed? Would investors be more aware or less
aware of the availability of the information if transmitted in reliance on the
proposed rule?

•

Would any positive or negative effect of the proposed rule on investors be
disproportionately greater for certain investors than for others? If so, which
investors would be disproportionately affected, to what extent, and how would
such effects manifest? What, if any, additional measures could help mitigate any
such disproportionate effects? Please provide supportive data to the extent
available.

171

•

Rule 30e-3 as proposed contains a number of conditions to be satisfied for
reliance on the rule. Are the proposed conditions appropriate? Are there
conditions that should be added or are any of the proposed conditions
inappropriate? If so, state the conditions and the reasons why.

•

The rule as proposed would require that the materials required to be accessible
online be publicly accessible, free of charge, at the website specified in the
Notice, and does not expressly require that the website be the fund’s website.
Should the rule require that the materials be accessible at the fund’s website?
Why or why not?

•

What materials should be required to be accessible in order for a fund to rely on
the rule? For example, we have proposed that a fund relying on the rule would be
required to make accessible the shareholder report, the shareholder report for the
prior period, and in the case of a fund that is a management company other than a
money market fund or an SBIC, the complete portfolio holdings for the most
recent first and third fiscal quarters. Is it appropriate to require funds to post
holdings information covering a full year? Should we require information be
posted covering a longer period or a shorter period? If so, why? Should money
market funds and SBICs relying on the rule be required to post complete portfolio
holdings for the first and third quarters? Why or why not?

•

The rule as proposed would require that the materials made accessible on the
website be presented in a format or formats that are convenient for both reading
online and printing on paper. Is the proposed format requirement appropriate?
Are there liability or other concerns that would arise in connection with meeting a

172

fund’s obligation to transmit shareholder reports under Section 30(e) and the rules
thereunder? Should we instead require that the materials be presented in a format
or formats that are human-readable and capable of being printed on paper in
human-readable format? Why or why not?
•

How soon should each of the materials be required to be accessible, and how long
should each be required to remain accessible?

•

The proposed rule would contain a safe harbor for instances in which the
materials required to be made accessible are not available for a temporary period
of time. Is the safe harbor as proposed appropriate, or should it be modified? For
example, should the rule be more proscriptive as to the period of time in which
action must be taken to resolve any issues?

•

Should we require the website on which the proposed rule’s required materials are
made accessible to incorporate safeguards to protect the anonymity of its visitors?
For example, should we require similar conditions to those provided in rule
14a-16 under the Exchange Act relating to Internet availability of proxy
materials? Why or why not? If so, what specific requirements should we
consider?

•

Should the proposed rule require that a shareholder consent to electronic
transmission of shareholder reports before a fund begins to rely on the rule?
Should we permit funds to obtain implied consent, as proposed, or should we
require funds to receive express consent? Are there certain circumstances in
which funds should not be permitted to obtain implied consent? For example, if
an investor upon opening a new account does not opt-in to electronic delivery of

173

documents, should the fund be permitted nonetheless to seek to rely on the
proposed rule as to that shareholder? Why or why not?
•

Under the proposed rule, each series of a registrant offering multiple series would
need to obtain separate consent as to a shareholder, regardless of whether consent
was obtained from that shareholder by other series offered by that registrant. If a
fund has obtained implied consent from a shareholder as to a particular series, and
subsequently the shareholder invests in one or more other series offered by the
fund, should the fund be required to obtain consent as to those other series, or
should the fund be permitted to infer consent as to all series offered by the fund?
Why or why not? Should the fund be permitted to infer consent as to only other
series offered by the registered investment company, or should the fund be
permitted to infer consent as to other funds within the fund complex? What, if
any, are the special considerations relating to investors who invest through
intermediaries?

•

Under the proposed rule, to obtain implied consent as to a shareholder, the fund
would be required to transmit to the shareholder an Initial Statement, at least 60
days before it begins to rely on the rule. Are the proposed disclosures for the
Initial Statement appropriate? Should a fund be required to provide to a
shareholder other disclosures before inferring consent to electronic transmission?

•

Should the rule require funds to provide multiple written statements (i.e., in
addition to the Initial Statement) prior to inferring consent to electronic
transmission? If so, how many additional statements and how long after the
Initial Statement should they be provided? What period of time after a fund

174

transmits the Initial Statement should we permit the fund to infer consent? Is 60
days an appropriate time? Why or why not?
•

What methods should shareholders be permitted to use to deny or revoke consent
to electronic transmission?

•

Should we permit the Initial Statement to be incorporated into, or combined with,
one or more other documents? If so, which documents should we permit the
Initial Statement to be incorporated into or combined with?

•

The rule as proposed would require that the Initial Statement must be sent
separately from other types of communications and may not accompany any other
document or materials except the fund’s current summary prospectus, statutory
prospectus, statement of additional information, or Notice of Internet Availability
of Proxy Materials. Is this requirement appropriate? Should we permit the Initial
Statement to accompany one or more other documents? If so, which documents?

•

Should we, as we have proposed for the Notice, permit the Initial Statement to be
sent in a “householded” manner?

•

Should we require that the Initial Statement not contain any additional
information other than that specified in the rule? Why or why not? Absent any
requirement specified by rule, what other information would funds generally
include in the Initial Statement? For example, would funds provide information
on how shareholders could elect to receive the shareholder report and other
documents and information electronically by satisfying the conditions contained
in the Commission’s guidance on use of electronic media relating to notice,
access, and evidence of delivery?

175

•

Should the rule permit funds to obtain implied consent from shareholders who
have previously revoked consent? If so, should the rule prescribe a minimum
period of time after consent was revoked before re-attempting to obtain implied
consent from a shareholder? What period should that be and why?

•

Should each fund be required to send a shareholder a Notice each time it transmits
a shareholder report electronically under the proposed rule? Why or why not?

•

We anticipate that the Notice would be sent in paper and mailed to shareholders.
Should we permit the Notice to be sent by email if the shareholder has provided
an email address? Why or why not? For example, are there any concerns that
under such an approach, while a shareholder may have provided an email address
(e.g., as part of opening an account), the shareholder may nonetheless neither
prefer nor expect to receive documents or other information through that
medium? To what extent are funds and intermediaries, pursuant to regulatory
requirements or otherwise, maintaining up-to-date e-mail addresses for investors?
Would an investor be more likely to view a Notice delivered by one method
versus another (i.e., print versus electronically)? Would an investor be more
likely to access the related shareholder report and other required materials when
notified by one method or the other?

•

Are the proposed disclosures for the Notice appropriate? Should we require that
the disclosure in the Notice concerning a shareholder’s ability to indicate a
preference for paper transmission in the future be preceded by an additional boldface legend or otherwise made more prominent?

176

•

Should we permit the Notice to be incorporated into, or combined with, one or
more other documents? If so, which documents should we permit the Notice to
be incorporated into or combined with?

•

The rule as proposed would require that the Notice must be sent separately from
other types of communications and may not accompany any other document or
materials except the fund’s current summary prospectus, statutory prospectus,
statement of additional information, or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy
Materials. Is this requirement appropriate? Should we permit the Notice to
accompany one or more other documents? If so, which documents? For
example, in the case of a Notice sent to a shareholder for the first time, should we
permit or require the Notice to be accompanied with materials explaining the new
transmission regime? Why or why not?

•

Should we, as proposed, permit funds to either send separate Notices for each
fund or send combined Notices for more than one fund held by a particular
shareholder, or should the rule require one or the other of those approaches?

•

Should we require that the Notice not contain any additional information other
than that specified in the rule? Why or why not? Absent any restriction by rule,
what other information would funds generally include in the Notice? For
example, would funds provide information on how shareholders could elect to
receive the shareholder report and other documents and information electronically
by satisfying the conditions contained in the Commission’s guidance on use of
electronic media relating to notice, access, and evidence of delivery?

177

•

In the case of management companies that are not SBICs, should we require such
funds to send a notice each time the fund makes accessible its complete portfolio
holdings for the first or third fiscal quarters? Why or why not?

•

Should we, as proposed, permit the Notice to be sent in a “householded” manner?

•

We are proposing that funds would file a form of the Notice with the Commission
not later than 10 days after it is sent to shareholders. Is 10 days sufficient to meet
this proposed filing requirement, or should some other filing period be required?
If so, what time period and why?

•

We anticipate that the form of Notice would be filed with the Commission on
EDGAR pursuant to a separate EDGAR submission type. Should we instead
require that the form of Notice be filed as an exhibit to a report filed with the
Commission? For example, should we require that the form of Notice be filed as
part of the fund’s report on Form N-CSR or Form N-CEN? Why or why not?

•

Should we require, as proposed, that funds send a paper copy of a shareholder
report upon request? If so, how soon should a fund be required to send the report
after receiving a request?

•

Should we restrict funds relying on the proposed rule from using the summary
schedule of investments? Why or why not? Are there considerations relating to
the use of the summary schedule of investments other than those relating to
printing and mailing costs that would make the summary schedule an important
option for funds to provide portfolio holdings disclosures? Should we restrict
funds from using the summary schedule only in reports transmitted pursuant to
the rule, and permit funds to use the summary schedule in printed reports that are

178

mailed to shareholders? Would funds prefer this additional flexibility? Why or
why not?
•

Are the proposed amendments to rule 498 and the registration forms regarding
website availability of documents appropriate? Should we also, for example,
specifically require funds relying on the rule to disclose on the cover page or
elsewhere in the summary prospectus or statutory prospectus its reliance on the
rule and what specific documents are made available on the website?

•

To what extent would the proposed rule reduce burdens such as printing and
mailing costs borne by funds? Would these burden reductions ultimately accrue
to fund shareholders in the form of lower total fund operating expenses? For
example, would these reductions ultimately accrue to shareholders in funds with
arrangements that permit or limit payments to service providers or intermediaries
such as broker-dealers in connection with the printing and mailing of shareholder
reports? Please provide supportive data to the extent available.

•

In addition to allowing funds to electronically transmit reports to shareholders,
should we also consider options for permitting similar delivery of summary or
statutory prospectuses? Why or why not?
E.

Form N-CEN and Rescission of Form N-SAR

1.

Overview

We are proposing to amend the framework by which registered investment
companies report census-type information to the Commission by rescinding Form N-SAR

179

and replacing it with a new form—Form N-CEN. 363 Form N-SAR was adopted by the
Commission in 1985 and requires that funds report a wide variety of census information
to the Commission, including information relating to a fund’s organization, service
providers, fees and expenses, portfolio strategies and investments, portfolio transactions,
and share transactions. Funds generally must file reports on Form N-SAR semi-annually,
except for UITs, which file annually. 364 By contrast, as discussed further below, we are
proposing to have all funds file reports on Form N-CEN annually. 365
In recent years, Commission staff has found that the utility of the information
reported on Form N-SAR has become increasingly limited. We believe there are two
primary reasons for this limited utility. First, in the past two decades, we have not
substantively updated the information reported on the form to reflect new market
developments, products, investment practices, or risks. Second, the technology by which
funds file reports on Form N-SAR has not been updated and limits the Commission
staff’s ability to extract and analyze the data reported. Accordingly, we believe that by
updating the content and format requirements for census reporting, as discussed below,
the Commission will be better able to carry out its regulatory functions, while at the same
time reducing burdens on filers.
Proposed Form N-CEN would gather similar census information about the fund
industry that funds currently report on Form N-SAR, which could be aggregated and
363

We are proposing to rescind Form N-SAR and replace it with a new census reporting form,
Form N-CEN, rather than to amend Form N-SAR in order to avoid technical difficulties that
could arise with filing reports on an amended Form N-SAR (e.g., difficulties related to
changes to filing format and form specifications).

364

See rules 30b1-1 and 30a-1.

365

See proposed amendments to rule 30a-1.

180

analyzed by Commission staff to better understand industry trends, inform policy, and
assist with the Commission’s examination program. However, in order to improve the
quality and utility of information reported, proposed Form N-CEN would streamline and
update information reported to the Commission to reflect current Commission staff
information needs and developments in the industry. 366 Additionally, where possible, we
have endeavored to exclude items from proposed Form N-CEN that are disclosed or
reported pursuant to other Commission forms, or are otherwise available; however, in
some limited cases, we are proposing to collect information that may be similarly
disclosed or reported elsewhere, but that the staff would benefit from collecting in a
structured format.
In order to improve the utility of the information reported to the Commission, we
are also proposing that reports on Form N-CEN be structured in an XML format. 367 By
requiring reports on Form N-CEN to be filed in XML format, filers will no longer be
required to use outdated technology for census reporting. Additionally, requiring reports
on Form N-CEN to be filed in an updated structured format will allow reported
information to be more efficiently and effectively validated, retrieved, searched, and
analyzed through automated means and, therefore, more useful to end users. 368

366

We are proposing to streamline our data collection, in part, through the use of yes/no
questions in order to flag certain information for follow-up, if necessary, by Commission
staff. See, e.g., Item 11 and Item 30.a of proposed form N-CEN. For example, staff of our
Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations may rely on responses to flag questions
in Form N-CEN to indicate areas for follow-up discussion or to request additional
information.

367

The Commission has adopted a number of other forms that are structured in an XML format,
including Form N-MFP. Reports on Form N-SAR, by contrast, are filed with an outdated
filing application.

368

See supra Part II.A.3 (discussing benefits to the use of XML for reports on Form N-PORT).

181

2.

Who Must File Reports on Form N-CEN

We are proposing to require that all registered investment companies, except face
amount certificate companies, 369 file reports on Form N-CEN. 370 Funds offering multiple
series would be required to report information in Part C of the form as to each series
separately, even if some information is the same for two or more series. 371
Like Form N-SAR, the sections of Form N-CEN that a fund is required to
complete would depend on the type of registrant in order to better tailor the disclosure
requirements. 372 All funds would be required to complete Parts A and B, and file any

369

Face-amount certificate companies are investment companies which are engaged or propose
to engage in the business of issuing face-amount certificates of the installment type, or which
have been engaged in in such businesses and have any such certificates outstanding. See
section 4(1) of the Investment Company Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-4(1)]. Face amount certificate
companies are not currently required to file reports on Form N-SAR. See General Instruction
A to Form N-SAR. Face amount certificate companies would continue to file periodic
reports pursuant to section 13 or section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

370

See proposed amendments to rule 30a-1. Consistent with Form N-SAR, BDCs, which are not
registered investment companies, would not be required to file reports on Form N-CEN.

371

Proposed General Instruction A. Unlike Form N-PORT where separate reports would be
filed for each series, registrants would file one report on Form N-CEN covering all series (as
is currently done with reports on Form N-SAR). We are proposing this framework for Form
N-CEN to help minimize reporting burdens, as much of the information that would be
required by Form N-CEN (for example, the information reported pursuant to Parts A and B)
would be the same across a fund’s various series. We note that Form N-SAR’s approach to
series information is slightly different than that of proposed Form N-CEN, in that Form NSAR allows registrants to indicate instances where the information is the same across all
series, rather than requiring repetitive information. See General Instruction D(8) of Form NSAR. Unlike Form N-SAR, however, we have sought to organize the information requested
in proposed Form N-CEN so that information that is the same for all series is reported in
Parts A and B of the form, with Part C, the part of the form that requires each series to
respond separately, requesting information that is more likely to differ between series.
Accordingly, we anticipate the need to report repetitive information should be limited.

372

See General Instruction A (Rule as to Use of Form N-CEN) to proposed Form N-CEN. As
reflected in General Instruction A, registrants would be required to respond to each item in
their required sections. To the extent an item in a required section is inapplicable to a
registrant, the registrant would respond “N/A” to that item. Registrants would not, however,
have to provide responses to items in sections they are not required to fill out.

182

attachments required under Part G. In addition, funds would complete the following
Parts as applicable:
•

All management companies, other than SBICs, would complete Part C;

•

closed-end funds and SBICs would complete Part D;

•

ETFs (including those that are UITs) would complete Part E; 373 and

•

UITs would complete Part F. 374
We request comment on who must file Form N-CEN.

•

Should we require any other types of investment companies to file reports on
Form N-CEN? For example, should face-amount certificate companies be
required to file reports on Form N-CEN?

•

Should funds offering multiple series be required to file a report for each series
separately, rather than one report covering multiple series, as proposed?
3.

Frequency of Reporting and Filing Deadline

Management investment companies currently file reports on Form N-SAR semiannually, 375 and UITs file such reports annually. 376 To reduce reporting burdens, we are
proposing that reports on Form N-CEN be filed annually, regardless of type of filer. 377
Form N-CEN would require census-type information, which in our experience does not

373

Certain investment products known as “exchange-traded managed funds” would also be
required to complete Part E: of proposed Form N-CEN.

374

Management companies that are registered on Form N-3 would also complete certain
items in Part F as directed by Item 7.c.i of proposed Form N-CEN. See General A to
proposed Form N-CEN.

375

See rule 30b1-1.

376

See rule 30a-1.

377

See proposed amendments to rule 30a-1.

183

change as frequently as, for example, portfolio holdings information. Accordingly, we
believe that an annual filing requirement would be sufficient for purposes of review by
Commission staff, as well as investors and other market participants that might use this
information. 378
We are proposing a filing period of 60 days after the end of the fiscal year for
funds to file reports on Form N-CEN. 379 This is the same filing period that management
companies currently have to file reports on Form N-SAR. 380 As with Form N-SAR, and
having considered the amount and nature of the information that would be requested in
proposed Form N-CEN, we continue to believe that a sixty-day filing period would
appropriately balance the staff’s need for timely information against the time necessary
for a fund to collect, verify, and report the required information to the Commission.
Rule 30b1-3 under the Investment Company Act currently requires a fund to file a
transition report on Form N-SAR when a fund’s fiscal year changes. 381 Because reports

378

As discussed above, certain items that are currently reported on Form N-SAR that would be
helpful to have updated on a more frequent basis would be moved to proposed Form
N-PORT. For example, item 28 of Form N-SAR requires the fund to provide its monthly
sales and repurchases of the Registrant’s/Series’ shares. In order to increase the timeliness of
the information reported to the staff for funds flows, certain information relating to monthly
flows would be reported on item B.6 of proposed Form N-PORT, if adopted.

Management companies are currently required to file Form N-SAR reports no more than 60
days after the close of their fiscal year and fiscal second quarter. See rule 30b1-1 under the
Investment Company Act [17 CFR 270.30b1-1]. Accordingly, we anticipate that
management companies, which would constitute the largest number of funds filing reports on
proposed Form N-CEN, generally will already have processes in place for reporting censustype information at the end of their fiscal years. Thus, we believe requiring reports on
proposed Form N-CEN after the close of a fund’s fiscal year, rather than calendar year, would
be the least burdensome approach for most funds.

380

See rule 30b1-1 under the Investment Company Act [17 CFR 270.30b1-1]; but see rule 30a-1
under the Investment Company Act [17 CFR 270.30a-1] (requiring UITs to file annual
reports on Form N-SAR no more 60 days after the close of the calendar year).

381

See rule 30b1-3.

184

on Form N-CEN would be filed annually rather semi-annually, we believe that a rule
outlining the requirements for a transition report would no longer be necessary as
transition report filing requirements for fiscal year changes involve less complexity in the
case of reports required to be filed once a year rather than twice a year. Consequently,
we are proposing to rescind rule 30b1-3. We are, however, proposing to require that
reports on Form N-CEN not cover a period of more than 12 months. 382 Thus, if a fund
changes its fiscal year, a report filed on Form N-CEN may cover a period shorter than 12
months, but would not be permitted to cover a period longer than 12 months or a period
that overlaps with a period covered by a previously filed report. 383
In addition, a fund would be able to file an amendment to a previously filed report
on proposed Form N-CEN at any time, including an amendment to correct a mistake or
error in a previously filed report. 384 A fund that files an amendment to a previously filed
report on the form would provide information in response to all items of Form N-CEN,
regardless of why the amendment is filed. 385
We request comment on the proposed frequency of reporting and proposed
reporting deadline:
•

Should reports on Form N-CEN be filed more frequently than annually, as
proposed? Should we require management companies to file reports on Form NCEN semi-annually and UITs to file reports annually, as is currently required by

382

See General Instruction C of proposed Form N-CEN.

383

Id.

384

See General Instruction E of proposed Form N-CEN. Pursuant to section 34(b) of the
Investment Company Act, we expect that funds would correct a material mistake in a Form
N-CEN report by filing an amendment to that report.

385

Id.

185

Form N-SAR? Are certain information items on Form N-CEN of a nature that
they may change frequently or such that more frequent information about them
should be reported to the Commission? If so, should any information items in
proposed Form N-CEN be reported on proposed Form N-PORT or another form
instead? If so, what items and on which forms?
•

Consistent with the treatment of Form N-SAR filings for management companies,
we are proposing that reports be filed 60 days after the end of the fund’s fiscal
year. Should we require a different filing period? If so, what period should we
require and why? How long would it take funds to collect, verify, and file reports
covering the information required by proposed Form N-CEN? Would the burdens
associated with reports on proposed Form N-CEN be greater or less than those
associated with reports on Form N-SAR?

•

We have proposed that reports on Form N-CEN be filed as of the end of the
fund’s fiscal year. We understand that funds have other filing requirements that
are tied to their fiscal-year end. Should we require some other period end date,
such as end of calendar year? Should UITs be required to file reports as of the
end of their fiscal year, as proposed, or should they file reports as of the end of
their calendar year as they currently do with reports on Form N-SAR?

•

We are proposing to eliminate rule 30b1-3 under the Investment Company Act.
Should we instead retain the rule? Are the general instructions to Form N-CEN,
as proposed, sufficiently clear as to the filing requirements when a fund changes
its fiscal year end? If not, how should the general instructions be revised, or in
the alternative, should a transition period rule be provided in connection with

186

Form N-CEN? If so, how should a transition period be defined and what
deadlines or timeframes should such a rule address?
•

Should a fund be required to file an amendment to its Form N-CEN report or file
a current report within a certain period of time if previously reported information
changes? If so, what types of changes should trigger an amendment requirement?
What filing period should be required for such an amendment requirement?

Information Required on Form N-CEN

a.

Part A — General Information

Part A of Form N-CEN, which would be completed by all funds, would collect
information about the reporting period covered by the report. It would require funds to
report the fiscal-year end date and indicate if the report covers a period of less than 12
months. 386
We request comment on the information items proposed to be reported in Part A.
b.

Part B — Information About The Registrant

Part B of Form N-CEN, which would also be completed by all funds, would
require certain background and other identifying information about the fund. In the case
of funds offering multiple series, if the response to an item in Part B of the form differs
between series, the fund would be instructed to provide a response for each series, as
applicable, and label the response with the name and series identification number of the
series to which a response relates. 387 This background information would allow the staff
to quickly categorize filers by fund type and will assist with our oversight of funds.

386

Item 1 of proposed Form N-CEN.

387

See Instruction to Part B: of proposed Form N-CEN.

187

Included in this background information would be the fund’s name, 388 Investment
Company Act filing number, 389 and other identifying information, such as its CIK 390 and
LEI. 391 In addition, the form would require the fund’s address, telephone number, and
public website (if any), 392 and the location of the fund’s books and records. 393 While the
fund’s name, address, and filing number are currently required by Form N-SAR, 394 some
of the additional information, such as the fund’s CIK, LEI, public website and location of
books and records would be new. As discussed in the Form N-PORT section above,
information such as the CIK and LEI would assist the Commission with organizing the
data received by the Commission and allow the staff to cross-reference the data reported
on Form N-CEN with data received from other sources. 395 For tracking purposes, the
proposed form would require information relating to whether the filing was the initial or
final filing. 396
As discussed above, funds would be required to include the location of their
books and records in reports on proposed Form N-CEN. We note that books and records

389

Item 2.b of proposed Form N-CEN.

390

Item 2.c of proposed Form N-CEN.

391

Item 2.d of proposed Form N-CEN; see also supra note 43 (discussing comment letters
received on the FSOC Notice supporting the use of LEIs).

Items 1 and 2 of Form N-SAR.

395

See supra Part II.A.2.a. As discussed above, commenters to the FSOC Notice expressed
support for the regulatory acceptance of LEI identifiers. See supra note 43.

396

Item 5 of proposed Form N-CEN.

188

information is currently required by fund registration forms; 397 however, this information
is not filed with us in a structured format. We believe that having books and records
information in a structured format would increase our efficiency in preparing for exams
as well as our ability to identify current industry trends and practices and, thus, we are
proposing to include this information in proposed Form N-CEN. 398 In addition, so as not
to create unnecessary burdens, we are proposing to amend Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4,
and N-6 to exempt funds from those forms’ respective books and records disclosure
requirements if the information is provided in a fund’s most recent report on proposed
Form N-CEN. 399
Similar to Form N-SAR, 400 Form N-CEN would require information regarding
whether the fund is part of a “family of investment companies.” The form, which would
include a substantially similar definition as Form N-SAR, 401 would define a “family of
investment companies” to mean, except with respect to insurance company separate
accounts, any two or more registered investment companies that (i) share the same
investment adviser or principal underwriter; and (ii) hold themselves out to investors as

397

See Item 33 of Form N-1A, Item 32 of Form N-2, Item 36 of Form N-3, Item 30 of Form N4, and Item 31 of Form N-6.

398

Additionally, by including books and records information in Form N-CEN, we may receive
more frequently updated books and records information from closed-end funds. Closed-end
funds do not update their registration statements as regularly as open-end funds and, thus, the
information regarding their books and records may not always be up-to-date.

399

Funds that have not yet filed a report on proposed Form N-CEN would have to continue to
include this information in their registration statement filings.

400

Items 19, 94 and 116 of Form N-SAR; see also General Instruction H of Form N-SAR
(defining “family of investment companies”).

401

See id.; see also instruction 1 to Item 17 of Form N-1A.

189

related companies for purposes of investment and investor services. 402 This item would
assist Commission staff with analyzing multiple funds across the same family of
investment companies.
Similar to Form N-SAR, proposed Form N-CEN would also require the fund to
provide its classification (e.g., open-end fund, closed-end fund). 403 In addition, unlike
Form N-SAR, the proposed form would specifically ask whether the fund issues a class
of securities registered under the Securities Act. 404 These questions are intended to elicit
background information on the fund, which will assist us in our monitoring and oversight
functions (for example, identifying those funds that have not issued securities registered
under the Securities Act).
Under proposed Form N-CEN, a management company would report information
about its directors, including each director’s name, whether they are an “interested
person” (as defined by section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act), and the
Investment Company Act file number of any other registered investment company for

402

Instruction to Item 6 of proposed Form N-CEN. The instruction, like the definition of “family
of investment companies” in Form N-SAR, would also clarify that insurance company
separate accounts that may not hold themselves out to investors as related companies
(products) for purposes of investment and investor services should consider themselves part
of the same family if the operational or accounting or control systems under which these
entities function are substantially similar. See General Instruction H to Form N-SAR.

403

Item 7 of proposed Form N-CEN; see also Items 5, 6, 27, 58, 59 and 117 of Form N-SAR. If
the registrant is an open-end fund, proposed Form N-CEN would also require information on
the total number of series of the registrant and, if a series of the registrant was terminated
during the reporting period, information regarding that series. Item 7.a.i-Item 7.a.ii of
proposed Form N-CEN. In addition, registrants that indicate they are management
companies registered on Form N-3 are directed by Item 7 to respond to certain additional
items in Part F of the form that relate to insurance company separate accounts. Item 7.c.i of
proposed Form N-CEN.

404

Item 8 of proposed Form N-CEN.

190

which they serve as a director. 405 Although this information is reported in a management
company’s Statement of Additional Information and provided in annual reports to
shareholders, providing this information to the Commission in a structured format will
allow the Commission and other potential users to sort and analyze the data more
efficiently. 406 In addition, the fund would be required to provide the chief compliance
officer’s (“CCO’s”) name, CRD number (if any), address, and phone number, 407 as well
as indicate if the CCO has changed since the last filing. 408 If the fund’s CCO is
compensated or employed by any person other than the fund, or an affiliated person of
the fund, for providing CCO services, the fund would also be required to report the name
and Employer Identification Number of the person providing such compensation. 409
Although some funds provide information relating to their CCO in their registration
statements, not all funds do. 410 This new requirement would provide staff with
information on all fund CCOs and would allow the staff to contact a fund’s CCO directly.

405

Item 9 of proposed Form N-CEN.

406

See, e.g., Items 17 and 27(b)(5) of Form N-1A.

407

Because we expect that funds will provide the CCO’s direct phone number in response to this
information request, the CCO’s phone number would be a non-public field in all Form NCEN filings.

408

Item 10 of proposed Form N-CEN

409

Item 10.j of proposed Form N-CEN.

410

See, e.g., Item 17 of Form N-1A (requesting information regarding fund officers). For
example, Form N-1A defines the term “officer” to mean “the president, vice-president,
secretary, treasurer, controller, or any other officer who performs policy-making functions.”
It is our understanding that in some fund complexes, the CCO does not fit within the category
of officers covered by this definition (i.e., the CCO does not perform a policy-making
function), and therefore, information as to their CCO is not provided pursuant to the item.

191

Part B would also include an item regarding matters that have been submitted to a
vote of security holders during the relevant period. 411 Information regarding submissions
of matters to a vote of securities holders is currently reported in Form N-SAR by
management companies in the form of an attachment with multiple reporting
requirements. 412 In order to alleviate the burden on filers, we are proposing to reduce the
information to be reported regarding votes of security holders to a yes/no question that is
primarily meant to allow staff to quickly identify funds with such votes, so that they can
follow up as appropriate, such as by reviewing more detailed information required by
other filings. 413 Like Form N-SAR, the proposed form would also include an item
relating to material legal proceedings during the reporting period. 414
Form N-SAR currently requires management companies to report a number of
data points relating to fidelity bond and errors and omissions insurance policy
coverage. 415 In order to limit the number of items to those most useful to the
Commission staff and reduce burdens on filers, we are proposing to limit this request to
411

See Item 11 of proposed Form N-CEN.

412

See Item 77.C of Form N-SAR; see also Instruction to Specific Items for Item 77C.

413

This information request would apply to UITs as well as management companies. The Form
N-SAR requirement applies only to management companies. See id. We believe it is
important for the Commission to have information for all registered investment companies on
matters submitted for security holder vote in order to assist us in our oversight and
examination functions.

414

Item 12 of proposed Form N-CEN. As in Form N-SAR Item 77.E, if there were any material
legal proceedings, or if a proceeding previously reported had been terminated, the registrant
would file an attachment as required by Part G: of proposed Form N-CEN. See Item 79.a.i of
proposed Form N-CEN. We note that Form N-CEN, unlike Form N-SAR, would require
UITs to respond to the information request related to material legal proceedings. For the
same reasons discussed above with respect to matters submitted for security holder vote, we
believe it is important to have information on material legal proceedings of all registered
investment companies. See supra n.413.

415

Form N-SAR Items 80-85 and 105–110.

192

two separate items in Form N-CEN. One item would ask if any claims were filed under
the management company’s fidelity bond and the aggregate dollar amount of any such
claims. 416 The other item would ask if the management company’s officers or directors
are covered under any directors and officers/errors and omissions insurance policy and, if
so, whether any claims were filed under the policy during the reporting period with
respect to the registrant. 417 These questions will help alert Commission staff to insurance
claims made by the fund or its officers and directors as a result of legal issues related to
the fund. 418
In order to better understand instances when funds receive financial support from
an affiliated entity, our proposal would also require new information regarding the
provision of such financial support. 419 We recently adopted disclosure requirements
relating to fund sponsors’ support of money market funds as part of our money market
reform amendments in 2014, including a new requirement that money market funds file
reports on Form N-CR disclosing, among other things, the receipt of financial support. 420
As with money market funds, we believe that it is important that the Commission
understand the nature and extent that a fund’s sponsor provides financial support to a
fund, and are therefore proposing to extend this requirement to all funds that would file
reports on Form N-CEN. Although we believe it is an infrequent practice, based on staff
416

Item 13 of proposed Form N-CEN; cf. Item 83 of Form N-SAR.

417

Item 14 of proposed Form N-CEN; cf. Item 85 of Form N-SAR.

418

For example, a fund is required to provide and maintain a fidelity bond against larceny and
embezzlement, which in general covers each officer and employee of the fund who has access
to securities or funds. See rule 17g-1(a) under the Investment Company Act [17 CFR
270.17g-1].

419

Item 15 of proposed Form N-CEN.

420

See Money Market Fund Reform 2014 Release, supra note 13.

193

experience, non-money market funds have received sponsor support in the past and we
believe this item would allow Commission staff to readily identify any funds that have
received such support for further analysis and review, as appropriate. For consistency,
Form N-CEN would include a substantially similar definition of “financial support” as
provided by Form N-CR. 421 In addition, the definition in Form N-CEN would also
explicitly exclude certain routine transactions from the definition of financial support, as
is the case for money market funds. 422 If the fund received financial support, it would
also be required to provide more detailed information in the form of an attachment as
required by Part G of Form N-CEN. 423
In addition, Form N-CEN would include a new item requiring reporting as to
whether the fund relied on orders from the Commission granting the fund an exemption
from one or more provisions of the Investment Company Act, Securities Act or Securities
Exchange Act during the reporting period. 424 Funds would identify any such order by
release number. 425 We are proposing to collect this information in a structured format to
better monitor fund reliance on exemptive orders, which will assist us with our oversight
functions.
421

See Instruction to Item 15 of proposed Form N-CEN; see also Part C of Form N-CR.

422

See id.

423

Item 79.a.ii of proposed Form N-CEN. This requirement would not apply to money market
funds, as money market funds currently provide this information through reports on Form NCR.

424

Item 16 of proposed Form N-CEN. Form N-SAR currently requires funds to attach
information required to be reported on Form N-1Q pursuant to an existing exemptive order.
See Instructions to Specific Items 77P and 102O of Form N-SAR. Form N-CEN would
require the fund to file as an attachment any information required to be filed pursuant to
exemptive orders issued by the Commission and relied on by the fund. Instruction to Item
79.a.vi of proposed Form N-CEN.

425

See Item 16.a.i of proposed Form N-CEN.

194

As with Form N-SAR, 426 proposed Form N-CEN would require identifying
information for the fund’s principal underwriters 427 and independent public
accountants, 428 including, as applicable, name, SEC file number, CRD number, PCAOB
number, LEI (if any), state or foreign country, and whether a principal underwriter was
hired or terminated or if the independent public accountant changed since the last
filing. 429 If the independent public accountant changed since the last filing, the fund
would have to provide a detailed narrative attachment to Form N-CEN. 430
We are proposing to include for all funds several other accounting and valuation
related items that are currently required for management companies by Form N-SAR, and
that provide important information to the Commission regarding possible accounting and
valuation issues related to a fund. These items include a question relating to material
changes in the method of valuation of the fund’s assets. 431 However, unlike reports on
Form N-SAR, proposed Form N-CEN would not require a separate attachment detailing
the circumstances surrounding a change in valuation methods. 432 Instead, to facilitate

426

Items 11, 13, 77.K, 91, 102.J, 114, 115 of Form N-SAR.

427

Item 17 of proposed Form N-CEN.

428

Item 18 of proposed Form N-CEN.

429

Item 17 and Item 18 of proposed Form N-CEN.

430

Item 79.a.iii of proposed Form N-CEN.

431

Item 21 of proposed Form N-CEN. Valuation methodologies are approved by fund directors
for use by funds to determine, in good faith, the fair value of portfolio securities (and other
assets) for which market quotations are not readily available. For example, valuation
methodology changes may include, but are not limited to, changing from use of bid price to
mid price for fixed income securities or changes in the trigger threshold for use of fair value
factors on international equity securities.

432

See Item 77.J and Item 102.I of Form N-SAR. Also unlike Form N-SAR, this requirement
would apply to UITs as well as management investment companies. We believe it is
important for the Commission to have information on accounting and valuation for all

195

review of this information in a structured format, our proposal would include specific
items in the form itself, including the date of change, explanation of change, type of
investment, statutory or regulatory basis for the change, and the fund(s) involved. 433 We
would also carry over to proposed Form N-CEN the requirement from Form N-SAR 434
that the fund identify whether there have been any changes in accounting principles or
practices, and, if any, to provide more detailed information in a narrative attachment to
the form. 435
Form N-CEN would also require, like Form N-SAR, that management
companies, other than SBICs, file a copy of their independent public accountant’s report
on internal control as an attachment to their reports on the form. 436 However, Form NCEN would also include a new question that asks whether the report on internal control

registered investment companies in order to assist us in our oversight and examination
functions.
433

Compare Item 77.J of Form N-SAR with Item 21 of proposed Form N-CEN. An instruction
to Item 21 of proposed Form N-CEN would clarify that we do not expect responses to this
item to include changes to valuation techniques used for individual securities (e.g., changing
from market approach to income approach for a private equity security). Form N-SAR does
not elaborate on the type of information it is seeking by asking for changes in the method of
valuation of the registrant’s assets. We are proposing to include this instruction to provide
clarity for filers and because we believe that responding to Item 21 of proposed Form N-CEN
for individual securities may be overly burdensome for filers.

434

See Item 77.L and Item 102.K of Form N-SAR.

435

Item 22 and Item 79.a.v of proposed Form N-CEN. Like the information requested regarding
changes in valuation methods, Form N-SAR only requests information from management
companies regarding changes in accounting principles and practices. Unlike Form N-SAR,
Form N-CEN would require this information from UITs as well, for the same reasons as
discussed above with respect to changes in valuation methods. See supra n.432

436

See Item 77.B of Form N-SAR; Item 79.a.iv of proposed Form N-CEN. As noted above,
management companies (other than SBICs) are currently required to file a copy of the
independent public accountant’s report on internal control with their reports on Form N-SAR.
We continue to believe that a copy of the management company’s report on internal control
should be filed with the Commission and thus are proposing to carry over the filing
requirement to Form N-CEN.

196

found any material weaknesses. 437 Form N-CEN would also contain a new requirement
that the fund disclose if the certifying accountant issued an opinion other than an
unqualified opinion with respect to its audit of the fund’s financial statements. 438 These
questions will elicit information on potential accounting issues identified by a fund’s
accountant.
Unlike Form N-SAR, proposed Form N-CEN would also include an item relating
to whether, during the reporting period, an open-end fund made any payments to
shareholders or reprocessed shareholder accounts as a result of an NAV error. 439
Proposed Form N-CEN would also require information from management companies
regarding payments of dividends or distributions that required a written statement
pursuant to section 19(a) of the Investment Company Act and rule 19a-1 thereunder. 440
These questions will assist the staff in monitoring valuation of fund assets and the
calculation of the fund’s NAV, as well as compliance with distribution requirements
under section 19(a) and rule 19a-1.
We request comment on the proposed information items to be reported in Part B:
•

Should any additional information regarding the fund be requested? Should any
of the information that would be requested by proposed Form N-CEN be

437

Item 19 of proposed Form N-CEN.

438

Item 20 of proposed Form N-CEN.

439

Item 23 of proposed Form N-CEN.

440

Item 24 of proposed Form N-CEN. Section 19(a) of the Investment Company Act generally
prohibits a fund from making a distribution from any source other than the fund’s net income,
unless that payment is accompanied by a written statement that adequately discloses the
source or sources of the payment. See 15 U.S.C. 80a-19(a). Rule 19a-1 under the Investment
Company Act specifies the information required to be disclosed in the written statement. See
17 CFR 270.19a-1; see also 2013-11 IM Guidance Update, supra note 289.

197

excluded? Should any of the information requested for all Registrants be limited
to only certain Registrants?
•

Should any other identifying number other than file number and LEI be
requested?

•

Should another definition or term be used to capture affiliations across related
funds rather than “family of investment companies”? Should a broader term, such
as “fund complex” as defined by instruction 1(b) to Item 17 of Form N-1A, be
used instead? If so, why would a broader definition be better?

•

Should Form N-CEN request any additional information concerning the board of
directors or individual directors? For example, should Form N-CEN request
information about the length of service of directors?

•

Should Form N-CEN request information regarding a fund’s CCO, as proposed?
Should we, as proposed, make the CCO’s phone number a non-public data field
on all Form N-CEN filings? Are there any privacy concerns with the other
information that would be requested? Would these concerns still exist if the
information is reported in a non-public data field? Are there any other concerns
with the information that would be requested? Is there other information we
should request in lieu of information that presents such concerns?

•

The current proposal eliminates Form N-SAR’s attachment regarding matters
submitted to a vote of security holders. Should we retain this requirement in
Form N-CEN? Why or why not? Are there any costs to eliminating Form
N-SAR’s attachment in Item 77C in favor of yes/no type questions? Should the
item regarding votes submitted to security holders apply to UITs?

198

•

We request comment on Item 12 of proposed Form N-CEN. Should this item
apply to UITs? Should “legal proceedings” be defined? Should it include
administrative, mediated, or arbitrated matters? Are there any other litigation
matters that should be deemed inherently material besides those enumerated in the
instructions to the item? Is there any additional information that should be
requested regarding material legal proceeding matters?

•

Should Form N-CEN request information about the fidelity bond beyond what has
been proposed (e.g., bond amount, the cost of the bond, or the number of insured
persons)? Should any additional information regarding claims filed or that could
have been filed under the fidelity bond be requested? For example, should dates
of claims filed or that could have been filed be requested? Should the nature of
the claim be disclosed?

•

Is the term “errors and omissions insurance” clear or should the form include a
definition? In addition to requesting information on whether any errors and
omissions insurance claim was made as proposed, should dates of insurance
claims and amounts of claims be requested? Should Form N-CEN permit funds
to exclude the advancement of expenses under a policy from disclosure as a
claim?

•

The definition of “financial support” in proposed Form N-CEN would include a
non-exclusive list of examples of actions that would (and would not) be deemed
“financial support.” Money market funds currently report this information in
reports on Form N-CR. Should the definition in proposed Form N-CEN be
further expanded or limited from our definition in Form N-CR, and if so, how and

199

why? For example, should we include a requirement to report information
relating to inter-fund lending? Should we require non-money market funds to
report receipt of financial support on a more timely basis? For example, should
we require non-money market funds to file reports on Form N-CR or a similar
form if they receive financial support?
•

Should any additional information concerning exemptive or other orders be
requested?

•

We also considered whether to require funds to disclose reliance on no-action
letters. If we were to require this information, should we limit it to certain noaction letters and, if so, which ones?

•

Should we request additional information regarding fund accounting and
valuation? If so, what information? Should the items relating to changes in
valuation methods and changes in accounting principles and practices apply to
UITs, as proposed?

•

We request comment on Items 23 and 24 of proposed Form N-CEN. Should we
request information regarding NAV errors and/or dividend and distribution
payments that required a written statement pursuant to section 19(a) and rule 19a1? Why or why not? Is there additional information we should request?

Part C — Items Relating to Management Investment Companies

i.

Background and Classification of Funds

Part C of Form N-CEN would be completed by management investment
companies other than SBICs. For management companies offering multiple series, this

200

information would be completed separately as to each series. 441 The proposed
information requirements in this section are intended to provide the Commission and its
staff with background information on the fund industry and to assist us in meeting our
legal and regulatory requirements, such as requirements under the Paperwork Reduction
Act. Additionally, certain demographic information would allow the Commission to
better identify particular types of management companies for monitoring and analysis if,
for example, an issue arose with respect to a particular fund type.
Similar to Form N-SAR, proposed Form N-CEN would include general
identifying information on management companies and any series thereof, including the
full name of the fund, the fund’s series identification number and LEI, and whether it is
the fund’s first time filing the form. 442 Unlike Form N-SAR, we are proposing to request
specific information on the classes of open-end management companies, including
information relating to the number of classes authorized, added, and terminated during
the relevant period. 443 Form N-CEN would also include a new requirement to
specifically provide identifying information for each share class outstanding, including
the name of the class, the class identification number, and ticker symbol. 444

441

General Instruction A to proposed Form N-CEN.

442

Item 25 of proposed Form N-CEN; see also supra n.43 (discussing comment letters received
on the FSOC Notice supporting the use of LEIs). The proposed requirements relating to the
name of the fund and if this is the first filing with respect to the fund are currently required by
Form N-SAR. See Items 3 and 7.C of Form N-SAR.

443

Item 26.a–Item 26.c of proposed Form N-CEN.

444

Item 26.d of proposed Form N-CEN.

201

Pursuant to proposed Form N-CEN, a management company also would be
required to identify if it is any of the following types of funds: 445 ETF or exchange-traded
managed fund (“ETMF”); 446 index fund; 447 fund seeking to achieve performance results
that are a multiple of a benchmark, the inverse of a benchmark, or a multiple of the
inverse of a benchmark; interval fund; 448 fund of funds; 449 master-feeder fund; 450 money

445

Item 27 of proposed Form N-CEN. As discussed herein, many of the types of funds listed in
Item 27 are defined in proposed Form N-CEN. With the exception of “index fund” and
“money market fund,” these terms are not currently defined in Form N-SAR. See General
Instruction H and Item 69 of Form N-SAR.

446

For purposes of reporting on proposed Form N-CEN, we propose to define “exchange-traded
fund” as an open-end management investment company (or series or class thereof) or UIT,
the shares of which are listed and traded on a national securities exchange at market prices,
and that has formed and operates under an exemptive order under the Investment Company
Act granted by the Commission or in reliance on an exemptive rule under the Act adopted by
the Commission. We also propose to defined “exchange-traded managed fund” as an openend management investment company (or series or class thereof) or UIT, the shares of which
are listed and traded on a national securities exchange at NAV-based prices, and that has
formed and operates under an exemptive order under the Investment Company Act granted
by the Commission or in reliance on an exemptive rule under the Act adopted by the
Commission. General Instruction F of proposed Form N-CEN. We believe these are
appropriate definitions as they are similar to the one used for determining the applicability of
ETF registration statement disclosure requirements for open-end funds. See General
Instruction A to Form N-1A. Currently, all ETFs and exchange-traded managed funds rely
on relief from certain provisions of the Investment Company Act that is granted by
Commission order. See ETF Proposing Release, supra note 5; Eaton Vance Management, et
al.; Notice of Application, Investment Company Act Release No. 31333 (Nov. 6, 2014) [79
FR 67471 (Nov. 13, 2014)] (Notice); Eaton Vance Management, et al.; Order, Investment
Company Act Release No. 31361 (Dec. 2, 2014) (Order). The Commission has, however,
proposed to codify the exemptive relief previously granted to ETFs by order. See ETF
Proposing Release, supra note 5 (proposing rule 6c-11).

447

For purposes of reporting on proposed Form N-CEN, we propose to define “index fund” as
an investment company, including an ETF, which seeks to track the performance of a
specified index. See Instruction 2 of Item 27 of proposed Form N-CEN. We believe this is
an appropriate definition as it is substantively similar to the definition of “index fund” in
Form N-SAR, but also takes into account the emergence of ETFs. See Instruction to Item 69
of Form N-SAR. Additionally, the proposed definition is largely similar to the definition of
“index fund” in rule 2a19-3 under the Investment Company Act. See 17 CFR 270.2a19-3
(referring to an index fund for purposes of the rule as a fund that has “an investment objective
to replicate the performance of one or more broad-based securities indices….”).

448

For purposes of reporting on proposed Form N-CEN, we propose to define “interval fund” as
a closed-end management company that makes periodic repurchases of its shares pursuant to

202

market fund; target date fund; 451 and underlying fund to a variable annuity or variable life
insurance contract. ETFs and ETMFs, index funds and master-feeder funds would also
be required to provide the additional information discussed below. 452
First, proposed Form N-CEN would require a management company to further
indicate if it is an ETF or an ETMF. 453 Second, index funds would be required to report
certain standard industry calculations of relative performance. In particular, index funds
would be required to report a measure of the difference between the index fund’s total

rule 23c-3 under the Investment Company Act. See Instruction 3 of Item 27 of proposed
Form N-CEN. We believe this is an appropriate definition because the term “interval fund”
is commonly used to refer to funds that rely on rule 23c-3. See 17 CFR 270.23c-3.
449

For purposes of reporting on proposed Form N-CEN, we propose to define “fund of funds” as
a fund that acquires securities issued by another investment company in excess of the
amounts permitted under section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act. See 15 U.S.C
80a-12(d)(1)(A); Instruction 1 of Item 27 of proposed Form N-CEN. We believe this is an
appropriate definition because “funds of funds” is a term typically used to refer to funds that
invest in other funds beyond the limits of the Investment Company Act. Additionally, the
proposed definition of “fund of funds” largely tracks FINRA’s definition of “fund of funds”
in its rules. See FINRA Code of Conduct Rule 2830(b)(11) (defining “fund of funds”).

450

For purposes of reporting on proposed Form N-CEN, we propose to define “master-feeder
fund” as a two-tiered arrangement in which one or more funds holds shares of a single fund in
accordance with section 12(d)(1)(E) of the Investment Company Act. See Instruction 4 of
Item 27 of proposed Form N-CEN. We believe this is an appropriate definition as it is the
same definition as used for purposes of Form N-1A. See General Instruction A to Form
N-1A.

451

For purposes of reporting on proposed Form N-CEN, we propose to define “target date fund”
as an investment company that has an investment objective or strategy of providing varying
degrees of long-term appreciation and capital preservation through a mix of equity and fixed
income exposures that changes over time based on an investor’s age, target retirement date,
or life expectancy. See Instruction 5 of Item 27 of proposed Form N-CEN. We believe this
is an appropriate definition as it is the same definition as proposed by the Commission in our
2010 proposing release relating to target date funds. See Investment Company Advertising
Release, supra note 6.

452

See Item 27.a; Item 27.b; and Item 27.f of proposed Form N-CEN.

453

See Item 27.a.i and Item 27.a.ii.

203

return during the reporting period 454 and the index’s return both before and after fees and
expenses—commonly called the “tracking difference”— 455 and also a measure of the
volatility of the day-to-day tracking difference over the course of the reporting period—
commonly called the fund’s “tracking error.” 456
Specifically, the proposed tracking difference data item would equal the
annualized difference between the index fund’s total return during the reporting period
and the index’s return during the reporting period, and the proposed tracking error data
item would equal the annualized standard deviation of the daily difference between the
index fund’s total return and the index’s return during the reporting period. 457 Reporting
of these measures will help data users, including the Commission, investors, and other
potential users, evaluate the degree to which particular index funds replicate the

454

With respect to index funds that are ETFs, we would expect a fund to use its NAV-based total
return, rather than market-based total return, in responding to Items 27.b.i. and ii.

455

Item 27.b.i of proposed Form N-CEN. The tracking difference is the return difference
between the fund and the index it is following, annualized. Johnson, Ben, et al., On the Right
Track: Measuring Tracking Efficiency in ETFs, Morningstar ETF Research, at 29 (Feb.
2013), available at http://media.morningstar.com/uk/MEDIA/Research_Paper/
Morningstar_Report_Measuring_Tracking_Efficiency_in_ETFs_February_2013.pdf
(“Morningstar Paper”), at 29. Thus, tracking difference = (1 + RNAV – RINDEX)1/N – 1, where
RNAV is the total return for the fund over the reporting period, RINDEX is the total return for the
index for the reporting period, and N is the length of the reporting period in years. N will
equal to 1 if the reporting period is the fiscal year. Id.

456

See Item 27.b.ii of proposed Form N-CEN. Tracking error is commonly understood as the
standard deviation of the daily difference in return between the fund and the index it is
following, annualized. Morningstar Paper, supra note 455, at 29. Thus, tracking error = std
(RNAV – RINDEX) x √n, where RNAV is the daily return for the fund, RINDEX is the daily return for
the index, std(∙) represents the standard deviation function, and n is the number of trading
days in the fiscal year. Id.

457

See Morningstar Paper, supra note 455, at 29.

204

performance of the target index. 458 In addition, tracking difference and tracking error
before fees and expenses 459 would allow data users to better understand the effect of
factors other than fees and expenses on the degree to which the index fund replicates the
performance of the target index. 460
Finally, master funds would be required to provide identifying information with
respect to each feeder fund, including information on unregistered feeder funds (i.e.,
feeder funds not registered as investment companies with the Commission), such as
offshore feeder funds. 461 Similarly, a feeder fund would provide identifying information
of its master fund. 462
Proposed Form N-CEN would also require the management company to report if
it seeks to operate as a non-diversified company, as defined in section 5(b)(2) of the
Investment Company Act. 463 Form N-SAR, however, asks if the management company
was a diversified investment company at any time during the period or at the end of the
reporting period. 464 We are proposing to require reporting on the non-diversified status
of a management company, rather than the diversified status, because it is less common

458

See Morningstar Paper, supra note 455, at 5. We believe this information would help data
users understand which funds are best tracking their target indices and could highlight outlier
funds.

459

See Item 27.b.i.1 and Item 27.b.ii.1 of proposed Form N-CEN.

460

See Morningstar Paper, supra note 455, at 9.

461

Item 27.f.i of proposed Form N-CEN.

462

Item 27.f.ii of proposed Form N-CEN.

463

Item 28 of proposed Form N-CEN.

464

See Item 60 of Form N-SAR.

205

for funds to be non-diversified. 465 Additionally, the question in proposed Form N-CEN
is forward looking rather than backward looking as in Form N-SAR. This change is
intended to include as part of the universe of non-diversified funds those funds that seek
to operate as non-diversified companies even if they should happen to meet the definition
of a “diversified company” as of the end of a particular reporting period. 466 We believe
this change will allow our staff to more accurately pinpoint the universe of nondiversified funds and, thus, better able the staff to assist us in our analysis and inspection
functions.
We request comment on the Part C questions relating to the fund’s background
and classification:
•

Should additional identifying information be requested with regard to series or
classes of management investment companies? Should any of the information
proposed to be included in proposed Form N-CEN be excluded?

•

We request comment on our list of types of fund. Are there any types of funds
that we should add to or remove from the list? If so, which ones and why?
Should we include additional categories based on investment strategy, as
proposed? If so, which categories? Are the definitions in proposed Form N-CEN
of the type of funds listed appropriate? Should any different definitions be used
for types of funds? If so, what definitions and why? Are any terms that are not

465

Based on Form N-SAR data between July 2014 – December 2014, 74% of funds were
diversified during the reporting period.

466

For example, if a fund generally operates as a non-diversified fund, but as a result of market
conditions or other reasons, happens to meet the definition of “diversified fund” as of the end
of the reporting period, it would still be required to indicate that it was a non-diversified fund
for purposes of this item.

206

defined sufficiently clear or should we provide definitions? If so, what terms and
what definitions?
•

We request comment on the information to be required for index funds. Should
we require the difference between the fund’s total return during the reporting
period and the index’s return during the reporting period? Is this a meaningful
methodology? Is there a better methodology for calculating tracking difference or
tracking error?

•

Should the form solicit information about the intent of a management company to
operate as a non-diversified fund or should it request information about past
operations during the reporting period?
ii.

Investments in Certain Foreign Corporations

We are also proposing to require a management company to identify if it invests
in a controlled foreign corporation for the purpose of investing in certain types of
instruments, such as commodities, including the name and LEI of such corporation, if
any. 467 As discussed supra Part II.A.2.b, some funds use CFCs for making certain
investments, particularly in commodities and commodity-linked derivatives, often for tax
purposes. Information regarding assets invested in a controlled foreign corporation for
the purpose of investing in certain types of instruments would provide investors greater
insight into special purpose entities, such as CFCs, that may have certain legal, tax, and
country-specific risks associated with them. Combined with the information that we are
proposing to collect in Form N-PORT, Commission staff would likewise benefit from
467

Item 29 of proposed Form N-CEN. An instruction to Item 29 of proposed Form N-CEN
would define “controlled foreign corporation” as having the meaning provided in section 957
of the Internal Revenue Code.

207

this information by better understanding the use of CFCs and other similar entities, which
could allow for more efficient collaboration with foreign regulatory authorities to the
extent the Commission may need books and records or other information for specific
funds or general inquiries related to CFCs.
We request comment on the Part C questions relating to the fund’s investments in
certain foreign corporations:
•

Should we request additional information on whether the management company
invested in a foreign corporation or subsidiary, including CFCs? For example,
should we request information on the types of investing activities the CFCs
engage in or certain balance sheet items from the CFC?
iii.

Securities Lending

As discussed above, we are proposing that funds provide certain securities lending
information in reports on Form N-PORT to help inform the Commission, investors and
other market participants about the scale of securities lending activity by funds and their
collateral reinvestments. 468 Additionally, we are proposing to require that funds include
in their financial statements certain information concerning their income and expenses
associated with securities lending activities in order to increase the transparency of this
information to investors and other potential users. 469 We believe, however, that some
important information concerning securities lending activity by funds should be reported
in a structured format, but on a less frequent basis than reports on proposed Form
N-PORT. In this regard, we believe an annual reporting requirement on Form N-CEN
468

See supra Parts II.A.2.d and II.A.2.g.v.

469

See proposed rule 6-03(m) of Regulation S-X.; see also supra Parts II.C.3 and II.C.5.

208

may yield sufficiently timely data and may more appropriately balance the requirements’
benefits with their associated costs than would additional monthly reporting requirements
on Form N-PORT.
Accordingly, we propose to require that each management company report
annually on new Form N-CEN, in addition to whether it is authorized to engage in
securities lending transactions and whether it loaned securities during the reporting
period, 470 information about the fees associated with securities lending activity and
information about the management company’s relationship with certain securitieslending-related service providers. First, we propose to require that management
companies that loaned any securities during the reporting period disclose certain
information that would illuminate the commonality of borrower default. Specifically, we
propose to require that those management companies disclose annually whether any
borrower of securities had defaulted on its obligations to the management company to
return loaned securities or return them on time in connection with a security on loan
during that period. 471
Under proposed Form N-CEN, management companies would also be required to
disclose whether a securities lending agent or any other entity indemnifies the fund
against borrower default on loans administered by the agent and certain identifying
information about the entity providing indemnification if not the securities lending
agent. 472 Together, these reporting requirements would yield data that would allow the

470

Item 30.a–Item 30.b of proposed Form N-CEN.

471

Item 30.b.i of proposed Form N-CEN.

472

Item 30.c.iv and Item 30.c.v.1–Item 30.c.v.2 of proposed Form N-CEN.

209

Commission, investors, and other potential users to assess the counterparty risks
associated with borrower default in the securities lending market and the extent to which
those risks are mitigated by—or concentrated in—third parties that provide
indemnification against default. 473
Because management companies sometimes engage external service providers as
securities lending agents or cash collateral managers, we believe that some of the risks
associated with securities lending activities by management companies could be impacted
by these service providers and the nature of their relationships with the management
companies and one another. Accordingly, we propose to require that management
companies report some basic identifying information about each securities lending agent
and cash collateral manager. 474 In addition, we propose to require that funds disclose
whether each of these service providers is a first- or second-tier affiliated person of the
management company, 475 which data would highlight those funds that might be expected
to rely on Commission exemptive relief with respect to those transactions. 476 We also

473

As discussed above, commenters to the FSOC Notice suggested that enhanced securities
lending disclosures could be beneficial to investors and counterparties. See supra note 71.

474

Item 30.c.i–Item 30.c.ii and Item 30.d.i–Item 30.d.ii of proposed Form N-CEN.

475

Item 30.c.iii and Item 30.d.iv of proposed Form N-CEN.

476

Section 17(d) of the Investment Company Act makes it unlawful for first- and second- tier
affiliates, among others, acting as principal, to effect any transaction in which the fund, or a
company it controls, is a joint or a joint and several participant in contravention of
Commission rules. 15 U.S.C. 80a-17(d). Rule 17d-1(a) prohibits first- and second-tier
affiliates of a registered fund, among others, acting as principal from participating in or
effecting any transaction in connection with any joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or
profit-sharing plan in which the fund (or any company it controls) is a participant unless an
application or arrangement or plan has been filed with the Commission and has been granted.
17 CFR 270.17d-1. These provisions would prohibit a fund from compensating a securities
lending agent that is a first- or second-tier affiliate with a share of loan revenue or lending to
a borrower that is a first- or second-tier affiliate without an exemptive order, and generally
from investing cash collateral in a first- or second-tier affiliated liquidity pool unless the fund

210

propose to require each management company to disclose whether it has made each of
several specific types of payments, including a revenue sharing split, non-revenue sharing
split (other than an administrative fee), administrative fee, cash collateral reinvestment
fee, and indemnification fee, to one or more securities lending agents or cash collateral
managers during the reporting period. 477 These disclosures will allow the Commission,
investors and other management company boards of directors to understand better the
type of fees a management company pays in connection with securities lending activities
and whether, for example, the revenue sharing split that the company pays to a securities
lending agent includes compensation for other services such as administration or cash
collateral management. 478 Finally, our proposed disclosure of whether the cash collateral

satisfies the conditions in rule 12d1-1 under the Investment Company Act, which provides
exemptive relief for fund investments in an affiliated registered money market fund and
pooled investment vehicle that would be an investment company but for sections 3(c)(1) and
3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act and that operate in compliance with money market
fund regulations subject to certain conditions. A management company that has a service
agreement with an affiliated securities lending agent, under which compensation is not based
on a share of loan revenue generated by the lending agent’s efforts, generally is not a joint
enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan and, thus, does not need an
exemptive order. See Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A., SEC Staff No-action Letter (pub.
avail. May 25, 1995) available at http://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/noaction/1995/
norwest052595.pdf.
477

Item 30.e of proposed Form N-CEN. Management companies that report that other payments
were made to one or more securities lending agents or cash collateral managers during the
reporting period would also be required to describe the type or types of other payments. Item
30.e.vi of proposed Form N-CEN.

478

In evaluating the fees and services of any securities lending agent, the board of directors of a
management company that engages in securities lending may be assisted by reviewing and
comparing information on securities lending agent fee arrangements of other management
companies. See, e.g., SIFE Trust Fund, SEC No-action Letter (publ. avail. Feb. 17, 1982)
(management company’s board of directors determines that the securities lending agent’s fee
is reasonable and based solely on the services rendered); Neuberger Berman Equity Funds, et
al., Investment Company Act Release No. 25880 (Jan. 2, 2003) (notice), Investment
Company Act Release No. 25916 (Jan. 28, 2003) (order) (management company’s board of
directors, including a majority of independent directors, will determine initially and review
annually, among other things, that (i) the services to be performed by the affiliated securities

211

manager is a first- or second-tier affiliate of the securities lending agent 479 could alert the
Commission, investors, and other market participants to potential conflicts of interest
when an entity managing a cash collateral reinvestment portfolio is affiliated with a
securities lending agent that is compensated with a share of revenue generated by the
cash collateral reinvestment pool. Together, the data that these proposed requirements
would yield would allow the Commission to monitor the interaction of these service
providers with management companies. In addition to informing the Commission’s risk
analysis and, potentially, future policymaking concerning securities lending activity by
management companies, we believe that this information could also help inform other
data users about the use of, and possible risks associated with, the lending of portfolio
securities by management companies.
We request comment on the Part C questions relating to the management
company’s securities lending activities:
•

Should management companies be required to report any or all of the proposed
information concerning securities lending activity? If not, which items should not
be required, and why? Should we collect any additional information?

•

Should we require, as proposed, that management companies disclose annually
whether any borrower of securities defaulted on its obligations to the management
company? Why or why not? Should we instead, or additionally, require

lending agent are appropriate for the lending fund, (ii) the nature and quality of the services to
be provided by the agent are at least equal to those provided by others offering the same or
similar services; and (iii) the fees for the agent’s services are fair and reasonable in light of
the usual and customary charges imposed by others for services of the same nature and
quality).
479

Item 30.d.iii of proposed Form N-CEN.

212

management companies to report monthly on Form N-PORT whether any
borrower of securities defaulted on its obligations to the management company?
•

Should we require, as proposed, that management companies report certain
information about each securities lending agent and each cash collateral manager?
Why or why not? Should we require that these funds disclose whether each of
these external service providers is a first- or second-tier affiliate of the fund?

•

In addition to requiring management companies to report whether they made each
of the proposed types of payments associated with securities lending, should the
Commission also require disclosure of specific rates and/or amounts paid during
the reporting period of each enumerated type of compensation, similar to the
disclosures we are proposing to require in the financial statements concerning the
terms governing the compensation of the securities lending agent and collateral
manager? Would that additional information be useful in proposed Form N-CEN
in a structured format for risk monitoring and use by investors or other market
participants, including other management company boards of directors that are
evaluating securities lending agent services?

•

Would the proposed reporting requirements regarding securities lending yield
beneficial information? If not, what information should the Commission collect
instead to conduct appropriate risk monitoring of securities lending activity by
management companies? How should this information be collected?

•

Would the proposed reporting requirements concerning securities lending activity
be burdensome?

213

•

Should proposed Form N-CEN include a specific definition for “securities lending
agent”? Why or why not? If so, how should the term be defined? Should the
form include a specific definition for “cash collateral manager”? Why or why
not? If so, how should the term be defined?

•

Are there other reporting requirements that the Commission should adopt for
securities lending activity? If so, would these additional reporting requirements
assist with Commission risk monitoring, inform the public, or both?
iv.

Reliance on Certain Rules

Like Form N-SAR, proposed Form N-CEN would include a requirement that
management companies report whether they relied on certain rules under the Investment
Company Act during the reporting period. 480 However, proposed Form N-CEN would
require this information with respect to additional rules not currently covered by Form
N-SAR. 481 We are proposing to collect information on these additional rules to better
monitor reliance on exemptive rules and to assist us with our accounting, auditing and
oversight functions, including, for some rules, compliance with the Paperwork Reduction

480

Item 31 of proposed Form N-CEN

481

Compare id. (requiring management companies to identify if they relied upon any of the
following rules: rule 10f-3 (exemption for the acquisition of securities during the existence
of an underwriting or selling syndicate), rule 12d1-1 (exemptions for investments in money
market funds), rule 15a-4 (temporary exemption for certain investment advisers), rule 17a-6
(exemption for transactions with portfolio affiliates), rule 17a-7 (exemption of certain
purchase or sale transactions between an investment company and certain affiliated persons
thereof), rule 17a-8 (mergers of affiliated companies), rule 17e-1 (brokerage transactions on a
securities exchange), rule 22d-1 (exemption from section 22(d) to permit sales of redeemable
securities at prices which reflect sales loads set pursuant to a schedule), rule 23c-1
(repurchase of securities by closed-end companies), rule 32a-4 (independent audit
committees)) with Items 40, 77.N, 77.O, 102.M, 102.N of Form N-SAR (requiring
information regarding rules 2a-7 (money market funds), 10f-3 (see above for description) and
12b-1 (distribution of shares by registered open-end management investment company).

214

Act. For example, reporting of reliance on rules 15a-4 and 17a-8 under the Investment
Company Act will allow the staff to monitor significant events relating to interim
investment advisory agreements and affiliated mergers, respectively.
In addition, we are proposing to amend rule 10f-3 to eliminate the requirement
that funds provide the Commission with reports on Form N-SAR regarding any
transactions effected pursuant to the rule. 482 Rule 10f-3 currently requires funds to
maintain and preserve certain information—the same information also required to be
filed pursuant to Form N-SAR—in its records regarding rule 10f-3 transactions. 483 Our
proposed amendments to rule 10f-3 would eliminate the requirement to periodically
report this information, 484 but would not alter the requirement to maintain and preserve it.
The Commission believes it is unnecessary for funds to continue to file this information
because Commission staff can request the information in connection with staff
inspections, examinations and other inquiries. 485
We request comment on the Part C questions relating to the management
company’s reliance on certain exemptive rules and orders:

482

See proposed amendments to rule 10f-3.

See rule 10f-3(c)(12) under the Investment Company Act [17 CFR 270.10f-3(c)(12)].

484

See rule 10f-3(c)(9).

485

Similar exemptive rules take this approach and do not require filings with the Commission.
See rule 17a-7 under the Investment Company Act [17 CFR 270.17a-7] and rule 17e-1 under
the Investment Company Act [17 CFR 270.17e-1]. We note that we previously proposed
deleting this filing requirement from rule 10f-3 in 1996. See Exemption for the Acquisition
of Securities During the Existence of an Underwriting Syndicate, Investment Company Act
Release No. 21838 (Mar. 21, 1996) [61 FR 13620 (Mar. 27, 1996)]. We chose not to adopt it
in light of the other amendments to the rule at that time, including the increase in the
percentage limit on the principal amount of an offering that an affiliated fund could purchase.

Selling Syndicate, Investment Company Act Release No. 22775 (July 31, 1997) [62 FR

Should any additional information concerning exemptive or other rules be
requested?

We request comment on our proposal to eliminate the requirement under rule
10f-3 that funds provide the Commission with periodic reports on Form N-SAR.
Should we eliminate this requirement or continue it under Form N-CEN? Why or
why not? Are there any costs or benefits associated with eliminating this
requirement?
v.

Expense Limitations

As in Form N-SAR, 486 Form N-CEN would require information regarding
expense limitations. 487 The requirements in Form N-CEN, however, would be modified
from Form N-SAR by requiring information on whether the management company had
an expense limitation arrangement in place, whether any expenses of the fund were
waived or reduced pursuant to the arrangement, whether the waived fees are subject to
recoupment, and whether any expenses previously waived were recouped during the
period. 488 We believe that more specific questions relating to management company
expense limitation arrangements would reduce burdens and limit uncertainty for
management companies when responding to these items.
486

See Items 53.A-C of Form N-SAR (requiring the fund to identify if expenses of the
Registrant/Series were limited or reduced during the reporting period by agreement, and, if
so, identify if the limitation was based upon assets or income).

487

Item 32 of proposed Form N-CEN.

488

Id. Proposed Form N-CEN would also include an instruction that filers should provide
information in response to the item concerning any direct or indirect limitations, waivers or
reductions, on the level of expenses incurred by the fund during the reporting period. The
instructions would also provide an example of how an expense limit may be applied – when
an adviser agrees to accept a reduced fee pursuant to a voluntary fee waiver or for a
temporary period such as for a new fund in its start-up phase. See Instruction to Item 32 of
proposed Form N-CEN.

216

We request comment on the Part C questions relating to the management
company’s expense limitations and fee waivers:
•

Are the proposed Form N-CEN items relating to expense limitations appropriate?
Is there any additional information that we should request on the management
company’s expense limitations? If so, what items and why?
vi.

Service Providers

Similar to Form N-SAR, 489 Form N-CEN would collect identifying information
on the management company’s service providers, including its advisers and subadvisers, 490 transfer agents, 491 custodians (including sub-custodians), 492 shareholder
servicing agents, 493 third-party administrators, 494 and affiliated broker-dealers. 495 We are
also proposing new requirements that the management company provide information on
whether the service provider was hired or terminated during the reporting period and
whether it is affiliated with the fund or its adviser(s). 496 In addition, like Form N-SAR,
Form N-CEN would ask custodians to indicate the type of custody, but would expand
upon the types of custody listed. 497 Together, these items would assist the Commission

489

See Items 8 and 10–15 of Form N-SAR.

490

Item 33 of proposed Form N-CEN.

Item 34 of proposed Form N-CEN. Form N-SAR equates a “shareholder servicing agent”
with a “transfer agent.” See Instruction to Item 12 of Form N-SAR.

Compare Items 15.E and 18 of Form N-SAR with Item 37.a.vii.6-Item 37.a.vii.7 of proposed
Form N-CEN.

217

in analyzing the use of third-party service providers by management companies, as well
as identify service providers that service large portions of the fund industry.
Based on staff experience, management companies and their boards often rely on
pricing agents to help price securities held by the fund. Therefore, we are proposing a
new requirement that management companies provide identifying information on persons
that provided pricing services during the reporting period, 498 as well as persons that
formerly provided pricing services to the management company during the current and
immediately prior reporting period that no longer provide services to that company. 499
This would assist the Commission in assessing the use of pricing services by the fund
industry and the role they play in valuing fund investments.
Part C would also require identifying information on the ten entities that, during
the reporting period, received the largest dollar amount of brokerage commissions from
the management company 500 and with which the management company did the largest
dollar amount of principal transactions. 501 Form N-SAR also requests identifying
information on these entities 502 – information that is not available elsewhere in a
structured format. Moreover, we continue to believe that brokerage commission and
principal transaction information provides valuable information to Commission staff

500

Item 41 of proposed Form N-CEN.

501

502

Items 20–23 of Form N-SAR. Form N-SAR includes an instruction designed to help filers
distinguish between agency and principal transactions for purposes of reporting information
regarding brokerage commissions and principal transactions. See Instruction to Items 20-23
of Form N-SAR. A substantially similar instruction would be included in Form N-CEN. See
Instructions to Item 41-Item 42 of proposed Form N-CEN.

218

about management company brokerage practices, and would assist the staff in identifying
the types of broker-dealers who service management company clients, monitoring for
changes in business practices, and assessing the types of trading activities in which funds
are engaged. Finally, similar to Form N-SAR, we are proposing to ask whether the
management company paid commissions to broker-dealers for “brokerage and research
services” within the meaning of section 28(e) of the Exchange Act. 503
We request comment on the Part C questions relating to the fund’s service
providers:
•

Are the proposed Form N-CEN items relating to service providers appropriate?
Should any of the service providers or information regarding the service providers
included in proposed Form N-CEN be excluded from the form? Are there other
service providers for which we should require information? For example, should
we request information on index providers and, in particular, affiliated index
providers?

•

Are the service providers identified in proposed Form N-CEN sufficiently clear or
should we provide definitions for each provider? If so, what definitions should
we use and why?

503

Item 43 of proposed Form N-CEN; see also Item 26.B of Form N-SAR (requiring disclosure
if the fund’s receipt of investment research and statistical information from a broker or dealer
was a consideration which affected the participation of brokers or dealers or other entities in
commissions or other compensation paid on portfolio transactions of Registrant). Section
28(e) of the Exchange Act establishes a safe harbor that allows money managers to use client
funds to purchase “brokerage and research services” for their managed accounts under certain
circumstances without breaching their fiduciary duties to clients. See 15 U.S.C. 78bb(e); see
also Commission Guidance Regarding Client Commission Practices Under Section 28(e) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Release No. 33-54165 (July 18, 2006) [71 FR 41978
(July 24, 2006)]. We continue to believe that an item indicating whether a fund uses soft
dollars will assist our staff in their examinations and provide census data as to the number
and type of funds that rely on the safe harbor provided by section 28(e).

219

•

Should additional information be requested regarding advisers or sub-advisers?
Should the form provide a definition of the term sub-adviser?

•

Should any additional specific service provider information be requested? Is
there any proposed service provider information that should not be requested?
Should proposed Form N-CEN request information on whether the service
provider was hired or terminated, or on the affiliation of the service provider, as
proposed?

•

In addition to requesting service provider city and state or foreign country
information as proposed, should street address, phone or email information be
requested? Would inclusion of this additional information in proposed Form NCEN raise any privacy or other concerns?

•

Should the form request information regarding sub-transfer agents or other
shareholder servicers?

•

Should any additional information on service provider fees be requested? For
example, should custodian, audit, or administrator fees be requested? Is certain
service provider fee information unnecessary as redundant with financial
statements?

•

Is the use of the term “pricing service” appropriate as proposed? Should the form
provide a definition of “pricing service”?

•

Should we, as proposed, include custody pursuant to rules 17f-6 and 17f-7 under
the Investment Company Act (types of custody not currently listed in Form NSAR) on the list of types of custody in proposed Form N-CEN?

220

•

Is there additional information regarding broker-dealers that should be requested?
Should we use a different methodology other than largest amount of brokerage
commissions or collect information for a larger or smaller number of brokers?

•

Is there additional information regarding payments by the management companies
to brokers or dealers for “brokerage and research services” that should be
requested?
We request comment on Part C, generally:

•

Are there any additional questions regarding management companies that we
should include in proposed Form N-CEN?
d.

Part D — Closed-End Management Companies and Small Business
Investment Companies

Proposed Form N-CEN would, as Form N-SAR does, recognize that closed-end
funds and SBICs have particular characteristics that warrant questions targeted
specifically to them. 504 Like Form N-SAR, Form N-CEN would require additional
information to be reported by closed-end funds in Part D of the form and would also treat
SBICs differently than other management investment companies, requiring them to
complete Part D of the form in lieu of Part C. 505 The information requested in Part D
would provide us with information that is particular to closed-end funds and SBICs and,
thus, would assist us in monitoring the activities of these funds and our examiners in their
preparation for exams of these funds.

504

See Items 86-88 of Form N-SAR (relating specifically to closed-end funds) and Items 89-110
of Form N-SAR (relating specifically to SBICs).

505

As discussed above, SBICs are unique investment companies that operate differently than
other management investment companies. See supra note 35.

221

Similar to Form N-SAR, we are proposing to require in Part D of proposed Form
N-CEN information on the securities that have been issued by the closed-end fund or
SBIC, including the type of security issued (common stock, preferred stock, warrants,
convertible securities, bonds, or any security considered “other”), title of each class,
exchange where listed, and ticker symbol. 506 We are also proposing to require new
information relating to rights offerings 507 and secondary offerings by the closed-end fund
or SBIC, 508 including whether there was such an offering during the reporting period and
if so, the type of security involved. 509 Together, this information will allow the staff to
quickly identify and track the securities and offerings of closed-end funds and SBICs
when monitoring and examining these funds.
Like Form N-SAR, 510 we are also proposing to require that each closed-end fund
or SBIC report information on repurchases of its securities during the reporting period. 511
However, unlike Form N-SAR, which requires information on the number of shares or
principal amount of debt and net consideration received or paid for sales and repurchases
for common stock, preferred stock, and debt securities, Form N-CEN would only require

506

Item 44 of proposed Form N-CEN; cf. Items 87-88 and 96 of Form N-SAR (requesting
information on the title and ticker of each class of securities issued on an exchange and
information regarding certain specific types of securities). An instruction to Item 44 of
proposed Form N-CEN would indicate that the fund should provide the ticker symbol for any
security not listed on an exchange, but that has a ticker symbol.

507

Item 45 of proposed Form N-CEN.

508

Item 46 of proposed Form N-CEN.

509

See Item 45 and Item 46 of proposed Form N-CEN. Item 45.c of proposed Form N-CEN
would also ask for the percentage of participation in a primary rights offering and an
accompanying instruction to this item would address the method of calculating such
percentage.

510

See Items 86 and 95 of Form N-SAR.

511

Item 47 of proposed Form N-CEN.

222

the closed-end fund or SBIC to indicate if it repurchased any outstanding securities
issued by the closed-end fund or SBIC during the reporting period and indicate which
type of security. 512
We are also proposing to carry over Form N-SAR’s requirements 513 relating to
default on long-term debt 514 and dividends in arrears. 515 However, unlike Form N-SAR,
which requires an attachment stating detailed information on defaults and arrears on
senior securities, 516 we are proposing that Form N-CEN only require a yes/no question
and text-based responses directly in the form. 517 We are similarly proposing to carry
over the Form N-SAR requirement 518 regarding modifications to the constituent’s
instruments defining the rights of holders. 519 Similar to Form N-SAR, if a closed-end
fund or SBIC made modifications to such an instrument, it would also be required to file
an attachment in Part G of Form N-CEN with a more detailed description of the
512

We note that, with respect to closed-end funds, financial information relating to monthly sales
and repurchases of shares would be reported monthly on proposed Form N-PORT. See Item
B.6 of proposed Form N-PORT (requiring the aggregate dollar amounts for sales and
redemptions/repurchases of fund shares during each of the last three months).

513

See Items 77.G and 102.F of Form N-SAR.

514

Item 48 of proposed Form N-CEN.

515

Item 49 of proposed Form N-CEN.

516

Items 77.G and 102.F of Form N-SAR.

517

Item 48 of proposed Form N-CEN would require, with respect to any default on long-term
debt, the nature of the default, the date of the default, the amount of the default per $1000
face amount, and the total amount of default. An instruction to this item would define “longterm debt” to mean a debt with a period of time from date of initial issuance to maturity of
one year or greater. Item 49 of proposed Form N-CEN would require, with respect to any
dividends in arrears, the title of the issue and the amount per share in arrears. This item
would define “dividends in arrears” to mean dividends that have not been declared by the
board of directors or other governing body of the fund at the end of each relevant dividend
period set forth in the constituent instruments establishing the rights of the stockholders.

518

Items 77.I and 102.H of Form N-SAR.

519

Item 50 of proposed Form N-CEN.

223

modification. 520 This item provides the Commission with information on and copies of
documents reflecting changes to shareholders’ rights.
Part G of proposed Form N-CEN would also require closed-end funds or SBICs
to file attachments regarding material amendments to organizational documents, 521 new
or amended investment advisory contracts, 522 information called for by Item 405 of
Regulation S-K, 523 and, for SBICs only, senior officer codes of ethics. 524 Where
possible, we sought to eliminate the need to file attachments with the census reporting
form in order to simplify the filing process and maximize the amount of information we
receive in a data tagged format. However, the attachments proposed to be required with
reports on Form N-CEN, provide us with information that is not otherwise updated or
filed with the Commission and, thus, we believe they should continue to be filed in
attachment form. All of the attachments in proposed Form N-CEN that are specific to
closed-end funds and SBICs are also currently required by Form N-SAR. 525
Similar to Form N-SAR, we are proposing to require other census-type
information relating to management fees and net operating expenses. Closed-end funds
would be required to report the fund’s advisory fee as of the end of the reporting period
520

Item 79.b.ii of proposed Form N-CEN.

521

Item 79.b.i of proposed Form N-CEN.

522

Item 79.b.iii of proposed Form N-CEN.

523

Item 79.b.iv of proposed Form N-CEN.

524

Item 79.b.v of proposed Form N-CEN. This item applies only to SBICs because other
management investment companies, including closed-end funds, provide this information in
filings on Form N-CSR. See Items 2 and 3 of Form N-CSR; see also rule 30d-1 under the
Investment Company Act [17 CFR 270.30d-1].

525

Compare Item 79.b of proposed Form N-CEN with Items 77.Q.1, 77.Q.2, 102.P.1, 102.P.2,
and 102.P.3 of Form N-SAR; see also Instructions to Specific Items 77Q1(a), 77Q1(e), 77Q2,
102P1(a), 102P1(e), 102P2, and 102P3 of Form N-SAR.

224

as a percentage of net assets. 526 Additionally, closed-end funds and SBICs would both
be required to report the fund’s net annual operating expenses as of the end of the
reporting period (net of any waivers or reimbursements) as a percentage of net assets. 527
Unlike open-end funds, which provide management fee and net expense information to
the Commission in a structured format, 528 such information is not reported to or updated
with the Commission in a structured format by closed-end funds or SBICs. This
information would allow the Commission to track industry trends relating to fees. Like
Form N-SAR, proposed Form N-CEN also would require, for the end of the reporting
period, the market price per share 529 and NAV per share 530 of the fund’s common stock.
Finally, like Form N-SAR, proposed Form N-CEN would require information
regarding an SBIC’s investment advisers, transfer agents, and custodians. 531 This
information is the same as what would be reported by open-end and closed-end funds in
Part C of proposed Form N-CEN, but SBICs would not be required to fill out Part C of
the proposed form. As noted above, proposed Form N-CEN, like Form N-SAR, would
recognize that SBICs have particular characteristics that warrant questions targeted
526

Item 51 of proposed Form N-CEN; cf. Items 47-52 and 72.F of Form N-SAR (requesting
advisory fee information for management companies, including closed-end funds). Whereas
Form N-SAR requests information regarding the advisory fee rate and the dollar amount of
gross advisory fees, an instruction to Item 51 of proposed Form N-CEN would explain that
the management fee reported should be based on the percentage of amounts incurred during
the reporting period.

527

Item 52 of proposed Form N-CEN; cf. Items 72.X and 97.X of Form N-SAR (requesting total
expenses in dollars for closed-end funds and SBICs).

528

Management fee information for open-end funds is currently tagged in XBRL format in the
fund’s risk return summary and is therefore not required by proposed Form N-CEN. See
General Instruction C.3.G of Form N-1A.

529

Item 53 of proposed Form N-CEN; see Items 76 and 101 of Form N-SAR

530

Item 54 of proposed Form N-CEN; see Items 74.V.1 and 99.V of Form N-SAR.

531

Item 55-Item 57 of proposed Form N-CEN.

225

specifically to them. The majority of questions in Part C of proposed Form N-CEN
would be inapplicable to SBICs or otherwise request information that would not be
helpful to us in carrying out our regulatory functions with respect to SBICs.
Accordingly, we propose to except SBICs from filling out Part C of the form and instead
would include certain service provider questions from Part C in Part D of the form as
response items for SBICs.
We request comment on the following information requirements relating to
closed-end funds and SBICs:
•

Are the proposed Form N-CEN items relating to closed-end funds and SBICs
appropriate? Are there other information items relating to closed-end funds and
SBICs that we should require? If so, what information and why? Are there any
items relating to closed-end funds and SBICs in proposed Form N-CEN that
should be excluded from the form?

•

Is there additional information regarding trading in closed-end fund or SBIC
securities that should be requested?

•

Is there additional information regarding repurchases that should be requested?

•

Should the form provide specific instructions on the calculation of management
fees?

•

Should net annual operating expenses be defined? Should they include
amortization and depreciation expenses?

•

Should the management fee for closed-end funds be requested as proposed or
should other information such as the absolute amount of fees be requested?
Should we request this information for SBICs? Should the form request

226

information on what the fee is based upon, such as a percentage of income or
performance? Should breakpoints used in calculating the management fee be
reported at each breakpoint level or should an average management fee be
provided? Should the management fee information requested be forward-looking
or should it be backward looking, as proposed, providing a management fee based
on fees charged during the reporting period and, if so, which NAV (e.g., year-end
or average) should be used?
•

If a closed-end fund or SBIC pays a performance fee, should the form provide
instructions regarding how they should calculate the fees to be disclosed?

•

In connection with defaults, is reference to a $1,000 face amount appropriate?
Would this requirement appropriately provide meaningful information not only on
the amount of principal default but default on interest payments? Should the form
also require information on the amount of debt outstanding to provide additional
context and information related to the default?

•

Regarding dividends in arrears, should the form request per share amounts as
proposed or should it request the aggregate amount in arrears?
e.

Part E — Exchange-Traded Funds and Exchange-Traded Managed
Funds

We are proposing to include a section in Form N-CEN related specifically to
ETFs—Part E—which ETFs would complete in addition to Parts A, B, and G, and either
Part C (for open-end funds) or Part F (for UITs). For purposes of Form N-CEN, an ETF
is a special type of investment company that is registered under the Investment Company
Act as either an open-end fund or a UIT. Unlike other open-end funds and UITs, an ETF
does not sell or redeem its shares except in large blocks (or “creation units”) and with

227

broker-dealers that have contractual arrangements with the ETF (called “authorized
participants”). 532 However, national securities exchanges list ETF shares for trading,
which allows investors to purchase and sell individual shares throughout the day in the
secondary market. Thus, ETFs possess characteristics of traditional open-end funds and
UITs, which issue redeemable shares, and of closed-end funds, which generally issue
shares that trade at negotiated prices on national securities exchanges and that are not
redeemable. 533
Currently, ETFs are subject to the same comprehensive information reporting
requirements on Form N-SAR as are other open-end funds or UITs, and they are not
required to report additional, more specialized information because Form N-SAR
predates the introduction of ETFs to the market and has not been amended to address
ETFs’ distinct characteristics. In 2009, the Commission amended its registration
statement disclosure requirements for ETFs 534 that are open-end funds to better meet the

532

For purposes of Form N-CEN, “creation unit” is defined as “a specified number of ExchangeTraded Fund or Exchange-Traded Managed Fund shares that the fund will issue to (or redeem
from) an authorized participant in exchange for the deposit (or delivery) of specified
securities, cash, and other assets.” Instruction 8 to Item 60 of proposed Form N-CEN. For
purposes of Form N-CEN, “authorized participant” is defined as “a broker-dealer that is also
a member of a clearing agency registered with the Commission, and which has a written
agreement with the Exchange-Traded Fund or Exchange-Traded Managed Fund or one of its
designated service providers that allows it to place orders to purchase or redeem creation
units of the Exchange-Traded Fund or Exchange-Traded Managed Fund.” Instruction to Item
59 of proposed Form N-CEN.

533

See generally Actively Managed Exchange-Traded Funds, Investment Company Act Release
No. 25258 (Nov. 8, 2001) [66 FR 57614 (Nov. 15, 2001)]; ETF Proposing Release, supra
note 446.

534

See General Instruction A to Form N-1A (defining “exchange-traded fund”).

228

needs of investors who purchase those ETF shares in secondary market transactions. 535
We believe that it is appropriate—and accordingly propose—to similarly tailor some of
the comprehensive information reporting requirements in proposed new Form N-CEN to
the special characteristics of ETFs. Funds and UITs meeting the definition of “exchangetraded fund” in Form N-CEN would be required to disclose information pursuant to the
items in Part E of the form, as would certain similar investment products known as
“exchange-traded managed funds.” 536
Some of the new reporting requirements for ETFs that we are proposing today as
part of Form N-CEN relate to an ETF’s (or its service provider’s) interaction with
authorized participants. These entities have an important role to play in the orderly
distribution and trading of ETF shares and are significant to the ETF marketplace. 537
Because of the importance of authorized participants, we are proposing new
reporting requirements concerning these entities. Currently, the information we have
regarding reliance by ETFs on particular authorized participants is limited, and we
believe that collecting information concerning these entities on an annual basis would
allow us to understand and better assess the size, capacity, and concentration of the
authorized participant framework and also inform the public about certain characteristics
of the ETF primary markets. Accordingly, we propose to require each ETF to report

535

See Enhanced Disclosure and New Prospectus Delivery Option for Registered Open-End
Management Investment Companies, Securities Act Release No. 8998 (Jan. 13, 2009) [74 FR
4546, 4558 (Jan. 26, 2009)].

229

identifying information about its authorized participants 538 and the dollar value of the
ETF shares the authorized participant purchased and redeemed from the ETF during the
reporting period. 539 More specifically, proposed Form N-CEN would require an ETF to
report the name of each of its authorized participants (even if the authorized participant
did not purchase or redeem any ETF shares during the reporting period), 540 certain other
identifying information, 541 the dollar value of the ETF’s shares that the authorized
participant purchased from the ETF during the reporting period, 542 and the dollar value of
the ETF’s shares that the authorized participant redeemed during the reporting period. 543
Collection of this additional information may allow the Commission staff to monitor how
ETF purchase and redemption activity is distributed across authorized participants and,
for example, the extent to which a particular ETF—or ETFs as a group—may be reliant
on one or more particular authorized participants.
Other proposed new reporting requirements relate to certain characteristics of
ETF creation units—the large blocks of shares that authorized participants may purchase
from or redeem to the ETF. In the primary market, ETF shares, bundled in creation units,
are sold or redeemed either primarily “in kind”—i.e., in the form of the ETF’s constituent
portfolio securities—or primarily in cash. When transacting in kind or in cash, the
particular authorized participant wishing to purchase (or redeem) shares typically bears,

in the form of a fixed fee, the transactional costs associated with assembling (or
disassembling) creation units. Those costs, therefore, are not mutualized to nontransacting shareholders. When an authorized participant purchases (or redeems) ETF
shares all or partly in cash, absent a countervailing effect, the ETF would experience
additional costs (e.g., brokerage, taxes) involved with buying the securities with cash or
selling portfolio securities to satisfy a cash redemption. Therefore, in order to ensure that
the purchasing or redeeming party bears these costs rather than the non-transacting
shareholders, the ETF may charge a “variable” fee, so called because it is often computed
as a percentage of the value of the creation unit. We understand that such variable fees
also can take the form of a dollar amount.
In order to better understand the capital markets implications of different creation
unit requirements, primary market transaction methods, and transaction fees, we are
proposing to require that ETFs annually report summary information about these
characteristics of creation units and primary market transactions. ETFs are not currently
required to report the information discussed below in a structured format, and public
availability of many of the proposed data items is limited and indeterminable. To better
understand the commonality of different transaction methods and the degree to which it
varies across ETFs and over time, we propose to require that ETFs report the total value
(i) of creation units that were purchased by authorized participants primarily in exchange
for portfolio securities on an in-kind basis; 544 (ii) of those that were redeemed primarily
on an in-kind basis; 545 (iii) of those purchased by authorized participants primarily in
544

Item 60.a of proposed Form N-CEN.

545

Item 60.c of proposed Form N-CEN.

231

exchange for cash; 546 and (iv) of those that were redeemed primarily on a cash basis. 547
For purposes of these proposed reporting requirements concerning transaction methods
and transaction fees, “primarily” would mean greater than 50% of the value of the
creation unit. 548 To better understand the effects of primary market transaction fees on
ETF pricing and trading and to better inform the public about such fees, we also propose
to require that ETFs report applicable transactional fees—including each of “fixed” and
“variable” fees—applicable to the last creation unit purchased and the last creation unit
redeemed during the reporting period of which some or all of the creation unit was
transacted on a cash basis, as well as the same figures for the last creation unit purchased
and the last creation unit redeemed during the reporting period of which some or all of
the creation unit was transacted on an in-kind basis. 549
We also propose to require ETFs to report the number of ETF shares required to
form a creation unit as of the last business day of the reporting period, 550 which we
believe would also allow the Commission and other data users to better analyze any
effects that ETFs’ creation unit size requirements may have on ETF pricing and trading.
We are proposing that this information be as of the last business day of the reporting
period because we understand that these fees sometimes vary over the course of the
reporting period, and the fee level information is likely to be most current if provided as
of the last business day of the period. In addition to information about authorized

participants and creation units, we propose to require that ETFs, like closed-end funds,
disclose the exchange on which the ETF is listed so that Commission staff may be better
able to quickly gather information as to which ETFs may be effected should an
idiosyncratic risk or market event arise in connection with a particular exchange. 551
Finally, with respect to ETFs that are UITs, we ask for information regarding
tracking difference and tracking error. 552 This information is requested of open-end
index funds in Item 27(b) and, for the same reasons discussed in Part II.E.4.c.i of this
release, the proposed form would request this information of ETFs that are UITs.
Taken together, we believe that, in addition to informing the Commission’s risk
analysis and, potentially, future policymaking concerning ETFs, the information these
proposed requirements would yield could also help inform the interested public about the
operation of, and possible risks associated with, these funds.
We request comment on the proposed reporting requirements for ETFs and
ETMFs:
•

Should ETFs be required to report the proposed additional information in Part E
of proposed Form N-CEN that other funds would not be required to report?

•

Should ETFs that are UITs and ETFs that are open-end funds be subject to the
same special reporting requirements, or should the requirements be different from
one another? If so, how? Should ETFs and ETMFs be subject to the same special
reporting requirements, or should the requirements be different from one another?
If so, how and why?

551

Item 58 of proposed Form N-CEN.

552

Item 61 of proposed Form N-CEN.

233

•

Should the proposed items concerning authorized participants be required? Why
or why not? Should we require additional information about authorized
participants? For example, should we require funds to report the volume of shares
purchased and redeemed in each month of the reporting period by each authorized
participant, in order to better understand how primary market transactions are
distributed across authorized participants and over the course of the reporting
period? Should we require funds to report information on purchases and
redemptions by each authorized participant on days when the most primary or
secondary market activity is observed, which could be used to better understand
how primary market activity responds to periods of unusual activity? Why or
why not? If so, what specific information should be required?

•

Should the proposed items concerning creation unit characteristics and primary
market transactions be required? Why or why not?

•

Should the ETFs and ETMFs that are subject to the proposed special reporting
requirements be defined as proposed? If not, how should the group be defined?
Are there certain entities that are not included in the proposed definitions that
should be? Are there certain entities that are included in the proposed definitions
that should not be?

•

Would the proposed reporting requirements yield beneficial information? If not,
what information should the Commission collect instead to conduct appropriate
risk monitoring of ETFs? How should this information be collected?

•

Would any of the proposed reporting requirements conflict with agreements
between private parties, such as ETFs and authorized participants, to keep

234

information confidential? If so, should the information nonetheless be required to
be disclosed?
•

How might the proposed reporting requirements concerning ETF primary market
transaction fees be used by others outside the Commission, if at all? Are the
proposed fee categories (viz., fixed fees and variable fees) appropriate, or would
alternative categories be more suitable? If so, what should those categories be?

•

How costly would the proposed reporting requirements for ETFs be? In addition
to reporting and recordkeeping costs, are there competitive or other costs that
should be considered in connection with these proposed requirements?

•

Are there other reporting requirements that the Commission should adopt for
ETFs? If so, would these additional reporting requirements assist with
Commission risk monitoring, inform the public, or both?
f.

Part F — Unit Investment Trusts

Part F of Form N-CEN would require information specific to UITs. Like Form
N-SAR, proposed Form N-CEN would recognize that UITs have particular
characteristics that warrant questions targeted specifically to them. 553 The information
requested in Part F would inform us further about the scope and composition of the UIT
industry and, thus, would assist us in monitoring the activities of UITs and our examiners
in their preparation for exams of UITs. Accordingly, similar to Form N-SAR, 554
proposed Form N-CEN would require certain identifying information relating to a UIT’s

553

See Items 111-133 of Form N-SAR (relating specifically to UITs).

554

See Items 111 (depositor information), 112 (sponsor information), 113 (trustee information),
and 114 (principal underwriter information) of Form N-SAR.

235

service providers and entities involved in the formation and governance of UITs,
including its depositor, 555 sponsor, 556 trustee, 557 and third party administrator. 558
Proposed Form N-CEN would also ask whether a UIT is a separate account of an
insurance company. 559 Depending on a UIT’s response to this item, it would proceed to
answer certain additional questions in Part F. 560 While Form N-SAR generally does not
differentiate between UITs that are and are not separate accounts of insurance companies,
proposed Form N-CEN would make this distinction. We believe that by distinguishing
between these different types of UITs, the form will allow us to better target the
information requests in the form appropriate to the type of UIT. We also believe this new
approach will allow filers to better understand the information being requested of them
because it will be more reflective of their operations and should thus improve the
consistency of the information reported.
Accordingly, similar to Form N-SAR, 561 a UIT that is not a separate account of an
insurance company would provide the number of series existing at the end of the

555

Item 62 of proposed Form N-CEN.

556

Item 65 of proposed Form N-CEN (only applies to UITs that are not insurance company
separate accounts).

557

Item 66 of proposed Form N-CEN (only applies to UITs that are not insurance company
separate accounts).

558

Item 63 of proposed Form N-CEN. Form N-SAR does not request information about a UIT’s
third-party administrator.

559

Item 64 of proposed Form N-CEN; see Item 117.A of Form N-SAR.

560

If a UIT answers “yes” to this item, it would proceed to answer Items 73 through 78 of the
form. However, if a UIT answers “no” to this item, it would proceed to Items 65 through 72,
and 78. Id.

reporting period that had securities registered under the Securities Act 562 and, for new
series, the number of series for which registration statements under the Securities Act
became effective during the reporting period 563 and the total value of the portfolio
securities on the date of deposit. 564 Proposed Form N-CEN would also carry over from
Form N-SAR 565 requirements relating to the number of series with a current
prospectus, 566 the number of existing series (and total value) for which additional units
were registered under the Securities Act, 567 and the value of units placed in portfolios of
subsequent series. 568 Our proposal would also require that a UIT that is not a separate
account of an insurance company provide the total assets of all series combined as of the
reporting period, 569 which is also currently required by Form N-SAR. 570
As proposed, Form N-CEN would also require certain new information to be
reported by separate accounts offering variable annuity and variable life insurance
contracts. Specifically, if the UIT is a separate account of an insurance company,
proposed Form N-CEN would require disclosure of its series identification number 571
and, for each security that has a contract identification number assigned pursuant to rule

See Item 127.L of Form N-SAR (all UITs are required to complete this item). Proposed
Form N-CEN would not require UITs to report certain assets held by a UIT as required by
Item 127 of Form N-SAR. See Items 127.A-K of Form N-SAR.

571

Item 73 of proposed Form N-CEN.

237

313 of Regulation S-T, the number of individual contracts that are in force at the end of
the reporting period. 572
With respect to insurance company separate accounts, our proposal would also
require new identifying and census information for each security issued through the
separate account. 573 This requirement would include the name of the security, 574 contract
identification number, 575 total assets attributable to the security, 576 number of contracts
sold, 577 gross premiums received, 578 and amount of contract value redeemed. 579 This
item would also require additional information relating to section 1035 exchanges,
including gross premiums received pursuant to section 1035 exchanges, 580 number of
contracts affected in connection with such premiums, 581 amount of contract value
redeemed pursuant to section 1035 redemptions 582 and the number of contracts affected
by such redemptions. 583 In addition, insurance company separate accounts would be
required to provide information on whether they relied on rules 6c-7 584 and 11a-2 585

Item 76 of proposed Form N-CEN. Rule 6c-7 under the Investment Company Act provides
exemptions from certain provisions of sections 22(e) and 27 of the Act for registered separate

238

under the Investment Company Act. This information, which is specific to UITs that are
separate accounts of insurance companies and is either not otherwise filed with the
Commission or is not filed in a structured format, will further assist the Commission in its
oversight of UITs, including monitoring trends in the variable annuity and variable life
insurance markets.
Finally, Form N-CEN would carry over the Form N-SAR 586 requirement that a
UIT provide certain information relating to divestments under section 13(c) of the
Investment Company Act. 587 Thus, if a UIT intends to avail itself of the safe harbor
provided by section 13(c) with respect to its divestment of certain securities, it will
continue to make the following disclosures on Form N-CEN: identifying information for
the issuer, total number of shares or principal amount divested, date that the securities
were divested, and the name of the statute that added the provisions of section 13(c) in

accounts offering variable annuity contracts to participants in the Texas Optional Retirement
Program. See 17 CFR 270.6c-7.
585

Item 77 of proposed Form N-CEN. Rule 11a-2 under the Investment Company Act relates to
offers of exchange by certain registered separate accounts or others, the terms of which do
not require prior Commission approval. See 17 CFR 270.11a-2.

586

Item 133 of Form N-SAR. Section 13(c) of the Investment Company Act provides a safe
harbor for registered investment companies and its employees, officers, directors and
investment advisers, based solely upon the investment company divesting from, or avoiding
investing in, securities issued by persons that the investment company determines, using
credible information that is available to the public, engage in certain investment activities in
Iran or Sudan. The safe harbor, however, provides that this limitation on actions does not
apply unless the investment company makes disclosures about the divestments in accordance
with regulations prescribe by the Commission. See 15 U.S.C. 80a-13(c)(2)(B). Management
investment companies are required to provide the disclosure on Form N-CSR, pursuant to
Item 6(b) of the form, and UITs are required to provide the disclosure on Form N-SAR,
pursuant to Item 133 of the form. See Technical Amendments to Forms N-CSR and N-SAR
in Connection With the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act
of 2010, Exchange Act Release No. 34-63087 (Oct. 13, 2010) [75 FR 64120 (Oct. 19, 2010)].

the issuer on the date of the filing, it would also provide the ticker symbol, CUSIP
number, and total number of shares or, for debt securities, the principal amount held on
the date of the filing. 589
We request comment on the following information requirements relating to UITs:
•

Is there any additional information regarding series of UITs that should be
requested? For example, are there other special UIT account types that should
also be included in the form? Is there any information regarding UITs that is
included in proposed Form N-CEN that should be excluded from the form?

•

Is there any additional information regarding those involved in the formation and
governance of the UIT and service providers to the UIT that should be requested?
Should the form provide instructions or a definition regarding depositor or
sponsor?

•

Is there any additional information regarding the number of series that should be
requested?

•

We request comment on the requirement to provide asset information for the UIT.
Is there any other information regarding the series’ assets that should be
provided? Form N-SAR item 127 contains a detailed list of asset types held by
the UIT. The requirement in Form N-CEN is limited to total assets. Should we

N-SAR item 127? If so which items should we include?
•

We request comment on our items relating specifically to insurance company
separate accounts. Should we include items relating solely to insurance company
separate accounts? Are there any UIT items that insurance company separate
accounts should be subject to that they would not be subject to under our
proposal? Is there any other information that we should require for insurance
company separate accounts?
g.

Part G — Attachments

Like Form N-SAR, 590 we are proposing that Part G of Form N-CEN require some
descriptive attachments to the filing in order to provide the staff with more granular
information regarding certain key issues. 591 Where possible, we sought to eliminate the
need to file attachments with the census reporting form in order to simplify the filing
process and maximize the amount of information we receive in a data tagged format. 592
Accordingly, we have attempted to limit the number of attachments to the form to those
that are most useful to the staff, either because of investor protection issues or because

590

See Items 77.E, 77.I, 77.K, 77.L, 77.N, 77.P, 77.Q.1, 77.Q.2, 102.D, 102.H, 102.J, 102.K,
102.M, 102.O, 102.P.1, 102.P.2, and 102.P.3 of Form N-SAR.

591

Form N-SAR requires only management companies to file attachments to reports on the
form, whereas proposed Form N-CEN would require certain attachments for all Registrants.

592

With respect to certain attachments currently in Form N-SAR, we propose to integrate the
data requirements into the form itself, rather than keep the attachment requirements. See,
e.g., Items 77.G and 102.F of Form N-SAR; Item 48 and Item 49 of proposed Form N-CEN.
However, not all of the attachments currently required by Form N-SAR lend themselves to
integration into the form, either because of the amount of information reported in the
attachment or because the attachment is a standalone document (e.g., the accountant’s report
on internal control).

241

the information is not available elsewhere. Moreover, all except one of the proposed
attachments to Form N-CEN are current requirements in Form N-SAR. 593
Thus, all funds that would be required to file Form N-CEN would, where
applicable, be required to file attachments regarding legal proceedings, 594 provision of
financial support, 595 changes in the fund’s independent public accountant, 596 independent
public accountant’s report on internal control, 597 and changes in accounting principles
and practices. 598 In addition, all funds would be required, where applicable, to provide
attachments relating to information required to be filed pursuant to exemptive orders, 599
and other information required to be included as an attachment pursuant to Commission
rules and regulations. 600 Moreover, closed-end funds and SBICs would also be required,
where applicable, to provide attachments relating to material amendments to
organizational documents, 601 instruments defining the rights of the holders of any new or
amended class of securities, 602 new or amended investment advisory contracts, 603

and, thus, we believe the information should continue to be filed as an attachment to the
census reporting form.

Item 79.b.ii of proposed Form N-CEN.

242

information called for by Item 405 of Regulation S-K, 604 and, for SBICs only, senior
officer codes of ethics. 605 Each attachment proposed to be required by Form N-CEN
includes instructions describing the information that should be provided in the
attachment. 606
As noted earlier, all of the attachments, except one, are currently required by
Form N-SAR. 607 The new attachment relates to the provision of financial support and
would be filed by a fund if an affiliate, promoter or principal underwriter of the fund, or
affiliate of such person, provided financial support to the fund during the reporting
period. As discussed in Part II.E.4.b, we are proposing to include this requirement in
Form N-CEN because we believe that it is important that the Commission understand the
nature and extent that a fund’s sponsor provides financial support to a fund.
We request comment on the following information requirements relating to
attachments to the Form:
•

Should any additional attachments be required to be attached to Form N-CEN?
Are any proposed attachments unnecessary and, if so, why? Should any of the
attachments requested for all Registrants be limited to only certain Registrants?

603

Item 79.b.iii of proposed Form N-CEN. Unlike open-end funds, closed-end funds and SBICs
do not otherwise update or file the information requested by this item with the Commission
and, thus, we believe the information should continue to be filed as an attachment to the
census reporting form.

For example, the instructions to Item 79.b.v require SBICs to attach detailed information
regarding the senior officer code of ethics and certain information regarding the audit
committee. The instructions also require SBICs to meet certain requirements regarding the
availability of their senior office code of ethics.

607

See supra note 593 and accompanying text.

243

•

Should we require that the information be reported as attachments to the form or
in narrative text-boxes embedded in the form?

•

Should attachment requirements concerning copies of all constituent instruments
defining the rights of the holders of any new class of securities and of any
amendments to constituent instruments be limited to closed-end funds and SBICs
as proposed? Should such requirements apply to all funds?

•

Should the attachments regarding material amendments to organizational
documents and new or amended advisory contracts apply only to closed-end
funds and SBICs as proposed? Should these requirements apply to all funds?
Should the advisory contract requirement apply only to advisory contracts to
which the fund is a party or should it include all advisory contracts, including
subadvisory contracts?

•

Should any of the attachment filing requirements without materiality qualifiers be
limited by materiality qualifiers?

•

With Form N-CEN, we are proposing to eliminate a number of attachments
currently required by items 77 and 102 of Form N-SAR. Are there any
attachments to Form N-SAR, that are proposed to be eliminated, that should be
included in Form N-CEN? Which attachments and why? Are there any costs
associated with eliminating these attachments?
5.

Items Required by Form N-SAR That Would be Eliminated by Form
N-CEN

As we discussed above, with proposed Form N-CEN, we seek to improve the
information that we collect in order to reflect changes in the fund industry since Form
N-SAR’s adoption in 1985. With that in mind, we are proposing to eliminate certain

244

items from Form N-SAR that we believe are no longer needed by Commission staff or
are outdated in their current form. For example, we are proposing not to include Form NSAR’s requirement relating to considerations which affected the participation of brokers
or dealers or other entities in commissions or other compensation paid on portfolio
transactions. 608
Form N-CEN would similarly eliminate a number of Form N-SAR items where
the information is (or would be, under our proposed reforms) reported elsewhere – for
example, items relating to fees and expenses, including front-end and deferred/contingent
sales loads, redemption and account maintenance fees, rule 12b-1 fees, and advisory
fees. 609 Many of the fee and expense items required by Form N-SAR are already
disclosed, in a structured format, in the risk-return summary required by Form N-1A for
open-end funds, as well as in an unstructured format in other places in fund registration
statements. 610 For other fee and expense items, the information is either not frequently
used by Commission staff or we believe that the benefit of having such information is
minimal while the burden to funds of reporting such information is costly. 611 For similar

608

Item 26 of Form N-SAR. Proposed Form N-CEN does, however, contain information
relating to funds that paid commissions to brokers and dealers for research services. See Item
43 of proposed Form N-CEN.

609

See generally Items 29-44, 47-52 of Form N-SAR. Proposed Form N-CEN does, however,
contain items relating to information regarding expense limitations, reductions, and waivers.
See Item 32 of proposed Form N-CEN. As discussed above, proposed Form N-CEN would
also require information on management fees and net operating expenses for closed-end
funds, as that information is not available elsewhere in a structured format. See Item 51 and
Item 52 of proposed Form N-CEN; see also supra Part II.E.4.d.

610

See General Instruction C.3.G of Form N-1A; see generally Form N-1A, Form N-2, Form N4, Form N-5, Form N-6.

611

We acknowledge that some of the information reported in reports on Form N-SAR related to
loads paid to captive or unaffiliated broker-dealers has been used by interested third-parties,
including researchers. See, e.g., Susan E. K. Christoffersen, Richard Evans, and David K.

245

reasons as above, we are also proposing not to require other information in proposed
Form N-CEN, including information relating to adjustments to shares outstanding by
stock split or stock dividend, minimum initial investments, investment practices, portfolio
turnover, number of shares outstanding, number of shareholder accounts, average net
assets, and certain other condensed balance sheet data items. 612
We are also proposing to eliminate certain information requirements specifically
relating to SBICs and UITs that we no longer believe are necessary to collect on a census
form because, much like the items discussed above, the benefit of having such
information is minimal to the Commission’s oversight and examination functions while
the burdens to these funds of reporting such information is costly. 613 Additionally, with
respect to the Form N-SAR 614 item relating to closed-end fund monthly sales and
repurchases of shares, this information would be reported on proposed Form N-PORT, 615
rather than proposed Form N-CEN.
The full list of items from Form N-SAR that would be included in Form N-CEN,
as proposed, or would be eliminated is listed in Figure 2 below.
Musto, 2013. What do Consumers’ Fund Flows Maximize? Evidence from Their Brokers’
Incentives. The Journal of Finance, Vol. 68(1), 201-235 (2013). While this is evidence of a
discrete instance where such information has been useful to a third party, based on staff
experience with this information and Form N-SAR information generally, we believe that no
longer requiring funds to gather and report this information appropriately balances the burden
on funds of providing this information and the overall utility of the information to the
Commission, investors and third parties. As noted below, we request comment generally on
whether any information items not currently being proposed to be carried over from Form NSAR should be included on Form N-CEN.

We request comment on the information requirements relating to items required
in Form N-SAR, but not required in proposed Form N-CEN, including the following:
•

Should proposed Form N-CEN require more detailed information relating to the
fund’s 12b-1 plan, as required by items 40 through 44 of Form N-SAR,
considering detailed information regarding the fund’s 12b-1 plan is otherwise
disclosed in response to other reporting requirements?

•

Should proposed Form N-CEN include financial information or balance sheet
items, such as those required by item 72 of Form N-SAR?

•

Despite the fact that certain items relating to fee information are required by other
forms, should we include fee information in proposed Form N-CEN? If so, what
specific information and why?

•

Should proposed Form N-CEN include information relating to number of shares
outstanding, total number of shareholder accounts, or average net assets during
the reporting period as required by Items 74.U.1, 74.X, and 75 of Form N-SAR?

•

Are there any other items currently in Form N-SAR that are proposed to be
eliminated, which should be included in Form N-CEN? Which items and why?
Are there any costs associated with eliminating these items?
F.

Technical and Conforming Amendments

We are also proposing technical and conforming amendments to various rules and
forms. As discussed above, our proposal would rescind Form N-Q and create new Form
N-PORT. In order to implement this proposed change, we propose to revise Forms N-1A,
N-2, and N-3 to refer to the availability of portfolio holdings schedules attached to
reports on Form N-PORT and posted on fund websites rather than on reports on Form N-

257

Q. 616 In addition, we propose to rescind 17 CFR 249.332 and revise the following rules
to remove references to Form N-Q: 17 CFR 232.401, 17 CFR 270.8b-33, 17 CFR
270.30a-2, 17 CFR 270.30a-3, and 17 CFR 270.30d-1.
Our proposal would also rescind Form N-SAR and replace it with new Form NCEN. In order to implement this proposed change, we propose to revise the following
rules and sections to remove references to Form N-SAR and replace them with references
to Form N-CEN: 17 CFR 232.301, 17 CFR 240.10A-1, 17 CFR 240.12b-25, 17 CFR
249.322, 17 CFR 249.330, 17 CFR 270.8b-16, 270.30d-1, and 17 CFR 274.101. 617
Currently, reports on Form N-SAR are filed semi-annually by management
investment companies as required by 17 CFR 270.30b1-1, and annually by UITs as
required by 17 CFR 270.30a-1. Because our proposal would require reports on Form NCEN to be filed annually by all registered investment companies, we propose to rescind
17 CFR 270.30b1-1 and revise 17 CFR 270.30a-1 to require all registered investment
companies to file reports on Form N-CEN. We also propose to revise the following rules
to remove references to 17 CFR 270.30b1-1 and add references to proposed rule 17 CFR
270.30a-1: 17 CFR 240.13a-10, 17 CFR 240.13a-11, 17 CFR 240.13a-13, 17 CFR
240.13a-16, 17 CFR 240.15d-10, 17 CFR 240.15d-11, 17 CFR 240.15d-13, and 17 CFR
240.15d-16.
616

See Form N-1A, Item 16(f), Instruction 3(b) (we would remove references to Form N-Q) and
Item 27(d), Instruction 4 (we would replace references to portfolio schedules reported on
Form N-Q with references to portfolio schedules attached to reports on Form N-PORT or
posted on fund websites); Form N-2, Item 24, Instruction 6.b (same); Form N-3, Instruction
6(ii) to Item 28(a) (same).

617

Although we are proposing to delete references to Form N-SAR in 17 CFR 232.301, we are
not proposing to replace them with references to Form N-CEN because the references in that
section relate to specific portions of the EDGAR Filer Manual that would not be relevant to
Form N-CEN.

258

In addition, as a result of the proposed new annual reporting requirement that
would apply to all registered investment companies, we propose to rescind 17 CFR
270.30b1-2—which currently permits wholly-owned management investment company
subsidiaries of management investment companies to not file Form N-SAR under certain
circumstances—and propose new rule 17 CFR 270.30a-4—which would permit whollyowned management investment company subsidiaries of management investment
companies to not file Form N-CEN under those same circumstances. We also propose to
amend 17 CFR 200.800 to display control numbers assigned to information collection
requirements for Forms N-PORT and N-CEN by the Office of Management and Budget
pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act. As discussed further below, an agency may
not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to a collection of
information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. 618
Our proposed amendments to Regulation S-X would, among other things, require
management investment companies to report new schedules for certain derivatives
holdings. 619 To implement these changes, we propose to renumber the sections for
schedules required to be reported by management investment companies and renumber
the list of schedules provided in 17 CFR 210.6-10, which outlines the schedules to be
reported by investment companies. 620 We propose conforming changes to references to

618

See infra Part V.

619

Our proposal would require new schedules to be filed to report open futures contracts, open
forward foreign currency contracts, and open swap contracts. See proposed new rules 1213A, B, and C of Regulation S-X.

620

Among other things, our proposed amendments would renumber the CFR sections for open
option contracts and the summary schedule of investments in unaffiliated issuers from 17
CFR 210.12-12B and 17 CFR 210.12-12C to 17 CFR 210.12-13 and 17 CFR 210.12-B,
respectively. These amendments would group the schedule for open option contracts written

259

Regulation S-X in the following forms: Form N-1A, Form N-2, Form N-3, and Form N14. 621
We also propose to amend Form N-CSR to delete instructions addressing how
certifications as to changes in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting
should be handled during the transition period when certifications were being
implemented on Form N-Q, because those instructions are no longer applicable. 622
We also propose to remove paragraph (a) of 17 CFR 232.105, which currently
requires electronic filers to submit Forms N-SAR and 13F in ASCII, and redesignate
paragraphs (b) and (c) as (a) and (b), respectively. Our proposal would rescind Form NSAR, and Form 13F has been submitted by electronic filers in XML, rather than ASCII,
since 2013. 623
We request comment on these technical and conforming amendments.

together with the new schedules for open futures contracts, open forward foreign currency
contracts, and open swap contracts, and would list the summary schedule sequentially after
the investments in securities of unaffiliated issuers. We would also amend 17 CFR 210.6-10
to, among other things, add new schedules V, VI, and VII for open futures contracts, open
forward foreign currency contracts, and open swap contracts, respectively, and renumber
schedule II for investments other than securities and schedule VI for summary of investments
in securities of unaffiliated issuers as schedules VIII and IX, respectively. See proposed rule
6-10 of Regulation S-X (listing the schedules required to be filed by management investment
companies, UITs, and face-amount certificate companies).
621

See Form N-1A, Item 27(b)(1) (reference to Schedule VI would be changed to Schedule IX
and reference to schedule I would be corrected to cite to the appropriate CFR section); Form
N-2, Instruction 7 to Item 24 (we would update references to schedule VI); Form N-3,
Instruction 7(i) and (ii) to Item 28(a) (we would update references to schedule VI).

622

Form N-CSR, Item 12 (the instruction to paragraph (a)(2) of that item would be removed).

See Notice to EDGAR Form13 Filers, available at
http://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/imannouncements/notice-form-13f-im.htm

beginning on April 29, 2013).

G.

Compliance Dates

Currently, we anticipate the following compliance dates for our proposed
amendments, as set forth below.
1.

Form N-PORT, Rescission of Form N-Q, and Amendments to the
Certification Requirements of Form N-CSR

Given the nature and frequency of filings on proposed Form N-PORT, if Form NPORT is adopted, the Commission expects to provide for a tiered set of compliance dates
based on asset size. Specifically, for larger entities—namely, funds that together with
other investment companies in the same “group of related investment companies” 624 have
net assets of $1 billion or more as of the end of the most recent fiscal year—we are
proposing a compliance date of 18 months after the effective date to comply with the new
reporting requirements. For these larger entities, we expect that eighteen months would
provide an adequate period of time for funds, intermediaries, and other service providers
to conduct the requisite operational changes to their systems and to establish internal
processes to prepare, validate, and file reports on proposed new Form N-PORT with the
Commission. 625

624

For these purposes, we expect that the threshold would be based on the definition of “group
of related investment companies,” as such term is defined in rule 0-10 under the Investment
Company Act. Rule 0-10 defines the term as “two or more management companies
(including series thereof) that: (i) Hold themselves out to investors as related companies for
purposes of investment and investor services; and (ii) Either: (A) Have a common
investment adviser or have investment advisers that are affiliated persons of each other; or
(B) Have a common administrator; and (2) In the case of a unit investment trust, the term
group of related investment companies shall mean two or more unit investment trusts
(including series thereof) that have a common sponsor.” We believe that this broad definition
would encompass most types of fund complexes and therefore is an appropriate definition for
compliance date purposes.

625

We believe that an eighteen month compliance period for larger groups of investment
companies is an adequate amount of time for funds to implement proposed new Form NPORT and make the necessary system and operational changes. We adopted a nine month

261

For smaller entities (i.e., funds that together with other investment companies in
the same “group of related investment companies” have net assets of less than $1 billion
as of the end of the most recent fiscal year), 626 we are proposing to provide for an extra
12 months (or 30 months after the effective date) to comply with the new reporting
requirements. We believe that smaller groups would benefit from this extra time to
comply with the filing requirements for Form N-PORT and would potentially benefit
from the lessons learned by larger investment companies and groups of investment
companies during the adoption period for Form N-PORT. 627
2.

Form N-CEN and Rescission of Form N-SAR

If Form N-CEN and the related proposals are adopted, we are proposing a
compliance date of 18 months after the effective date to comply with the new reporting
requirements. We expect that eighteen months would provide an adequate period of time
for funds, intermediaries, and other service providers to conduct the requisite operational
changes to their systems and to establish internal processes to prepare, validate, and file
reports on proposed Form N-CEN with the Commission. We are proposing the same
compliance periods when we first required money market funds to report their portfolio
holdings to the Commission on a monthly basis on Form N-MFP. Based upon our Form NMFP compliance experience, and the larger number of non-money market fund filers, we
believe that doubling the Form N-MFP compliance period to eighteen months for filing
reports on Forms N-PORT is appropriate. See Money Market Fund Reform 2010 Release,
supra note 13, at 10087.
626

Based on staff analysis of data obtained from Morningstar Direct, as of March 31, 2015, we
estimate that a $1 billion assets threshold would provide an extended compliance period to
more than 66% of the fund groups, but only 0.6% of all fund assets. We therefore believe
that the $1 billion threshold would appropriately balance the need to provide smaller groups
of investment companies with more time to prepare for the initial filing of reports on Form NPORT, while still including the vast majority of fund assets in the initial compliance period.

627

We likewise intend to rescind Form N-Q (referenced in 17 CFR 274.130) and the
amendments to the certification requirements of Form N-CSR (referenced in 17 CFR
274.128) with a timing that is consistent with this proposal.

262

compliance date for the related amendments to other rules and forms we are proposing
today. 628
Unlike Form N-PORT, we do not expect to provide for a tiered compliance date
based on asset size. We believe that it is less likely that smaller fund complexes would
need additional time to comply with the requirements to file Form N-CEN because the
requirements are similar to the current requirements to file Form N-SAR, and we expect
that filers will prefer the updated, more efficient filing format of Form N-CEN. We are
therefore proposing to require all funds, regardless of size, to file reports on Form N-CEN
with the same compliance period.
3.

Option for Website Transmission of Shareholder Reports

Proposed rule 30e-3, if adopted, would permit (but not require) a fund to satisfy
requirements under the Act and rules thereunder to transmit reports to shareholders if the
fund makes the reports and certain other materials accessible on its website. As reliance
on the rule would be optional, we believe a compliance period would not be necessary.
Therefore, we expect that funds would be able to rely on the rule immediately after the
effective date.
4.

Regulation S-X and Related Amendments

As discussed above, our proposed amendments to Regulation S-X are largely
consistent with existing fund disclosure practices. As such, we do not expect that fund,
intermediaries, or service providers would require significant amounts of time to modify
systems or establish internal processes to prepare financial statements in accordance with

628

We similarly intend to rescind Form N-SAR (referenced in 17 CFR 274.101) with a timing
that is consistent with this proposal.

263

our proposed amendments to Regulation S-X. Accordingly, we are proposing a
compliance date for our proposed amendments to Regulation S-X of eight months after
the effective date. We expect the same compliance date would apply to conforming
amendments related to our proposed amendments to Regulation S-X, including the
related amendment we are proposing today.
5.

Request for Comment

We request comment on the compliance dates discussed above.
•

How, if at all, should the proposed compliance dates be modified? What factors
should we consider when setting the compliance dates for the proposed rules and
forms?

•

We request comment on our proposed tiered compliance dates for filings on Form
N-PORT. Is a threshold of $1 billion based on the net assets of funds together
with other investment companies in the same “group of related investment
companies” as of the end of the most recent fiscal year appropriate? Should the
threshold be higher or lower? 629 Should the threshold include aggregation of net
assets with other investment companies in the same “group of related investment
companies?” Why or why not? In lieu of “group of related investment
companies,” should aggregation be based on a different set of related companies?
For example, should aggregate assets be based on “family of investment
companies,” as such term defined in instruction 1(a) to Item 17 of Form N-1A or

629

Based on staff analysis of data obtained from Morningstar Direct, as of March 31, 2015, we
estimate that a threshold of $100 million would include 38% of fund firms and 0.1% of all
fund assets. A threshold of less than $3 billion would include 76.9% of fund firms and 1.5%
of fund assets.

264

“fund complex” as defined in instruction 1(b) to Item 17 of Form N-1A? Should
we require administrator-sponsored funds to aggregate assets for purposes of this
threshold regardless of whether the individual funds (or series thereof) do not hold
themselves out to investors as related companies for purposes of investment and
investor services? Why or why not?
•

With respect to Form N-PORT, is our compliance date of eighteen months for
larger filers appropriate? If not, what length of time would be appropriate for
compliance with Form N-PORT? Would a shorter or longer compliance date be
appropriate? For example, would a compliance date of 15 months be sufficient?
Conversely, would funds need more time to comply, such as 20 months? Is our
12 month extension of the compliance period for smaller entities appropriate? If
not, what length of time would be appropriate for compliance with Form NPORT? Would a shorter or longer extension, such as 9 months or 15 months, be
appropriate? How do we appropriately consider the benefits and costs to
receiving the information more quickly and the potential costs and benefits
associated with a shorter or longer compliance period?

•

Should the Commission consider the implementation of reporting on Form
N-PORT initially through a voluntary pilot program? If so, what length of time
would be needed for funds and their service providers to appropriately test their
reporting procedures?

•

Is our eighteen-month compliance period for Form N-CEN appropriate? If not,
what length of time would be appropriate? Would a shorter or longer compliance
date be appropriate? For example, would a compliance date of 15 months be

265

sufficient? Conversely, would funds need more time to comply, such as 20
months? Should the compliance period for Form N-CEN mirror that for Form NPORT, or should we consider different compliance periods? Should we adopt a
tiered compliance period for Form N-CEN? Why or why not?
•

We are proposing to not have a compliance period for the option for website
transmission of shareholder reports under proposed rule 30e-3. Is this
appropriate?

Is our eight-month compliance period for our proposed amendments to Regulation
S-X adequate? If not, what length of time would be adequate and why?

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.

Introduction

The Commission is sensitive to the economic effects, including the benefits and
costs and the effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation that will result
from the proposed changes to the current reporting regime. Changes to the current
reporting regime include proposed Form N-PORT, the rescission of Form N-Q,
amendments to the certification requirements for Form N-CSR, amendments to
Regulation S-X, the proposed rule governing electronic transmission of shareholder

266

reports, proposed Form N-CEN, and the rescission of Form N-SAR. The economic
effects of the proposed changes are discussed below.
The Commission is proposing to modernize the content and format requirements
of reports and disclosures by funds, and the manner in which information is filed with the
Commission and disclosed to the public. The intent of the proposal is to enhance the
Commission’s ability to effectively oversee and monitor the activities of investment
companies in order to better carry out its regulatory functions and to aid investors and
other market participants to better assess the benefits, costs, and risks of investing in
different fund products. In summary, and as discussed in greater detail in Part II above,
the Commission is proposing the following changes to its rules and forms:
•

We propose to require registered management investment companies and ETFs
organized as UITs, other than money market funds or SBICs, to report monthly
portfolio information in a structured data format on a proposed new form, Form
N-PORT.

•

Because we believe that monthly portfolio reports on Form N-PORT would
render quarterly portfolio reports on current Form N-Q unnecessarily duplicative,
we are proposing to rescind Form N-Q. We also propose to lengthen the lookback for Sarbanes-Oxley certifications on Form N-CSR to six months to cover the
gap in certification coverage that would otherwise occur once Form N-Q is
rescinded.

•

We propose to revise Regulation S-X to require new, standardized enhanced
disclosures regarding fund holdings in certain derivatives instruments; update the

267

disclosures for other investments; and amend the rules regarding the general form
and content of fund financial statements.
•

We propose new rule 30e-3 under the Investment Company Act, which would
allow funds to satisfy shareholder report transmission requirements by posting
such reports on their own websites if they meet certain conditions, including
posting quarterly portfolio holdings on their websites and notifying investors of
its availability.

•

We propose to rescind Form N-SAR, the form on which funds currently report
census-type information on a semi-annual basis, and replace it with Form N-CEN,
which would require the annual reporting of similar and additional information in
an updated, structured format.
The current disclosure of information by funds serves as the baseline against

which the costs and benefits as well as the impact on efficiency, competition, and capital
formation of this proposal are discussed. The baseline includes the current set of
requirements for funds to file reports on Forms N-CSR, N-Q, and N-SAR with the
Commission and the content of such reports, including Regulation S-X, and in particular,
its schedule of investments. The baseline also includes guidance from Commission staff
and other industry groups that has established industry practices for the disclosure of a
fund’s schedule of investments and financial statements, and includes Commission
guidance that permits funds to transmit these materials electronically today provided that
certain other conditions are met. Lastly, the baseline includes the current practice of
some funds to voluntarily disclose additional information. For example, some funds
disclose monthly or quarterly portfolio investment information on their websites or to

268

third-party information providers, and disclose additional information (e.g., particular
information on derivative positions) in fund financial statements that is not currently
required under Regulation S-X. The parties that would be affected by the proposed
amendments are funds that have registered or will register with the Commission; the
Commission; and other current and future users of fund information including investors,
third-party information providers, and other potential users; and other market participants
that could be affected by the change in fund disclosures.
We discuss separately below the economic effects of each part of the proposal:
the introduction of Form N-PORT, rescission of Form N-Q, amendments to the
certification requirements for Form N-CSR, amendments to Regulation S-X, the
electronic transmission of shareholder reports, and the introduction of Form N-CEN and
the rescission of Form N-SAR. We identify for each part of the proposal the baseline
from which the economic effects will be discussed and the parties most likely to be
affected.
As noted above, the assets of registered investment companies exceeded $18
trillion at year-end 2014, having grown from about $4.7 trillion at the end of 1997. 630 In
addition, approximately 90 million individuals own mutual funds, representing 53.2
million or 43.3% of U.S. households. 631 Among investment companies, we estimate that,
as of December 2014, there were 3,146 investment companies registered with the
Commission, of which 1,636 were open-end funds, 780 were closed-end funds (including

630

See supra note 4.

631

See id.

269

one SBIC), and 727 were UITs. 632 We further estimate that those registered funds
included 16,619 series thereof, of which 1,411 were exchange-traded funds, 528 were
money market funds, 5,381 were UITs, and 9,299 were other funds. 633 The following
table summarizes the entities likely to be affected by the proposed forms, rescissions, and
amendments.

The Commission relies on information included in reports filed by funds to
monitor trends, identify risks, inform policy and rulemaking, and assist Commission staff
in examination and enforcement efforts of the asset management industry. An essential
factor to the Commission’s ability to carry out its regulatory functions is regular, timely
information about portfolio holdings and general, census information about funds.

In

general, this proposal would modernize the fund reporting regime and, among other
effects, would result in an increased transparency of fund portfolios and investment
practices. The increased transparency would improve the ability of the Commission to
fulfill its regulatory functions. These functions include the development of policy and
guidance, the staff’s review of fund registration statements and disclosures, and the
Commission’s examination and enforcement programs. The increased transparency
would also improve the ability of investors to select funds for investment, and therefore
improve their ability to allocate capital across funds and other investments to more
closely reflect their investment risk preferences. Increased transparency would also
enhance competition among funds to attract investors.
At the outset, the Commission notes that, where possible, it has sought to quantify
the costs, benefits, and effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation expected
to result from each part of the proposal and its reasonable alternatives. As discussed in
further detail below, in many cases the Commission is unable to quantify the economic
effects because it lacks the information necessary to provide a reasonable estimate.
The economic effects of the proposal depend upon a number of factors that we
cannot estimate or quantify, such as the extent to which investor protection would
increase along with the ability of the Commission to oversee the fund industry; the
amount of new information that would become available as a result of requiring such
information in regulatory filings (as opposed to information that is provided voluntarily);
the increase in the availability of the information to all investors, institutional and
individual, as a result of the improved structured format of the information; and the
extent to which investors are able to use the information to make more informed

271

investment decisions either through direct use or through third-party service providers.
Therefore, much of the discussion below is qualitative in nature although we try to
describe where possible the direction of these effects.
B.

Form N-PORT, Rescission of Form N-Q, and Amendments to Form
N-CSR

a.

Introduction and Economic Baseline

Form N-PORT, as proposed, would require registered management investment
companies and ETFs organized as UITs, other than money market funds or SBICs, to
report portfolio investment information to the Commission on a monthly basis. As
discussed, only information reported for the last month of each fiscal quarter would be
made available to the public in order to minimize potential costs associated with making
the information public, including front-running or reverse engineering of a fund’s
investment strategies. Reports would be filed in a structured format using XML to allow
for easier aggregation and manipulation of the data. As discussed above, we are also
proposing to rescind Form N-Q but require that funds attach their complete portfolio
holdings to Form N-PORT for the first and third fiscal quarters in accordance to
Regulation S-X. We are also proposing to amend the form of certification in Form NCSR to require each certifying officer to state that he or she has disclosed in the report
any change in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred
during the most recent fiscal half-year to fill the gap in certification coverage that would
otherwise occur once Form N-Q is rescinded. 634

634

Proposed Item 11(b) of Form N–CSR; proposed paragraph 5(b) of certification exhibit of
Item 11(a)(2) of Form N–CSR.

272

The current set of requirements under which registered management investment
companies (other than money market funds and SBICs) and ETFs organized as UITs
publicly report their complete portfolio investments to the Commission on a quarterly
basis and certain other information on a semi-annual basis, 635 as well as the current
practice of some investment companies to voluntarily disclose portfolio investment
information either on their websites or to third-party information providers on a more
frequent basis, is the baseline from which we will discuss the economic effects of new
Form N-PORT. 636 The parties that could be affected by the introduction of Form NPORT are registered management investment companies (other than money market funds
and SBICs) and ETFs organized as UITs, that have registered or will register with the
Commission; the Commission; and other current and future users of investment company
portfolio investment information including investors, third-party information providers,
other interested potential users; and other market participants that could be affected by
the change in fund disclosure of portfolio investment information.
Currently, the Commission requires registered management investment
companies (other than money market funds and SBICs) to report their complete portfolio
investments to the Commission on a quarterly basis. 637 These funds are required to
635

Form N-PORT would also require information that is currently being reported on Form NSAR such as information on fund flows, assets, and liabilities. The current requirement to
report this information as part of Form N-SAR is also part of this baseline.
The baseline also includes the current obligation of Form N-Q filers to make certifications
regarding (1) the accuracy of the portfolio holdings information reported on that form, and
(2) the fund’s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.

636

Additionally, many funds currently provide additional information concerning derivatives
investments, based on industry guidance and practices. See discussion supra Part II.C.2.

637

See General Instruction A to Form N-CSR; Item 6 of Form N-CSR; General Instruction A to
Form N-Q; Quarterly Portfolio Holdings Adopting Release, supra note 19.

273

provide this information in reports on Form N-Q as of the end of the first and third fiscal
quarters of each year 638 and in reports on Form N-CSR as of the end of the second and
fourth fiscal quarters of each year. 639 Both forms require that the reported schedule of
portfolio investments conform to the requirements of Regulation S-X, and the schedule
for the close of the fiscal year must be audited (but those schedules for the other three
fiscal quarters need not be). 640 These reports are generally required to be filed on the
EDGAR system and are made publicly available upon receipt. 641 Reports on Form NCSR may be filed up to 70 days after the end of the reporting period, 642 and reports on
Form N-Q may be filed up to 60 days after the end of the reporting period.
Forms N-CSR and N-Q are required to be filed in HTML or ASCII/SGML
format. 643 In order to prepare reports in HTML and ASCII/SGML, reporting persons
generally need to reformat information from the way the information is stored for normal
business use. 644 The resulting format, when rendered in an end user’s web browser, is
comprehensible to a human reader, but it is not suitable for automated processing. These
formats do not allow the Commission or other interested data users to combine

641

See rule 101(a)(i) of Regulation S-T [17 CFR 232.101(a)(i)].

642

Form N-CSR must be filed within 10 days after the shareholder report is sent to shareholders,
and the shareholder report must be sent within 60 days after the end of the reporting period.
Rule 30b2-1(a); rule 30e-1(c).

643

See rule 301 of Regulation S-T; EDGAR Filer Manual (Volume II) version 27 (June 2014), at
5-1.

644

In so doing, reporting persons typically strip out incompatible metadata (i.e., syntax that is not
part of the HTML or ASCII/SGML specification) that their business systems use to ascribe
meaning to the stored data items and to represent the relationships among different data
items.

274

information from more than one report in an automated way to, for example, construct a
database of fund portfolio positions without additional formatting.
The economic effects from the introduction of new Form N-PORT would largely
result from the disclosure of portfolio investment information in a structured format, as
well as the additional information that investment companies would report. The
economic effects would depend on the extent to which the portfolios and investment
practices of investment companies become more transparent as a result of the increase in
the amount and availability of portfolio investment information, and the ability of
Commission staff and all investors to utilize the structured data. The current reporting
requirements for investment companies, however, reduce the ability of Commission staff
to evaluate the potential economic effects. For example, the non-structured format of
reported portfolio investment information, the absence of information to identify
securities, and reporting inconsistencies between investment companies all reduce the
ability of Commission staff to aggregate information across the fund industry and to
evaluate the economic effects of the proposal.
The proposal would increase the amount of portfolio investment information
available for some investment companies more so than others. For example, investment
companies that utilize derivatives as part of their investment strategy, or that otherwise
engage in alternative strategies, would have more information become available
describing their businesses than other investment companies. Information from Form NSAR provides some indication as to the current use of derivatives by investment
companies. Form N-SAR requires investment companies to identify permitted
investment policies, and if permitted, investment policies engaged in during the reporting

275

period. As of the second half of 2014, on average 75.4% of investment companies
reported as permitted investment policies involving the writing or investing in options or
futures, and on average 5.2% of investment companies reported engaging in each one of
these policies during the report period. 645 In addition, the total net assets of alternative
funds from which more information would become available were as of year-end 2014
approximately $200 billion or 1.2% of the total net assets of the mutual fund market. 646
Although the percentage of net assets of alternative funds relative to the mutual fund
market is currently small, the percentage of flows to alternative funds was 10.2% in 2013
and 4.3% in 2014. 647
b.

Benefits

As discussed, Form N-PORT would improve the information that registered
management investment companies and ETFs organized as UITs (other than money
market funds and SBICs) disclose to the Commission. The increase in the reporting

645

See Item 70 of Form N-SAR for a list of permitted investment policies, and if permitted, the
investment policies engaged in during the reporting period. The percentages are calculated
from the percentage of funds that report affirmatively to either of the two parts for Items 70.B
though 70.I. There is little difference in the proportion of investment companies that reported
as permitted the investment practices relating to Items 70.B through 70.I. The greatest
proportion of funds reported engaging in writing or investing in stock index futures (13.1%)
and engaging in writing or investing in interest rate futures (12.0%), and the smallest
proportion of funds reported engaging in writing or investing in other commodity futures
(1.7%) and engaging in writing or investing in options on stock index futures (0.9%).
Aggregate condensed balance sheet information reported on Form N-SAR indicates that
funds held $2.6 billion in options on equities and options on all futures (Items 74.G and 74.H)
or 0.013% of net assets from the second half of 2014. Aggregate condensed balance sheet
information reported on Form N-SAR from the second half of 2014 also indicates that funds
had $55.9 billion in short sales (Item 74.R.(2)) and $4.2 billion in written options (Item
74.R.(3)), or 0.285% and 0.021% of net assets, respectively. The estimates are approximate.

data, and are based on fund categories as defined by Morningstar.

276

frequency, the update to the structure of the information that reporting funds would
disclose, and the additional information not currently disclosed, discussed in further
detail below, would improve the ability of the Commission to understand, analyze, and
monitor the fund industry. We believe that the information we receive on these reports
would facilitate the oversight of funds and would assist the Commission, as the primary
regulator of such funds, to better effectuate its mission to protect investors, maintain fair,
orderly and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation, through better informed
policy decisions, more specific guidance and comments in the disclosure review process,
and more targeted examination and enforcement efforts.
To the extent that monthly portfolio investment information is not currently
available, the requirement that all investment companies make available portfolio
investment information on a monthly basis to the Commission would improve the ability
of the Commission to oversee investment companies by increasing the timeliness of the
information available, and by providing a larger number of data points, would increase
the ability of Commission staff to identify trends in investment strategies and fund
products as well as industry outliers. 648 As discussed above, the quarterly portfolio
reports that the Commission currently receives on Forms N-Q and N-CSR could become
stale due to the turnover of portfolio securities and fluctuations in the values of the
648

See, e.g., supra text following note 169. Although likely not a significant effect, the increase
in the frequency of portfolio investment disclosure to the Commission could also reduce the
ability of investment companies to alter or “window-dress” portfolio investments in an
attempt to disguise investment strategies and risk profiles that are not consistent with the
disclosures in registration statements and shareholder reports. The incentives for managers to
window-dress in an attempt to mislead investors would not change because the frequency of
public disclosure of portfolio investment information would remain the same. See, e.g.,
Vikas Agarwal, Gerald D. Gay, and Leng Ling, Window Dressing in Mutual Funds, The
Review of Financial Studies, Vol. 27(11), 3133-3170 (2014).

277

portfolio’s investments. Requiring monthly reports on Form N-PORT would decrease
the delay between fund reports, so that the Commission would have more timely
information than it has currently; portfolio investment information that is more timely
would improve the ability of Commission staff to identify risks a fund is facing,
particularly during times of market stress.
The ability of Commission staff to effectively use the information reported in
Form N-PORT is dependent on the ability of staff to compile and aggregate information
into a single database that can then be utilized to conduct industry-wide analyses.
Otherwise, the information would only improve the ability of staff to analyze a single or a
small number of funds at any one time. The structuring of the information in an XML
format would improve the ability of the Commission to compile and aggregate
information across all funds, and to analyze individual funds, a subset of funds, or the
fund industry as a whole, and would increase the overall efficiency of staff to analyze the
information. For example, the ability to compare portfolio investment information across
reporting funds or for a single fund across report dates would improve the ability of the
Commission to identify funds for examination and to identify trends in the fund industry.
The structuring of portfolio investment information may also improve the quality
of the information disclosed by imposing constraints on how the information would be
provided. A feature of XML is a built-in validation framework that can provide precise
constraints as to how the information could be provided. These data checks, which are
not available in the current formats for Form N-CSR and Form N-Q, are important to
ensure that the reports contain information that is accurate and consistent across filings,
and therefore usable by Commission staff. An improved, structured format may also

278

promote additional efficiency among investment companies to the extent that the new
reporting requirements encourage an update and integration of systems, and standardized
formats for the disclosure and transmission of filings.
Form N-PORT would require information that is not currently required to be
reported to the Commission, including portfolio and position level risk-sensitivity
measures and additional information describing derivatives, securities lending activities,
repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, the pricing and liquidity of securities, and
information regarding fund returns and flows. The information would increase the ability
of Commission staff to understand the use of these products and activities as part of a
fund’s investment strategy, as well as the risks of a particular fund, a group of funds, and
the fund industry.
The proposed requirement to report portfolio- and position-level risk sensitivity
measures would provide Commission staff with a set of estimates that summarizes the
risk exposures of a fund. The risk sensitivity measures improve the ability of
Commission staff to efficiently analyze information for all funds and identify those funds
not only with specific risk exposures but also risk exposures that appear to be outliers
among peer funds. An ability to efficiently identify funds based on exposure to certain
risks would improve the Commission’s ability to analyze fund industry trends, monitor
funds, and, as appropriate, engage in further inquiry or timely outreach in case of a
market or other event. Commission staff could also use these measures to determine
whether additional guidance or policy measures are appropriate to improve disclosures.
The calculation of portfolio- or position-level measures of risk for some
derivatives, including derivatives with unique or complicated payoff structures,

279

sometimes requires time-intensive computational methods or additional information that
Form N-PORT would not require. As discussed above, based on staff experience and
outreach, we understand that most funds calculate risk measures for such securities.
Accordingly, we believe that requiring funds to provide these measures is more efficient
than requiring funds to provide all of the information that might be necessary for the
Commission, investors, or other potential users to calculate these measures. The
requirement for investment companies to provide risk measures for derivatives, at the
position-level and at the portfolio-level, would therefore improve the ability of staff to
efficiently identify the risk exposures of funds regardless of the types of derivatives held
or that could be introduced to the marketplace. In addition, the requirement for
investment companies to provide portfolio-level measures of risk would also improve the
ability of staff to efficiently identify interest rate and credit spread exposures at the fund
level and conduct analyses without first aggregating position-level measures.
Form N-PORT would require funds to provide the contractual terms for debt
securities and many of the more common derivatives including options, futures, forwards,
and swaps; the reference instrument for all convertible debt securities and derivatives,
and information describing the size of the position. The information would provide
Commission staff an ability to identify funds with interest rate risk exposure or exposure
to other risks such as those pertaining to a company, industry, or region.
As discussed, for securities lending activities and reverse repurchase agreements,
Form N-PORT would require counterparty identification information, contractual terms,
and information describing the collateral and reinvestment of the collateral. The
additional information could improve the ability of Commission staff to assess fund

280

compliance with the conditions that they must meet to engage in securities lending, as
well as better analyze the extent to which funds are exposed to the creditworthiness of
counterparties, the loss of principal of the reinvested collateral, and leverage creation
through the reinvestment of collateral.
Form N-PORT would also require additional identification information regarding
the reporting fund, the issuers of fund investments, and the investments themselves,
including the reference instruments for convertible debt securities and derivatives
investments. The additional identification information would benefit the Commission by
improving the ability of staff to link the information from Form N-PORT with
information from other sources, such as Form N-CEN, that also identify market
participants and investments with these identifiers. The additional identification
information would be especially important to identify the issuers of fund investments and
the investments themselves. The information would improve the ability of Commission
staff, from the current requirement to provide just the issuer name, to identify and
compare funds that have exposures to particular investments or issuers regardless of the
whether the exposure is direct or indirect such as through a derivative security.
Investors, third-party information providers, and other potential users would also
experience benefits from the introduction of Form N-PORT. While the frequency of
public disclosure of portfolio information would not change, we believe that the
structured format of this information would allow investors and other potential users to
more efficiently analyze portfolio information. Investors and other potential users would
also have quarterly disclosure of additional information that is currently not included in
the schedule of investments reported on Form N-Q and Form N-CSR. The additional

281

information as well as the structure of the information would increase the transparency of
funds’ investment strategies and improve the ability of investors and other potential users
to more efficiently identify the risk exposures of the fund.
Form N-PORT would benefit investors, to the extent that they use the
information, to better differentiate investment companies based on their investment
strategies and other activities. For example, investors would be able to more efficiently
identify funds that use derivatives and the extent to which they use derivatives as part of
their investment strategies. 649 In general, we expect that institutional investors and other
market participants would directly use the information from Form N-PORT more so than
individual investors. As discussed, the format of Form N-PORT is not designed to be
human readable and the amount of information could result in reports that are
voluminous. The Commission therefore has endeavored to mitigate the potential loss of
information to individual investors from the rescission of From N-Q through the
additional disclosure requirements for investment companies as part of this proposal,
including the requirement for investment companies to attach to Form N-PORT complete
portfolio holdings in accordance with Regulation S-X for the first and third fiscal
quarters. 650 Individual investors, however, could indirectly benefit from the information
in Form N-PORT to the extent that third-party information providers and other interested
parties are able to obtain, aggregate, provide, and report on the information. Individual
investors could also indirectly benefit from the information in Form N-PORT to the
649

Form N-PORT would also eliminate the reporting gap between money market funds, which
report portfolio investment information in an XML format on Form N-MFP, and funds
engaging in similar investment strategies such as ultra-short bond funds, which would be
required to file reports on Form N-PORT.

650

See discussion supra Part II.A.2.j.

282

extent that other entities, including investment advisers and broker-dealers, utilize the
information to help investors make more informed investment decisions.
Portfolio investment information that investment companies report to the
Commission is informative in describing the ongoing investment strategy of the fund, 651
and investors could use the information to select funds based on security selection,
industry focus, level of diversification, and the use of leverage and derivatives. 652 An
increase in the ability of investors to differentiate investment companies would allow
investors to allocate capital across reporting funds more in line with their risk preferences
and increase the competition among funds for investor capital. In addition, by improving
the ability of investors to understand the risks of investments and hence their ability to
allocate capital across funds and other investments more efficiently, the introduction of
Form N-PORT could promote capital formation.
Rescission of Form N-Q, along with its certifications of the accuracy of the
portfolio schedules reported for each fund’s first and third fiscal quarters, may result in
some cost savings by funds in terms of administrative or filing costs. However, we
expect any such savings, if any, to be minimal, because under our proposal each fund
would still be required to file portfolio schedules prepared in accordance with §§210.12651

Academic research indicates that the portfolio investment information funds provide to the
Commission, such as on Form N-CSR and Form N-Q, has value even though the information
is publicly available only after a time-lag. See infra notes 664-667. Just as investors can use
the information to front-run or copycat/reverse engineer the investment strategy of a reporting
fund, investors of funds can also use the information to identify funds for investment.

652

Empirical research shows that fund flows are sensitive to many factors including past fund
performance and investor search costs. See, e.g., Erik R. Sirri and Peter Tufano, Costly
Search and Mutual Fund Flows, The Journal of Finance, Vol. 53(5), 1589-1622 (1998);
Zoran Ivković and Scott Weisbenner, Individual Investor Mutual Fund Flows, Journal of
Financial Economics, Vol. 92, 223-237 (2009); George D Cashman, Convenience in the
Mutual Fund Industry, Journal of Corporate Finance, Vol. 18, 1326-1336 (2012).

Form N-PORT, as proposed, would require registered management investment
companies and ETFs organized as UITs, other than money market funds or SBICs, to
incur one-time and ongoing costs to comply with the new filing requirements. Funds
would incur additional ongoing costs to report portfolio investment information on a
monthly basis on Form N-PORT instead of a quarterly basis as currently reported on
Forms N-Q and N-CSR. Funds that voluntarily provide information to third-party
information providers and on its website, including monthly portfolio investments, and
additional information in fund financial statements, including additional information
regarding derivatives similar to the requirements that we are proposing today, would bear
fewer costs as a result of the proposal than those that do not. 653 The Commission is
aware that these funds would nonetheless likely incur additional costs on reports on
proposed Form N-PORT than on voluntary submissions, such as validation and signoff
processes, given that reports on Form N-PORT would be a required regulatory filing and
would possibly require different data than the funds are currently providing to third-party

653

Monthly portfolio investment information is available for approximately 45% of funds
covered by The CRSP Survivor-Bias-Free US Mutual Fund Database as of the third quarter
of 2014. The database covers more than 9,000 open-ended mutual funds during this time
period. This estimate suggests that a large proportion of funds already report monthly
portfolio investment information, although it is unclear whether monthly information is
reported following each month or if information relating to several months is periodically
reported at a later date. Calculated based on data from The CRSP Survivor-Bias-Free US

information providers. Over time, the filings could become highly automated and could
involve fewer costs. 654
Funds would also incur costs to file reports on Form N-PORT in a structured
format. Based on staff experience with other XML filings, however, these costs are
expected to be minimal given the technology that would be used to structure the data. 655
XML is a widely used data format, and based on the Commission’s understanding of
current practices, most reporting persons and third party service providers have systems
already in place to report schedules of investments and other information. Systems
would be able to accommodate an alternative format such as XML without significant
costs, and large-scale changes would likely not be necessary to output structured data
files. In an effort to reduce some of the potential burdens on smaller entities, we are
proposing to extend the compliance period to begin filing reports on Form N-PORT to
thirty months after the effective date for groups of funds with assets under $1 billion. 656
The additional time could increase the ability of these investment companies to comply
with the filing requirements by providing more time for system and operation changes
and from observing larger fund groups.
Form N-PORT would also require the disclosure of certain information that is not
currently required by the Commission. In some instances, such as in the case of

654

Costs related to such processes are included in the estimate below of the paperwork costs
related to Form N-PORT, discussed below.

costs to advisers to private funds of filing Form PF in XML format); Money Market Fund

costs to money market funds of filing reports on Form N-MFP in XML format).

increased disclosures regarding derivatives investments and information concerning the
pricing and liquidity of investments, the Commission is proposing to require parallel
disclosures in the fund’s schedule of investments; accordingly, we expect funds would
generally incur one set of costs to adhere to the reporting of new information on Form NPORT and in its schedule of investments. For other information, such as the reporting of
particular asset classifications, identification of investments and reference instruments,
and risk measures, the information would be disclosed on Form N-PORT only.
To the extent that our proposal would require information to be reported that is
not currently contained in fund accounting or financial reporting systems, funds would
bear one-time costs to update systems to adhere to the new filing requirements. The onetime costs would depend on the extent to which investment companies currently report
the information required to be disclosed. The one-time costs would also depend on
whether an investment company would need to implement new systems, such as to
calculate and report risk-sensitivity measures, and to integrate information maintained in
separate internal systems or by third parties to comply with the new requirements. Based
on staff outreach to funds, we believe that, at a minimum, funds would incur systems or
licensing costs to obtain a software solution or to retain a service provider in order to
report data on risk metrics, as risk metrics are not required to be reported on the fund
financial statements. Our experience with and outreach to funds indicates that the types
of systems funds use for warehousing and aggregating data, including data on risk
metrics, varies widely.
To the extent possible, we have attempted to quantify these costs. As discussed
below, we estimate that funds would incur certain annual paperwork costs associated

286

with preparing, reviewing, and filing reports on Form N-PORT. 657 Assuming that 35%
of funds (3,749 funds) would choose to license a software solution to file reports on Form
N-PORT, we estimate an upper bound on the initial annual costs to funds choosing this
option of $55,970 per fund 658 with annual ongoing costs of $46,745 per fund. 659 We
further assume that 65% of funds (6,962 funds) would choose to retain a third-party
service provider to provide data aggregation and validation services as part of the
preparation and filing of reports on Form N-PORT, and we estimate an upper bound on
the initial costs to funds choosing this option of $54,821 per fund 660 with annual ongoing

See infra notes 736-739, 749 and accompanying text. This estimate is based upon the
following calculations: $55,970 = $4,805 in external costs + $51,165 in internal costs

for a senior portfolio manager) + (24 hours x $283/hour for a compliance manager) + (24
hours x $312/hour for a senior database administrator)).

hours x $283/hour for a compliance manager)).

costs of $38,746 per fund. 661 In total, we estimate that funds would incur initial annual
costs of $515,537,918 and ongoing annual costs of $444,996,657. 662
Although under the proposal there would be no change to the frequency or timelag for which investment company security position information is publicly disclosed, the
increase in the amount of publicly available information and the greater ability to analyze
the information as a result of its structure may facilitate activities such as “front-running,”
“predatory trading,” and “copycatting/reverse engineering of trading strategies” by other
investors. For example, Form N-PORT would result in the disclosure of additional
information, such as pertaining to derivatives and securities lending activities, which
could more clearly reveal the investment strategy of reporting funds and its risk
exposures. The structured format of portfolio investments disclosure could also improve
the ability of other investors to obtain and aggregate the data, and identify specific funds
to front-run or predatory trade. These activities could reduce the profitability from
developing new investment strategies, and therefore could reduce innovation and impact
competition in the fund industry.
Investors that trade ahead of funds could reduce the profitability of funds by
increasing the price of fund purchases and by decreasing the price of fund sales. These
activities can reduce the returns to shareholders who invest in actively managed funds,
661

See infra notes 746, 750 and accompanying text. This estimate is based upon the following
calculations: $38,746 = $11,440 in external costs + $27,306 in internal costs ($27,306 = (18
hours x $266/hour for a financial reporting manager) + (18 hours x $198/hour for a senior
accountant) + (18 hours x $157/hour for an intermediate accountant) + (18 hours x $301/hour
for a senior portfolio manager) + (18 hours x $283/hour for a compliance manager) + (18
hours x $312/hour for a senior database administrator)).

662

These estimates are based upon the following calculations: $591,495,332 = (3,749 funds x
$55,970 per fund) + (6,962 funds x $54,821 per fund). $444,996,657 = (3,749 funds x
$46,745 per fund) + (6,962 funds x $38,746 per fund).

making actively managed funds less attractive investment options. 663 Portfolio
investment information, along with flow information, can also create opportunities for
other market participants to front-run the sales of funds that experience large outflows
and the purchases of funds that experience large inflows, 664 or create opportunities for
other market participants to engage in predatory trading that could lead to further fund
distress. 665
A trading strategy that follows the publicly reported holdings of actively managed
funds can also earn similar if not higher after expense returns. 666 An implication of this
finding is that the public disclosure of portfolio investment information could induce
free-riding by investors that use the information and reduce the potential benefit from
developing new investment strategies and engaging in proprietary market research. The
effect of free-riding would reduce the ability of an investment companies with longer
investment horizons to benefit from researching investment opportunities and developing
new strategies more so than investment companies with shorter investment horizons
because of the increased likelihood that the disclosed portfolio investment information
would reveal their long-term investment strategies. 667

A comparison can be made between the economic effects from the introduction of
Form N-PORT and the economic effects from the introduction of Form N-Q in May 2004
which increased the reporting frequency of portfolio investment information to the
Commission from semiannual to quarterly. The introduction of Form N-Q resulted in an
increase in the amount of information that could have been acted upon by other investors.
For example, evidence indicates that the ability of copycat funds to outperform actively
managed funds increased after the introduction of Form N-Q, 668 and additional evidence
indicates that the performance of those funds with better previous performance or that
invest in low-information stocks decreased following the introduction of Form N-Q. 669
The increase in the frequency of portfolio investment information as a result of Form NQ resulted in an increase in the amount of portfolio investment information available.
Although Form N-PORT would not increase the frequency of public disclosure, Form NPORT would increase the amount of portfolio investment information available. In
addition, Form N-PORT, unlike Form N-Q, would also increase the accessibility of the
information as a result of its structured format.
We have endeavored to mitigate the potential for front-running, predatory trading,
and copycatting/reverse engineering by other market participants by proposing to

See Agarwal et al., supra note 667. Low information stocks include stocks with smaller
market capitalization, less liquidity, and less analyst coverage. The authors also find that the
liquidity of stocks with higher fund ownership increased following the introduction of Form
N-Q. Although the increase in liquidity would benefit investors by reducing trading costs,
this benefit stems as a result of the costly disclosure of potential investment opportunities.

290

maintain the status quo for the frequency and timing of disclosure of publicly available
portfolio information. In addition, much, though not all, of the information that Form NPORT would require, is already disclosed by reporting funds on Form N-CSR and Form
N-Q. 670 The additional information and the structure of the information that would be
required under Form N-PORT, however, would improve the ability of investors to obtain,
aggregate, and analyze all fund investments. Thus, Form N-PORT could negatively
affect actively managed funds by increasing the ability of other investors to copycat or
front-run investment strategies, and in particular could negatively affect those funds that
would have more additional information disclosed, such as funds that use derivatives as
part of their investment strategies. The Commission has considered the needs of the
Commission, investors, and other users of portfolio investment information and the
potential that other investors may use the information to the detriment of the reporting
funds.
Form N-PORT would require the disclosure of information that is currently
nonpublic that could result in additional costs to funds and market participants. For
example, Form N-PORT would require a fund to report the identities and weights of each
of the individual components comprising the reference instruments underlying the fund’s
derivative investments, unless the reference instrument is an index whose components are
publicly available on a website and are updated on that website no less frequently than
quarterly, or the notional amount of the derivative represents 1% or less of the net asset
value of the fund. 671 We understand that many indices used as reference instruments in
670

See supra note 27 and accompanying text.

671

See supra note 123 and accompanying text.

291

derivative investments are proprietary to index providers, and are subject to licensing
agreements between the index provider and the fund. Disclosing the components of a
non-public index could result in costs to both the index provider, whose proprietary
indexing strategy could be imitated, and the fund, whose investments could be frontrun. 672 Moreover, disclosing the underlying components of such an index could subject
the fund to one-time costs associated with renegotiating licensing agreements and the
ongoing payment of fees in order to obtain the rights to disclose the components of the
index. 673 Additionally, the increased transparency in proprietary indexes could ultimately
decrease the incentives of index providers to license the use of such indices to funds as
well as fund demand for securities products that incorporate these indices. Likewise,
Form N-PORT, as well as the proposed amendments to regulation S-X, would require
funds to report certain information regarding fees and financing terms for certain
derivatives contracts, particularly OTC swaps, which are not currently required to be
publicly disclosed. The increased transparency could increase the competition among
swap and security-based swap dealers to offer favorable fees and financing terms, as the
fees and financing terms offered to one fund would be known to other funds negotiating
the terms of such contracts.

672

See Antti Petajisto, The Index Premium and its Hidden Cost for Index Funds, Journal of
Empirical Finance, Vol. 18, 271-288 (2011). Petajisto finds evidence that mechanically
induced demand changes to demand, such as index fund rebalancing, can result in price
effects. If predictable, then other investors could take advantage of the changes to the
proprietary indexes by front-running future trades.

673

The Commission does not have information available to provide a reliable estimate of the
increased costs of such licensing agreements because funds are currently not required to
disclose the agreements or the components of the index.

292

As discussed above, although our proposal would rescind Form N-Q, it would
also require funds to file portfolio schedules prepared in accordance with §§210.12-12 to
12-14 of Regulation S-X for the fund’s first and third fiscal quarters, by attaching those
schedules as attachments to its reports on Form N-PORT for those reporting periods.
Although the schedules attached to Form N-PORT would be largely identical to the
information currently reported on Form N-Q, under our proposal funds would have 30
days to prepare and file the attachments to Form N-PORT, as opposed to the 60 days that
funds currently have to prepare, certify, and file reports on Form N-Q. The faster
turnaround time may result in increased costs to funds, but we expect these costs may be
mitigated by removing the requirement that funds certify this information.
Rescission of Form N-Q would also eliminate certifications of the accuracy of the
portfolio schedules reported for the first and third fiscal quarters, and would also result in
funds providing certifications regarding their disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting semi-annually rather than quarterly. To the
extent that such certifications improve the accuracy of the data reported, removing such
certifications could have negative effects on the quality of the data reported. Likewise, if
the reduced frequency of the certifications affects the process by which controls and
procedures are assessed, requiring such certifications semi-annually rather than quarterly
could reduce the effectiveness of the fund’s disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting are assessed. However, we expect such effects, if
any, to be minimal because certifying officers would continue to certify portfolio
holdings for the fund’s second and fourth fiscal quarters and would further provide semi-

293

annual certifications concerning disclosure controls and procedures and internal control
over financial reporting that would cover the entire year.
C.

Amendments to Regulation S-X

a.

Introduction and Economic Baseline

The proposed amendments to Regulation S-X would require new, standardized
disclosures regarding fund holdings in open futures contracts, open forward foreign
currency contracts, and open swap contracts, and additional disclosures regarding fund
holdings of written and purchased option contracts; update the disclosures for other
investments with conforming amendments, as well as reorganize the order in which some
investments are presented; and amend the rules regarding the general form and content of
fund financial statements, including requiring prominent placement of investments in
derivative investments in a fund’s financial statements, rather than allowing such
schedules to be placed in the notes to the financial statements. 674 Finally, our
amendments would require a new disclosure in the notes to the financial statements
relating to a fund’s securities lending activities.
The current set of requirements under Regulation S-X, as well as the current
practice of many funds 675 to voluntarily disclose additional portfolio investment

674

See supra Part II.C. As discussed above, rule 12-13 of Regulation S-X requires limited
generic information on the fund’s investments other than securities. To address issues of
inconsistent disclosures and lack of transparency, our proposal would standardize a fund’s
disclosures of open futures contacts, foreign currency forward contracts, and swaps. In
addition, while many of the proposed amendments to Regulation S-X are similar to the
proposed disclosures in Form N-PORT (e.g,. enhanced derivatives disclosures), the
amendments to Regulation S-X would be investor-friendly, as the financial statements and
schedule of investments are human-readable (as opposed to proposed Form N-PORT’s
structured data).

675

As we discussed supra note 180, while “funds” are defined in the preamble as registered
investment companies other than face amount certificate companies and any separate series

294

information in fund financial statements and to follow industry guidance and other
industry practices, is the baseline from which we discuss the economic effects of
amendments to Regulation S-X. 676 The parties that could be affected by the proposed
amendments to Regulation S-X include funds that file or would file reports with the
Commission and update or would update registration statements on file with the
Commission, the Commission, current and future investors of investment companies, and
other market participants that could be affected by the increase in the disclosure of
portfolio investment information.
Regulation S-X prescribes the form and content of financial statements required
in shareholder reports and registration updates. Today, Regulation S-X does not
prescribe specific information to be disclosed under Regulation S-X for many
investments in derivatives, which could result in inconsistent reporting between funds
and reduced transparency of the information reported, and in some cases could result in
insufficient information concerning the terms and underlying reference assets of
derivatives to allow investors to understand the investment.
Many of the economic effects from the proposed amendments to Regulation S-X
would largely result from an increase in investor ability to make investment decisions
dependent on more transparent disclosure in shareholder reports and in the financial
statements of registration statements. As discussed above, the economic effects would

thereof—i.e., management companies and UITs, we note that our proposed amendments to
Regulation S-X apply to both registered investment companies and BDCs. See supra notes
264 and 265. Therefore, when discussing fund reporting requirements in the context of our
proposed amendments to Regulation S-X, we are also including changes to the reporting
requirements for BDCs.
676

See discussion supra Part II.C.

295

depend on the extent to which the portfolios and investment practices of investment
companies become more transparent, and the ability of investors, and in particular
individual investors, to utilize shareholder reports to make investment decisions. The
economic effects would also depend on the extent to which investment companies
already voluntarily provide disclosures that would be required by the proposed
amendments. As a result of these factors, some of which are difficult to quantify or
unquantifiable, the discussion below is largely qualitative although certain one-time and
ongoing costs associated with the proposed amendments are quantified below.
b.

Benefits

The amendments to Regulation S-X could benefit investors by updating the
information funds disclose in the financial statements of registration statements and
shareholder reports. Our proposed amendments could benefit investors through increased
transparency into a fund’s investments, particularly for individual investors that we
would not expect to use the information in Form N-PORT because of its structured
format. In particular, the additional information that Regulation S-X would require for
open option contracts both written and purchased, open futures contracts, open forward
foreign currency contracts, open swap contracts, and other investments would increase
the transparency of the fund’s portfolio investments and risk exposures.
Other amendments would also improve the transparency into the fund’s
investments. For example, we are proposing to require funds to identify each investment
whose fair value was determined using significant unobservable inputs. 677 Likewise, we

677

See, e.g., proposed rule 12-13, n.7 of Regulation S-X; see also proposed rules 12-13A, n.5;
12-13B, n.3; 12-13C, n.6; and 12-13D, n.7 of Regulation S-X.

296

are proposing a requirement that funds identify illiquid securities, 678 as well as to
separately identify investments that are restricted. 679 As discussed above, we believe that
the effect of these proposed amendments would be to increase transparency into the
liquidity of investments and help investors better understand how fund investments are
valued. 680
In certain circumstances, we are also requiring funds to separately list each of the
investments comprising the referenced assets underlying swap 681 and option contracts. 682
We believe that increased disclosure of the investments underlying a referenced asset
could benefit investors by making it easier for them to understand and evaluate the
specific risk exposures of a fund from certain swap and option contracts.
We also believe that our proposed changes to the form and content of financial
statements in Article 6 of Regulation S-X will similarly benefit investors, particularly
individual investors, through greater transparency in a fund’s financial statements. For
example, we are proposing to require funds to disclose their investments in derivatives in
the financial statements, as opposed to in the notes to the financial statements. 683 To the
extent funds do not do this already, we believe that more prominent placement of
investments in derivatives in the financial statements (immediately following the

678

See, e.g., proposed rule 12-13, n.8 of Regulation S-X; see also proposed rules 12-13A, n.6;

679

See proposed rule 12-13, n.6 of Regulation S-X; see also proposed rules 12-13A, n.4; 1213B, n.2; 12-13C, n.5; and 12-13D, n.6 of Regulation S-X.

schedules for investments in securities of unaffiliated investors and securities sold short),
would benefit investors through increased visibility of fund investments in derivatives.
Likewise, we are proposing to eliminate the financial statement disclosure of “Total
investments” on the balance sheet under “Assets”. 684 As we discuss in more detail in Part
II.C.5, recognizing that investments in derivatives could be presented under both assets
and liabilities on the balance sheet, eliminating this disclosure would benefit investors by
providing a more accurate representation of the effect of these investments on a fund’s
balance sheet. 685
Other parties that would be affected by the amendments to Regulation S-X
include the Commission and other market participants that would use shareholder reports
and registration statements to obtain fund information. Although the amendments to
Regulation S-X would primarily benefit investors and particularly individual investors,
the Commission and other market participants could use the information reported in a
fund’s shareholder report such as the proposed notes to financial statement relating to
income and expenses from securities lending activities, as well as the terms governing the
compensation of securities lending agents, and would benefit from an increase in
transparency into a fund’s investments and financial statements during examinations.
Commission staff believes that a large number of funds currently adhere to industry
practices from which the amendments to Regulation S-X are derived. The proposal to
amend Regulation S-X, therefore, would effectively standardize the information that all
funds disclose in financial statements, and make the schedule of investments and
684

See proposed rule 6-04 of Regulation S-X; see also discussion supra Part II.C.5.

685

See id.

298

financial statement disclosures consistent and thus more comparable across funds.
Similar to the introduction of Form N-PORT, the amendments to Regulation S-X, to the
extent that it increases the transparency of shareholder reports, could improve the ability
of investors, particularly individual investors, to differentiate investment companies and
make investment decisions. An increase in the ability of investors to differentiate
investment companies and allocate capital across reporting funds closer to their risk
preferences would increase the competition among funds for investor capital. In addition,
by improving the ability of investors to understand investment risks and hence their
ability to allocate capital across funds and other investments more efficiently, the
introduction of Form N-PORT could also promote capital formation.
c.

Costs

We believe that registrants on average will likely incur minimal costs from our
proposed amendments to Regulation S-X because, as discussed above, based upon staff
experience, we believe that a majority of funds are already providing the information that
would be required by the proposed amendments to Regulation S-X in their financial
statements. 686 The costs to a fund of complying with the proposed rules would depend
upon the extent to which funds are already making such disclosures voluntarily. As
discussed above, the Commission is proposing to require parallel disclosures in Form NPORT, and funds would incur one set of costs, both one-time and ongoing, to obtain the
information that would be disclosed in Form N-PORT and in shareholder reports and
registration statements. In addition, other costs that relate to the disclosure of portfolio

686

In order to reduce burdens on funds, we also endeavored, where appropriate, to require
consistent derivatives holdings disclosures between Form N-PORT and Regulation S-X.

299

investment information, including the ability of other investors to front-run or copycat the
investment strategies of funds, would primarily relate to Form N-PORT because of the
additional ability of other interested third-parties and market participants to efficiently
obtain, aggregate, and analyze the information as a result of its structured format as
compared to the non-structured format of reported portfolio investment information in
shareholder reports.
For example, similar to our disclosures proposed in Form N-PORT, 687 proposed
rules 12-13 and 12-13C of Regulation S-X would, under certain circumstances, require
funds to list separately each of the investments comprising referenced assets underlying
swap 688 and option contracts, 689 such as when the referenced asset is an index whose
components are not periodically publicly available on a website. We understand that
many indexes are the proprietary property of an index provider, and may be subject to
licensing agreements between the index provider and the fund. Disclosing the underlying
components of an index could subject the fund to costs associated with negotiating or
renegotiating licensing agreements in order to publicly disclose the components of the
index. The Commission does not have information available to provide a reliable
estimate of the increased costs of licensing agreements because funds currently are not
required to disclose the agreements or the components of the index. In addition,
disclosing the components of a non-public index may include costs to both the index
provider, whose proprietary indexing strategy could be reverse engineered, and the fund,

whose rebalancing trades could be front-run. 690 However, the underlying components
may be more accessible in Form N-PORT as a result of its structured format as compared
to the non-structured format of the information in shareholder reports, and the costs of
disclosing the information would therefore primarily relate to Form N-PORT.
As another example, the proposal includes an instruction to disclose the variable
financing rates for swaps which pay or receive financing payments. 691 It is our
understanding that variable financing rates for swap contracts are often commercial terms
of a deal that are negotiated between the fund and the counterparty to the swap.
Disclosure of favorable variable financing rates could result in costs to the fund in the
form of less favorable variable financing rates for future transactions, but may also
improve the ability of other funds to negotiate more favorable terms. Similar to the
introduction of Form N-PORT, the increased transparency could increase the competition
among swap and security-based swap dealers to offer favorable fees and financing terms.
As with the disclosure of the components of an index, we believe that the majority of the
costs associated with disclosures of variable financing rates, including the increase in
competition for favorable fees and terms, would instead derive from the similar
requirements in proposed Form N-PORT. 692
Funds would incur one-time and ongoing costs to comply with the amendments to
Regulation S-X in addition to the costs attributable to new Form N-PORT. For the
amendments to Regulation S-X, funds would incur one-time and ongoing costs to obtain

the additional information that would be disclosed on shareholder reports and registration
statements, and that would also not be disclosed on Form N-PORT; and funds would also
incur one-time costs to format for presentation all additional information that would be
disclosed on shareholder reports and registration statements. In addition, our proposal
would require funds, to the extent they do not already do so, to present the schedules
associated with rules 12-13 through 12-13D and 12-14 in the financial statements, as
opposed to in the notes to the financial statements. 693 Funds that do not currently present
their schedule of investments in this manner would incur a one-time cost of modifying
the presentation of their financial statements to conform to our proposal.
To the extent possible, we have attempted to quantify these costs. As discussed
below, we estimate that management investment companies would incur certain one-time
additional paperwork and other costs associated with preparing, reviewing, and filing
semi-annual reports in accordance with our proposed amendments to Regulation S-X in
the amount of approximately $2,417 per fund 694 and $27,142,910 in the aggregate. 695 We
similarly estimate that management investment companies would incur certain ongoing
paperwork and other costs associated with preparing, reviewing, and filing semi-annual
reports in accordance with our proposed amendments to Regulation S-X in the amount of

D.

Option for Website Transmission of Shareholder Reports

a.

Introduction and Economic Baseline

As discussed above, the Commission is proposing new rule 30e-3 under the
Investment Company Act, which would permit, but not require, a fund to satisfy
requirements under the Act and rules thereunder to transmit reports to shareholders if the
fund meets certain requirements. These requirements include making the reports and
certain other materials accessible on its website and periodically notifying investors of
the materials’ availability. 702 Funds that do not maintain websites or that otherwise wish
to transmit shareholder reports in paper or pursuant the Commission’s existing electronic
delivery guidance would continue to be able to satisfy the transmission requirements by
those transmission methods.
The current set of requirements under which funds transmit shareholder reports to
investors is the baseline from which we will discuss the economic effects of proposed
rule 30e-3. The baseline also includes the current practice of many funds to make some
or all of these reports—or other materials listing portfolio investment information such as
reports on Form N-Q—accessible on their own websites. The baseline also reflects that
some funds transmit these materials electronically today, pursuant to Commission
guidance that permits such a transmission method on a shareholder-by-shareholder “opt
in” basis, provided that certain other conditions are met. 703 The parties that could be
affected by new rule 30e-3 are funds that currently are or would be required to transmit
shareholder reports under rule 30e-1 or 30e-2, and other current and future users of fund

702

See supra Part II.D.

703

See supra note 289 and accompanying text.

304

portfolio investment information, including investors and third-party information
providers.
Today, most funds are required to disclose their portfolio holdings on a quarterly
basis, with holdings as of the end of the second and fourth fiscal quarters disclosed in the
fund’s semiannual and annual reports, respectively, and holdings as of the end of the first
and third fiscal quarters disclosed in reports on Form N-Q. Funds are generally required
to transmit reports to shareholders on a semiannual basis, and these reports have
historically been paper copies mailed to shareholders. 704 As of December 31, 2014,
about 11,957 funds could rely on proposed rule 30e-3 if it were in effect. 705 As discussed
in detail below, we estimate that these funds—and their shareholders—bear aggregate
annual paperwork expenses of about $616 million in connection with the required
preparation and transmission of shareholder reports (or about $51,539 for each
portfolio). 706 Of those estimated expenses, we estimate that about $116 million are

704

See supra note 288 and accompanying text.

705

See infra note 799 and accompanying text.

706

As discussed below, we previously estimated 994,960 aggregate annual internal burden hours
associated with rules 30e-1 and 30e-2. See infra notes 853 and 855 (estimating 903,000
hours for rule 30e-1 and 91,960 hours for rule 30e-2). The Commission estimates the wage
rate associated with these burden hours based on salary information for the securities industry
compiled by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. The estimated wage
figure is based on published rates for attorneys and intermediate accountants, modified to
account for an 1,800-hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size,
employee benefits, and overhead, yielding an effective hourly rate of $268.50. This estimate
is based upon the following calculation: ($380 per hour for Attorneys × 0.5) + ($157 per
hour for Intermediate Accountants × 0.5) = $268.50. See Securities Industry and Financial
Markets Association, Report on Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities
Industry 2013. Based on the Commission’s estimate of 994,960 burden hours per year and
the estimated wage rate of about $268.50 per hour, the total annual paperwork expenses for
funds associated with the internal hour burden of rules 30e-1 and 30e-2 are approximately
$267,146,760. This estimate is based upon the following calculation: 994,960 hours ×
$268.50 per hour = $267,146,760. We have also estimated aggregate annual external cost
burden of $349,105,750 associated with rules 30e-1 and 30e-2. See infra notes 854 and 856

305

associated with the printing and mailing of shareholder reports. 707 Reports on Form N-Q
are available on EDGAR. 708 Some funds choose to make some or all of these reports—or
other materials listing portfolio holdings at particular times—accessible on their own
websites, but funds do not do so uniformly.
As technology has developed, so has the need to modernize the manner in which
shareholder reports and portfolio investment information are delivered to investors. As
discussed above, recent investor testing and Internet usage trends have highlighted that
investor preferences about electronic delivery of information have evolved, and that
many investors would prefer enhanced availability of fund information on the Internet. 709
In addition, investor testing has suggested that fund investors are much more likely to
seek out fund information on the fund’s own website than they are to seek it out on
EDGAR. 710 Moreover, searching for and retrieving individual reports on Form N-Q on
EDGAR may, in many cases, be more difficult than navigating a website with which the
investor is likely to be already familiar. We therefore believe that many investors may
(estimating $333,905,750 for rule 30e-1 and $15,200,000 for rule 30e-2). Therefore, we
estimate that the total estimated aggregate annual paperwork expenses associated with rules
30e-1 and 30e-2 are $616,252,510. This estimate is based upon the following calculation:
$267,146,760 expenses associated with internal burden hours + $349,105,750 external cost
burden = $616,252,510. Using this estimate and our prior estimate of 11,957 funds, we
estimate that annual paperwork expenses associated with rules 30e-1 and 30e-2 are about
$51,539 on a per-portfolio basis. This estimate is based upon the following calculation:
$616,252,510 aggregate annual paperwork expenses ÷ 11,957 funds = $51,539.
707

We estimate that one-third of the external costs attributed to rules 30e-1 and 30e-2 relate to
printing and mailing expenses. See infra notes 857–858. Therefore, we estimate aggregate
annual printing and mailings costs associated with those rules of about $116,368,583. This
estimate is based upon the following calculation: $349,105,750 aggregate external cost
burden ÷ 3 = $116,368,583.33.

not view the information that is available in reports on Form N-Q. Shareholders also pay,
pro rata, the expenses associated with printing and mailing reports by default to
shareholders, who may nonetheless prefer electronic transmission.
The economic effects of proposed rule 30e-3 are dependent on a number of
factors, including the number of funds that would rely on the rule, the number of funds
which currently rely on Commission guidance to transmit shareholder reports
electronically, and the extent to which shareholders become more aware of the
availability of portfolio investment information, view the information, and use the
information to make investment decisions. Due to the optionality of the rule, we would
expect that, in general, each fund would only rely on the rule if the benefits to that fund
exceeded the costs. We have provided estimates of the costs associated with printing and
mailing shareholder reports. However, information that would allow the Commission to
quantify the other economic effects of the rule, such as how the availability of
shareholder reports online will affect investors’ use of the information, is not known to
us.
Funds can transmit shareholder reports electronically today pursuant to
Commission guidance. However, funds wishing to rely on this Commission guidance
must satisfy certain conditions, including that shareholders agree to electronic
transmission on a shareholder-by-shareholder “opt in” basis. We recognize that express
shareholder consent can be difficult to obtain even for practices that many shareholders

307

may prefer. 711 The number of funds that transmit shareholder reports electronically today
is unclear to us, because funds are not required to report their reliance on the
Commission’s electronic delivery guidance or the number of investors that have given
opt-in consent to receive electronic delivery. Commission staff is also not aware of
information that describes the prevalence of electronic delivery of disclosure documents
and other information. In addition, although survey evidence describes certain investor
preferences regarding electronic delivery of shareholder report information, 712 we are not
aware of information that would describe the effect of this rule on investor ability to
choose between funds and allocate capital across all investments. For these reasons,
much of the discussion below is qualitative in nature.
b.

Benefits

The proposed rule, to the extent that it is relied upon by funds and alters the
current transmission of reports, would increase the accessibility of portfolio investment
information including information from the first and third fiscal quarters that might
otherwise be only available on EDGAR. The proposed rule would thereby increase the
awareness of fund shareholders of the availability of portfolio investment information,
and therefore also increase the likelihood that fund investors review portfolio investment
information. The proposed rule would also increase the likelihood that fund shareholders
view the portfolio investment information in their preferred format, and thereby increase

711

See Investment Company Act Release No. 22884 (Nov. 13, 1997) [62 FR 61933, 61935
(Nov. 20, 1997)] (concerning implied consent to delivery of disclosure documents to
households).

712

See supra note 292 and accompanying text.

308

their use of the information to make investment decisions. 713 Similar to the introduction
of Form N-PORT and the amendments to Regulation S-X, greater investor use of
shareholder reports could result in more informed investment decisions, particularly for
individual investors, and an increase in competition among funds for investor capital. A
greater understanding of the investment strategy of the fund, its portfolio composition,
and its investment risks could also result in a more efficient allocation of capital across
funds and other investments, and could thereby promote capital formation.
Funds and their shareholders would also benefit from a reduction in expenses
related to the physical distribution of shareholder reports. Although the proposed rule
would not have much of an effect, if any, on the expenses associated with the preparation
of reports, we expect that the expenses associated with printing and mailing of
shareholder reports would be substantially reduced if the rule is adopted. As discussed in
detail below, of the estimated $116 million in annual paperwork expenses associated with
the printing and mailing of shareholder reports, 714 we estimate that about $105 million
would be eliminated if the proposed rule were adopted. 715 The actual reduction in
paperwork expenses would depend, in part, upon reliance on the proposed rule by funds

713

See supra notes 291–296 and accompanying text (concerning investor Internet usage statistics
and transmission method preferences).

714

See supra notes 706–707 and accompanying text.

715

We estimate that about 90% of the $116,368,583 in paperwork expenses associated with
printing and mailing shareholder reports pursuant to rules 30e-1 and 30e-2 would be
eliminated if rule 30e-3 were adopted. See supra note 707; infra notes 857–858. Therefore,
we estimate that about $104,731,725 of annual paperwork expenses associated with rules
30e-1 and 30e-2 would be eliminated if rule 30e-3 were adopted. This estimate is based upon
the following calculation: $116,368,583 in aggregate annual printing and mailing expenses ×
0.90 proportion eliminated = $104,731,724.70 eliminated annual printing and mailing
expenses.

309

and the extent of shareholder consent to electronic transmission of reports, each of which
is uncertain.
The expected benefits would not necessarily be distributed uniformly across funds
and across a fund’s shareholders. Some funds already transmit materials electronically to
some or all of their shareholders, and these funds would experience fewer benefits from
electing to rely on the proposed rule. Some funds, such as funds that do not currently
maintain websites, may choose not to rely on the proposed rule.
c.

Costs

Although we believe that permitting electronic delivery “by default” would
improve overall alignment of transmission method with investor preferences, 716 there
may be some investors who would prefer to receive print copies that do not notify their
fund of that preference and may be others that would benefit from print copies even
though they prefer electronic transmission. These investors, depending on their ability
and preference to access shareholder reports and portfolio investment information
electronically, could overlook electronic deliveries or otherwise experience a reduction in

716

See supra note 292. We believe that the change from requiring shareholders to “opt-in” if
they wish to receive electronic instead of print copies of shareholder reports, to—as under the
proposed rule—“opt-out” if they wish to receive print copies instead of electronic copies
would increase the ability of funds to transmit shareholder reports electronically. Although
the preferences of shareholders would not change dependent on the form of consent,
behavioral economic theory and empirical evidence suggest the likelihood that shareholders
receive electronic transmissions of fund reports would be greater under opt-out consent rather
than opt-in consent. See, e.g., Richard H. Thaler and Shlomo Bernatzi, Save More
Tomorrow™: Using Behavioral Economics to Increase Employee Saving, Journal of
Political Economy, Vol. 112:1, S164-S187 (2004); Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein,
Libertarian Paternalism, The American Economic Review, Vol. 93:2, 175- 179 (2003).
Thaler and Sunstein argue that a “status quo” bias results in the continuance of existing
arrangements even if better options are available. The authors illustrate their argument with
higher rates of initial enrollments in employee savings plans when enrollment is automatic as
compared to when employees must first complete an enrollment form.

310

their ability to access portfolio investment information, and could result in a decrease in
their ability to efficiently allocate capital across funds and other investments. We have
endeavored, through the consent and notice provisions of the proposed rule, to mitigate
the potential costs associated with this possibility by requiring a fund wishing to rely on
the proposed rule to alert an investor before beginning to transmit reports electronically
and to notify the investor around the time each report is made accessible on the website.
Although, as discussed above, an increase in investor use of shareholder reports could
increase competition among funds for investor capital, funds that do not rely on the rule
could be placed at a competitive disadvantage depending on whether investors choose
funds based on their preference for website transmission.
As discussed above, reliance on proposed rule 30e-3 would be optional, and funds
that rely on the rule would incur costs to adhere to the rule. Relying funds would incur
paperwork expenses associated with satisfying the conditions of the proposed rule, such
as making the materials publicly accessible; preparing, reviewing, and transmitting a
notice to shareholders; soliciting the consent of each shareholder by sending them an
initial statement; and printing and mailing shareholder reports and other materials upon
request. As discussed in detail below, we estimate that these paperwork expenses would
be, in the aggregate, about $32 million each year. 717 Relying funds would also incur

717

Below, we estimate that 10,761 funds would choose to rely on proposed rule 30e-3. See infra
note 799 and accompanying text. Below, we estimate that funds that elect to rely on rule
30e-3 will, on average, incur 0.76 burden hours per fund per year to comply with the website
accessibility conditions of rule 30e-3. See infra note 808 and accompanying text. Therefore,
in the aggregate, we estimate that such funds would incur about 8,178 burden hours to
comply with these requirements. This estimate is based upon the following calculation: 0.76
burden hours per fund × 10,761 funds expected to rely on rule 30e-3 = 8,178.36 hours. The
Commission estimates the wage rate associated with these burden hours based on salary
information for the securities industry compiled by the Securities Industry and Financial

311

Markets Association. The estimated wage figure is based on published rates for senior
programmers, modified to account for an 1,800-hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to
account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead, yielding an effective hourly
rate of $303. See Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Report on
Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013. Based on the
Commission’s estimate of 8,178 burden hours per year and the estimated wage rate of about
$303 per hour, the total annual paperwork expenses for funds associated with the internal
hour burden imposed by the website accessibility conditions of rule 30e-3 are approximately
$2,477,934. This estimate is based upon the following calculation: 8,178 hours × $303 per
hour = $2,477,934.
Below, we also estimate that funds that elect to rely on proposed rule 30e-3 would incur
average annual external costs of $500 per fund in connection with the requirement to provide
a complete shareholder report upon request of a shareholder. See infra note 816 and
accompanying text. We estimate that aggregate external costs to funds in connection with
this requirement would therefore be about $5,380,500. This estimate is based upon the
following calculation: $500 per fund × 10,761 funds = $5,380,500.
Below, we also estimate that funds that elect to rely on proposed rule 30e-3 would incur
about 0.38 annual burden hours in connection with the initial statement conditions of the rule.
See infra note 829 and accompanying text. Therefore, in the aggregate, we estimate that such
funds would incur about 4,089 burden hours to comply with these requirements. This
estimate is based upon the following calculation: 0.38 burden hours per fund × 10,761 funds
expected to rely on rule 30e-3 = 4,089.18 hours. The Commission estimates the wage rate
associated with these burden hours based on salary information for the securities industry
compiled by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. The estimated wage
figure is based on published rates for compliance attorneys, modified to account for an 1,800hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits,
and overhead, yielding an effective hourly rate of $334. See Securities Industry and Financial
Markets Association, Report on Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities
Industry 2013. Based on the Commission’s estimate of 4,089 burden hours per year and the
estimated wage rate of about $334 per hour, the total annual paperwork expenses for funds
associated with the internal hour burden imposed by the initial statement conditions of rule
30e-3 are approximately $1,365,726. This estimate is based upon the following calculation:
4,089 hours × $334 per hour = $1,365,726. Below, we also estimate that these funds will
incur annual cost burden of about $216 per fund to comply with the initial statement
conditions. This estimate is based upon the following calculation: $49 per fund per year for
services of outside counsel + $333 per year per fund to print and mail initial statements =
$382 per fund per year. See infra notes 837 and 844. Such funds would therefore incur about
$4,110,702 in aggregate annual cost burden to comply with the initial statement conditions.
This estimate is based upon the following calculation: $382 per fund per year × 10,761 funds
= $4,110,702 per year. Thus the total estimated annual paperwork expenses associated with
the initial statement conditions are $5,476,428. This estimate is based upon the following
calculation: $1,365,726 associated with internal burden + $4,110,702 external cost burden =
$5,476,428.
Below, we also estimate that funds that elect to rely on proposed rule 30e-3 would incur
about 1.5 annual burden hours in connection with the notice conditions of the rule. See infra
note 832 and accompanying text. Therefore, in the aggregate, we estimate that such funds
would incur about 16,142 burden hours to comply with these requirements. This estimate is

312

initial one-time costs associated with establishing systems and procedures for
compliance. We estimate that these expenses would be, in the aggregate, about $16
million. 718

based upon the following calculation: 1.5 burden hours per fund × 10,761 funds expected to
rely on rule 30e-3 = 16,141.5 hours. Based on the Commission’s estimate of 16,142 burden
hours per year and the estimated wage rate of about $334 per hour, the total annual
paperwork related expenses for funds associated with the internal hour burden imposed by the
website accessibility conditions of rule 30e-3 are approximately $5,391,428. This estimate is
based upon the following calculation: 16,142 hours × $334 per hour = $5,391,428. Below,
we also estimate that these funds will incur annual cost burden of about $1,190 per fund to
comply with the notice conditions. This estimate is based upon the following calculation:
$190 per fund per year for services of outside counsel + $1,000 per fund per year to print and
mail notices = $1,190 per fund per year. See infra notes 840 and 845 and accompanying text.
Such funds would therefore incur about $12,805,590 in aggregate annual cost burden to
comply with the notice conditions. This estimate is based upon the following calculation:
$1,190 per fund per year × 10,761 funds = $12,805,590 per year. Thus the total estimated
annual paperwork expenses associated with the notice conditions are $12,816,518. This
estimate is based upon the following calculation: $5,391,428 associated with internal burden
+ $12,805,590 external cost burden = $18,197,018.
Thus, we estimate that the total annual paperwork expenses associated with satisfying the
conditions of proposed rule 30e-3 would be $31,531,880. This estimate is based upon the
following calculation: $2,477,934 associated with website accessibility conditions +
$5,380,500 associated with provision of print report upon request condition + $5,476,428
associated with initial statement condition + $18,197,018 associated with notice condition =
$31,531,880.
718

Below, we estimate that funds that elect to rely on rule 30e-3 will, on average, incur an
additional 0.08 one-time burden hours per fund in the first year to comply with website
accessibility conditions. See infra notes 807–808 and accompanying text. Therefore, in the
aggregate, we estimate that such funds would incur about 861 one-time burden hours to
comply with these requirements. This estimate is based upon the following calculation: 0.08
hours per fund × 10,761 funds = 860.88 hours. Based on the Commission’s estimate of 861
one-time burden hours and the estimated wage rate of about $303 per hour for senior
programmers, the total annual paperwork expenses for funds associated with the internal hour
burden imposed by the website accessibility conditions of rule 30e-3 are approximately
$260,883. This estimate is based upon the following calculation: 861 hours × $303 per hour
= $260,883. Below, we also estimate that about 113 funds that wish to rely on proposed rule
30e-3 but that do not currently have a website will incur one-time cost burden of $2,000 per
fund to comply with the website accessibility conditions. See infra notes 804 and 811 and
accompanying text. Such funds would therefore incur about $226,000 in aggregate one-time
cost burden to comply with the website accessibility conditions. $2,000 per fund × 113 funds
= $226,000. Thus the total estimated one-time paperwork expenses associated with the
website accessibility conditions are $486,883. This estimate is based upon the following
calculation: $260,883 associated with internal burden + $226,000 external cost burden =
$486,883.

313

We have endeavored to mitigate the costs associated with compliance with the
rule’s conditions by, for example, requiring that the required schedule of portfolio
investment information as of the end of the first and third fiscal quarters be presented
Below, we also estimate that funds that elect to rely on rule 30e-3 will, on average, incur an
additional 0.92 one-time burden hours per fund in the first year to comply with the initial
statement conditions. See infra notes 828–829 and accompanying text. Therefore, in the
aggregate, we estimate that such funds would incur about 9,900 one-time burden hours to
comply with these requirements. This estimate is based upon the following calculation: 0.92
hours per fund × 10,761 funds = 9,900.12 hours. Based on the Commission’s estimate of
9,900 one-time burden hours and the estimated wage rate of about $334 per hour, the total
annual administrative expenses for funds associated with the internal hour burden imposed by
the initial statement conditions of proposed rule 30e-3 are approximately $3,306,600. This
estimate is based upon the following calculation: 9,900 hours × $334 per hour = $3,306,600.
Below, we also estimate that these funds will incur one-time cost burden of $762 per fund to
comply with the initial statement conditions. This estimate is based upon the following
calculation: $95 per fund for the services of outside counsel + $667 per fund to print and
mail initial statements = $762 per fund. See notes 836–843 and accompanying text. Such
funds would therefore incur about $8,199,882 in aggregate one-time cost burden to comply
with the initial statement conditions. This estimate is based upon the following calculation:
$762 per fund × 10,761 funds = $8,199,882. Thus the total estimated one-time paperwork
expenses associated with the initial statement conditions are $11,506,482. $3,306,600
associated with internal burden + $8,199,882 external cost burden = $11,506,482.
Below, we also estimate that funds that elect to rely on rule 30e-3 will, on average, incur an
additional 0.8 one-time burden hours per fund in the first year to comply with the notice
conditions. See infra notes 831–832 and accompanying text. Therefore, in the aggregate, we
estimate that such funds would incur about 8,609 one-time burden hours to comply with these
requirements. This estimate is based upon the following calculation: 0.8 hours per fund ×
10,761 funds = 8,608.8 hours. Based on the Commission’s estimate of 8,609 one-time
burden hours and the estimated wage rate of about $334 per hour, the total annual paperwork
expenses for funds associated with the internal hour burden imposed by the notice conditions
of proposed rule 30e-3 are approximately $2,875,406. This estimate is based upon the
following calculation: 8,609 hours × $334 per hour = $2,875,406. Below, we also estimate
that these funds will incur one-time cost burden of $95 per fund to comply with the notice
conditions. See infra notes 839–840 and accompanying text. Such funds would therefore
incur about $1,022,295 in aggregate one-time cost burden to comply with the initial statement
conditions. This estimate is based upon the following calculation: $95 per fund × 10,761
funds = $1,022,295. Thus the total estimated one-time paperwork expenses associated with
the notice conditions are $3,897,701. This estimate is based upon the following calculation:
$2,875,406 associated with internal burden + $1,022,295 external cost burden = $3,897,701.
Thus, we estimate that the total one-time paperwork expenses associated with satisfying the
conditions of proposed rule 30e-3 would be $15,891,066. This estimate is based upon the
following calculation: $486,883 associated with website accessibility conditions +
$11,506,482 associated with initial statement condition + $3,897,701 associated with notice
condition = $15,891,066.

314

consistent with the reporting requirements of Regulation S-X. Most funds would have
established procedures in place to prepare and review such disclosures and would be
familiar with the disclosure requirements. Because reliance on the proposed rule would
be optional, a particular fund would not be expected to rely on the proposed rule if the
costs of the rule to that fund would exceed its benefits. Funds that do not rely on the
proposed rule would therefore not incur compliance costs.
E.

Form N-CEN and Rescission of Form N-SAR

a.

Introduction and Economic Baseline

Form N-CEN, as proposed, would require funds to report census information to
the Commission on an annual basis. Although Form N-CEN would include many of the
same data elements as the current census-type reporting form, Form N-SAR, it would
replace items that are outdated or no longer informative with items of greater importance.
Form N-CEN would also eliminate certain items that are reported to the Commission in
other forms. Reports would also be filed in a structured, XML format to allow for easier
aggregation and manipulation of the data. Form N-SAR would be rescinded.
The current set of requirements—management companies must file reports on
Form N-SAR semi-annually, 719 and UITs file such reports annually 720—is the baseline
from which we discuss the economic effects of Form N-CEN. The parties that could be
affected by the rescission of Form N-SAR and the introduction of Form N-CEN include
funds that currently file reports on Form N-SAR and funds that would file reports on
Form N-CEN; the Commission; and, other current and future users of fund census

719

See rule 30b1-1.

720

See rule 30a-1.

315

information including investors, third-party information providers, and other interested
potential users.
At the time it was adopted, Form N-SAR was intended to reduce reporting
burdens and better align the information reported with the characteristics of the fund
industry. As the fund industry has developed, including the development of new
products, so has the need to update the information the Commission requires in order to
improve its ability to monitor the compliance and risks of reporting funds. The format in
which information is reported in Form N-SAR is also outdated, which reduces the ability
of Commission staff to obtain and aggregate the information. The technology in which
Form N-CEN would be filed allows for both the sender and recipient to validate the
information against identical definitions, thereby increasing the accuracy of the
information and therefore the ability of Commission staff to compare the information
across funds.
The economic effects from the introduction of new Form N-CEN and the
rescission of Form N-SAR would largely result from an update to the format of the
information reported, as well as the update to the census information that investment
companies would report. The economic effects would therefore depend on the extent to
which investment companies become more transparent, and the ability of Commission
staff and investors to utilize the updated disclosures. Form N-CEN would require census
information about the fund industry reported in a structured format. However, while
Form N-SAR is also reported in a structured format, Form N-CEN would modernize the
information funds report and the required format of the filings. Therefore, although the
introduction of Form N-CEN would increase the transparency of the fund industry, we do

316

not know the extent to which the transparency would increase or the significance of its
economic implications.
b.

Benefits

As discussed above, the Commission is proposing to rescind Form N-SAR and
replace it with new Form N-CEN in order to improve the quality and utility of the
information reported to the Commission. The improvement in the quality and utility of
the information would allow Commission staff to better understand industry trends,
inform policy, and assist with the Commission’s examination program.
Similar to Form N-PORT, the ability of the Commission to most effectively use
the information is dependent on the ability of staff to compile and aggregate the
information into a single database. The structuring of the information in an XML format
would improve the ability and efficiency of Commission staff to obtain and analyze the
information. An improved structured format could also promote additional efficiency to
the extent that the new reporting requirements encourage modernization of internal
systems and standardization for the disclosure and transmission of information. An XML
format would also improve its accuracy by providing sophisticated constraints as to how
information could be provided and by allowing for built-in validation.
Form N-CEN would also modernize the census information that funds provide
and increase its utility to Commission staff, investors, and other interested parties by
reflecting the changes to the fund industry. The Commission would use the information
in Form N-CEN to improve its understanding of fund industry trends and practices, and
assist with the Commission’s examination program. Commission staff has identified
specific information that could improve its ability to effectively oversee funds including
identifying information, when applicable, about the fund’s service providers, information
317

describing financial support by an affiliated entity, classification of fund type, and
information describing investments in CFCs.
Along with the additional information, Form N-CEN would add new
requirements for information specifically relating to the ETF primary markets, including
more detailed information on authorized participants and creation unit requirements. 721
We believe that our proposed additional information on ETFs allows the Commission to
better understand and assess the ETF market and also inform the public about certain
characteristics of the ETF primary markets. Additionally, Form N-CEN, like Form NSAR, has particular sections for closed-end funds, SIBCs, and UITs in order to obtain
information about the particular characteristics of these entities to assist us in monitoring
the activities of these funds and our examiners in their preparation for exams of these
funds.
Form N-CEN would also add new requirements for information relating to a
management company’s securities lending activities, including information concerning
the management company’s securities lending agents and cash collateral managers. 722
Together with the requirements on securities lending activities in proposed Form NPORT, this information would benefit the Commission’s oversight abilities and,
potentially, future policymaking concerning securities lending. Moreover, we believe
that this information could inform investors and other interested parties about the use of
and potential risks associated with a management company’s securities lending activities.

721

See discussion supra Part II.E.4.e.

722

See Item 30 of proposed Form N-CEN.; see also discussion supra Part II.E.4.c.iii.

318

We expect funds to also benefit from replacing Form N-SAR with Form N-CEN
through reduced expenses. First, we estimate that N-CEN has a lower cost per filing than
Form N-SAR, as a result of filing in an XML format, as opposed to the outdated format
of Form N-SAR, and the elimination of certain information items on Form N-SAR that
funds would not be required to report on Form N-CEN. Second, funds that are
management investment companies would experience reduced paperwork related costs
from decreasing the reporting frequency of census information from semi-annual to
annual. We estimate that filers would have an aggregate annual paperwork related
expenses of $12,395,064 for reports on Form N-CEN. 723 By contrast, we estimate that
the ongoing paperwork related expenses of filing Form N-SAR is $25,299,092
annually. 724 Accordingly, we estimate the annual paperwork related cost savings to funds
associated with the adoption of Form N-CEN, compared to Form N-SAR, would be
$12,904,028. We recognize that these ongoing annual cost savings would be offset by a
one-time cost in the first year to file reports on N-CEN, estimated at $20,040,020. 725

723

This estimate is based on annual ongoing burden hour estimate of 32,294 burden hours for
management companies (2,419 management companies x 13.35 hours per filing) plus 6,623
burden hours for UITs (727 UITs x 9.11 burden hours per filing), for a total estimate of
38,917 burden ongoing hours. This was then multiplied by a blended hourly wage of $318.50
per hour, $303 per hour for Senior Programmers and $334 per hour for compliance attorneys,
as we believe these employees would commonly be responsible for completing reports on
proposed Form N-CEN ($318.50 x 38,917 = $12,395,064.50). See infra Part V.B.1.

724

This estimate is based on an assumption of annual ongoing burden hour estimate to file Form
N-SAR of 74,263 burden hours for management investment companies (2,419 management
companies x 15.35 hours per filing x 2 filings per year) and 5,169 burden hours for UITs (727
UITs x 7.11 burden hours per filing) for a total estimate of 79,432 ongoing burden hours.
This was then multiplied by a blended hourly wage of $318.50 per hour ($318.50 x 79,432 =
25,299,092). See infra Part V.B.2.

725

This estimate is based on an estimate of 20 initial burden hours per filer, multiplied by a
blended hourly wage of $318.50 (20 hours x 3,146 filers x $318.50 = $20,040,020)

319

The rescission of Form N-SAR and the introduction of Form N-CEN, to the
extent relevant, could provide similar benefits to investors, to third-party information
providers, and to other potential users from an update to the census information that
investment companies report and from an update to its structured format. Similar to
Form N-PORT, we expect that institutional investors and other market participants could
use the information from Form N-CEN more so than individual investors, and that the
format of the data may make the information difficult for individual investors to
understand. However, individual investors may indirectly benefit from the increase in
information to the extent that it becomes available through third-party information
providers. For the investors and other potential users that would obtain and use the
information reported in Form N-CEN, the update to the structure of the information
would improve their ability to efficiently aggregate the information collected on Form
N-CEN across all investment companies.
The changes to the reporting of census information, including the reporting of the
information in a modern structured format, could improve the ability of investors to
differentiate investment companies and could therefore lead to an increase in competition
among funds for investor capital. These changes would not significantly relate to the
ability of investors to understand the investment risks of investment companies, and
therefore would not significantly improve the ability of investors to efficiently allocate
capital. Consequently, the reporting changes would not significantly promote capital
formation.
c.

Costs

As discussed above, we expect the adoption of N-CEN and rescission of Form NSAR would result in reduced costs to funds in the form of lower expenses related to filing
320

Form N-CEN relative to Form N-SAR. ETFs and closed-end funds, however, may have
higher expenses in filing reports on Form N-CEN relative to other investment companies,
as they will generally be required to provide more information. There could, however, be
costs as a result of the change in the disclosure of census information. For example, the
Commission would receive census information on an annual instead of semi-annual basis,
and therefore the information would be more dated than if the information was reported
to the Commission on a semi-annual basis. 726 As discussed above, we believe that the
costs related to reducing the frequency of the information received on Form N-SAR is not
significant as this information is unlikely to change frequently. Also, some of the
information from Form N-SAR would not be included in Form N-CEN. 727 However, we
have attempted to mitigate the potential cost relating to the loss of information by
eliminating only that information which is either available elsewhere, not frequently used
by Commission staff, or provides little benefit.
Form N-CEN could impose costs on investors and other potential users of the
information to obtain the information from a new or additional source, including the
information that would not be included on Form N-CEN but would be available through
other filings. The information that would not be included on Form N-CEN and that

726

However, as discussed supra note 378, this cost is mitigated, in part, by the fact that certain
items that the Commission staff has deemed necessary on a more frequent basis would be
included instead in reports on proposed Form N-PORT. In addition, the static nature of the
information that would be reported on Form N-CEN increases the likelihood that the
information remains current.

727

See discussion supra Part II.E.5.

321

would not be available elsewhere would impose costs on investors and other potential
users from a loss of information to the extent that the information is found to be useful. 728
F.

Alternatives to the Reporting Requirements

The Commission has explored ways to modernize and improve the utility and the
quality of the information that funds provide to the Commission and to investors.
Commission staff examined how information reported to the Commission could be
improved to assist the Commission in its rulemaking, inspection, examination,
policymaking, and risk-monitoring functions, and how technology could be used to
facilitate those ends. Commission staff also examined enhancements that would benefit
investors and other potential users of this information, including updating the reporting
obligations of funds to keep pace with the changes in the fund industry.
In formulating our proposal, we have considered many alternatives to the
individual elements contained in our proposal, and those alternatives are outlined above
in the sections discussing each of the five parts of our proposal, and we have requested
comment on these alternatives. 729 The following discussion addresses significant
alternatives to our proposal, which involve broader issues than the more granular

728

Some of the information that would no longer be requested, such as loads paid to captive or
unaffiliated brokers, has been found by interested third-parties, including researchers, to be
important in their analysis of the fund industry. See, e.g., Susan E. K. Christoffersen, Richard
Evans, and David K. Musto, What do Consumers’ Fund Flows Maximize? Evidence from
Their Brokers’ Incentives, The Journal of Finance, Vol. 68(1), 201-235 (2013). We are
proposing to eliminate certain items from Form N-SAR that are either infrequently used by
the Commission, provide minimal benefits, or costly for funds to provide. We request
comment on the items required by Form N-SAR that would be eliminated by Form N-CEN.
See discussion supra Part II.E.5.

729

See generally supra Parts II and II.G.5.

322

alternatives to the individual elements contained in each part of our proposal, as
discussed above.
We considered the frequency at which Commission staff believed it to be
important to receive information from investment companies. A possible alternative to
the monthly reporting of portfolio investment information in Form N-PORT is a quarterly
reporting of the information, with the quarterly reports containing information for each
month in the quarter. The quarterly reporting of portfolio investment information could
decrease the ongoing burden of the proposal on investment companies. We do not
believe, however, that the quarterly reporting of portfolio investment information would
be as useful for Commission staff to oversee investment companies on an ongoing basis
given the increase in alternative strategies and the use of derivatives, as this information,
even if broken out into monthly data, would result in the Commission receiving the
information with a longer time lag. For example, a longer time lag for the Commission to
receive portfolio investment information could reduce its effectiveness to analyze the
effect of a market or other event on the fund industry.
Likewise, a possible alternative to the annual reporting of census information in
Form N-CEN is a semiannual reporting of the information similar to Form N-SAR.
However, as we discussed above, the census-type nature of the information that we
would collect from funds in Form N-CEN should not change frequently. Requiring
management companies to report census information semi-annually would therefore
place a burden on funds without a commensurate increase in the value of the information
received by the Commission.

323

We also considered alternatives to extend or shorten the filing period of Form NPORT from thirty days and Form N-CEN from sixty days. While a shorter filing period
would provide more timely information to the Commission, it would also place a burden
on funds that need time to collect, verify, and report the required information to the
Commission. Conversely, a longer filing period would give funds more time to report the
information and would decrease the potential costs to front-running or copycatting by
other investors, but would decrease the utility of the information for the Commission.
We therefore believe that the thirty-day filing period for Form N-PORT and the sixty-day
filing period for Form N-CEN would appropriately balance the staff’s need for timely
information against the appropriate amount of time for funds to collect, verify, and report
information to the Commission.
Other significant alternatives relate to the public dissemination of information
reported on Form N-PORT. Alternatives to the proposal include making more of the
portfolio and other information reported on the form either non-public or public,
including making all or none of the information reported on Form N-PORT each month
publicly available, and increasing or decreasing the lag from the date funds would file
this information to when the information would be publicly released. Making more of
the portfolio and other information reported on the form non-public or increasing the
time-lag to release the information would reduce the amount of information investors
have access to when making investment decisions. However, as discussed above, making
more of the portfolio and other information reported on the form public or decreasing the
time-lag could increase the risk of front-running, predatory trading, and

324

copycatting/reverse engineering of trading strategies by other investors. 730 We believe
the current proposal strikes an appropriate balance of providing more usable information
to investors and other third-parties while mitigating the risk of potential investor harm
that could occur from more frequent disclosure of portfolio information.
Other alternatives relate to the information that the Commission could require
when determining the specific items to include and exclude on From N-PORT and Form
N-CEN. The Commission considered what information it believes to be important for the
Commission’s oversight activities and to the public, and the costs to investment
companies to provide the information. In particular, the Commission considered the
benefits and costs of the information already disclosed in Form N-CSR, Form N-Q, and
Form N-SAR, and that could be required on Form N-PORT and Form N-CEN.
Commission staff believes that the benefits of the information currently disclosed by
investment companies that would be reported on Form N-PORT and Form N-CEN,
especially in a structured format, justify the costs to investment companies to report the
information in these forms.
The Commission also considered the information that would be required on Form
N-PORT as compared to the information on Form N-CEN. Commission staff considered
the benefits to having the information more frequently updated as well as the cost to
funds to report the information. Although the costs to report information on a more
frequent basis imposes additional costs on funds, Commission staff believes the
information that would be reported more frequently on Form N-PORT, relative to the

730

See Part IV.C.c

325

annual reporting on Form N-CEN, is necessary for the Commission’s oversight activities
and could be important to other interested third-parties.
The Commission also considered the benefits and costs of the new information
that would be required on Form N-PORT and Form N-CEN. The new information that
would be required includes contractual terms for debt securities and derivatives, a
description of reference instruments, if any, and information describing securities lending
and repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements. A reasonable alternative would be to
not require some of the new information, and another reasonable alternative would be to
require information in addition to what is currently proposed.
As discussed, the Commission would require information which provides staff an
ability to identify investment risks and engage in further outreach as necessary, and not
requiring the information would substantially reduce the ability of the Commission to
oversee the fund industry. In addition, the information would be important to investors to
differentiate investment companies. Although the new information that would be
reported on Form N-PORT and Form N-CEN could increase the initial and ongoing
reporting costs for investment companies, and increase the likelihood of front-running or
copycatting by other investors, Commission staff believes that the information is
important to fully describe a fund’s investments.
The Commission is also proposing to require risk-sensitivity measures at the
portfolio and position level on Form N-PORT. These measures would aid Commission
staff to efficiently understand the risk exposures of investment companies, especially
those funds that invest in debt securities and derivatives. The portfolio risk-sensitivity
measures, DV01 and SDV01, and the position level risk-sensitivity measure, delta, would

326

improve the ability of Commission staff to efficiently approximate the risk exposures of
reporting funds.
A reasonable alternative is to require additional portfolio and position level risksensitivity measures that would provide Commission staff a more precise approximation
of the risk exposures of reporting funds for larger changes in the value of the reference
instrument. For example, Form N-PORT could require at the portfolio level measures
that describe the sensitivity of a reporting fund to a 50 or 100 basis point change in
interest rates and credit spreads, and a measure of convexity; and Form N-PORT at the
position level could require gamma. 731 These measures could improve the ability of
Commission staff to monitor the fund industry when large changes in prices and rates
occur. The Commission could also require other risk measures including vega. While
potentially valuable, requiring these additional risk-sensitivity measures could increase
the burden on funds, and the additional precision might not significantly improve the
ability of Commission staff to monitor the fund industry in most market environments.
Another reasonable alternative is to not require any risk-sensitivity measures, or limit the
requirement to certain derivatives such as those traded over-the-counter. Although the
burden to investment companies to provide the information would be less if fewer or no
risk-sensitivity measures were required by the Commission, staff believes that the
benefits from requiring the measures, including the ability to efficiently identify and size
specific investment risks, justify the costs to investment companies to provide the
measures.
731

Other risk-sensitivity measures that the Commission could request include portfolio-level
duration measures at the position level, or additional position level risk sensitivity measures
such as vega.

327

The Commission is proposing a tiered compliance for filing reports on Form
N-PORT—funds that together with other investment companies in the same group of
related investment companies with assets over $1 billion would have eighteen months to
file reports, and smaller groups of related investment companies with assets less than $1
billion would have thirty months to file reports. An alternative would be to not allow for
tiered compliance and require all investment companies to begin filing reports on Form
N-PORT within eighteen months. We believe it is appropriate to tier the compliance
period to improve the ability of smaller fund complexes to make the system and internal
process changes necessary to prepare reports on Form N-PORT. Although the
Commission, investors, and other interested parties would potentially not have access to
structured portfolio investment information for the smaller fund complexes until thirty
months after the effective date, information similar to the proposed requirements
concerning disclosures of derivatives that would be required on reports on proposed Form
N-PORT would be available elsewhere, such in the fund’s financial statements as a result
of amendments to Regulation S-X. Although another alternative would be to tier the
compliance period for our proposed amendments to Regulation S-X, we believe that it is
less likely that smaller fund complexes would benefit from additional time to modify
systems to adhere to the amendments to Regulation S-X because the proposed
amendments are largely consistent with current disclosure practices and would therefore
be unnecessary. Likewise, we could propose a tiered compliance period for reports on
proposed Form N-CEN. However, as discussed above, we believe that it is less likely
that smaller fund complexes would need additional time to comply with the requirements
to file Form N-CEN because the requirements are similar to the current requirements to

328

file Form N-SAR, and we expect that filers will prefer the updated, more efficient filing
format of Form N-CEN. Commission staff also considered requiring funds to continue to
report Form N-Q, and to amend Form N-SAR instead of replacing it with Form N-CEN.
Commission staff believes, however, that the new reporting requirements for portfolio
investment information, including the amendments to the certification requirements of
Form N-CSR, would cause Form N-Q to become redundant if not outdated, and therefore
impose costs on funds to file reports that would result in little benefit. Although
requiring that certifying officers state that they have disclosed in the report any change in
the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most
recent fiscal half-year would increase the burden of filing Form N-CSR, these
certifications are necessary to ensure that the information reported continues to be
accurate. The Commission also believes that the technology associated with Form NSAR required the introduction of a new form in order to increase the benefits from the
changes made to the reporting of census information. One effect of the amendments to
Regulation S-X would be to provide investors with more transparency in a fund’s
investments. For example, as discussed above, we are proposing to require funds, under
certain circumstances, to disclose the components of a custom index underlying swaps or
option contracts. As an alternative, we could require funds to only disclose a brief
description of the index or require a different threshold for identifying the components of
the swap or options contract, such as a custom basket that represents a larger portion of
the fund’s assets under management. Although these alternatives would attenuate the
information disclosed and reduce the potential costs to funds and index providers, these

329

alternatives would result in less transparency for investors into the assets underlying a
swap or options contract and any related risks associated with these investments.
The accessibility of information about a fund’s investments would also increase
as a result of the new option for transmission of shareholder reports and other portfolio
investment information. In general, the requirements of proposed rule 30e-3 are designed
to allow funds to take advantage of the cost efficiencies from the advancements in
technology and to more closely align the transmission format to investor preferences,
while at the same time ensuring that shareholders would have an opportunity to view
reports in their desired form and have an opportunity to view portfolio investment
information in a central and more familiar location. One alternative would be to require
different notice and consent procedures, and another alternative would be for funds to
report different portfolio investment information on their websites. We believe that the
requirements of rule 30e-3, as proposed, provide investors an ability to receive
shareholder reports in their desired format and become aware of the availability of
portfolio investment information, while at the same time providing funds an opportunity
to take advantage of advancements in technology and reduce burdens.
Lastly, the Commission is proposing that investment companies file Form NPORT and Form N-CEN in an XML structured format. One alternative is to not structure
the information. As discussed, the ability of Commission staff investors, third-party
information providers, and other potential users to utilize the information is dependent on
the efficiency in which the information investment companies provide can be compiled
and aggregated. Commission staff believes that the affected parties to this proposal
would experience substantially less benefit from the reporting of investment company

330

information if the information is not structured. In addition, based on the Commission’s
understanding of current practices, it is likely that investment companies and third party
service providers have systems in place to accommodate the use of XML. Therefore,
requiring information in a format such as XML should impose minimal costs. The
proposal would require funds to file certain attachments to their reports on Form NPORT and Form N-CEN, and these attachments would not be required in a structured
format. Commission staff believes that only marginal benefits would result from
requiring funds to file these attachments in a structured, XML format due to the narrative
format of the information provided.
The technology used to structure the data could affect the benefits and costs
associated with the proposed rules, and we have therefore considered alternative formats
for structuring the data, such as XBRL. Sending a data file from a sender to a recipient
requires many conditions to be satisfied, and one of crucial importance to regulatory data
collection is the need for validation. XML provides for a built-in validation framework,
and is supported in all modern programming languages. Other data formats can achieve
validation but through custom software. The nature of the information we are collecting
also lends itself to an XML format due to the non-complex requirements to structure the
information, and does not necessitate the need for a more robust framework such as
XBRL.

Request for Comments

Throughout this release, we have discussed the anticipated benefits and costs of
the proposed rules and their potential impact on efficiency, competition, and capital
formation. While the Commission does not have comprehensive information on all
aspects of asset management industry reporting, the Commission is using the data
331

currently available in considering the effects of the proposals. The Commission requests
comment on all aspects of this initial economic analysis, including on whether the
analysis has: (1) identified all benefits and costs, including all effects on efficiency,
competition, and capital formation; (2) given due consideration to each benefit and cost,
including each effect on efficiency, competition, and capital formation; and (3) identified
and considered reasonable alternatives to the proposed new rules and rule amendments.
We request and encourage any interested person to submit comments regarding the
proposed rules, our analysis of the potential effects of the rules and other matters that
may have an effect on the proposed rules. The Commission requests that commenters
identify sources of data and information as well as provide data and information to assist
the Commission in analyzing the economic consequences of the proposed rules.

We are

also interested in comments on the qualitative benefits and costs we have identified and
any benefits and costs we may have overlooked. We urge commenters to be as specific
as possible.
Comments on the following questions are of particular interest.
•

To what extent would the monthly public reporting or the quarterly public
reporting of monthly portfolio investment information aid in the ability of other
investors to front-run, predatory trade, or copycat/reverse engineer the investment
strategy of reporting funds? To what extent would the monthly public reporting
or the quarterly public reporting of monthly portfolio investment information
reduce the incentives of fund companies to develop new or alternative strategies,
and what would be the effect on fund competition? How would investors benefit
from the public reporting of portfolio investment information in the first and

332

second month of each fiscal quarter as compared to the public reporting of the
third month only? Would investors benefit from the quarterly public reporting of
monthly portfolio investment information? Why?
•

To what extent would the additional information required on Form N-PORT,
especially with respect to the contractual terms for debt securities and derivatives,
including information describing reference instruments, if any, and to securities
lending and repurchase and reverse repurchase result in additional front-running,
predatory trading, or copycatting/reverse engineering by other investors? Does
this raise any confidentiality or other concerns?

•

What are the benefits, costs, and other economic effects from funds providing
portfolio investment information in a structured XML format? In particular, what
are the effects of structured portfolio investment information on the ability of
other investors to front-run, predatory trade, or copycat/reverse engineer the
investment strategy of reporting funds? How would the effect of structured
portfolio investment information differ between funds that engage in alternative
strategies or utilize derivatives as part of its investment strategy and those funds
that do not? To what extent would portfolio investment information that is
structured reduce the incentives of fund companies to develop new or alternative
strategies, and what would be the effect on fund competition? Also, would the
public reporting of portfolio investment information in an XML format result in a
decrease in the costs to investors from obtaining the information?

•

What are the operational benefits and costs to investment companies to file Form
N-PORT and Form N-CEN in a structured format? What are the costs to funds

333

from adapting systems to the new filing requirements? To what extent would the
fund industry benefit from a standard format to report information?
•

Is there additional information that Form N-PORT and Form N-CEN, as
proposed, could require that would aid in the ability of the Commission to oversee
the fund industry or that could be beneficial to other potential users? Are any of
the proposed information requirements duplicative or unnecessary? What are the
benefits and costs of reporting this additional information? Is there information
that Form N-PORT and Form N-CEN, as proposed, would require that does not
aid in the ability of the Commission to oversee the fund industry and would not
benefit other potential users? What are the benefits and costs of not reporting this
information?

•

What are the costs, benefits, and other economic effects from investment
companies reporting risk-sensitivity measures on Form N-PORT? What is the
current availability of the measures to investment companies, in particular for
more complex or exotic derivatives? Are there competitive or other economic
effects from the reporting of risk-sensitivity measures? Would the public
reporting of the risk-sensitivity measures disclose information relating to
proprietary risk management practices of investment companies?

•

To what extent would the proposal affect the ability of investors to understand the
investment risks of investment companies as a result of the proposal and to
efficiently allocate capital? Would investors be more likely to allocate additional
capital to investment companies? What would be the effect on fund competition
for investor capital?

334

•

Under what circumstances and to what extent would funds choose to rely on
proposed rule 30e-3 by making shareholder reports publicly accessible on a
website and satisfying the other conditions of the rule? Would allowing funds
that choose to rely on the proposed rule to transmit shareholder reports to their
investors “by default” result in more investors viewing shareholder reports in a
format that the investors prefer, or would the need for each investor who wishes
to receive a printed report to affirmatively “opt-out” of electronic delivery reduce
the number of shareholders that receive reports in the format that they prefer?
Why or why not? What is the likelihood that investors would mistakenly opt-out
and consent to website posting? Lastly, to what extent do investors compare
portfolio investment information between fiscal quarters, and would investors
benefit from the requirement that a fund’s shareholder reports as well as its
complete portfolio holdings from its most recent first and third fiscal quarters be
publicly accessible on a website?

•

What are the costs, benefits, and other economic effects to other market
participants including third-party information providers, index providers, and
swap dealers? For instance, what would be the economic effects of structured
data on the cost to service providers to offer aggregated information to investors?
Are there other market participants that would be affected by the proposal that are
not discussed above? What are the benefits and costs to these other market
participants?

•

What are the benefits and costs of providing an additional twelve months for
smaller entities to comply with the requirements to file Form N-PORT? Are there

335

potential costs from smaller fund complexes potentially not providing structured
portfolio investment information during the additional twelve months? Are the
potential costs, if any, from a loss of disclosed portfolio investment information
from small fund complexes mitigated by the amendments to Regulation S-X? Are
there other alternatives to the current compliance dates that would be more
beneficial or that would be less costly, including with respect to other parts of the
proposal? Which alternatives and why?
•

What are the costs associated with rescinding N-Q and replacing Form N-SAR?
How reliant are investors, third-party information providers, and other interested
parties on the data reported on these forms? What are the costs to investors, thirdparty information providers, and other interested parties to obtain the information
from alternative sources? What are the benefits from the amendments to
certification requirements of Form N-CSR? What are the costs?

•

Are there alternatives to the proposal that the Commission did not consider that
would result in a more robust disclosure regime for investment companies? What
are the costs associated with those alternatives? Similarly, are there alternatives
to the proposal that would result in the same benefits but that would be less
costly? Which alternatives and why?

V.

PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT
Proposed new forms, Form N-CEN and Form N-PORT, and proposed new rule

30e-3 contain “collections of information” within the meaning of the Paperwork

336

Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”). 732 In addition, the proposed amendments to Articles 6
and 12 of Regulation S-X would impact the collections of information under rules 30e-1
and 30e-2 of the Investment Company Act, 733 and the proposed amendments to Forms
N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4 and N-6 under the Investment Company Act and Securities Act
would impact the collections of information under those forms. Furthermore, the
proposals would rescind Forms N-Q and N-SAR, thus eliminating the collections of
information associated with those forms.
The titles for the existing collections of information are: “Form N-Q – Quarterly
Schedule of Portfolio Holdings of Registered Management Investment Company” (OMB
Control No. 3235-0578); 734 “Form N-SAR under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
Semi-Annual Report for Registered Investment Companies” (OMB Control No. 32350330); Rule 30e-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, Reports to Stockholders
of Management Companies” (OMB Control No. 3235-0025); “Rule 30e-2 pursuant to
Section 30(e) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Reports to Shareholders of Unit
Investment Trusts” (OMB Control No. 3235-0494); “Form N-CSR under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and under the Investment Company Act of 1940, Certified
732

44 U.S.C. 3501 through 3521.

733

The paperwork burden from Regulation S-X is imposed by the rules and forms that relate to
Regulation S-X and, thus, is reflected in the analysis of those rules and forms. To avoid a PRA
inventory reflecting duplicative burdens and for administrative convenience, we have previously
assigned a one-hour burden to Regulation S-X.

734

Currently, there is a collection of information associated with rule 30b1-5 under the
Investment Company Act. See rule 30b1-5, ‘Quarterly Report’ Originally submitted and
approved as Proposed Rule 30b1-4 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, ‘Quarterly
Report’” (OMB Control No. 3235-0577). Rule 30b1-5 is the rule that requires certain funds
to file Form N-Q. Among other things, today’s proposals would rescind Form N-Q and
require certain funds to file proposed Form N-PORT pursuant to proposed rule 30b1-9. If
proposed rule 30b1-9 is adopted, we anticipate discontinuing the information collection for
rule 30b1-5.

(17 CFR 274.11d) Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, Registration Statement

Insurance Policies” (OMB Control No. 3235-0503). We are also submitting new
collections of information for proposed new forms, Form N-CEN and Form N-PORT and
proposed new rule 30e-3 under the Investment Company Act. The titles for these new
collections of information would be: “Form N-CEN Under the Investment Company
Act, Annual Report for Registered Investment Companies;” “Form N-PORT Under the
Investment Company Act, Monthly Portfolio Investments Report;” “Rule 30e-3 Under
the Investment Company Act, Website Transmission of Shareholder Reports.” The
Commission is submitting these collections of information to the OMB for review in
accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3507(d) and 5 CFR 1320.11. An agency may not conduct or

338

sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it
displays a currently valid control number.
The Commission is proposing new forms, Form N-CEN and Form N-PORT, new
rule 30e-3, and amendments to Regulation S-X and the relevant registration forms, as
well as the rescission of Forms N-Q and Form N-SAR as part of a set of reporting and
disclosure reforms. These reforms are designed to harness the benefits of advanced
technology and to modernize the fund reporting regime in order to help investors and
other market participants better assess different fund products and to assist the
Commission in carrying out our regulatory functions. We discuss below the collection of
information burdens associated with these reforms.
A.

Portfolio Reporting

1.

Form N-PORT

Under our proposal, certain funds would be required to file an electronic monthly
report on proposed Form N-PORT within thirty days after the end of each month.
Proposed Form N-PORT is intended to improve transparency of information about funds’
portfolio holdings and facilitate oversight of funds. The information required by
proposed Form N-PORT would be data-tagged in XML format. The respondents to
proposed Form N-PORT would be management investment companies (other than money
market funds and small business investment companies) and UITs that operate as ETFs.
Compliance with proposed Form N-PORT would be mandatory for all such funds.
Responses to the reporting requirements would be kept confidential for reports filed with
respect to the first two months of each quarter; the third month of the quarter would not
be kept confidential, but made public sixty days after the quarter end.

339

We estimate that 10,710 funds 735 would be required to file, on a monthly basis, a
complete report on proposed Form N-PORT reporting certain information regarding the
fund and its portfolio holdings. Based on our experience with other interactive data
filings, we estimate that funds would prepare and file their reports on proposed Form NPORT by either (1) licensing a software solution and preparing and filing the reports in
house, or (2) retaining a service provider to provide data aggregation, validation and/or
filing services as part of the preparation and filing of reports on proposed Form N-PORT
on behalf of the fund. We estimate that 35% of funds (3,749 funds) would license a
software solution and file reports on proposed Form N-PORT in house. 736 We further
estimate that each fund that files reports on proposed Form N-PORT in house would
require an average of approximately 44 burden hours to compile (including review of the
information), tag, and electronically file a report on proposed Form N-PORT for the first
time 737 and an average of approximately 14 burden hours for subsequent filings. 738

735

This estimate includes 8,731 mutual funds (excluding money market funds), 1,411 ETFs and
568 closed-end funds and is based on ICI statistics as of December 31, 2014 available at
http://www.ici.org/research/stats.

736

See Money Market Fund Reform 2014 Release, supra note 13, at 47945 (adopting
amendments to Form N-MFP and noting that approximately 35% of money market funds that
report information on Form N-MFP license a software solution from a third party that is used
to assist the funds to prepare and file the required information).

737

We anticipate that these funds would use the same software that was used to generate reports
on Form N-Q and that the software vendor offering the Form N-Q software would likely offer
an update to that software to handle reports on Form N-PORT. Accordingly, we estimate the
burden associated with information that is currently filed on Form N-Q and that would also
be filed on Form N-PORT to generally be the same – 10.5 hours per filing. With respect to
new data that would be required by Form N-PORT that was not required by Form N-Q, we
generally estimate that it would initially take up to 10 hours to connect the software to the
new data points. However, because we understand risk metrics data may be located on a
different system than portfolio holdings data and because current reporting requirements do
not require funds to have a process in place for these two systems to work together, with
respect to the new risk metrics data that would be required by Form N-PORT, we estimate
that it would initially take up to 15 hours to connect the risk metrics data to the software and

340

Therefore, we estimate the per fund average annual hour burden associated with proposed
Form N-PORT for 3,749 fund filers is 198 hours for the first year 739 and 168 hours for
each subsequent year. 740 Amortized over three years, the average aggregate annual hour
burden would be 178 hours per fund. 741
We estimate that 65% of funds (6,962 funds) would retain the services of a third
party to provide data aggregation, validation and/or filing services as part of the
preparation and filing of reports on proposed Form N-PORT on the fund’s behalf. 742
Because reports on Form N-PORT would be filed in a structured format and more
frequently than current portfolio holdings reports (i.e., Form N-CSR and Form N-Q), we
that, once connected, it would take 5 hours to program the risk metrics software to output the
required data to the Form N-PORT software. Additionally, we added another 3.5 hours to
our estimated initial burden to account for the increased amount of information that would be
required to be reported on Form N-PORT, but that is not currently required by Form N-Q.
See infra note 738 (discussing the additional 30% burden added to the current Form N-Q
estimate). We also note that funds that are part of a larger fund complex may realize certain
economies of scale when preparing and filing reports on proposed Form N-PORT. For
purposes of our analysis, we do not account for such economies of scale.
738

We anticipate that most of the burden associated with licensing a software solution, as
discussed above, will be a one-time burden. Accordingly, we estimate approximately 14
hours per fund for subsequent filings. This estimate is based on the 10.5 hours currently
estimated for filings on Form N-Q, plus 30% to account for the amount of additional
information that would be required to be filed on Form N-PORT. Additionally, because we
believe that the required information is generally maintained by funds pursuant to other
regulatory requirements or in the ordinary course of business, for the purposes of our
analysis, we have not ascribed any time to collecting the required information. See also
supra note 737 (noting that our estimates do not account for economies of scale).

739

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (1 filing x 44 hours) + (11 filings x 14
hours) = 198 burden hours in the first year.

740

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 12 filings x 14 hours = 168 burden hours
in each subsequent year.

741

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (198 + (168 x 2)) / 3 = 178.

742

See Money Market Fund Reform 2014 Release, supra note 13, at 47945 (adopting
amendments to Form N-MFP and noting that approximately 65% of money market funds that
report information on Form N-MFP retain the services of a third party to provide data
aggregation and validation services as part of the preparation and filing of reports on Form NMFP).

341

anticipate that funds and their third-party service providers will move to automate the
aggregation and validation process to the extent they do not already use an automated
process for portfolio holdings reports. For these funds, we estimate that each fund would
require an average of approximately 60 burden hours to compile and review the
information with the service provider prior to electronically filing the report for the first
time 743 and an average of approximately 9 burden hours for subsequent filings. 744
Therefore, we estimate the per fund average annual hour burden associated with proposed
Form N-PORT for 6,962 funds would be 159 hours for the first year 745 and 108 hours for
each subsequent year. 746 Amortized over three years, the average aggregate annual hour

743

In order to be able to automate the process of communicating data to a third-party service
provider so that it can be reported on Form N-PORT, we estimate that it will initially take a
fund 60 hours to either procure software and integrate it into its systems or, alternatively, to
write its own software. For those funds that already have an automated portfolio reporting
process in place, we estimate that they would initially incur the same burden as those funds
that license a software solution and file reports on proposed Form N-PORT in house. For
these latter funds, however, we are using the higher burden hours estimated for using a third
party service provider in order to be conservative in our estimates because we lack data on
the number of funds that currently have an automated portfolio reporting process in place.
See supra note 737 (discussing the burdens associated with licensing a software solution and
filing reports on proposed Form N-PORT in house); see also supra note 737 (noting that our
estimates do not account for economies of scale).

744

We anticipate that most of the burden associated with third-party aggregation and validation
will be the result of creating an automated process, as discussed above, and thus will be a
one-time burden. Accordingly, we estimate approximately 9 hours per fund for subsequent
filings. This estimate is based on the 10.5 hours currently estimated for filings on Form N-Q,
plus 30% to account for the amount of additional information that would be required to be
filed on Form N-PORT, and subtracting 5 hours in recognition of the use of a third-party
service provider to assist in the preparation and filing of reports on the form. Additionally,
because we believe that the required information is generally maintained by funds pursuant to
other regulatory requirements or in the ordinary course of business, for the purposes of our
analysis, we have not ascribed any time to collecting the required information. See also
supra note 737 (noting that our estimates do not account for economies of scale).

745

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (1 filing x 60 hours) + (11 filings x 9
hours) = 159 burden hours per year.

746

The estimate is based on the following calculation: 12 filings x 9 hours = 108.

342

burden would be 125 hours per fund. 747 In sum, we estimate that filing reports on
proposed Form N-PORT would impose an average total annual hour burden of 1,537,572
on applicable funds. 748
In addition to the costs associated with the hour burdens discussed above, funds
would also incur other external costs in connection with reports on proposed Form
N-PORT. Based on our experience with other interactive data filings, we estimate that
funds that would file reports on proposed Form N-PORT in house would license a thirdparty software solution to assist in filing their reports at an average cost of $4,805 per
fund per year. 749 In addition, we estimate that funds that would use a service provider to
prepare and file reports on proposed Form N-PORT would pay an average fee of $11,440
per fund per year for the services of that third-party provider. 750 In sum, we estimate that
all applicable funds would incur on average, in the aggregate, external annual costs of
$97,674,221. 751

747

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (159 + (108 x 2)) / 3 = 125.

748

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (3,749 x 178 hours) + (6,962 x 125
hours) = 1,537,572.

749

We estimate that money market funds that file reports on Form N-MFP in house license a
third-party software solution for approximately $3,696 per fund per year. Due to the
increased volume and complexity of the information that would be filed in reports pursuant to
proposed Form N-PORT, we have increased our external cost estimate for funds filing in
house on proposed Form N-PORT by 30% (or $1,109).

750

We estimate that money market funds that file reports on Form N-MFP through a third-party
service provider pay approximately $8,800 per fund per year. Due to the increased volume
and complexity of the information that would be filed in reports pursuant to proposed Form
N-PORT, we have increased our estimate for funds filing through a third-party service
provider on proposed Form N-PORT by 30% (or $2,640).

751

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (3,749 funds that would file reports on
proposed Form N-PORT in house x $4,809 per fund, per year) + (6,962 funds that would file
reports on proposed Form N-PORT using a third-party service provider x $11,440 per fund,
per year) = $97,674,221.

343

2.

Rescission of Form N-Q

Our proposed reforms would rescind Form N-Q in order to eliminate
unnecessarily duplicative reporting requirements. The proposed rescission of Form N-Q
would affect all management investment companies required to file reports on the form.
We currently estimate that each fund requires an average of approximately 21
hours per year to prepare and file two reports on Form N-Q annually, for a total estimated
annual burden of 219,513 hours. 752 Accordingly, we estimate that, in the aggregate, our
proposed rescission would eliminate the 219,513 annual burden hours associated with
filing Form N-Q. Additionally, we currently estimate that there are no external costs
associated with the certification requirement or with preparation of reports on Form N-Q
in general.
B.

Census Reporting

1.

Form N-CEN

As proposed, amended rule 30a-1 would require all funds to file reports on
proposed Form N-CEN with the Commission on an annual basis. 753 Similar to current
Form N-SAR, proposed Form N-CEN would require reporting with the Commission of
certain census-type information. However, unlike Form N-SAR, which requires semiannual reporting for all management investment companies, proposed Form N-CEN
would require annual reporting. 754 Proposed Form N-CEN would be a collection of
information under the PRA, and is designed to facilitate the Commission’s oversight of
752

Management investment companies are required to file a quarterly report on Form N-Q after
the close of the first and third quarters of each fiscal year.

753

For purposes of the PRA analysis, the burdens associated with amended rule 30a-1, as
proposed, are included in the collection of information estimates of Form N-CEN.

754

UITs are only required to file Form N-SAR on an annual basis. See rule 30a-1.

344

funds and its ability to monitor trends and risks. This new collection of information
would be mandatory for all funds, and responses would not be kept confidential.
The staff estimates that the Commission would receive an average of 3,146
reports per year, based on the number of existing Form N-SAR filers. 755 We estimate
that management investment companies would each spend as much as 13.35 hours
annually, preparing and filing reports on proposed Form N-CEN. 756 The Commission
further estimates that UITs, including separate account UITs, would each spend as much
as 9.11 hours annually, preparing and filing reports on proposed Form N-CEN, since a
UIT would be required to respond to fewer items. 757
As discussed below, we currently estimate that management investment
companies spend as much as 15.35 hours preparing and filing each report on Form
N-SAR. We have generally sought with proposed Form N-CEN, where appropriate, to
simplify and decrease the census-type reporting burdens placed on registrants by current
Form N-SAR. For example, proposed Form N-CEN would reduce the number of
attachments that may need to be filed with the reports and largely eliminate financial
statement-type information from the reports. Additionally, we believe that reports in
XML on proposed Form N-CEN will be less burdensome to produce than the reports on
Form N-SAR currently required to be filed using outdated technology. Accordingly, for
management investment companies we believe the estimated hour burden for filing

755

This estimate is based on 2,419 management companies and 727 UITs filing reports on Form
N-SAR as of December 31, 2014.

756

Our estimate includes the hourly burden associated with registering/maintaining LEIs for the
registrant/funds, which would be required to be included in reports on Form N-CEN.

757

See id.

345

reports on proposed Form N-CEN should be a reduced burden from the hour burden
associated with Form N-SAR. 758 As such, we estimate that the annual hour burden for
management companies will be 13.35 per report on proposed Form N-CEN, down from
15.35 hours per report for Form N-SAR.
UITs may, however, experience an increase in the hour burden associated with
census-type reporting if proposed Form N-CEN is adopted because UITs would be
required to respond to more items in the form than they are currently required to respond
to under Form N-SAR. For example, UITs would be required to provide certain
background information and attachments in their reports on proposed Form N-CEN,
which they are not currently required to provide in their reports on Form N-SAR. As a
result, we have increased the annual hour burden for UITs from 7.11 hours in the
currently approved collection for Form N-SAR to 9.11 hours for proposed Form N-CEN.
The Commission also believes that, in the first year reports on the form are filed,
funds may require additional time to prepare and file reports. We estimate that, for the
first year, funds would require 20 additional hours. 759 Accordingly, we estimate that
management investment companies would require 33.35 annual burden hours in the first

758

We note that reports on Form N-CEN would be filed annually, rather than semi-annually as
in the case of reports on Form N-SAR. Thus, while we estimate that the burden associated
with each report on Form N-CEN for management companies would be two hours less than
the burden associated with each report on Form N-SAR, we estimate that the annual Form NCEN burden for management companies would actually be 17.35 hours less than that
associated with Form N-SAR. This estimate is based on the following calculation: (15.35
Form N-SAR burden hours x 2 reports) – 13.35 Form N-CEN burden hours = 17.35 hours.

759

This additional time may be attributable to, among other things, reviewing and collecting new
or revised data pursuant to the Form N-CEN requirements or changing the software currently
used to generate reports on Form N-SAR in order to output similar data in a different format.

346

year 760 and 13.35 annual burden hours in each subsequent year for preparing and filing
reports on proposed Form N-CEN. Additionally, we estimate that UITs would require
29.11 annual burden hours in the first year 761 and 9.11 annual burden hours in each
subsequent year for preparing and filing reports on proposed Form N-CEN.
We estimate that the average annual hour burden per response for proposed Form
N-CEN for the first year would be 32.37 hours 762 and 12.37 hours in subsequent years. 763
Amortizing the burden over three years, we estimate that the average annual hour burden
per fund per year would be 19.04 764 and the total average annual hour burden would be
59,900. 765
With respect to the initial filing of a report on Form N-CEN, we estimate an
external cost of $220 per fund and, with respect to subsequent filings, we estimate an
annual external cost of $120 per fund. 766 We estimate the amortized annual external cost
per fund would be $153. 767 We currently estimate that no external cost burden is
associated with Form N-SAR. External costs include the cost of goods and services,
which with respect to reports on Form N-CEN, would include the costs of registering and

760

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 13.35 hours for filings + 20 additional
hours for the first filing = 33.35 hours.

761

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 9.11 hours for filings + 20 additional
hours for the first filing = 29.11 hours.

762

This estimate is based on the following calculation: ((2,419 management investment
companies x 33.35 hours) + (727 UITs x 29.11 hours)) / 3,146 total funds = 32.37 hours.

763

This estimate is based on the following calculation: ((2,419 management investment
companies x 13.35 hours) + (727 UITs x 9.11 hours)) / 3,146 = 12.37 hours.

764

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (32.37 + (12.37 x 2)) / 3 = 19.04.

765

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 3,146 x 19.04 = 59,900.

766

See supra note 46 (discussing the costs associated with registering and maintaining an LEI).

This estimate is based on the following calculation: $220 + (2 years x $120) / 3 = $153.

maintaining an LEI for the registrant/funds. 768 In sum, we estimate that all applicable
funds would incur, in the aggregate, external annual costs of $1,748,637. 769
2.

Rescission of Form N-SAR

Our proposed reforms would rescind Form N-SAR in order to eliminate
unnecessarily duplicative reporting requirements. The proposed rescission would affect
all management investment companies and UITs.
We currently estimate that the weighted average annual hour burden per response
for Form N-SAR is 14.25 hours, 770 with a total annual hour burden for all respondents of
approximately 82,223 hours. Accordingly, we estimate that, in the aggregate, our
proposed rescission would eliminate the 82,223 annual burden hours associated with
filing Form N-SAR. Additionally, we currently estimate that there are no external costs
associated with preparation of reports on Form N-SAR.

Amendments to Regulation S-X

1.

Rule 30e-1

Section 30(e) of the Investment Company Act requires every registered
investment company to transmit to its stockholders, at least semiannually, reports
containing such information and financial statements or their equivalent, as of a
reasonably current date, as the Commission may prescribe by rules and regulations. 771

768

See Items 2.d. and 25.c. of Form N-CEN (requiring LEI for the registrant and each
management company).

769

This estimate is based on the following calculation: $153 x 11,429 funds = $1,748,637; see
infra note 799 (explaining the calculation of 11,429 funds).

770

This weighted estimate accounts for management companies filing reports on Form N-SAR
twice a year and UITs filing reports on Form N-SAR once a year.

771

Section 30(e).

348

Rule 30e-1 generally requires management investment companies to transmit to their
shareholders, at least semi-annually, reports containing the information that is required to
be included in such reports by the fund’s registration statement form under the
Investment Company Act. 772 Pursuant to this rule and Forms N-1A and N-2,
management investment companies are required to include the financial statements
required by Regulation S-X in their shareholder reports. 773
Rule 30e-1 also permits, under certain conditions, delivery of a single shareholder
report to investors who share an address (“householding”). 774 Specifically, rule 30e-1
permits householding of annual and semi-annual reports by management companies to
satisfy the transmission requirements of rule 30e-1 if, in addition to the other conditions
set forth in the rule, the management company has obtained from each applicable investor
written or implied consent to the householding of shareholder reports at such address.
The rule requires management companies that wish to household shareholder reports with
implied consent to send a notice to each applicable investor stating, among other things,
that the investors in the household will receive one report in the future unless the
investors provide contrary instructions. In addition, at least once a year, management
companies relying on the householding provision must explain to investors who have
provided written or implied consent how they can revoke their consent.
Compliance with the disclosure requirements of rule 30e-1 is mandatory.
Responses to the disclosure requirements are not be kept confidential.

772

Rule 30e-1.

773

See Item 27 of Form N-1A and Item 24 of Form N-2.

774

See rule 30e-1(f).

349

Based on staff conversations with fund representatives, we currently estimate that
it takes approximately 84 hours per fund to comply with the collection of information
associated with rule 30e-1, including the householding requirements. This time is spent,
for example, preparing, reviewing, and certifying the reports. The current total estimated
annual hour burden of responding to rule 30e-1 is approximately 903,000 hours. 775
As discussed above, we are proposing certain amendments to Articles 6 and 12 of
Regulation S-X. As outlined in Part II.C. above, the amendments would: (1) require
new, standardized disclosures regarding fund holdings in open futures contracts, open
forward foreign currency contracts, and open swap contracts, and additional disclosures
regarding fund holdings of written and purchased options; (2) update the disclosures for
other investments, as well as reorganize the order in which some investments are
presented; (3) amend the rules regarding the general form and content of fund financial
statements; and (iv) require a new disclosure in the notes to the financial statements
relating to a fund’s securities lending activities. 776
We estimate that that there are 11,230 management companies that would have to
comply with these amendments. 777 In addition, we estimate that these amendments
would likely increase the time spent preparing, reviewing and certifying reports, if
adopted. The extent to which a fund’s burden would increase as a result of the proposed
775

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 84 hours per fund x 10,750 funds (the
estimated number of portfolios the last time the rule’s information collections were submitted
for PRA renewal in 2012) = 903,000 hours.

776

Our amendments would also require prominent placement of disclosures regarding
investments in derivatives in a fund’s financial statements, rather than allowing such
schedules to be placed in the notes to the financial statements. See supra Part II.C.

777

This estimate includes 9,259 mutual funds (including money market funds), 1,403 ETFs
(1,411 ETFs – 8 UIT ETFs) and 568 closed-end funds and is based on internal SEC data as
well as ICI statistics as of December 31, 2014 available at http://www.ici.org/research/stats.

350

amendments would depend on the extent to which the fund invests in the instruments
covered by many of the amendments. We estimate that, on an annual basis, funds
generally will incur an additional 9 burden hours in the first year 778 and an additional 3
burden hours for filings in subsequent years in order to comply with the proposed
amendments. 779 Amortized over three years, the average annual hour burden associated
with the amendments for Regulation S-X would be 5 hours per fund. 780 Accordingly, the
estimated total annual average hour burden associated with the amendments would be
56,150. 781
We estimate that the annual external cost burden of compliance with the
information collection requirements of rule 30e-1, which is currently $31,061 per fund,

778

With respect to the amendments to Article 6 of Regulation S-X, we estimate that each fund
would spend an average of five hours to initially comply with the amendments. For example,
amendments to Article 6-07.1 would likely require funds to identify non-cash income and put
a process in place to capture it in the financial statements. In addition, some funds would also
likely move their schedules from financial statement notes to the financial statements
themselves. With respect to the amendments requiring disclosure of the components of a
custom basket/index, some funds voluntarily provide this disclosure now, but others do not;
we recognize that funds would be affected by this requirement differently depending on their
investments.
With respect to the amendments to article 12 of Regulation S-X, we estimate each fund
would spend an average of four hours to initially comply with the amendments. For example,
while accounting guidance already requires funds to identify the level of each security (such
as Level 3 securities), we estimate there will be an increased burden in adding another note to
the financial statements. This increased burden would vary depending on the information
already reported by funds in their financial statements. Likewise, while many funds
voluntarily identify illiquid securities in their schedule of investments, the funds that do not
make this disclosure would bear an initial burden to comply with these amendments.

779

With respect to the amendments to Article 6 of Regulation S-X, we estimate each fund would
require two hours to comply with the requirements in each subsequent year. We likewise
estimate that each fund would require one hour to comply with the requirements of the
proposed amendments to Article 12 in each subsequent year.

780

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (9 hours + (3 hours x 2)) / 3 = 5.

781

The estimate is based on the following calculation: 5 hours x 11,230 management investment
companies = 56,150.

351

will not change as a result of the proposed amendments to Regulation S-X. 782 We further
estimate that the total annual external cost burden for rule 30e-1 would be
$348,815,030. 783 External costs include, for example, the costs for funds to prepare,
print, and mail the reports.
2.

Rule 30e-2

Rule 30e-2 requires registered UITs that invest substantially all of their assets in
shares of a management investment company to send their unitholders annual and
semiannual reports containing financial information on the underlying company. 784
Specifically, rule 30e-2 requires that the report contain all the applicable information and
financial statements or their equivalent, required by rule 30e-1 under the Investment
Company Act to be included in reports of the underlying fund for the same fiscal
period. 785 Rule 30e-2 also permits UITs to rely on the householding provision in rule
30e-1 to transmit a single shareholder report to investors who share an address. 786
Compliance with the disclosure requirements of rule 30e-2 is mandatory.
Responses to the disclosure requirements are not kept confidential.

782

Because the proposed amendments would largely reorganize information currently reported
by funds in their financial statements, either voluntarily or because it is required, we do not
believe the external costs, such as printing and mailing costs, will increase as a result of the
amendments.

783

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 11,230 funds x $31,061 = $348,815,030.
The current total annual cost burden of rule 30e-1 is $333,905,750, which reflects the higher
estimated number of funds subject to rule 30e-1 at the time of the last renewal for the rule.
See supra note 775.

784

Rule 30e-2.

785

As discussed above, rule 30e-1 (together with Forms N-1A and N-2) essentially requires
management investment companies to transmit to their shareholders, at least semi-annually,
reports containing the financial statements required by Regulation S-X.

786

See rule 30e-2(b); see also supra note 774 and accompanying text.

352

The Commission currently estimates that the annual burden associated with rule
30e-2, including the householding requirements, is 121 hours per respondent. The
Commission currently estimates that the total hour burden is approximately 91,960
hours. 787
As discussed above, we are proposing certain amendments to Articles 6 and 12 of
Regulation S-X that, if adopted, would likely increase the time spent preparing,
reviewing and certifying reports. 788 The extent to which a UIT’s burden increases as a
result of the proposed amendments would depend on the extent to which an underlying
fund invests in the instruments covered by many of the amendments. We estimate that
there are 727 UITs that may be subject to the proposed amendments. 789 We also estimate
that, on an annual basis, UITs generally will incur an additional 9 burden hours in the
first year 790 and an additional 3 burden hours for filings in subsequent years in order to
comply with the proposed amendments. 791 Amortized over three years, we estimate that
the average annual hour burden associated with the proposed amendments would be 5
787

760 UITs (the estimated number of UITs the last time the rule’s information collections were
submitted for PRA renewal in 2012) x 121 hours per UIT = 91,960.

788

As discussed above, the amendments would: (1) require new, standardized disclosures
regarding fund holdings in open futures contracts, open forward foreign currency contracts,
and open swap contracts, and additional disclosures regarding fund holdings of written and
purchased options; (2) update the disclosures for other investments, as well as reorganize the
order in which some investments are presented; (3) amend the rules regarding the general
form and content of fund financial statements; and (iv) require a new disclosure in the notes
to the financial statements relating to a fund’s securities lending activities. In addition, our
amendments would also require prominent placement of disclosures regarding investments in
derivatives in a fund’s financial statements, rather than allowing such schedules to be placed
in the notes to the financial statements.

789

This estimate is based on the number of UITs that filed Form N-SAR with the Commission as
of December 31, 2014.

790

See supra note 778.

791

See supra note 779.

353

hours per fund. 792 Accordingly, we estimate that the total average annual hour burden
associated with the proposed amendments to Regulation S-X would be 3,635 hours. 793
In addition, we estimate that the annual external cost burden of compliance with
the information collection requirements of rule 30e-2, which are currently $20,000 per
respondent, will not change as a result of the proposed amendments to Regulation S-X. 794
We further estimate that the total annual external cost burden for rule 30e-2 would be
$14,540,000. 795 External costs include, for example, the costs for the funds to prepare,
print, and mail the reports.
D.

Option for Website Transmission of Shareholder Reports

We are also proposing new rule 30e-3, which would permit, but not require, a
fund to transmit its reports to shareholders by posting them on its website, as long as the
fund meets certain other conditions of the rule regarding (a) availability of the report and
other materials, (b) shareholder consent, (c) notice to shareholders, and (d) delivery of
materials upon request of the shareholder. 796 Reliance on the rule would be voluntary;
however, compliance with the rule’s conditions is mandatory for funds relying on the
rule. Responses to the information collections would not be kept confidential.

792

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (9 hours + (3 hours x 2)) / 3 = 5.

793

The estimate is based on the following calculation: 5 hours x 727 UITs = 3,635.

794

See supra note 782.

795

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 727 UITs x $20,000 = $14,540,000. The
current total annual cost burden of rule 30e-2 is $15,200,000, which reflects the higher
estimated number of UITs at the time of the last renewal for the rule. See supra note 787.

796

See proposed rule 30e-3.

354

1.

Availability of Report and Other Materials and Delivery Upon
Request

Proposed rule 30e-3 would provide that a fund’s annual or semiannual report to
shareholders would be considered transmitted to a shareholder of record if certain
conditions set forth in the rule are satisfied. Among these conditions are the requirements
that (i) the fund’s shareholder report, any previous shareholder report transmitted to
shareholders of record within the last 244 days, and in the case of a fund that is not an
SBIC, the fund’s complete portfolio holdings as of the close of its most recent first and
third fiscal quarters, be publicly accessible, free of charge, at a specified website
address, 797 and (ii) the fund (or a financial intermediary through which shares of the fund
may be purchased or sold) must send a paper copy of any of the materials discussed in (i)
above to a shareholder upon request. 798
We estimate that 11,957 funds could rely on proposed new rule 30e-3. 799 Of
these funds, we estimate that 90% of all funds (or 10,761 funds) would rely on proposed
rule 30e-3. 800 Of this 10,761, we estimate 9,634 are funds relying on the summary

797

Proposed rule 30e-3(b)(1)(i)-(iii).

798

Proposed rule 30e-3(e).

799

This estimate includes 9,259 mutual funds (including money market funds), 1,403 ETFs
(1,411 ETFs – 8 UIT ETFs), 568 closed-end funds, and 727 UITs (including UIT ETFs)
based on ICI statistics, Form N-SAR filings, and internal SEC data as of December 31, 2014.
See ICI statistics available at http://www.ici.org/research/stats.

800

Open-end funds relying on the summary prospectus rule, rule 498 under the Securities Act,
are required to post their annual and semi-annual reports online. See rule 498(e)(1). In 2014,
9,634 funds filed a summary prospectus, which amounts to 90% of all open-end funds (9,634
/ (9,259 mutual funds + 1,403 ETFs (not including UITs))). Because these funds are already
posting their shareholder reports online, we estimate that they will rely on proposed rule 30e3 to transmit their reports. Based on the percentage of funds that rely on the summary
prospectus rule, which, like proposed rule 30e-3, requires posting of documents online while
also reducing printing and mailing costs for funds, we estimate that 90% of closed-end funds
and UITs (or 1,166 funds ((568 closed-end funds + 727 UITs) x 90%) will rely on proposed

355

prospectus rule (rule 498 under the Securities Act) and, thus, currently posting annual and
semiannual shareholder reports on their websites. Accordingly, with respect to these
funds, we estimate that annual compliance with the posting requirements of proposed rule
30e-3 will require a half hour burden per fund. 801
Of the remaining funds estimated to rely on proposed rule 30e-3, we further
estimate that approximately 90% of those funds 802 (or 1,014 funds) already have a
website. 803 With respect to these funds, we estimate that the posting requirements of
proposed rule 30e-3 will require a one and half hour burden per fund to post the required
documents online, both in the first year and annually thereafter. For the remaining 10%
of funds (or 113 funds) that we estimate will rely on the proposed rule but that do not
have a website, 804 we estimate initial compliance with the posting requirements will
require approximately 24 hours per fund of internal fund staff time to develop a webpage

rule 30e-3. Accordingly, we estimate that 90% of all funds ((9,634 open-end funds + 1,166
other funds) / 11,957 funds) would also rely on proposed rule 30e-3.
801

Because each of these funds is already required to have a website and to post its annual and
semiannual shareholder reports on this website, we estimate that proposed rule 30e-3 will
only result in each of these funds incurring a half hour burden per year to post their first and
third quarter portfolio holdings on their websites, including in the first year of compliance
with the rule.

802

See Money Market Fund Reform 2010 Release, supra note 13, at 10092 (estimating that 20%
of money market funds would have to develop a website in connection with new website
posting requirements). Because five years have passed since we estimated 80% of money
market funds had websites, and given the increased use of the Internet, we believe it is
appropriate to estimate that 90% of funds currently have websites.

803

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (10,761 funds – 9,634 open-end funds
relying on the summary prospectus rule) x 90% = 1,014 funds.

804

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (10,761 funds – 9,634 open-end funds
relying on the summary prospectus rule) x 10% = 113 funds.

356

and post the required documents on the webpage. 805 In addition, we estimate that each of
these funds would spend approximately four hours of professional time to maintain and
update a webpage with the required information on a quarterly basis. 806
Accordingly, we estimate that the posting requirements will result in an average
annual hour burden of 0.84 hours per fund in the first year of compliance 807 and 0.76
hours per fund for each of the next two years. 808 Amortized over three years, the average
annual hour burden would be 0.79 hours per fund. 809 In sum, we estimate that the
posting requirements of proposed rule 30e-3 would impose an average total annual hour
burden of 8,447 hours on applicable funds. 810
In addition, with respect to those funds that would rely on proposed rule 30e-3 but
that do not currently have a website, we estimate that the posting requirements of the
805

See Money Market Fund Reform 2010 Release, supra note 13, at 10092 (estimating 24 hours
of internal staff time to develop a webpage). Funds that are part of a larger fund complex
may realize certain economies of scale in connection with creating a website. For purposes
of our analysis, we do not account for such economies of scale.

806

See id. (estimating 4 hours of professional time to maintain and update a webpage with the
required money market fund information on a monthly basis). Funds that are part of a larger
fund complex may realize certain economies of scale in connection with maintaining and
updating a website. For purposes of our analysis, we do not account for such economies of
scale.

807

This estimate is based on the following calculations: 9,634 open-end funds relying on the
summary prospectus rule x .5 hours = 4,817 hours; 1,014 funds with a website but not relying
on the summary prospectus rule x 1.5 hours = 1,521 hours; 113 funds without a website x 24
hours in the first year = 2,712 hours; 4,817 hours + 1,521 hours + 2,712 hours = 9,050; 9,050
/ 10,761 = 0.84 hours.

808

This estimate is based on the following calculations: 9,634 open-end funds relying on the
summary prospectus rule x .5 hours = 4,817 hours; 1,014 funds with a website but not relying
on the summary prospectus rule x 1.5 hours = 1,521 hours; 113 funds without a website x (4
hours x 4 quarters) = 1,808 hours; 4,817 + 1,521 + 1,808 = 8,146; 8,146 / 10,761= 0.76 hours.

809

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (0.84 + (0.76 x 2)) / 3 = 0.79 hours.

810

This estimate is based on the following calculations: 9,050 hours for the first year + (8,146
hours x the 2 following years) = 25,342; 25,342 / 3 = 8,447.

357

proposed rule will result in an external cost burden of $2000 per fund in the first year to
develop a website, 811 but no cost burden in subsequent years. 812 We further estimate that
the amortized annual external cost burden associated with developing a website would be
$667. 813 In the aggregate, we estimate that the annual total external cost burden with
respect to these funds would be $75,371. 814 With respect to those funds that currently
have websites, we estimate that the posting requirements of the proposed rule will not
result in any external costs. 815 The external cost burden is the cost of goods and services
purchased in connection with complying with the rule, which, with respect to the posting
requirements, would include costs associated with development of a website.
Furthermore, we also estimate that funds may incur external costs in connection
with the requirement to provide a complete shareholder report upon request of a
shareholder. We estimate that the annual costs associated with printing and mailing these

811

See, e.g., How Much Should a Web Design Cost, Budgeting for a Professional Design for a
Small Business Website, available at
http://webdesign.about.com/od/beforeyoustartawebsite/a/how-much-should-a-web-designcost.htm (suggesting that a fairly basic website would cost $1250-$1500); What Does a
Website Cost? Website Development Costs, available at http://www.atilus.com/what-does-awebsite-cost-web-site-development-costs/ (suggesting a basis website can be created for
$2000-$5000). We believe that a website developed for purposes of proposed rule 30e-3
could be fairly basic considering the website would only need to accommodate posting of the
required documents.

812

We believe the collection of information burden in subsequent years will be handled
internally and have, therefore, accounted for this burden in our estimate of the hourly burden
for subsequent years. See supra note 806.

813

This estimate is based on the following calculation: $2000 / 3 = $667.

814

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 113 funds x $667 = $75,371.

815

Because these funds maintain their websites for reasons other than compliance with proposed
rule 30e-3, we do not attribute any costs related to such maintenance to proposed rule 30e-3.

358

reports would be $500 per fund. 816 Accordingly, we estimate that the aggregate annual
external costs associated with printing and mailing shareholder reports upon request
would be $5,380,500. 817 Together with the external costs for those funds that would rely
on proposed rule 30e-3 but that do not currently have a website, we estimate that the
posting and shareholder request requirements of the proposed rule will result in an annual
external cost burden of $5,455,871. 818
2.

Shareholder Consent and Notice

Proposed rule 30e-3 would permit electronic transmission of a shareholder report
to a particular shareholder only if the shareholder has either previously consented to this
method of transmission or has been determined to have provided implied consent under
certain conditions specified in the rule. 819 One of the conditions for implied consent
requires that the fund transmit to the shareholder an Initial Statement, at least 60 days

816

As noted above, we estimate the external costs associated with rules 30e-1 and 30e-2 (the
rules relating to shareholder reports) to be $31,061 and $20,000, respectively. These costs
account for preparation and transmission of complete shareholder reports twice a year in
paper to shareholders. We estimate that one-third of these external costs are attributed to
printing and mailing shareholder reports. Additionally, we estimate that 5% of shareholders
may request paper copies of shareholder reports transmitted via website pursuant to proposed
rule 30e-3. In this regard, we note that shareholders preferring paper copies of shareholder
reports will also have the ability to return the postage-paid, pre-addressed reply card that all
shareholders will receive with their Initial Statement to indicate that they want to opt-out of
website transmission. See Part II.D.3.b. above (discussing the Initial Statement).
Accordingly, we believe that only a small percentage of shareholders whose shareholder
reports are transmitted via website will request paper copies. In order to be conservative in
our estimates, we have multiplied 5% by $10,000, which is approximately one-third of the
external costs associated with management companies’ shareholder reports ($31,061 / 3 =
$10,354), which are higher than the external costs associated with UITs’ shareholder reports.
Thus, we estimate that the external costs associated with providing complete shareholder
reports upon request would be $500 (5% x $10,000).

817

This estimate is based on the following calculation: $500 x 10,761 funds = $5,380,500.

818

This estimate is based on the following calculation: $5,380,500 + $75,371 = $5,455,871.

819

See proposed rule 30e-3(c).

before it begins to rely on the rule, notifying the shareholder of the fund’s intent to make
future shareholder reports available on the fund’s website until the shareholder revokes
consent. Additionally, proposed rule 30e-3 would require funds relying on the rule with
respect to a shareholder who has consented to electronic transmission to send a Notice
containing certain information to the shareholder within 60 days of the close of the fiscal
period to which the report relates. 820 The proposed rule would also require funds to file a
form of the Notice with the Commission not later than 10 days after the Notice is sent to
shareholders. 821
As discussed in Part V.D.1. above, we estimate that 90% of all eligible funds (or
10,761 funds) will choose to rely on proposed rule 30e-3. 822 For those funds relying on
the rule, we estimate that it will take each fund one and a half hours to prepare the Initial
Statement in the first year of compliance with the rule. 823 We further estimate that each
fund will incur a half hour burden in subsequent years to the extent the fund has
shareholders that have not previously consented to website transmission of the fund’s
shareholder reports. 824 We also estimate that each fund will incur two hours to prepare

See Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, Exchange Act Release No. 55146 (Jan. 22,
2007) [72 FR 4148, 4161 (Jan. 29, 2007)] (“Proxy Notice Release”) (estimating the annual
burden for an issuer or other soliciting person to prepare a notice of Internet availability of
proxy materials (“proxy notice”) to be approximately one and half hours). We estimate that
the length and breadth of the Initial Statement would be similar to that of a proxy notice.

824

Based our initial hour burden estimate for the Initial Statement, and given that a fund will
only have to provide the Initial Statement in subsequent years to those shareholders who have
not previously consented, we believe the subsequent hour burden will be minimal.
Accordingly, we have estimated a half hour burden per fund in subsequent years.

and file the first Notice in the first year 825 and an hour for each subsequent notice. 826
Additionally, with respect to both the Initial Statement and the Notice, we estimate that
75% of the annual hour burden would be incurred by the fund and that 25% of the burden
would be incurred by outside counsel retained by the fund. 827
Accordingly, we estimate that the Initial Statement will result in an average
hourly burden per fund of 1.3 hours in the first year 828 and 0.38 hours in each subsequent
year. 829 Amortized over three years, the average annual hour burden associated with the
Initial Statement would be 0.69 hours per fund. 830 In addition, we estimate that the
Notice will result in an average annual hour burden of 2.3 hours per fund in the first
year 831 and 1.5 hours per fund in each subsequent year. 832 Amortized over three years,
825

See supra note 823. We estimate that the length and breadth of the Notice would be similar
to that of a proxy notice. However, under proposed rule 30e-3, a Notice would also have to
be separately filed with the Commission. Accordingly, we have increased the initial
estimated hour burden for the Notice to two hours versus the hour and half estimated hour
burden for the proxy notice. In addition, a fund relying on the proposed rule would have to
prepare and send a notice to relevant shareholders, and file the notice with the Commission,
twice a year – once for the annual shareholder report and once for the semiannual shareholder
report. In the first year of compliance with the rule, we estimate that the fund would need
two hours to prepare and file the first notice and one hour to prepare and file the second
notice, for a total of three hours in the first year of compliance.

826

Based our initial hour burden estimate for the Notice, and given that a fund will likely use its
original Notice as a template for subsequent notices but will also have to file each Notice
with the Commission, we believe one hour burden per fund per subsequent filing is an
appropriate estimate. As noted above, a fund would have to prepare and file a Notice twice a
year. As such, we estimate the hour burden for each fund in subsequent years would be two
hours.

827

See Proxy Notice Release, supra note 823 (estimating 75% of the proxy notice burden would
be prepared by the issuer and that 25% of the burden would be prepared by outside counsel
retained by the issuer).

828

The estimate is based on the following calculation: 1.5 hours x 75% = 1.3 hours.

829

The estimate is based on the following calculation: 0.5 hours x 75% = 0.38 hours.

830

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (1.3 hours + (2 years x 0.38 hours))/ 3
years = 0.69 hours.

831

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (2 hours + 1 hour) x 75% = 2.3 hours.

361

the average annual hour burden associated with the Notice would be 1.8 hours per
fund. 833 In sum, we estimate that the shareholder consent and Notice requirements of
proposed rule 30e-3 would impose an average total annual hour burden of 8,932 hours on
applicable funds. 834
In addition, we estimate that funds will incur external costs if they rely on
proposed rule 30e-3. The external cost burden is the cost of goods and services
purchased in connection with complying with the rule, which, with respect to the Initial
Statement and Notice, we estimate would include the costs associated with outside
counsel and printing and mailing costs.
We estimate outside counsel retained by the fund will incur 25% of the hourly
burden associated with each of the Initial Statement and Notice at a rate of $380 per
hour. 835 Accordingly, we estimate that outside counsel costs associated with the Initial
Statement will result in an average cost burden per fund of $144 in the first year, 836 $49
in subsequent years, 837 and amortized over three years, $81. 838 Additionally, we estimate

832

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (1 hour + 1 hour) x 75% = 1.5 hours.

833

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (2.3 hours + (2 years x 1.5 hours)) / 3
years = 1.8 hours.

834

This estimate is based on the following calculations: (0.69 hours for the Initial Statement x
10,761 funds) + (1.8 hours for the Notice x 10,761 funds) = 26,795; 26,795 hours / 3 years =
8,932.

835

This estimate is based on the rate for attorneys in SIFMA’s Management and Professional
Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013, modified by Commission staff to account for an
1800-hour work year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee
benefits, and overhead.

836

The estimate is based on the following calculation: 1.5 hours associated with x 25% = 0.38
hours; 0.38 hours x $380 = $144.

837

The estimate is based on the following calculation: 0.5 hours x 25% = 0.13 hours; 0.13 hours
x $380 = $49.

362

that outside counsel costs associated with the Notice will result in an average cost burden
per fund of $285 in the first year, 839 $190 in subsequent years, 840 and amortized over
three years, $222. 841 In sum, we estimate that the outside counsel costs related to the
shareholder consent and Notice requirements of proposed rule 30e-3 would impose an
annual average total cost burden of $3,260,583 on applicable funds. 842
We also estimate that, in the first year, each fund will incur approximately $1000
in printing and mailing costs related to each of the first Initial Statement and Notice. 843
In subsequent years, we estimate each fund will incur $333 in printing and mailing costs

838

The estimate is based on the following calculation: ($144 + (2 years x $49)) / 3 = $81.

839

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (2 hours + 1 hour) x 25% = 0.75 hours;
0.75 hours x $380 = $285.

840

The estimate is based on the following calculation: (1 hour + 1 hour) x 25% = 0.5 hours; 0.5
hours x $380 = $190.

841

The estimate is based on the following calculation: ($285 + (2 years x $190)) / 3 = $222.

842

This estimate is based on the following calculations: ($81 for the Initial Statement x 10,761
funds) + ($222 for the Notice x 10,761) = $3,260,583.

843

As noted above, we estimate the external costs associated with rules 30e-1 and 30e-2 (the
rules relating to shareholder reports) to be $31,061 and $20,000, respectively. These costs
account for preparation and transmission of complete shareholder reports twice a year in
paper to shareholders. We estimate that one-third of these external costs are attributed to
printing and mailing shareholder reports. We estimate that the Initial Statement and Notice
would require significantly less be spent on printing and mailing costs given the significantly
smaller size of the documents. Accordingly, we estimate that each of the Initial Statement
and Notice would require 10% of the printing and mailing costs associated with complete
shareholder reports. We also estimate that there would be no other external costs attributable
to the Initial Statement or Notice. In order to be conservative in our estimates, we have
multiplied 10% by $10,000, which is approximately one-third of the external costs associated
with management companies’ shareholder reports ($31,061 / 3 = $10,354), which are higher
than the external costs associated with UITs’ shareholder reports. Thus, we estimate that the
initial printing and mailing costs associated with each of the Initial Statement and Notice
would be $1000 (10% x $10,000). Additionally, however, with respect to the Notice, we note
that a fund would send two Notices a year - one for each shareholder report. Accordingly, we
estimate that the printing and mailing costs associated with the Notice would be $2000 ($100
x 2 Notices) in the first year.

363

related to the Initial Statement 844 and $1000 with respect to each Notice. 845 Amortized
over three years, we estimate that the Initial Statement will result in $555 annual cost
burden per fund 846 and the Notice will result in a $2000 annual cost burden per fund. 847
In sum, we estimate that the printing and mailing costs related to the shareholder consent
and Notice requirements of proposed rule 30e-3 would impose an average annual total
cost burden of $27,494,355 on applicable funds. 848 Accordingly, together with the costs
associated with outside counsel, we estimate that the shareholder consent and Notice
requirements of the proposed rule would impose an average annual total cost burden of
$30,754,938. 849
In total, proposed rule 30e-3 would impose an average total annual hour burden of
17,379 hours on applicable funds 850 and a total annual external cost burden of
$36,210,809 on applicable funds. 851

844

Given that funds will only have to send the Initial Statement to shareholders who have not yet
consented (e.g., new shareholders), we estimate that the external cost burden in subsequent
years would only be one-third the cost of the first Initial Statement ($1000 / 3 = $333).

845

We do not believe the external costs associated with printing and mailing the Notice will be
different in subsequent years because proposed rule 30e-3 specifies the information to be
included in the Notice, which must be sent each time a shareholder report is transmitted. As
noted above, funds would send two Notices a year - one for each shareholder report.
Accordingly, we estimate that the printing and mailing costs associated with the Notice
would be $2000 ($1000 x 2 Notices) in each subsequent year.

846

This estimate is based on the following calculation: ($1000 + (2 years x $333)) / 3 = $555.

847

This estimate is based on the following calculation: ($2000 per year x 3 years) / 3 = $2000.

848

This estimate is based on the following calculations: ($555 for the Initial Statement x 10,761
funds) + ($2000 for the Notice x 10,761) = $27,494,355.

849

This estimate is based on the following calculations: $3,260,583+ $27,494,355 =
$30,754,938.

850

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 8,447 hours for the posting requirements
+ 8,932 hours for the written shareholder consent statement and Notice requirements =
17,379 hours.

Impact on Information Collections for Rules 30e-1 and 30e-2

As discussed in Sections V.C.1. and 2. above, rule 30e-1 under the Investment
Company Act requires management companies to transmit semi-annual reports to their
shareholders and rule 30e-2 under the Investment Company Act requires certain UITs to
similarly transmit semi-annual reports to their unitholders. 852 Also as discussed above,
we currently estimate, with respect to rule 30e-1, that each fund incurs an annual hourly
burden of 84 hours 853 and an annual external cost burden of $31,061 per fund. 854
Additionally, with respect to rule 30e-2, we currently estimate that each UIT respondent
incurs an annual hourly burden of 121 hours per fund 855 and an annual external cost
burden of $20,000 per fund. 856
As discussed above, we estimate that 90% of all funds will rely on proposed rule
30e-3. In addition, we estimate that a fund’s hourly burden associated with rule 30e-1 or
rule 30e-2 will not change as result of proposed rule 30e-3. However, we estimate that,
for those funds that rely on proposed rule 30e-3, the fund’s external cost burden would
decrease. In this regard, we estimate that for 90% of funds relying on rule 30e-3, their

851

This estimate is based on the following calculation: $5,455,871 + $30,754,938 =
$36,210,809.

852

See supra notes 784 and 785 and accompanying text.

853

As discussed in Part V.C.1., the current estimated total annual hourly burden for all funds is
903,000 hours. See supra note 775.

854

As discussed in Part V.C.1., the current total estimated annual cost burden for all funds is
$333,905,750. See supra note 783.

855

As discussed in Part V.C.2., the current estimated total annual hourly burden for all UIT
respondents is 91,960 hours. See supra note 787.

856

As discussed in Part V.C.2., the current total estimated annual cost burden for all UIT
respondents is $15,200,000. See supra note 795.

365

annual cost burden related to rule 30e-1 would decrease from $31,061 to $20,707. 857
Additionally, we estimate that for the 90% of funds relying on rule 30e-3, their annual
cost burden related to rule 30e-2 would decrease from $20,000 to $13,333. 858
Accordingly, if proposed rule 30e-3 is adopted, we estimate that for 90% of management
companies the total annual external cost burden for rule 30e-1 would be $209,285,649 859
and the total annual external cost burden for all management companies under rule 30e-1
would be $244,167,152. 860 Additionally, if proposed rule 30e-3 is adopted, we estimate
that for 90% of UITs the total annual external cost burden for rule 30e-2 would be
$8,719,782 861 and the total annual external cost burden for all UITs under rule 30e-2
would be $10,179,782. 862
E.

Amendments to Certification Requirements of Form N-CSR

In connection with the rescission of Form N-Q, we are proposing to amend Form
N-CSR, the reporting form used by management companies to file certified shareholder
857

As discussed above, we estimate that one-third of the external costs currently attributed to
rule 30e-1 relate to printing and mailing costs, which would not be applicable to management
companies relying on proposed rule 30e-3. Accordingly, our estimate is based on the
following calculation: $31,061 / 3 = $10,354; $31,061 - $10,354 = $20,707.

858

As discussed above, we estimate that one-third of the external costs currently attributed to
rule 30e-2 relate to printing and mailing costs, which would not be applicable to UITs relying
on proposed rule 30e-3. Accordingly, our estimate is based on the following calculation:
$20,000 / 3 = $6,667; $20,000 - $6,667 = $13,333.

859

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 11,230 funds x 90% = 10,107; 10,107
funds x $20,707 = $209,285,649. See also note 777 (estimating the number of management
companies subject to rule 30e-1 as 11,230).

860

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 11,230 funds – 10,107 funds = 1,123
funds; 1,123 funds x $31,061 = $34,881,503; $209,285,649 + $34,881,503 = $244,167,152.

861

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 727 UITs x 90% = 654; 654 UITs x
$13,333 = $8,719,782; see also note 789 (estimating the number of UITs subject to rule 30e-2
as 727).

862

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 727 UITs – 654 UITs = 73 UITs; 73
UITs x $20,000 = $1,460,000; $8,719,782 + $1,460,000 = $10,179,782.

366

reports under the Investment Company Act and the Exchange Act. Form N-Q currently
requires principal executive and financial officers of the fund to make certifications for
the first and third fiscal quarters relating to (1) the accuracy of information reported to the
Commission, and (2) disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting. 863 Rescission of Form N-Q would eliminate these certifications.
Form N-CSR requires similar certification with respect to the fund’s second and
fourth fiscal quarters. As a result of the proposed rescission of Form N-Q, we are
proposing to amend the form of certification in Form N-CSR to require each certifying
officer to state that he or she has disclosed in the report any change in the registrant’s
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal halfyear, rather than the registrant’s most recent fiscal quarter as currently required by the
form. 864 Lengthening the look-back of this certification to six months, so that the
certifications on Form N-CSR for the semi-annual and annual reports would cover the
first and second fiscal quarters and third and fourth fiscal quarters, respectively, would
fill the gap in certification coverage that would otherwise occur once Form N-Q is
rescinded.
Compliance with the amended certification requirements would be mandatory and
responses would not be kept confidential.

863

See supra note 178 and accompanying text.

864

Proposed Item 11(b) of Form N–CSR; proposed paragraph 5(b) of certification exhibit of
Item 11(a)(2) of Form N–CSR.

367

We currently estimate that the annual burden associated with Form N-CSR is
14.42 hours per fund 865 and that the current total annual time burden for Form N-CSR is
177,799 hours. 866 We note that the amount and content of the information contained in
the reports filed on Form N-CSR would not change as the result of the proposed
amendments and the funds likely already have policies and procedures in place to assist
officers in their certifications of this information. Accordingly, we estimate that the
proposed amendments to Form N-CSR would not change the annual hour burden
associated with Form N-CSR and, thus, we continue to estimate the annual hour burden
associated with Form N-CSR to be 14.42 hours per fund. With respect to the total annual
hour burden, however, we estimate 161,937 hours. 867 This decrease in the current total
annual hour burden is a result of the decrease in the number of funds estimated to file
Form N-CSR.
In addition, we currently estimate that the annual cost of outside services
associated with Form N-CSR is approximately $129 per fund. 868 External costs include
the cost of goods and services purchased to prepare and update filings on Form N-CSR.
We do not believe that these costs will change as a result of the proposed amendments to

865

This estimate accounts for two filings per year. In addition, we note that our current estimate
does not separately account for the certifications on Form N-CSR.

866

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 14.42 hours x 12,330 funds (the
estimated number of funds the last time the rule’s information collections were submitted for
PRA renewal in 2013)).

867

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 11,230 funds x 14.42 hours = 161,937.
See supra note 777 (calculating the estimate for 11,230 funds).

868

The external costs associated with Form N-CSR do not include the external costs associated
with the shareholder report. The external costs associated with the shareholder report are
accounted for under the collections of information related to rules 30e-1 and 30e-2 under the
Investment Company Act.

368

Form N-CSR and, thus, continue to estimate an external cost burden of $129 per fund to
file Form N-CSR. We further estimate that the total annual external cost burden for Form
N-CSR would be $2,897,340. 869
F.

Amendments to Registration Statement Forms

We are also proposing to amend Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4, and N-6 to exempt
funds from those forms’ respective books and records disclosures if the information is
provided in a fund’s most recent report on Form N-CEN. 870 The books and records
disclosures required by these registration statement forms are not provided in a structured
format. We believe that having this information in a structured format would increase
our efficiency in preparing for exams as well as our ability to identify current industry
trends and practices and, therefore, are proposing it be reported on proposed Form
N-CEN.
Currently, we estimate the following total hour burden for each of the relevant
forms: (i) Form N-1A – 1,579,974 hours; (ii) Form N-2 – 86,533 hours; (iii) Form N-3 –
2,173 hours; (iv) Form N-4 – 256,835 hours; and (v) Form N-6 – 34,349 hours. We
estimate the total hour burden, as discussed above, for each respective form will not
change as result of the proposed amendments. Additionally, we do not believe the total
cost burden for any of the relevant forms would change as a result of the proposed

869

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 11,230 funds x $129 = $1,448,670;
$1,448,670 x 2 times per year = $2,897,340. The current total annual cost burden of Form NCSR is $3,189,771, which reflects the higher estimated number of filers for Form N-CSR at
the time of the last renewal for the form. See supra n.866.

870

See supra notes 397-399 and accompanying text. As discussed in Part II.F. above, we are
also proposing technical and conforming amendments to certain registration forms. We do
not believe these changes will result in any change to the burden and cost estimates currently
applicable to those forms.

369

amendments and, therefore, we continue to estimate the following total cost burden for
each of the respective forms: (i) Form N-1A – $124,820,197; (ii) Form N-2 –
$5,488,048; (iii) Form N-3 – $139,300; (iv) Form N-4 – $26,609,241; and (v) Form N-6
– $3,820,447.

Request for Comments

We request comment on whether our estimates for burden hours and any external
costs as described above are reasonable. Pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(B), the
Commission solicits comments in order to: (i) evaluate whether the proposed collections
of information are necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the
Commission, including whether the information will have practical utility; (ii) evaluate
the accuracy of the Commission’s estimate of the burden of the proposed collections of
information; (iii) determine whether there are ways to enhance the quality, utility, and
clarity of the information to be collected; and (iv) determine whether there are ways to
minimize the burden of the collections of information on those who are to respond,
including through the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of
information technology.
The agency has submitted the proposed collection of information to OMB for
approval. Persons wishing to submit comments on the collection of information
requirements of the proposed amendments should direct them to the Office of
Management and Budget, Attention Desk Officer for the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, and
should send a copy to Brent J. Fields, Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission,
100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549 1090, with reference to File No. S7-08-15.
OMB is required to make a decision concerning the collections of information between
370

30 and 60 days after publication of this release; therefore, a comment to OMB is best
assured of having its full effect if OMB receives it within 30 days after publication of this
release. Requests for materials submitted to OMB by the Commission with regard to
these collections of information should be in writing, refer to File No. S7-08-15, and be
submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of FOIA Services, 100 F
Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549-2736.
VI.

INITIAL REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS
This Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (“IRFA”) has been prepared in

accordance with section 3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”). 871 It relates to
proposed new Form N-PORT and amendments to the Form N-CSR certification
requirement, amendments to Regulation S-X, the proposed rule governing electronic
transmission of shareholder reports, the rescission of Forms N-Q and N-SAR, and
proposed amendments to Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4, and N-6.
A.

Reasons for and Objectives of the Proposed Actions

The Commission collects certain information about the funds that it regulates.
The Commission is proposing new rules, rule amendments, and new forms and form
amendments that would improve the quality of information that funds report to the
Commission, benefitting the Commission’s risk monitoring and oversight, examination,
and enforcement programs.
We believe that our proposals would improve the information that funds report to
their shareholders and the Commission. In addition, the proposed new forms would
require reports be filed in a structured data format (XML) to allow for easier collection
871

5 U.S.C. 603.

371

and analysis of data by Commission staff and the public. This is the format used by Form
N-MFP, Form 13F, and Form D, which greatly improves the ability of Commission staff
and other potential users to aggregate and analyze the data reported.
The Commission’s objective is to gain more timely and useful information about
funds’ operations and portfolio holdings. The Commission also believes that its risk
monitoring and oversight, examination, and enforcement programs would be improved
by requiring enhanced information from funds.
B.

Legal Basis

The Commission is proposing the rules and forms contained in this document
under the authority set forth in the Securities Act, particularly, section 19 thereof [15
U.S.C. 77a et seq.], the Trust Indenture Act, particularly, section 319 thereof [15 U.S.C.
77aaa et seq.], the Exchange Act, particularly, sections 10, 13, 15, 23, and 35A thereof
[15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.], the Investment Company Act, particularly, sections 8, 30, and 38
thereof [15 U.S.C. 80a et seq.], and 44 U.S.C. 3506, 3507.
C.

Small Entities Subject to the Rule

An investment company is a small entity if, together with other investment
companies in the same group of related investment companies, it has net assets of $50
million or less as of the end of its most recent fiscal year. 872 Commission staff estimates
that, as of December 2014, approximately 146 registered investment companies,
including 133 open and closed-end funds (including one SBIC) and 13 UITs. The
Commission staff further estimates that, as of December 2014, approximately 28 BDCs
are small entities.

Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance
Requirements

The proposed amendments would create, amend, or eliminate current reporting
requirements for small entities.
1.

Form N-PORT

Funds currently report portfolio holdings information quarterly on Form N-Q
(first and third fiscal quarters) and Form N-CSR (second and fourth fiscal quarters). The
Commission is proposing to adopt new Form N-PORT on which funds, other than
MMFs, UITs, and SBICs, would be required to report portfolio holdings information and
information related to liquidity, derivatives, securities lending, purchases and
redemptions, and counterparty exposure each month. Funds would be required to file
Form N-PORT within 30 days after the end of the monthly period using a structured
format. Only information reported for the third month of each quarter would be available
to the public and such information would not be made public until 60 days after the end
of the third month of the fund’s fiscal quarter. For smaller funds and fund groups (i.e.,
funds that together with other investment companies in the same “group of related
investment companies” have net assets of less than $1 billion as of the end of the most
recent fiscal year), which would include small entities, we expect to provide for an extra
12 months (or 30 months after the effective date) to comply with the new Form N-PORT
reporting requirements.
Based on our experience with other interactive data filings, we estimate that funds
would prepare and file their reports on proposed Form N-PORT by either (1) licensing a
software solution and preparing and filing the reports in house, or (2) retaining a service
provider to provide data aggregation and validation services as part of the preparation and

373

filing of reports on proposed Form N-PORT on behalf of the fund. We estimate that
approximately 132 open and closed-end funds (other than money market funds and
SBICs), are small entities that would be required to file, on a monthly basis, a complete
report on proposed Form N-PORT reporting certain information regarding the fund and
its portfolio holdings. As discussed above, we estimate, for funds that choose to license a
software solution to file reports on Form N-PORT, that completing, reviewing, and filing
Form N-PORT would cost $55,970 for each fund, including small entities, in its first year
of reporting and $46,745 per year for each subsequent year. 873 We further estimate, for
funds that choose to retain a third-party service provider to provide data aggregation and
validation services as part of the preparation and filing of reports on Form N-PORT, that
completing, reviewing, and filing Form N-PORT would cost $54,821 for each fund,
including small entities, in its first year of reporting, and $38,746 per year for each
subsequent year. 874
2.

Rescission of Form N-Q

Our proposal would rescind Form N-Q in order to eliminate unnecessarily
duplicative reporting requirements. The proposed rescission of Form N-Q would affect
all management investment companies required to file reports on the form. We expect
that approximately 132 open and closed-end funds are small entities that would be
affected by the recession of Form N-Q.

873

See supra notes 658-659 and accompanying text.

874

See supra notes 660-661 and accompanying text.

374

As discussed above, we estimate that the rescission of Form N-Q would save
$6,762 per year for each fund, including small entities. 875
3.

Form N-CEN

Funds currently report census type information relating to the fund’s organization,
service providers, fees and expenses, portfolio strategies and investments, portfolio
transactions, and share transactions on Form N-SAR. Funds file this form semi-annually
with the Commission, except for UITs, which must file such reports annually. 876 The
utility of the information reported on Form N-SAR has been limited for two reasons.
First, the data items funds are required to report on Form N-SAR have not been updated
to reflect current Commission staff needs. Second, the technology by which funds file
reports on Form N-SAR has not been updated and limits the Commission staff’s ability to
extract and analyze reported data.
Because of these limitations, the Commission is proposing to replace Form
N-SAR with new Form N-CEN. This new form would streamline and updated the
required data items to reflect current Commission staff needs. The Commission is also
proposing that funds file reports on Form N-CEN in a structured (XML) format, which
would allow for easier data analysis and use in the Commission’s rulemaking, inspection,
and risk monitoring functions and reduce burdens on filers. Finally, the Commission is
proposing that funds file reports on Form N-CEN annually, opposed to semi-annually,

875

The estimated cost is based upon the following calculations: ($6,762= 21 hours/fund x
$322/hour compensation for professionals commonly used in preparation of Form N-Q
filings.) See supra Part V.A.2.

876

See rule 30b1-1 and rule 30a-1.

375

which is currently required for Form N-SAR (except UITs, which currently must file
reports annually).
We estimate that that approximately 146 registered investment companies,
including 133 open and closed-end funds (including one SBIC) and 13 UITs, are small
entities that would be required to file a complete report on Form N-CEN. Although UITs
are required to complete fewer items on Form N-CEN than other registered investment
companies, the burden on UITs would increase because UITs would be required to
respond to more items in Form N-CEN than they are currently required to respond to
under Form N-SAR.
As discussed above, the SEC estimates that completing, reviewing, and filing
Form N-CEN would cost $10,622 for each fund, 877 including small entities, in its first
year of reporting, and $4,252 per year for each subsequent year. 878 We further estimate
that completing, reviewing, and filing Form N-CEN would cost $9,272 for each UIT, 879
including small entities, in its first year of reporting, and $2,902 per year for each
subsequent year. 880

877

See supra notes 723 and 725 and accompanying text. The estimated costs is based upon the
following calculations: ($10,622 = (13.35 hours/fund ongoing costs + 20 hours/fund initial
costs) x $318.50/hour compensation for professionals commonly used in preparation of Form
N-CEN filings)

878

See supra note 724 and accompanying text. The estimated costs is based upon the following
calculations: ($4,252 = 13.35 hours/fund ongoing costs x $318.50/hour compensation for
professionals commonly used in preparation of Form N-CEN filings)

879

See supra notes 723 and 725 and accompanying text. The estimated costs is based upon the
following calculations: ($9,272 = (9.11 hours/UIT ongoing costs + 20 hours/UIT initial
costs) x $318.50/hour compensation for professionals commonly used in preparation of Form
N-CEN filings)

880

See supra note 724 and accompanying text. The estimated costs is based upon the following
calculations: ($2,902 = 9.11 hours/UIT ongoing costs x $318.50/hour compensation for
professionals commonly used in preparation of Form N-CEN filings)

376

4.

Rescission of Form N-SAR

Our proposal would rescind Form N-SAR in order to eliminate unnecessarily
duplicative reporting requirements. We estimate that that approximately 146 registered
investment companies that are small entities, including 133 open and closed-end funds
(including one SBIC) and 13 UITs would be affected by the rescission of Form N-SAR.
We estimate that rescinding Form N-SAR would save $9,778 per year for each
fund, including small entities. 881 We further estimate that rescinding Form N-SAR would
save $2,265 per year for each UIT, including small entities. 882
5.

Regulation S-X Amendments

The Commission is also proposing to amend Regulation S-X to require new,
standardized disclosures regarding fund holdings in open futures contracts, open forward
foreign currency contracts, and open swap contracts, and additional disclosures regarding
fund holdings of written and purchased options, update the disclosures for other
investments with conforming amendments, and amend the rules regarding the form and
content of fund financial statements. We believe that the amendments we are proposing
today are generally consistent with how many funds are currently reporting investments
(including derivatives), and other information according to current industry practices.
The Commission believes investors would benefit from our proposed amendments

881

The estimated savings is based upon the following calculations: ($9,778= 15.35 hours/fund x
$318.50/hour compensation for professionals commonly used in preparation of Form N-SAR
filings x 2 filings/year.) See supra notes 724-725 and accompanying text (using a weighted
average annual hour burden per response for Form N-SAR of 14.25 hours).

882

The estimated savings is based upon the following calculations: ($2,265= 7.11 hours/UIT x
$318.50/hour compensation for professionals commonly used in preparation of Form N-SAR
filings.) See supra notes 724-725 and accompanying text (using a weighted average annual
hour burden per response for Form N-SAR of 14.25 hours).

377

because increased disclosure and standardization of fund holdings would improve
comparability among funds including transparency for investors regarding a fund’s use of
derivatives and the liquidity of certain investments. The Commission also believes that
greater clarity would benefit the industry, while any additional burdens would be reduced
since similar disclosures would be proposed to be required on Form N-PORT.
We expect that approximately 146 registered investment companies, including
133 open and closed-end funds (including one SBIC) and 13 UITs and, approximately 28
BDCs, are small entities that would be affected by the amendments to Regulation S-X.
As discussed above, we estimate that amending Regulation S-X would cost $2,417 for
each fund, including small entities, in its first year of reporting, and $806 per year for
each subsequent year. 883 As discussed above, we further estimate that amending
Regulation S-X would cost $2,417 for each UIT, including small entities, in its first year
of reporting, and $806 per year for each subsequent year. 884
6.

Website Transmission of Shareholder Reports

The Commission is proposing new rule 30e-3 under the Investment Company
Act, which would, if adopted, permit, but not require, a fund to satisfy requirements
under the Act and rules thereunder to transmit reports to shareholders if the fund makes
the reports and certain other materials accessible on its website and periodically notifies
investors of the materials’ availability. 885 Proposed rule 30e-3 would provide that a
fund’s annual or semiannual report to shareholders would be considered “transmitted” to

883

See supra notes 694-699 and accompanying text.

884

See supra notes 698-701 and accompanying text.

885

See supra Part II.D.

378

a shareholder of record if certain conditions set forth in the rule are satisfied. 886 Funds
that do not maintain websites or that otherwise wish to transmit shareholder reports in
paper or pursuant the Commission’s existing electronic delivery guidance would continue
to be able to satisfy their transmission requirements by those transmission methods.
We expect that approximately 146 registered investment companies, including
133 open and closed-end funds (including one SBIC) and 13 UITs, are small entities that
would rely on the website reporting rules. As discussed above, the SEC estimates that
our proposed website reporting would save $4,792 for each fund, including small entities,
in its first year of reporting, and $6,122 per year for each subsequent year. 887
7.

Amendments to Form N-CSR

Form N-Q and Form N-CSR currently require a quarterly SOX certification
relating to the accuracy of information reported to the Commission and disclosure
controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. To facilitate the
elimination of Form N-Q, we are proposing to expand the SOX certification for Form NCSR to six months to maintain coverage for the entire fiscal year. We expect that
approximately 146 registered investment companies, including 133 open and closed-end
funds (including one SBIC) and 13 UITs, are small entities that would be affected by the
amendments to Form N-CSR. As discussed above, the, the Commission does not believe
that the costs associated with reporting on Form N-CSR for will change for funds,
including small entities, as a result of the proposed amendments to Form N-CSR. 888

886

Proposed rule 30e-3(a).

887

See supra notes 715, 717, and 718 and accompanying text.

888

See supra Part V.E.

379

8.

Amendments to Registration Statement Forms

We are also proposing to amend Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4, and N-6 to exempt
funds from those forms’ respective books and records disclosures if the information is
provided in a fund’s most recent report on Form N-CEN. 889 The books and records
disclosures required by these registration statement forms are not provided in a structured
format. We believe that having this information in a structured format would increase
our efficiency in preparing for exams as well as our ability to identify current industry
trends and practices and, therefore, are proposing it be reported on proposed Form
N-CEN. We are also proposing amendments that would restrict funds that would rely on
proposed rule 30e-3 from providing a Summary Schedule in their shareholder reports in
lieu of a complete schedule, and certain technical and conforming amendments to Forms
N-1A, N-2 and N-3 to refer to the availability of portfolio holdings schedules attached to
reports on Form N-PORT and posted on fund websites rather than on reports on Form
N-Q.
We expect that approximately 146 registered investment companies, including
133 open and closed-end funds (including one SBIC) and 13 UITs, and approximately 28
BDCs, are small entities that would be required to file registration statements. As
discussed above, the SEC estimates that our proposed amendments would not change for
funds, including small entities, as a result of our proposed amendments to Forms N-1A,
N-2, N-3, N-4, and N-6. 890

889

See supra notes 397-399 and accompanying text.

890

See supra Part V.F.

380

E.

Duplicative, Overlapping, or Conflicting Federal Rules

Funds currently report portfolio holdings information for the first and third fiscal
quarters on Form N-Q and for the second and fourth fiscal quarters on Form N-CSR. As
a result of our proposal to create new Form N-PORT, on which funds will report portfolio
holdings information monthly, the Commission is proposing to eliminate Form N-Q,
which will reduce duplication of portfolio holdings information for the first and third
fiscal quarters. We acknowledge that Form N-CSR, Form N-PORT, Regulation S-X, and
web reporting would require reporting of some duplicative information, including
information currently reported on the fund’s registration statements and annual reports.
However, we believe that both the nature and structure of the reporting are sufficiently
different to justify overlapping information requirements on the fund’s website or on
respective Commission forms. 891
Funds currently report census information on Form N-SAR. As part of our
proposed amendments, the Commission is proposing to replace Form N-SAR with new
Form N-CEN. In addition, we are proposing that reports on Form N-CEN be filed
annually, as opposed to semi-annually, which is generally required for Form N-SAR.
Again, we acknowledge that Form N-CEN would require reporting of some duplicative
information, including information currently reported on the fund’s registration
statements and annual reports. Like Form N-PORT and Form N-CSR, we believe that
both the nature and structure of the reporting are sufficiently different to justify
overlapping information requirements.
891

For example, the purpose of Form N-PORT is to provide structured portfolio holdings data
for Commission staff and other to analyze, while the purpose of web reporting is to provide
shareholders with investor-friendly portfolio disclosures on a quarterly basis.

381

Finally, in order to reduce duplicative information in Form N-CEN and fund
registration statements, we are proposing to amend Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4, and N-6
to exempt funds from those forms’ respective books and records disclosures if the
information is provided in a fund’s most recent report on Form N-CEN.
F.

Significant Alternatives

The RFA directs the Commission to consider significant alternatives that would
accomplish our stated objective, while minimizing any significant economic impact on
small entities. The Commission considered the following alternatives for small entities in
relation our proposed amendments: (i) establishing different reporting requirements or
frequency to account for resources available to small entities; (ii) using performance
rather than design standards; and (iii) exempting small entities from all or part of the
proposal.
Small entities currently follow the same requirements that large entities do when
filing reports on Form N-SAR, Form N-CSR, and Form N-Q. The Commission believes
that establishing different reporting requirements or frequency for small entities would
not be consistent with the Commission’s goal of industry oversight and investor
protection. However, as discussed above, we are proposing a delayed compliance period
for small entities that would file reports on Form N-PORT.
G.

General Request for Comment

The Commission requests comments regarding this IRFA. We request comments
on the number of small entities that may be affected by our proposed rules and
guidelines, and whether the proposed rules and guidelines would have any effects not
considered in this analysis. We request that commenters describe the nature of any
effects on small entities subject to the rules, and provide empirical data to support the
382

nature and extent of such effects. We also request comment on the proposed compliance
burdens and the effect these burdens would have on smaller entities.
VII.

CONSIDERATION OF IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY
For purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996

(“SBREFA”), 892 the Commission must advise OMB whether a proposed regulation
constitutes a “major” rule. Under SBREFA, a rule is considered “major” where, if
adopted, it results in or is likely to result in:
•

An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;

•

A major increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries; or

•

Significant adverse effects on competition, investment, or innovation.
We request comment on whether our proposal would be a “major rule” for

purposes of SBREFA. We solicit comment and empirical data on:
•

The potential effect on the U.S. economy on an annual basis;

•

Any potential increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries;
and

•

Any potential effect on competition, investment, or innovation.

Commenters are requested to provide empirical data and other factual support for their
views to the extent possible.

§210.6-01 Application of §§210.6-01 to 210.6-10.
Sections 210.6-01 to 210.6-10 shall be applicable to financial statements filed for
registered investment companies and business development companies.
5.

Revise §210.6-03 to read as follows:

§210.6-03 Special rules of general application to registered investment companies
and business development companies.
The financial statements filed for persons to which §§210.6-01 to 210.6-10 are
applicable shall be prepared in accordance with the following special rules in addition to
the general rules in §§210.1-01 to 210.4-10 (Articles 1, 2, 3, and 4). Where the
requirements of a special rule differ from those prescribed in a general rule, the
requirements of the special rule shall be met.

386

(a) Content of financial statements. The financial statements shall be prepared in
accordance with the requirements of this part (Regulation S-X) notwithstanding any
provision of the articles of incorporation, trust indenture or other governing legal
instruments specifying certain accounting procedures inconsistent with those required in
§§210.6-01 to 210.6-10.
(b) Audited financial statements. Where, under Article 3 of this part, financial
statements are required to be audited, the independent accountant shall have been

(c) Consolidated and combined statements. (1) Consolidated and combined
statements filed for registered investment companies and business development
companies shall be prepared in accordance with §§210.3A-01 to 210.3A-04 (Article 3A)
except that:
(i) Statements of the registrant may be consolidated only with the statements of
subsidiaries which are investment companies;
(ii) A consolidated statement of the registrant and any of its investment company
subsidiaries shall not be filed unless accompanied by a consolidating statement which
sets forth the individual statements of each significant subsidiary included in the
consolidated statement: Provided, however, That a consolidating statement need not be
filed if all included subsidiaries are totally held; and
(iii) Consolidated or combined statements filed for subsidiaries not consolidated
with the registrant shall not include any investment companies unless accompanied by

387

consolidating or combining statements which set forth the individual statements of each
included investment company which is a significant subsidiary.
(2) If consolidating or combining statements are filed, the amounts included under
each caption in which financial data pertaining to affiliates is required to be furnished
shall be subdivided to show separately the amounts:
(i) Eliminated in consolidation; and
(ii) Not eliminated in consolidation.
(d) Valuation of investments. The balance sheets of registered investment
companies and business development companies, other than issuers of face-amount
certificates, shall reflect all investments at value, with the aggregate cost of each category
of investment reported under §§210.6-04.1, 6-04.2, 6-04.3 and 6-04.9 or the aggregate
cost of each category of investment reported under §210.6-05.1 shown parenthetically.
State in a note the methods used in determining value of investments. As required by
section 28(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-28(b)), qualified
assets of face-amount certificate companies shall be valued in accordance with certain
provisions of the Code of the District of Columbia. For guidance as to valuation of
securities, see §§404.03 to 404.05 of the Codification of Financial Reporting Policies.
(e) Qualified assets. State in a note the nature of any investments and other assets
maintained or required to be maintained, by applicable legal instruments, in respect of
outstanding face-amount certificates. If the nature of the qualifying assets and amount
thereof are not subject to the provisions of section 28 of the Investment Company Act of
1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-28), a statement to that effect shall be made.

388

(f) Restricted securities. State in a note unless disclosed elsewhere the following
information as to investment securities which cannot be offered for public sale without
first being registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (restricted securities):
(1) The policy of the person with regard to acquisition of restricted securities.
(2) The policy of the person with regard to valuation of restricted securities.
Specific comments shall be given as to the valuation of an investment in one or more
issues of securities of a company or group of affiliated companies if any part of such
investment is restricted and the aggregate value of the investment in all issues of such
company or affiliated group exceeds five percent of the value of total assets. (As used in
this paragraph, the term affiliated shall have the meaning given in §210.6-02(a).)
(3) A description of the person's rights with regard to demanding registration of
any restricted securities held at the date of the latest balance sheet.
(g) Income recognition. Dividends shall be included in income on the ex-dividend
date; interest shall be accrued on a daily basis. Dividends declared on short positions
existing on the record date shall be recorded on the ex-dividend date and included as an
expense of the period.
(h) Federal income taxes. The company's status as a regulated investment
company as defined in subtitle A, chapter 1, subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code,
as amended, shall be stated in a note referred to in the appropriate statements. Such note
shall also indicate briefly the principal assumptions on which the company relied in
making or not making provisions for income taxes. However, a company which retains
realized capital gains and designates such gains as a distribution to shareholders in
accordance with section 852(b)(3)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code shall, on the last day

389

of its taxable year (and not earlier), make provision for taxes on such undistributed
capital gains realized during such year.
(i) Issuance and repurchase by a registered investment company or business
development company of its own securities. Disclose for each class of the company's
securities:
(1) The number of shares, units, or principal amount of bonds sold during the
period of report, the amount received therefor, and, in the case of shares sold by closedend management investment companies, the difference, if any, between the amount
received and the net asset value or preference in involuntary liquidation (whichever is
appropriate) of securities of the same class prior to such sale; and
(2) The number of shares, units, or principal amount of bonds repurchased during
the period of report and the cost thereof. Closed-end management investment companies
shall furnish the following additional information as to securities repurchased during the
period of report:
(i) As to bonds and preferred shares, the aggregate difference between cost and
the face amount or preference in involuntary liquidation and, if applicable net assets
taken at value as of the date of repurchase were less than such face amount or preference,
the aggregate difference between cost and such net asset value;
(ii) As to common shares, the weighted average discount per share, expressed as a
percentage, between cost of repurchase and the net asset value applicable to such shares
at the date of repurchases.

390

Note to paragraphs (h)(2)(i) and (ii): The information required by paragraphs (h)(2)(i)
and (ii) of this section may be based on reasonable estimates if it is impracticable to
determine the exact amounts involved.
(j) Series companies. (1) The information required by this part shall, in the case of
a person which in essence is comprised of more than one separate investment company,
be given as if each class or series of such investment company were a separate
investment company; this shall not prevent the inclusion, at the option of such person, of
information applicable to other classes or series of such person on a comparative basis,
except as to footnotes which need not be comparative.
(2) If the particular class or series for which information is provided may be
affected by other classes or series of such investment company, such as by the offset of

Each issue shall be listed separately: Provided, however, that an amount not

exceeding five percent of the total of Column C may be listed in one amount as
“Miscellaneous securities,” provided the securities so listed are not restricted, have been
held for not more than one year prior to the date of the related balance sheet, and have not
previously been reported by name to the shareholders of the person for which the
schedule is filed or to any exchange, or set forth in any registration statement,
application, or annual report or otherwise made available to the public. If any securities
are listed as “Miscellaneous securities,” briefly explain in a footnote what the term
represents.

Categorize the schedule by (i) the type of investment (such as common stocks,

preferred stocks, convertible securities, fixed income securities, government securities,
options purchased, warrants, loan participations and assignments, commercial paper,
bankers' acceptances, certificates of deposit, short-term securities, repurchase agreements,
other investment companies, and so forth); (ii) the related industry of the investment; and
(iii) the related country, or geographic region of the investment. Short-term debt
406

instruments (i.e., debt instruments whose maturities or expiration dates at the time of
acquisition are one year or less) of the same issuer may be aggregated, in which case the
range of interest rates and maturity dates shall be indicated. For issuers of periodic
payment plan certificates and unit investment trusts, list separately: (i) Trust shares in

unless, during the last year preceding the date of the related balance sheet, there was at
least one dividend paid upon such common shares.

Revise §210.12-12B to read as follows:

§210.12-12B Summary schedule of investments in securities of unaffiliated issuers.
Column A

Column B

Column C

Column D

Name of issuer Balance held at close of period. Value of each item Percentage value
and title of issue1 Number of shares—principal at close of period2 9 compared to net
345678
amount of bonds and notes 10 11 12 13 14 15
assets.
1

Categorize the schedule by (a) the type of investment (such as common stocks,

preferred stocks, convertible securities, fixed income securities, government securities,
410

options purchased, warrants, loan participations and assignments, commercial paper,
bankers' acceptances, certificates of deposit, short-term securities, repurchase agreements,
other investment companies, and so forth); (b) the related industry of the investment; and
(c) the related country or geographic region of the investment.
2

The subtotals for each category of investments, subdivided both by type of

investment and industry, country, or geographic region, shall be shown together with
their percentage value compared to net assets.
3

Indicate the interest rate or preferential dividend rate and maturity date, as

applicable, for preferred stocks, convertible securities, fixed income securities,
government securities, loan participations and assignments, commercial paper, bankers'
acceptances, certificates of deposit, short-term securities, repurchase agreements, or other
instruments with a stated rate of income. For variable rate securities, indicate a
description of the reference rate and spread. For securities with payment in kind income,
disclose the rate paid in kind.
4

Except as provided in note 6, list separately the 50 largest issues and any other

issue the value of which exceeded one percent of net asset value of the registrant as of the
close of the period. For purposes of the list (including, in the case of short-term debt
instruments, the first sentence of note 4), aggregate and treat as a single issue,
respectively, (a) short-term debt instruments (i.e., debt instruments whose maturities or
expiration dates at the time of acquisition are one year or less) of the same issuer
(indicating the range of interest rates and maturity dates); and (b) fully collateralized
repurchase agreements (indicate in a footnote the range of dates of the repurchase
agreements, the total purchase price of the securities, the total amount to be received

411

upon repurchase, the range of repurchase dates, and description of securities subject to
the repurchase agreements). Restricted and unrestricted securities of the same issue
should be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the issue is among the 50
largest issues, but should not be combined in the schedule. For purposes of determining
whether the value of an issue exceeds one percent of net asset value, aggregate and treat
as a single issue all securities of any one issuer, except that all fully collateralized
repurchase agreements shall be aggregated and treated as a single issue. The U.S.
Treasury and each agency, instrumentality, or corporation, including each governmentsponsored entity, that issues U.S. government securities is a separate issuer.
5

For options purchased, all information required by §210.12-13 for options

contracts written should be shown. Options on underlying investments where the
underlying investment would otherwise be presented in accordance with §§210.12-12,
12-13A, 12-13B, 12-13C, or 12-13D should include the description of the underlying
investment as would be required by §§210.12-12, 12-13A, 12-13B, 12-13C, or 12-13D as
part of the description of the option.
6

If multiple securities of an issuer aggregate to greater than one percent of net

asset value, list each issue of the issuer separately (including separate listing of restricted
and unrestricted securities of the same issue) except that the following may be aggregated
and listed as a single issue: (a) Fixed-income securities of the same issuer which are not
among the 50 largest issues and whose value does not exceed one percent of net asset
value of the registrant as of the close of the period (indicating the range of interest rates
and maturity dates); and (b) U.S. government securities of a single agency,
instrumentality, or corporation, which are not among the 50 largest issues and whose

412

value does not exceed one percent of net asset value of the registrant as of the close of the
period (indicating the range of interest rates and maturity dates). For each category
identified pursuant to note 1, group all issues that are neither separately listed nor
included in a group of securities that is listed in the aggregate as a single issue in a subcategory labeled “Other securities,” and provide the information for Columns C and D.
7

Any securities that would be required to be listed separately or included in a

group of securities that is listed in the aggregate as a single issue may be listed in one
amount as “Miscellaneous securities,” provided the securities so listed are eligible to be,
and are, categorized as “Miscellaneous securities” in the registrant's Schedule of
Investments in Securities of Unaffiliated Issuers required under §210.12-12. However, if
any security that is included in “Miscellaneous securities” would otherwise be required to
be included in a group of securities that is listed in the aggregate as a single issue, the
remaining securities of that group must nonetheless be listed as required by notes 4 and 5
even if the remaining securities alone would not otherwise be required to be listed in this
manner (e.g., because the combined value of the security listed in “Miscellaneous
securities” and the remaining securities of the same issuer exceeds one percent of net
asset value, but the value of the remaining securities alone does not exceed one percent of
net asset value).
8

If any securities are listed as “Miscellaneous securities” pursuant to note 6 or

“Other securities” pursuant to note 5, briefly explain in a footnote what those terms
represent.
9

Total Column C. The total of column C should equal the total shown on the

related balance sheet for investments in securities of unaffiliated issuers.

413

10

Indicate by an appropriate symbol each issue of securities which is non-income

producing. Evidences of indebtedness and preferred shares may be deemed to be income
producing if, on the respective last interest payment date or date for the declaration of
dividends prior to the date of the related balance sheet, there was only a partial payment
of interest or a declaration of only a partial amount of the dividends payable; in such
case, however, each such issue shall be indicated by an appropriate symbol referring to a
note to the effect that, on the last interest or dividend date, only partial interest was paid
or partial dividends declared. If, on such respective last interest or dividend date, no
interest was paid or no cash or in kind dividends declared, the issue shall not be deemed
to be income producing. Common shares shall not be deemed to be income producing
unless, during the last year preceding the date of the related balance sheet, there was at
least one dividend paid upon such common shares.
11

Indicate by an appropriate symbol each issue of restricted securities. State the

following in a footnote: (a) as to each such issue: (1) Acquisition date, (2) carrying value
per unit of investment at date of related balance sheet, e.g., a percentage of current
market value of unrestricted securities of the same issuer, etc., and (3) the cost of such
securities; (b) as to each issue acquired during the year preceding the date of the related
balance sheet, the carrying value per unit of investment of unrestricted securities of the
same issuer at: (1) The day the purchase price was agreed to; and (2) the day on which an
enforceable right to acquire such securities was obtained; and (c) the aggregate value of
all restricted securities and the percentage which the aggregate value bears to net assets.
12

Indicate by an appropriate symbol each issue of securities whose fair value was

determined using significant unobservable inputs.

414

13

Indicate by an appropriate symbol each issue of illiquid securities.

14

Indicate by an appropriate symbol each issue of securities held in connection

with open put or call option contracts, loans for short sales, or where any portion of the
issue is on loan.
15

State in a footnote the following amounts based on cost for Federal income tax

purposes: (a) Aggregate gross unrealized appreciation for all securities in which there is
an excess of value over tax cost, (b) the aggregate gross unrealized depreciation for all
securities in which there is an excess of tax cost over value, (c) the net unrealized
appreciation or depreciation, and (d) the aggregate cost of securities for Federal income
tax purposes.

FORM N-CEN
ANNUAL REPORT FOR REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANIES
Form N-CEN is to be used by all registered investment companies, other than
face amount certificate companies, to file annual reports with the Commission, not
later than 60 days after the close of the fiscal year for which the report is being
prepared, pursuant to rule 30a-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“Act”)
(17 CFR 270.30a-1). Face amount certificate companies should continue to file
periodic reports pursuant to section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (“Exchange Act”). The Commission may use the information provided on
Form N-CEN in its regulatory, enforcement, examination, disclosure review,
inspection, and policymaking roles.
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
A.

Rule as to Use of Form N-CEN

Form N-CEN is the reporting form that is to be used for annual reports filed
pursuant to rule 30a­1 under the Act (17 CFR 270.30a-1) by registered investment
companies, other than face amount certificate companies, under section 30(a) of the
Act and, in the case of small business investment companies and registered unit
investment trusts, under section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, if applicable.
Registrants must respond to all items in the relevant Parts of Form N-CEN, as
listed below in this General Instruction A. If an item within a required Part is
inapplicable, the Registrant should respond “N/A” to that item. Registrants are not,
however, required to respond to items in Parts of Form N-CEN that they are not
required by this General Instruction A to respond to.
Management investment companies: Management investment companies other than
small business investment companies must complete Parts A, B, C, and G of this
Form. Management investment companies that offer multiple series must complete
Part C as to each series separately, even if some information is the same for two or
more series. Closed-end management investment companies also must complete
Part D of this Form. Small business investment companies must complete Parts A,
B, D, and G of this Form. Management investment companies that are registered on
Form N-3 also must complete certain items in Part F of this Form as directed by
Item 7.c.i.
Exchange-traded funds or exchange-traded managed funds: Funds that are exchangetraded funds or exchange-traded managed funds, as defined by this Form, must
complete Part E of this Form in addition to any other required Parts.

449

Unit investment trusts: Unit investment trusts must complete Parts A, B, F, and
G of this Form.
B.

Application of General Rules and Regulations

The General Rules and Regulations under the Act contain certain general
requirements that are applicable to reporting on any form under the Act. These
general requirements should be carefully read and observed in the preparation and
filing of reports on this form, except that any provision in the form or in these
instructions shall be controlling.
C.

Filing of Report

All registered investment companies with shares outstanding (other than shares
issued in connection with an initial investment to satisfy section 14(a) of the
Investment Company Act) must file a report on Form N-CEN at least annually. If a
Registrant changes its fiscal year, a report filed on Form N-CEN may cover a period
shorter than 12 months, but in no event may a report filed on Form N-CEN cover a
period longer than 12 months or a period that overlaps with a period covered by a
previously filed report. For example, if in 2014 a Registrant with a September 30
fiscal year end changes its fiscal year end to December 31, the Registrant could file a
report on this Form for the fiscal period ending September 30, 2014 and a report for
the period ending December 31, 2014. A Registrant could not, however, only file a
report for the fiscal period ending December 31, 2014 if its last report was filed for
the fiscal period ending September 30, 2013. An extension of time of up to 15
days for filing the form may be obtained by following the procedures specified
in rule l2b-25 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.12b-25).
Reports must be filed electronically using the Commission’s Electronic Data
Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (“EDGAR”) system in accordance with
Regulation S-T. Consult the EDGAR Filer Manual and Appendices for EDGAR
filing instructions.
D.

Paperwork Reduction Act Information

A registrant is required to disclose the information specified by Form N-CEN,
and the Commission will make this information public. A registrant is not required
to respond to the collection of information contained in Form N-CEN unless the
form displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) control
number. Please direct comments concerning the accuracy of the information
collection burden estimate and any suggestions for reducing the burden to the
Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC
20549-1090. The OMB has reviewed this collection of information under the
clearance requirements of 44 U.S.C. 3507.

450

E.

Signature and Filing of Report

If the report is filed in paper pursuant to a hardship exemption from electronic
filing (see Item 201 et seq. of Regulation S-T (17 CFR 232.201 et seq.)), eight complete
copies of the report shall be filed with the Commission. At least one complete copy
of the report shall be filed with each exchange on which any class of securities of the
registrant is registered. At least one complete copy of the report filed with the
Commission and one such copy filed with each exchange must be manually signed.
Copies not manually signed must bear typed or printed signatures.
A registrant may file an amendment to a previously filed report at any time,
including an amendment to correct a mistake or error in a previously filed report. A
registrant that files an amendment to a previously filed report must provide
information in response to all required items of Form N-CEN, regardless of why the
amendment is filed.
The report must be signed by the Registrant, and on behalf of the Registrant, by
an authorized officer of the Registrant. The name of each person who signs the
report shall be typed or printed beneath his or her signature. Attention is directed to
rule 8b-11 under the Act (17 CFR 270.8b-11) concerning manual signatures and
signatures pursuant to powers of attorney.

Instructions to Item 41 and Item 42.
To help Registrants distinguish between agency and principal transactions, and to
promote consistent reporting of the information required by these items, the
following criteria should be used:
1.

If a security is purchased or sold in a transaction for which the confirmation
specifies the amount of the commission to be paid by the Registrant, the
transaction should be considered an agency transaction and included in
determining the answers to Item 41.

2.

If a security is purchased or sold in a transaction for which the confirmation
specifies only the net amount to be paid or received by the Registrant and such
net amount is equal to the market value of the security at the time of the
transaction, the transaction should be considered a principal transaction and
included in determining the amounts in Item 42.

3.

If a security is purchased by the Registrant in an underwritten offering, the
acquisition should be considered a principal transaction and included in
answering Item 42 even though the Registrant has knowledge of the amount
the underwriters are receiving from the issuer.

469

4.

If a security is sold by the Registrant in a tender offer, the sale should be
considered a principal transaction and included in answering Item 42 even
though the Registrant has knowledge of the amount the offeror is paying to
soliciting brokers or dealers.

5.

If a security is purchased directly from the issuer (such as a bank CD), the
purchase should be considered a principal transaction and included in
answering Item 42.

6.

The value of called or maturing securities should not be counted in either
agency or principal transactions and should not be included in determining the
amounts shown in Item 41 and Item 42. This means that the acquisition of a
security may be included, but it is possible that its disposition may not be
included. Disposition of a repurchase agreement at its expiration date should
not be included.

7.

The purchase or sales of securities in transactions not described in paragraphs
(1) through (6) above should be evaluated by the Fund based upon the
guidelines established in those paragraphs and classified accordingly. The
agents considered in Item 41 may be persons or companies not registered under
the Exchange Act as securities brokers. The persons or companies from whom
the investment company purchased or to whom it sold portfolio instruments on
a principal basis may be persons or entities not registered under the Exchange
Act as securities dealers.

should separately state each date on which securities were divested and the total
number of shares or, for debt securities, principal amount divested, on each such date.

(7)

A Registrant may have separate codes of ethics for different types of officers.
Furthermore, a “code of ethics” within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2) of this

information on its Internet website within five business days following the date
of the amendment or waiver and the Registrant has disclosed in its most
recently filed report on this Form N-CEN its Internet website address and
intention to provide disclosure in this manner. If the amendment or waiver

open for business, then the five business day period shall begin to run on and
include the first business day thereafter. If the Registrant elects to disclose this
information through its website, such information must remain available on the
website for at least a 12-month period. The Registrant must retain the
information for a period of not less than six years following the end of the fiscal
year in which the amendment or waiver occurred. Upon request, the Registrant
must furnish to the Commission or its staff a copy of any or all information
retained pursuant to this requirement.

the Registrant of a material departure from a provision of the code of ethics;

within a reasonable period of time regarding a material departure from a

directly or indirectly any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from
the issuer; or (ii) be an “interested person” of the investment company as
defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(19)).

instruction, it must explain why it does not have an audit committee financial
expert.

(4)

If the Registrant’s board of directors has determined that the Registrant has
more than one audit committee financial expert serving on its audit committee,
the Registrant may, but is not required to, disclose the names of those
additional persons. A Registrant choosing to identify such persons must
indicate whether they are independent pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this
instruction.

accepted accounting principles and financial statements; (ii) the ability to assess
the general application of such principles in connection with the accounting for
estimates, accruals, and reserves; (iii) experience preparing, auditing, analyzing,

more persons engaged in such activities; (iv) an understanding of internal
controls and procedures for financial reporting; and (v) an understanding of
audit committee functions.

not be deemed an “expert” for any purpose, including without limitation for
purposes of Section 11 of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77k), as a result of being
designated or identified as an audit committee financial expert pursuant to this
instruction; (ii) the designation or identification of a person as an audit
committee financial expert pursuant to this instruction does not impose on such
person any duties, obligations, or liability that are greater than the duties,
obligations, and liability imposed on such person as a member of the audit
committee and board of directors in the absence of such designation or
identification; (iii) the designation or identification of a person as an audit
committee financial expert pursuant to this instruction does not affect the
duties, obligations, or liability of any other member of the audit committee or
board of directors.

(8)

held a position described in paragraph (b)(6)(iv) of this Instruction, the
Registrant shall provide a brief listing of that person’s relevant experience.

Responses to Questions

In responding to the items on this Form, the following guidelines apply unless
otherwise specifically indicated:
•

A fund is required to respond to every item of this form. If an item requests
information that is not applicable, for example, an LEI for a counterparty that
does not have an LEI, respond N/A;

•

If an item requests the name of an entity, provide the full name to the extent
known, and do not use abbreviations (other than abbreviations that are part of the
full name);

•

If an item requests information expressed as a percentage, enter the response as a
percentage (not a decimal), rounded to the nearest hundredth of one percent
(e.g., 5.27%);

•

If an item requests a monetary value, report the amount rounded to the nearest
hundredth (e.g., if U.S. dollars, round to the nearest penny);

•

For currencies other than U.S. dollars, also report the applicable three-letter
alphabetic currency code pursuant to the International Organization for
Standardization (“ISO”) 4217 standard;

•

If an item requests a unique identifier, such an identifier may be internally
generated by the fund or provided by a third party, but should be consistently
used across the fund’s filings for reporting that investment so that the
Commission, investors, and other users of the information can track the
investment from report to report;

•

If an item requests a numerical value other than a percentage or a dollar value,
provide information rounded to the nearest hundredth;

•

If an item requests a date, provide information in mm/dd/yyyy format; and

•

If an item requests information regarding a “holding” or “investment,” separately
report information as to each holding or investment that is recorded in the Fund’s
books as part of a larger transaction. For example, two or more partially
offsetting legs of a transaction entered into with the same counterparty under a
common master agreement shall each be separately reported.
H.
