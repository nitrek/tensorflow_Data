EXTENSION ORDER

The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has requested an extension of time until
January 20, 2015 to submit a Proposed Plan of Distribution under Rule 1101(a) of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 CFR 201.1101(a).
On August 13, 2014, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative and
Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section
21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Sections 203(f) and 203(k) of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, and Section 9(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, Making
Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”) against
Keith MacDonald Summers (“Summers” or “Respondent”). 1 The Order required Respondent
to pay disgorgement of $4,117,658.15 to the Commission. Pursuant to the Order, the
disgorgement obligation was deemed satisfied by the transfer of monies in accounts at UBS
Financial Services, Inc. and Bank of America to the Commission and by the restitution orders
in the parallel criminal proceeding, R v. Summers, Information No. 12000143. Payments
totaling approximately $1,397,583.92 were made to the Commission on or about August 20,
2014.
