1124816) is a British Columbia corporation located in Vancouver, British Columbia,
Canada with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange
Act Section 12(g). Cinema Internet Networks is delinquent in its periodic filings with the
Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 20-F registration

B. DELINQUENT PERIODIC FILINGS
5. As discussed in more detail above, all of the Respondents are delinquent in
their periodic filings with the Commission, have repeatedly failed to meet their
obligations to file timely periodic reports, and failed to heed delinquency letters sent to
them by the Division of Corporation Finance requesting compliance with their periodic
filing obligations or, through their failure to maintain a valid address on file with the
Commission as required by Commission rules, did not receive such letters.
6. Exchange Act Section 13(a) and the rules promulgated thereunder require
issuers of securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 to file with the

reports, and Rule 13a-13 requires domestic issuers to file quarterly reports.

Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and/or 13a-13 thereunder.

connection therewith, to afford the Respondents an opportunity to establish any defenses
to such allegations; and,

2

B.
Whether it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to

12b-2 or 12g-3, and any new corporate names of any Respondents.
IV.

the allegations contained in this Order within ten (10) days after service of this Order, as

Commission engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this

decision of this matter, except as witness or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to
notice. Since this proceeding is not “rule making” within the meaning of Section 551 of
the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not deemed subject to the provisions of Section
