In the Matter of

ORDER APPROVING
MODIFIED PLAN OF
DISTRIBUTION OF A
FAIR FUND

On December 29, 2005, the Commission published a “Notice of Proposed Plan of
Distribution of Disgorgement Fund and Opportunity for Comment by Non-Parties” (“Notice”) in
connection with this proceeding pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund
and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1103. The Notice advised interested parties how to
obtain a copy of the proposed plan of distribution (“Distribution Plan”) and how to submit any
comments regarding the Distribution Plan to the Commission’s Office of the Secretary.
On March 16, 2006, the Commission, finding that the Distribution Plan was an
appropriate distribution of the disgorgement and penalty amounts paid by Huntington
Bancshares, Inc., Thomas E. Hoaglin, Michael J. McMennamin, and John Van Fleet, CPA,
pursuant to the settled administrative proceeding and settled civil action filed June 2, 2005,
issued an order approving the Distribution Plan. The Commission further ordered the
appointment of Nancy R. Grunberg of the law firm Venable LLP as the Administrator of the
Distribution Plan (“Plan Administrator”). Although the March 16, 2006 Order stated that the
Commission received one comment on the Distribution Plan, it was subsequently determined
that the comment had been intended for a different distribution plan. Accordingly, no comments
were received concerning the Distribution Plan.
The Distribution Plan required that within 90 days of its approval by the Commission, the
Plan Administrator seek to amend the Distribution Plan to specify the procedures to be used to
identify and locate Claimants, provide notice to Claimants, verify Claimants’ claims, make and
approve claims and handle disputed claims, set a cut-off date for the submission of claims, and

calculate Claimants’ pro rata shares. The Plan Administrator subsequently filed a Modified Plan
of Distribution (“Modified Plan”) in which it amended certain definitions in the Distribution
Plan, such as claimant and pro rata share, and set forth additional information regarding the
procedures to be used to distribute the Fund.
On August 15, 2006, the Commission published a “Notice of Modified Plan of
Disgorgement Fund” (“Notice”) providing an opportunity for comment by non-parties in
connection with this proceeding pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund
and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1103. The Notice advised interested parties how to
obtain a copy of the Modified Plan and how to submit any comments regarding the distribution
to the Commission’s Office of the Secretary. No comments were received.
The Commission, having reviewed the Modified Plan, finds that it properly supplements
the original Distribution Plan by providing more detail concerning the claims process.
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Rule 1105(g) of the Commission’s Rules on
Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1105, that the Modified Plan is approved.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Nancy M. Morris
Secretary
