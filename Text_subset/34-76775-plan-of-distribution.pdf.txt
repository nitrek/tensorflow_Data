SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-15471

In the Matter of
SARKAUSKAS AND
ASSOCIATES, INC. and
JAMES M. SARKAUSKAS
Respondents.

PROPOSED PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
1.
Purpose and Background. This proposed Plan of Distribution (the “Plan”) has
been developed pursuant to Rule 1101 of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and
Disgorgement Plans (“Rules”), 17 C.F.R. § 201.1101. The Plan proposes a distribution of the
funds collected from Sarkauskas and Associates, Inc. (“the Adviser”) and James M. Sarkauskas
(“Sarkauskas”) (collectively, “Respondents”) to investors who were charged unnecessary
transaction fees from their respective accounts.
On September 13, 2013, the Commission issued a settled cease and desist and
administrative proceeding order 1 (“Order”) related to a fraudulent scheme perpetrated by
Respondents. Respondents purchased for their clients unit investment trust (“UIT”) units that
included transactional sales charges (“loads”) without disclosing that identical no-load UIT units
could be purchased. The Order stated that Respondents’ failure to disclose this information
resulted in their substantially increasing their compensation at the expense of their clients, which
created a conflict of interest. As a result of this conduct, the Commission’s order found that
Respondents willfully violated Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of
1940 (“Advisers Act”).
The Order required Respondents to cease and desist from committing or causing any
violations and any future violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act. The
Order barred Sarkauskas from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal
securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating
organization, prohibited him from serving or acting as an employee, officer, director, member of
an advisory board, investment adviser or depositor of, or principal underwriter for, a registered
investment company or affiliated person of such investment adviser, depositor, or principal

underwriter, and barred him from participating in any offering of a penny stock, including: acting
as a promoter, finder, consultant, agent or other person who engages in activities with a broker,
dealer or issuer for purposes of the issuance or trading in any penny stock, or inducing or
attempting to induce the purchase or sale of any penny stock. Respondents also were ordered to
pay disgorgement of $331,433.98 and prejudgment interest of $18,403.22, and Sarkauskas was
ordered to pay a civil money penalty of $100,000.
In accordance with the Order, Respondents paid a total of $449,837.20 in disgorgement,
prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties to the Commission.
The Order created a Fair Fund pursuant Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, as amended, for the funds paid by the Respondents (the “Fair Fund”). The Fair Fund is
subject to the continuing jurisdiction and control of the Commission and the Fair Fund is
currently on deposit in a Commission designated interest-bearing account at the United States
Department of the Treasury (“U.S. Treasury”). The Plan is subject to approval by the
Commission, and the Commission retains jurisdiction over the implementation of the Plan.
Under the Plan, the Fair Fund, less any reserve for taxes, fees or other expenses of
administering the Plan (the “Net Fair Fund”), will be distributed to eligible investors as defined
in paragraph 6 below. It is anticipated that there will be one disbursement to the eligible
investors.
2.
Fund Administrator. On May 21, 2015 the Commission appointed Rust
Consulting, Inc. as Fund Administrator and set its bond at $449,837.20 as required by Rules
1105(a) and 1105(c) of the Commission’s Rules. 2 The Fund Administrator will, among other
things: oversee the administration of the Fair Fund, confirm mailing information for the eligible
investors as defined in paragraph 6 below, distribute money from the assets of the Fair Fund in
accordance with the Plan, resolve disputes, prepare a final accounting with assistance from the
tax administrator, and provide the tax administrator with funds to pay tax liabilities and tax
compliance fees and costs, pursuant to the Omnibus Order Directing the Appointment of Tax
Administrator in Administrative Proceedings that Establish Distribution Funds. 3
3.
Qualified Settlement Fund. The Fair Fund constitutes a Qualified Settlement
Fund (“QSF”) under Section 468B(g) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 468B(g), and
related regulations, 26 C.F.R. §§ 1.468B-1 through 1.468B-5.
4.
Tax Administrator. The Commission has appointed Damasco and Associates,
LLP as the Tax Administrator (“Tax Administrator”) of the Fair Fund. 4 The Fund
Administrator will cooperate with the Tax Administrator in providing information necessary
to accomplish income tax compliance of the QSF. The Tax Administrator will be
compensated for all reasonable costs and expenses from the Fair Fund in accordance with its

3

2

2013-2015 Engagement Letter Agreement with the Commission. The Fair Fund’s taxes will
be paid out of the Fair Fund.
5.
Escrow Bank. The Fund Administrator shall establish with the Escrow Bank
(“Bank”) an escrow account pursuant to an escrow agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”) to be
provided by the staff of the Commission, in the name of and bearing the Employer Identification
Number (“EIN”) of the QSF (the “Escrow Account”). The Fund Administrator shall also
establish with the Bank a separate deposit account (e.g. controlled distribution account, managed
distribution account, linked checking and investment account) for the purpose of funding
distribution payments to be distributed to eligible investors by the Fund Administrator pursuant
to the Plan. The name of each account shall be in the following form: Sarkauskas Fair Fund.
During the term of the Escrow Agreement, if invested, the Escrow Account shall
be invested and reinvested in short-term U.S. Treasury securities backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States Government or an agency thereof, of a type and term necessary to
meet the cash liquidity requirements for payments to eligible investors, tax obligations, and/or
fees of the Tax Administrator and/or Fund Administrator, including investment or reinvestment
in a bank account insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to the
guaranteed FDIC limit, or in money market mutual funds registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 that invest 100% of their assets in direct obligations of the United States
government. The Fund Administrator shall provide duplicate original bank and/or investment
statements on any accounts established by the Fund Administrator to the Tax Administrator on a
monthly basis and shall assist the Tax Administrator in obtaining mid-cycle statements, as
necessary.
All Fair Fund checks presented for payment or electronic transfer will be subject to
“positive pay” controls before being honored by the Bank, and all such checks issued to eligible
investors by the Fund Administrator shall bear a stale date of ninety (90) days. Accordingly,
checks that are not negotiated within this ninety (90) day period shall be voided and the issuing
financial institution shall be instructed to stop payment on those checks, and the funds will
remain assets of the Fair Fund. If a check reissue has been requested before the stale date, such
request will be honored and the reissued check will bear a stale date of thirty (30) days. Check
reissue requests will not be honored after 90 days from the original check issuance date without
consultation with and direction given to reissue by Commission staff. For any electronic
payment, the exact amount necessary to make a payment shall be transferred from the Escrow
Account directly to the payee bank account in accordance with written instruction provided to
the Escrow Bank by the Fund Administrator.
6.
Specification of Eligible Investors. Eligible investors are persons who invested
with the Advisor and who suffered a loss due to the Advisor and Sarkauskas making purchases
with unnecessary transactional sales charges (“Eligible Investors”).
7.
No claims-made process. The Fair Fund is not being distributed according to a
claims-made process, so the procedures for providing notice and for making and approving
claims are not applicable.

8.
Methodology for Determining Distribution Amounts. The Commission staff
determined the amount to be distributed to each Eligible Investor as follows:
a. The staff totaled the dollar amount each Eligible Investor was overcharged for
every transaction that Respondents made on their behalf. Each trade should have cost
$18. The staff considered any additional commissions/fees paid to either Sarkauskas or
Western International (“Western”), a third party broker-dealer, an overcharge. The total
of the overcharges for each Eligible Investor is the dollar value of the harm (“Harm”)
each Eligible Investor incurred.
b. Because sufficient funds may be available to compensate Eligible Investors for
the time value of money on their Harm, the staff calculated the amount of lost interest
earnings (“Lost Interest Earnings”) on the Harm for each Eligible Investor by doing the
following:
1. Calculating the Harm on each transaction as described in 8.a. above;
2. Calculating the present value of Harm on each transaction by applying
the interest rate on short term U.S. treasury securities and
compounding monthly;
3. Summing the present value of Harm across all transactions for each
Eligible Investor to arrive at total present value harm (“Harm PV”) for
that Eligible Investor;
4. The difference between each Eligible Investor’s Harm PV and Harm is
the Lost Interest Earnings.
c. Because the Fair Fund ($449,837.20), prior to subtracting any fees, taxes, or
other expenses of administering the Plan, currently exceeds the sum of all Eligible
Investors’ Harm PV (“Total Harm PV”) of $367,417, the estimated net distribution for
each Eligible Investor (“Estimated Net Distribution”) is anticipated to be equal to each
Eligible Investor’s Harm PV. Any funds remaining in the Fair Fund following
disbursements to Eligible Investors will be transferred to the U.S. Treasury.
d. If, however, should the Fair Fund minus any fees, taxes, or other expenses of
administering the Plan be less than the Total Harm PV 5, the Estimated Net Distribution
Amount will be calculated as follows:
1. Dividing each Eligible Investor’s Harm PV by the Total Harm PV to
obtain a pro rata share (“Pro Rata Share”);
5

The staff provides this alternative method of calculating the Eligible Investor’s Estimated Net Distribution if, for
any reason, the total of fees, taxes, and other expenses of administering the Plan exceeds $82,420.20, which would
reduce the current Fair Fund below the Total Harm PV of $367,417. Thus, a pro rata calculation would be required.

4

2. Multiply each Eligible Investor’s Pro Rata Share by the Fair Fund
minus any fees, taxes, or other expenses of administering the Plan.
In the view of the staff and Fund Administrator, this methodology constitutes a fair and
reasonable allocation of the Fair Fund to compensate an Eligible Investor’s harm. Based on this
methodology, it is anticipated that there will be one distribution to Eligible Investors, which will
take place as outlined in paragraph 10 below.
The Eligible Investor’s Harm PV, Pro Rata Share, and estimated net distribution for each
Eligible Investor are as follows:

Procedures for Locating and Notifying Eligible Investors. Based on information
obtained by the Commission staff during its investigation and the review and analysis of
applicable records, Commission staff has identified one hundred and eleven (111) Eligible
Investors. Within thirty (30) days of the Commission’s approval of the Plan, the Fund
Administrator will send each Eligible Investor a notice by electronic mail, United States Postal
Service, or other mail delivery service regarding the Commission’s approval of the Plan,
including, as appropriate, a statement characterizing the distribution, a link to the Plan on the
Commission’s Information for Harmed Investors page and instructions for requesting a copy of
the Plan, the number assigned that Eligible Investor on the chart in order to determine his or her
Harm PV (as defined in paragraph 8) and Estimated Net Distribution amount (as defined in
paragraph 8), a description of the tax information reporting and other related tax matters, and the
name of the Fund Administrator to contact with questions regarding the distribution (the “Plan
Notice”). Eligible Investors will be asked to respond and provide documentation only if they
disagree with the Estimated Net Distribution amount, which is defined in paragraph 8 and will be
printed on their notice, or need to make a change to the account name. The Fund Administrator
will coordinate with the Tax Administrator to request contact and other information from each
Eligible Investor that is needed to accomplish the distribution in accordance with applicable tax
requirements relating to the Fair Fund.
If a Plan Notice is returned as undeliverable within sixty (60) days of the Commission’s
approval of the Plan, the Fund Administrator will make all reasonable efforts to ascertain an
Eligible Investor’s correct address. The Fund Administrator will then resend the Plan Notice to
the Eligible Investor’s new address within thirty (30) days of receipt of the returned Plan Notice.
If the Plan Notice is returned again, the Eligible Investor will be removed (“Removed Eligible
Investor”) from the distribution and that particular Removed Eligible Investor’s Estimated Net
Distribution amount (as defined in paragraph 8) will be added to the Net Fair Fund (as defined in
paragraph 1).
8

In no event will an Eligible Investor receive a distribution payment that exceeds the
amount of his or her Harm PV. The disposition of any funds remaining in the Net Fair Fund (as
defined in paragraph 1) that cannot be distributed for any reason is described in paragraph 17
below and will be reported in the final accounting.
10.
Distribution Timing. The Fund Administrator will use their best efforts to start
the Commission disbursement process within one hundred and fifty (150) days of the Plan’s
approval.
11.
Validation and Approval of Disbursement of the Fair Fund. The Fair Fund
disbursement to Eligible Investors will be implemented by the Commission and payments will be
disbursed by the Fund Administrator. The Fund Administrator will compile the payee
information and prepare a payment file in a format approved by Commission staff for submission
to the Commission. Checks will be mailed or distribution payments will be electronically
transferred to each Eligible Investor by the Fund Administrator working with Commission staff.
Pursuant to Rule 1101(b)(6), the Commission staff will obtain an order from the Commission to
disburse the Fair Fund.
The Fund Administrator will monitor uncashed checks, any returned items due to nondelivery, insufficient addresses, and/or other deficiencies. The Fund Administrator is responsible
for researching and reconciling errors and reissuing payments when possible. The Fund
Administrator also is responsible for accounting for all payments. Checks issued by the Fund
Administrator will state on their face that they are valid for 90 days. Accordingly, checks that
are not negotiated within this period shall be voided and the issuing institution shall be instructed
to stop payment on these checks.
12.
Expenses of Administration. Fees and other expenses of administering the Plan
will be paid from the Fair Fund.
13.
Reports. The Fund Administrator will provide Commission staff with a progress
report within twenty (20) days after the end of each quarter and a final report with a final
accounting once the distribution is complete.
14.
Amendments and Procedural Deadline Extensions. The Fund Administrator will
take reasonable and appropriate steps to distribute funds from the Net Fair Fund according to the
Plan. If there are any changes to the Plan that are determined to be material, Commission
approval is required prior to implementation by amending the Plan, which may be done upon the
motion of any party, the Fund Administrator, or upon the Commission’s own motion.
Immaterial changes may be made by the Fund Administrator with approval by Commission staff.
For good cause shown, the Fund Administrator may extend any of the procedural dates set forth
in the Plan with approval of Commission staff.
15.
Procedures to Request Plan Notice. A person that does not receive a Plan Notice
and believes that he or she should have received a Plan Notice after becoming aware of the Plan
(e.g., through other Eligible Investors or on www.sec.gov) must submit documentation to the
9

Fund Administrator to establish that the individual is in fact eligible to receive a Plan Notice
within seventy-five (75) days after the Commission’s approval of the Plan. The Fund
Administrator will contact the individual within twenty-one (21) days of receiving the
individual’s documentation with a determination of his or her eligibility if the Fund
Administrator determines, after consulting with the Commission staff, that the individual should
have received a Plan Notice.
16.
Disputes will be limited to calculations of disbursement amounts to Eligible
Investors. Within thirty (30) days of the date that an Eligible Investor’s disbursement is made,
the Fund Administrator must receive a written communication detailing the dispute along with
any supporting documentation. The Fund Administrator will investigate the dispute, and such
investigation will include a review of the written dispute as well as any supporting
documentation. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of the written dispute, the Fund Administrator
will notify the Eligible Investor of its resolution of the dispute, which shall be final. This
procedure will be set forth in the Plan Notice.
17.
Disposition of Undistributed Funds. Amounts remaining after distribution of the
Net Fair Fund to Eligible Investors has occurred may include but are not limited to: funds
reserved for future taxes and related expenses; funds from checks that have not been cashed, that
were not delivered or that were returned to the Commission; and tax refunds for overpayment or
for waiver of IRS penalties. All funds remaining in the Net Fair Fund will be transferred to the
U.S. Treasury after the final accounting (as described in paragraph 18 below) is approved by the
Commission.
18.
Final Accounting, Discharge of the Fund Administrator, and Termination of the
Fair Fund. Following the distribution of the Net Fair Fund to Eligible Investors, the Fund
Administrator will make arrangements for the final payment of taxes and Tax Administrator fees
and will submit a final accounting of all monies received, earned, spent, and distributed in
connection with the administration of the Plan, and a request for approval of any unpaid taxes,
fees and/or expenses to the Commission. The final accounting will be in a format provided by
Commission staff. Commission staff will submit the final accounting for approval. When the
Commission has approved the final accounting, staff will seek an order from the Commission:
(1) to transfer the remaining funds to the U.S. Treasury; (2) to discharge the Fund Administrator;
and (3) to terminate the Fair Fund.
