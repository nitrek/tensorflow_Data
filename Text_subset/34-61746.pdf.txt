Respondents.

On September 19, 2007, the Commission instituted settled administrative proceedings against
Evergreen Investment Management Company, LLC ("EIMCO"), Evergreen Investment Services, Inc.
("EIS"), Evergreen Service Company, LLC ("ESC"), and Wachovia Securities, LLC ("Wachovia
Securities") in connection with the market timing of Evergreen mutual funds. See Order Instituting
Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings pursuant to Sections 15(b)(4), 17A(c)(3) and 21C of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Sections 203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,
and Sections 9(b) and 9(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing
Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order as to Evergreen Investment Management Company,
LLC, Evergreen Investment Services, Inc., Evergreen Service Company, LLC and Wachovia Securities,
LLC, Admin. Proc. File No. 3-12805, Exchange Act Release No. 56462 (September 19, 2007)
(“Evergreen Order”). Also on September 19, 2007, the Commission instituted settled administrative
proceedings against William M. Ennis in connection with the market timing of one Evergreen mutual
fund. See Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings, and
Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to Sections 15(b)(6) and
17A(c)(4)(C) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Sections 203(f) and 203(k) of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 and Sections 9(b) and 9(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 as to William M.
Ennis, Admin Proc. File No. 3-12806, Exchange Act Release No. 56464 (September 19, 2007) ("Ennis
Order"). Among other things, the Evergreen Order and the Ennis Order required EIMCO, EIS, ESC,
Wachovia Securities, and Ennis to pay a total of $28,503,280 in disgorgement and $4,150,000 in civil
penalties. The Evergreen Order further required EIMCO to retain an independent distribution consultant
(“IDC”), not unacceptable to the staff, to develop a distribution plan for the Fair Fund. EIMCO has

retained Kenneth Lehn, Ph.D., as the IDC, and has submitted the Distribution Plan to the Division of
Enforcement, which has filed the plan with the Commission.
Dr. Lehn has proposed that Rust Consulting, Inc. be appointed as the Fund Administrator and that
Rust Consulting not be required to post a bond generally required under Fair Fund Rule 1105(e). With
respect to the bond, Dr. Lehn has noted that the Plan incorporates several layers of protection for the Fair
Fund. Among other things, under the Plan: (1) the Fund Administrator will have no custody, and only
limited control, of the Fair Fund; (2) the Fair Fund will be held by the U.S. Treasury Department's
Bureau of the Public Debt until immediately before transmittal of checks or electronic transfers to
eligible investors; (3) upon transfer from the U.S. Treasury, funds will be held in an escrow account,
separate from the assets of the Escrow Bank, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, until presentation
of a check or electronic transfer, at which time funds will be transferred to a controlled distribution
account; (4) presented checks or electronic transfers will be subject to “positive pay” controls before
being honored by the Escrow Bank; and (5) both the Escrow Bank and the Fund Administrator will
maintain, throughout this process, insurance and/or a financial institution bond that covers errors and
omissions, misfeasance and fraud.
The Division of Enforcement proposes that the Commission appoint Rust Consulting as the Fund
Administrator of the Distribution Plan as proposed by the Plan, and waive the bond requirement of the
Fund Administrator for the good cause shown in the Plan.
Accordingly, pursuant to Rules 1105(a) and (c) of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and
Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1105, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Rust Consulting is
appointed as the Fund Administrator in accordance with the terms of the Distribution Plan and that the
bond requirement is waived for good cause shown.
By the Commission.
