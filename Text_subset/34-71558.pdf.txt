until April 21, 2014 to submit a Proposed Plan of Distribution under Rule 1101(a) of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 CFR 201.1101(a).
On December 18, 2013, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative

and civil money penalties into an escrow account and created a Fair Fund pursuant to Section

Order on December 17, 2013.
In its request for an extension of time, the Division states that additional time is needed
to finalize the plan of distribution.
Accordingly, for good cause shown, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Division’s
request for an extension of time until April 21, 2014 to submit a Proposed Plan of Distribution
is granted.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.
