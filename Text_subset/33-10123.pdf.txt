In the Matter of

ORDER GRANTING PETITIONS FOR
REVIEW AND SCHEDULING BRIEFS

EQUITY TRUST COMPANY

On July 18, 2016, the Division of Enforcement (“Enforcement”) filed a petition for
review of an administrative law judge’s initial decision dismissing this proceeding against
respondent Equity Trust Company (“Equity Trust”).1 The order instituting proceedings (“OIP”)
alleged that Equity Trust, a custodian of “self-directed” individual retirement accounts, was
liable for causing violations of Section 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 by two
individuals who referred customers to Equity Trust.2 The initial decision found that the two
individuals committed primary violations of Section 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) and that Equity Trust
engaged in acts or omissions that were a cause of the violations but that the requirement that
Equity Trust knew or should have known that its conduct would contribute to the violations was
unproven.3 In its petition for review, the Division argues that the initial decision “was wrong and
should be reversed.” Specifically, the Division contends that unless it is reversed the initial
decision “will stand for the proposition that the conduct of Equity Trust, which was at least
negligent and which endangered investor funds, is without consequences.”
On July 28, 2016, Equity Trust filed a cross-petition for review. Equity Trust “urges the
Commission to deny the Division’s petition.” But if the Commission grants the Division’s
petition Equity Trust asks that the Commission also grant its cross-petition. Despite prevailing
below, Equity Trust states that it takes exception to certain specific findings and conclusions of
the initial decision. Specifically, Equity Trust argues that the initial decision erred in finding that
there were primary violations of Section 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3), that Equity Trust’s conduct was a
cause of the violations, and that the Division did not have to prove that Equity Trust acted with
scienter.

Rule of Practice 410(a) provides that, “[i]n any proceeding in which an initial decision is
made by a hearing officer, any party, and any other person who would have been entitled to
judicial review of the decision entered therein if the Commission itself had made the decision,
may file a petition for review of the decision with the Commission.”4 Rule of Practice 410(b)
provides that “[i]n the event a petition for review is filed, any other party to the proceeding may
file a cross-petition for review . . . .”5 And Rule of Practice 411(b)(2) provides that, in
“determining whether to grant review, the Commission shall consider whether the petition for
review makes a reasonable showing” of at least one of the following things:
(i) a prejudicial error was committed in the in the conduct of the proceeding; or
(ii) the decision embodies:
(A) a finding or conclusion or material fact that is clearly erroneous; or
(B) a conclusion of law that is erroneous; or
(C) an exercise of discretion or decision of law or policy that is important
and that the Commission should review.6
Based on the standards set forth in Rule 411(b)(2), it appears, under the particular facts of this
case, appropriate to grant both petitions for review.7
Pursuant to Commission Rule of Practice 411, the Division’s petition for review and
Equity Trust’s cross-petition for review are GRANTED. Pursuant to Rule of Practice 411(d), the
Commission will determine what sanctions, if any, are appropriate in this matter.8
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Rule of Practice 450(a),9 that briefs be filed
as follows:

exceed 16,000 words, by September 15, 2016.
