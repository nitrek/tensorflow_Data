I.

On September 14, 2006, pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1103, the Commission
published a Notice of Proposed Plan and Opportunity for Comment (“Notice”) for the distribution
of monies placed into a Fair Fund in the above-captioned matter. The Notice invited public
comment on the proposed distribution plan through October 16, 2006.
On November 13, 2006, the Commission entered an order, for good cause shown, to
extend the thirty-day time period provided in Rule 1104 for entry of an order approving or

disapproving the plan by ninety days, to February 13, 2007.1 The Commission believes that,
because of additional issues which have arisen in connection with the plan, including issues
relating to the distribution of certain funds from other market timing matters through the plan,
further evaluation, review and analysis are required, and therefore good cause has been shown to
extend the time period provided in Rule 1104 for entry of an order approving or disapproving the
plan by an additional ninety days, to May 14, 2007.
II.
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that:
Pursuant to Rule 1104 of the Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans,
17 C.F.R. § 201.1104, for good cause shown, the time for entering an Order approving or
disapproving the proposed distribution plan is extended to May 14, 2007.

By the Commission.

Rule 1104 of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1104,

provides:
At any time after 30 days following publication of notice of a proposed plan of disgorgement or of
a proposed Fair Fund plan, the Commission shall, by order, approve, approve with modifications,
or disapprove the proposed plan. In the discretion of the Commission, a proposed plan that is
substantially modified prior to adoption may be republished for an additional comment period
pursuant to 17 CFR 201.1103. The order approving or disapproving the plan should be entered
within 30 days after the end of the final period allowed for comments on the proposed plan unless
the Commission or the hearing officer, by written order, allows a longer period for good cause
shown.
Thirty-days from the end of the final period for comments on the proposed distribution plan lapsed on
November 15, 2006. Because of the complexity of the comments received, further evaluation, review and
analysis was required, and good cause was shown to extend the thirty day time period provided in Rule
1104 for entry of an order approving or disapproving the plan by ninety days, to February 13, 2007.
