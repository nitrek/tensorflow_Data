EXTENSION ORDER

The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has requested an extension of time, until
July 26, 2013, to submit a proposed Plan of Distribution under Rule 1101(a) of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans.
In its first request, the Division stated that since the issuance of the Commission’s
Orders dated July 18, 2012, relating to the above-referenced Respondents’ willful violations
of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940 (Securities Act Release Nos. 9340, 9341, and 9339 (July 18, 2012)), and the July
26, 2012, entry of the Final Judgment by the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York against Mizuho Securities USA Inc. for its willful violations of Sections
17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (SEC v. Mizuho Securities USA Inc., 12-cv5550 (MGC) (S.D.N.Y. July 26, 2012)), it had begun to analyze the feasibility of a potential
distribution. After further deliberations, the Division has now determined that it requires an
additional extension of time to continue its analysis and consultations regarding the potential
distribution of the funds paid by Respondents.

Accordingly, for good cause shown, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Division’s
request for an extension of time until July 26, 2013, is granted.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Elizabeth M. Murphy
Secretary
