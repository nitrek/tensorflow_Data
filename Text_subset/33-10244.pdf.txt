In the Matter of
LARRY C. GROSSMAN

ORDER GRANTING PARTIAL STAY
On September 30, 2016, the Commission issued an opinion and order (the “Opinion”)
finding that Larry C. Grossman, the founder and former owner and principal of Sovereign
International Asset Management, Inc. (“Sovereign”), a registered investment adviser, violated
antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and aided and abetted and was a cause of
Sovereign’s violations. Grossman did not dispute his liability, but contended that sanctions were
prohibited by the five-year statute of limitations under 28 U.S.C. § 2462 and were otherwise
inappropriate. The Commission concluded that the statute of limitations barred the imposition of
civil penalties, but did not prohibit an industry bar, cease-and-desist order, and disgorgement.
The Commission barred Grossman from the securities industry, imposed a cease-and-desist
order, and ordered Grossman to pay disgorgement of $3,004,180.65, plus prejudgment interest.1
Grossman now moves for a stay of the obligation to pay disgorgement plus prejudgment
interest pending judicial review. The Commission considers the following four factors in
determining whether to grant a stay: (i) whether there is a strong likelihood that the moving
party will succeed on the merits of its appeal; (ii) whether the moving party will suffer

irreparable harm without a stay; (iii) whether any person will suffer substantial harm as a result
of a stay; and (iv) whether a stay is likely to serve the public interest.2 The party seeking a stay
has the burden of establishing that relief is warranted.3
Grossman has not established a strong likelihood that he will succeed on the merits of his
appeal. His main argument is that the Eleventh Circuit held in SEC v. Graham4 that
“disgorgement is subject to Section 2462’s five-year statute of limitations”; that “the Eleventh
Circuit is not required to give deference to the Commission’s interpretation of Section 2462”;
and that “the Commission’s refusal to follow the law within the Eleventh Circuit knowing that
[he] would appeal any adverse decision to such circuit amounts to willful nonacquiescence.”
This argument lacks merit because the Commission did not willfully nonacquiesce in the
Eleventh Circuit’s decision in Graham.
The Opinion was not decided on the basis that Graham erred in construing the term
“forfeiture” in Section 2462, which led the court to conclude that “Section 2462’s statute of
limitations applies to disgorgement” because “forfeiture and disgorgement are effectively
synonymous.”5 Rather, the Opinion interpreted the term “disgorgement” in the Securities
Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 (the “Remedies Act”).6 After
explaining that the Remedies Act authorizes the Commission “to ‘enter an order’ in an
administrative cease-and-desist proceeding for ‘accounting and disgorgement’” and “to ‘adopt
. . . orders concerning such . . . matters as it deems appropriate to implement’” its authority to
order disgorgement,7 the Opinion concluded that “disgorgement is an equitable in personam
remedy distinct from and not equivalent to what courts have held to be the punitive in rem
sanction of ‘forfeiture’ to which Section 2462 applies.”8
Disgorgement, the Opinion held, “is an equitable remedy that imposes a personal liability
on a defendant in the amount of his ill-gotten gains ‘regardless whether he retains the self-same
proceeds of his wrongdoing.’”9 Yet Graham’s construction of the term “forfeiture” relied on

dictionaries that defined forfeiture as “‘the divesting of the ownership of particular property.’”10
Because this definition was “inconsistent with [the Commission’s] interpretation of
disgorgement as an obligation to return a sum equal to the ill-gotten gains rather than a
requirement to replevy a specific asset,” the Opinion respectfully disagreed with Graham’s
conclusion that disgorgement was a forfeiture subject to Section 2462.11
In so doing, the Opinion cited National Cable & Television Association v. Brand X
Internet Services.12 The Supreme Court in Brand X held that “a court’s prior interpretation of a
statute” may “override an agency’s interpretation only if the relevant court decision held the
statute unambiguous.”13 Graham did not hold that the meaning of disgorgement was
unambiguous.14 In this situation, an agency’s decision to construe a statutory term “differently
from a court does not say that the court’s holding was legally wrong.”15 “Instead, the agency
may, consistent with the court’s holding, choose a different construction, since the agency
remains the authoritative interpreter (within the limits of reason) of such statutes.”16 The
Opinion was therefore not an exercise in nonacquiescence; the Commission did not refuse to
accept Graham’s interpretation of forfeiture but rather provided its authoritative interpretation of
disgorgement and concluded that under that interpretation disgorgement did not fit within
Graham’s definition of forfeiture.
Grossman is wrong to characterize the Opinion as “amount[ing] to willful
nonacquiescence” for another reason: Grossman states that he will appeal to the Eleventh
Circuit, but the Commission did not know where he would file an appeal at the time it issued the
Opinion. The Opinion noted that Grossman could appeal to either the Eleventh Circuit or the
D.C. Circuit.17 As a result, the Commission issued the Opinion “without knowing in advance
which court of appeals will consider any petition for review that may be filed.”18

Grossman protests that this is implausible and cites the D.C. Circuit’s recent decision in
Heartland Plymouth Court MI, LLC v. NLRB.19 In Heartland, the court stated that “when a
case’s facts result in only two venue choices for the party appealing the adverse order, and one
circuit’s precedent is in agreement with the agency’s legal interpretation while the other is
adverse to it, the agency knows any appeal will be to the adverse circuit.”20 The Commission
had no such knowledge here. Although the D.C. Circuit’s precedent is in agreement with the
Commission’s legal interpretation of disgorgement,21 disgorgement is not the only remedy that
Grossman contended was time-barred under the statute of limitations. Grossman argued that
Section 2462 prevented the Commission from barring him from the securities industry under the
D.C. Circuit’s decision in Johnson v. SEC.22 The Opinion held that Section 2462 does not apply
to an industry bar; it relied in part on Eleventh Circuit precedent holding that Section 2462 does
not apply to equitable remedies such as injunctive relief, and reasoned that an industry bar is a
species of injunctive relief.23 Accordingly, the Commission had no basis to know whether
Grossman was more likely to pursue on appeal his challenge to disgorgement under Graham or
to a bar from the securities industry under Johnson; it therefore had no basis to know the court to
which he was likely to appeal.
Additional considerations distinguish the Opinion from the D.C. Circuit’s decision in
Heartland. That decision stated that nonacquiescence is permissible because “opposing adverse
circuit decisions permits [an agency] to bring national . . . questions to Supreme Court
resolution.” Venue uncertainty aside, therefore, the D.C. Circuit stated that “proper
nonacquiescence” requires both that after an issue has “‘percolat[ed]’ among the circuits” the
agency seeks Supreme Court review, and that the agency is forthright in its nonacquiescence.24
The D.C. Circuit faulted the NLRB for nonacquiescing in its precedent rather than seeking
certiorari because its own precedent had been adverse to the agency’s “for almost a quarter
century” and a circuit split had already “engulf[ed] most circuits.”25 Conversely, the Eleventh
Circuit issued Graham only months before the Opinion issued, Graham was the first court of
appeals decision to hold that Section 2462 applies to disgorgement, and the majority of circuits

See Johnson v. SEC, 87 F.3d 484, 490 (D.C. Cir. 1996). Grossman also relied on a Fifth
Circuit decision that purported to follow Johnson in holding that an officer-and-director bar was
punitive, and therefore subject to Section 2462, “in light of the minimal likelihood” of recurring
misconduct and the “severe” consequences of such a bar. SEC v. Bartek, 484 F. App’x 949, 957
(5th Cir. 2012). Grossman could not appeal the Opinion to the Fifth Circuit.

have not addressed the issue.26 In Heartland, the D.C. Circuit also faulted the NLRB for
“pretend[ing] there is no conflict between its Order and our law.”27 But in the Opinion the
Commission stated explicitly that it “disagree[s]” with Graham.28 The Opinion does not amount
to willful nonacquiescence.
In addition to failing to establish a likelihood of success on the merits, Grossman has not
shown irreparable injury absent a stay. He concedes “that the financial hardship of” paying
disgorgement plus prejudgment interest “do[es] not rise to the level of irreparable harm.”
Indeed, the Commission has held repeatedly that “financial detriment does not amount to
irreparable harm.”29 Yet Grossman claims that “the consequences of his inability to pay if the
Commission sought to enforce the Monetary Sanctions, namely contempt and potential
incarceration, is an irreparable harm that could be circumvented upon the issuance of a stay
pending appeal.” A respondent claiming an inability to pay disgorgement ordinarily bears the
“burden of proving financial inability to pay.”30 Grossman has offered nothing more than a
conclusory assertion about the “financial hardship” he faces.
The first two factors under the traditional standard for evaluating stay requests “are the
most critical.”31 Grossman does not address the remaining two factors.32 Accordingly, we find
that none of the four factors militates in favor of a stay.
Nonetheless, the Commission has at times stayed monetary sanctions pending appeal
without reference to the applicant’s likelihood of success on the merits or the other components

But see SEC v. Kokesh, 834 F.3d 1158, 2016 WL 4437585, at *6 (10th Cir. Aug. 23,
2016) (holding that disgorgement is not a forfeiture within the meaning of Section 2462),
petition for cert. filed, No. 16-529 (Oct. 18, 2016); Riordan v. SEC, 627 F.3d 1230, 1234-34 &
n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (same). The D.C. Circuit recognized that an agency “may also petition a
circuit to reconsider its adverse precedent via en banc review.” Heartland, 2016 WL 5485145,
at *4 n.5. Nonetheless, the court noted that “where a precedent has been reaffirmed multiple
times” there “is little or no reason for the agency to conclude the circuit is open to revisiting its
precedent.” Id. Unlike in Heartland, Graham has not yet been reaffirmed once let alone
multiple times.

of the four-factor test.33 Under the circumstances and as a matter of discretion, we elect to stay
the requirement in the Opinion that Grossman pay disgorgement plus prejudgment interest,
pending the filing of a petition for review with a United States Court of Appeals and, upon the
timely filing of such a petition, pending the determination of that appeal.
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that the requirement in the Opinion that Grossman pay
disgorgement plus prejudgment interest is stayed for sixty days from September 30, 2016,
pending the filing of a petition for review with a United States Court of Appeals and, upon the
timely filing of such a petition, pending determination of that appeal and the issuance of the
court’s mandate. The Opinion remains effective in all other respects.
For the Commission, by the Office of the General Counsel, pursuant to delegated
authority.
