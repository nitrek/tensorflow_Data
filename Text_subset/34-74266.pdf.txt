In the Matter of

ORDER APROVING
PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

On September 19, 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”)
issued an Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order
(“Order”) against JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan”).1 The Order found that JPMorgan
violated federal securities laws when it made material misstatements in its public filings with
the Commission. The Order required JPMorgan to pay a civil money penalty in the amount of
$200,000,000 to the Commission and ordered that such penalty may be distributed pursuant to
Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended.
On March 5, 2014, the Commission issued an Order Establishing a Fair Fund.2 The
Fair Fund has been deposited at the United States Treasury Department’s Bureau of the Fiscal
Service (“BFS”) for investment. Other than potential interest income from the BFS
investment, the Commission does not anticipate that the Fair Fund will receive additional
funds. The assets of the Fair Fund are subject to the continuing jurisdiction and control of the
Commission.
On December 11, 2014, the Commission published a Notice of Proposed Plan of
Distribution and Opportunity for Comment3 (“Notice”) pursuant to Rule 1103 of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans.4 The Notice advised interested
parties that they could obtain a copy of the proposed Plan of Distribution (“Distribution Plan”)
from the Commission’s public website at http://www.sec.gov/litigation/fairfundlist.htm or by
submitting a written request to Susan S. Pecaro, United States Securities and Exchange
Commission, 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549-5631.
The Notice also advised that all persons desiring to comment on the Distribution Plan
could submit their comments, in writing, no later than thirty (30) days from the date of the
Notice: (1) to the Office of the Secretary, United States Securities and Exchange

Commission, 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549-1090; (2) by using the Commission’s
Internet comment form (http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin.shtml); or (3) by sending an
email to rule-comments@sec.gov. The Commission received no comments on the
Distribution Plan.
The Fair Fund is comprised of the $200,000,000 civil money penalty paid by
JPMorgan to the Commission. The Distribution Plan proposes to compensate investors
harmed when JPMorgan failed to disclose accurately in public filings made with the
Commission the true amount of trading losses it suffered in the first quarter of 2012, and the
effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures. As set forth in the Distribution Plan,
beneficial owner investors who will be eligible for a distribution must have (a) purchased
Eligible Securities5 between April 13, 2012 and May 10, 2012, inclusive, and held the shares
of Eligible Securities through May 20, 2012; or (b) purchased Eligible Securities between
April 13, 2012 and May 10, 2012, inclusive, and sold their shares of Eligible Securities
between May 11, 2012 and May 20, 2012, inclusive; or (c) purchased Eligible Securities
between May 11, 2012 and May 20, 2012, inclusive, and held the shares of Eligible Securities
through May 20, 2012; and (d) met all other requirements of the Distribution Plan.
The Division of Enforcement now requests that the Commission approve the
Distribution Plan.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, pursuant to Rule 1104 of the Commission’s
Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans,6 that the Distribution Plan is approved.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Brent J. Fields
Secretary
