On February 6, 2009, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
(“Commission”) issued a Notice of Proposed Plan of Distribution and Opportunity for Comment
(Exchange Act Rel. No. 59368) pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund
and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. §201.1103. The Notice advised parties they could obtain a
copy of the Distribution Plan at www.sec.gov. The Notice also advised that all persons desiring
to comment on the Distribution Plan could submit their comments, in writing, no later than
March 9, 2009. No comments were received by the Commission in response to the Notice. On
May 15, 2009, the Commission issued an Order Approving Plan of Distribution (Exchange Act
Rel. No. 59930).
The Distribution Plan provides that the Commission will arrange for distribution of the
Fair Fund when an electronic payment file listing the payees with the identification information
required to make the distribution has been received and accepted. A validated electronic
payment file has been received and accepted for the disbursement of $6,912.82.

Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the Commission staff shall disburse $6,912.82 from
the Fair Fund to the payee identified in the validated payment file, pursuant to the Distribution
Plan.
By the Commission.
