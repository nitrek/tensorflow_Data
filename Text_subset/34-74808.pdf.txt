In the Matter of

EXTENSION ORDER

The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has requested an extension of time until
August 28, 2015 for entry of an order approving or disapproving the proposed plan of
distribution (“Plan”) that was noticed for public comment on December 23, 2014.
On August 16, 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) issued
an Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A
of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Sections
203(f) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Section 9(b) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-andDesist Order (“Order”) against North East Capital, LLC and Anthony T. Vicidomine
(collectively, “Respondents”).1 The Order found that Vicidomine was the founder and sole
principal of North East Capital, LLC, an unregistered investment adviser and general partner
of the North East Capital Fund LP. The Order further found, among other things, that from
November 2011 through March 2012, Vicidomine misappropriated $189,415 of the North
East Fund’s assets in the form of unearned “incentive fees.” Respondents were ordered to
pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement of $189,415, prejudgment interest of $6,717.04, and a
civil money penalty of $150,000, and have paid $345,911 to the Commission.
The Order created a Fair Fund pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002, as amended, for the funds paid by the Respondents. The Fair Fund is subject to the
continuing jurisdiction and control of the Commission and the Fair Fund has been deposited in
an account at the United States Department of Treasury.

Securities Act Rel. No. 9442 (Aug. 16, 2013).

On December 23, 2014, the Commission published a Notice of Proposed Plan of
Distribution and Opportunity for Comment2 (“Notice”) pursuant to Rule 1103 of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans (“Rules”).3 The Notice advised
that all persons desiring to comment on the Plan could submit their comments, in writing, no
later than thirty (30) days from the date of the Notice. The Commission received two
comments on the Plan, one of which was received after the comment deadline. On February
24, 2015, the Commission issued an order extending the time to issue an order approving or
disapproving the Plan to April 23, 2015.4
In its request for an extension of time, the Division states that it has requested and is
waiting to receive documents from an investor to evaluate whether that investor should be
included in the distribution. The Division has been communicating directly with the investor
on a routine basis to gather information and further evaluate the merits of the investor’s claim.
Further evaluation, analysis and consultation with other offices are also required to properly
address the comments. Consequently, the Division requests that the Commission extend the
time to issue an order approving or disapproving the Plan to August 28, 2015.
Accordingly, for good cause shown, it is hereby ORDERED, pursuant to Rule 1104 of
the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans,5 that the time for entering an
order approving or disapproving the Plan is extended to August 28, 2015.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Secretary
