Application of “Security-Based Swap Dealer” and “Major Security-Based Swap
Participant” Definitions to Cross-Border Security-Based Swap Activities
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Final rules; interpretation.
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or “Commission”) is adopting
rules and providing guidance to address the application of certain provisions of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) that were added by Subtitle B of Title VII of the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”), to cross-border
security-based swap activities. These rules and guidance in large part focus on the application of
the Title VII definitions of “security-based swap dealer” and “major security-based swap
participant” in the cross-border context. The Commission also is adopting a procedural rule
related to the submission of applications for substituted compliance. In addition, the
Commission is adopting a rule addressing the scope of our authority, with respect to enforcement
proceedings, under section 929P of the Dodd-Frank Act.
EFFECTIVE DATE: September 8, 2014.
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Richard Gabbert, Senior Special Counsel,
Joshua Kans, Senior Special Counsel, or Margaret Rubin, Special Counsel, Office of Derivatives
Policy, at 202-551-5870, Division of Trading and Markets, Securities and Exchange
Commission, 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549-7010.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission is adopting the following rules
under the Exchange Act, accompanied by related guidance, regarding the application of Subtitle
B of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act to cross-border activities: Rule 0-13 (filing procedures
regarding substituted compliance requests); Rule 3a67-10 (regarding the cross-border
implementation of the “major security-based swap participant” definition); Rule 3a71-3
(regarding the cross-border implementation of the de minimis exception to the “security-based
swap dealer” definition); Rule 3a71-4 (regarding the cross-border implementation of the
aggregation provisions of the dealer de minimis exception); and Rule 3a71-5 (regarding an
exception, from the dealer de minimis analysis, for certain cleared anonymous transactions). The
Commission is not addressing, as part of this release, certain other rules that we proposed
regarding the application of Subtitle B of Title VII in the cross-border context. The Commission
also is adopting Rule 250.1 to clarify the scope of its antifraud civil law-enforcement authority,
with respect to enforcement proceedings, in the cross-border context.

I. Background
A. Scope of this Rulemaking
The Commission is adopting the first of a series of rules and providing guidance
regarding the application of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act 1 (“Title VII”) to cross-border
security-based swap activities and persons engaged in those activities. 2 This rulemaking
primarily focuses on the application of the de minimis exception to the definition of “securitybased swap dealer” in the cross-border context, and on the application of thresholds related to the
definition of “major security-based swap participant” in the cross-border context. We also are
adopting a procedural rule regarding the submission of “substituted compliance” requests to
allow market participants to satisfy certain Title VII obligations by complying with comparable
foreign regulatory requirements. 3
The rules and guidance we are adopting are based on our May 23, 2013 proposal, which
addressed the application of Title VII in the cross-border context. 4 Aside from addressing the
1

Public Law 111–203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010). Unless otherwise indicated, references to Title VII
in this release are to Subtitle B of Title VII.

2

Consistent with the scope of the final rules as discussed below, the references in this release to the
application of Title VII to “cross-border activities” refer to security-based swap transactions
involving: (i) A U.S. person and a non-U.S. person, or (ii) two non-U.S. persons conducting a
security-based swap transaction that otherwise occurs in relevant part within the United States,
including where performance of one or both counterparties under the security-based swap are
guaranteed by a U.S. person. For purposes of this release only, “cross-border activities” do not
indicate activities involving a transaction between two non-U.S. persons where one or both are
conducting dealing activity within the United States, because, as discussed below, we anticipate
considering this issue in a subsequent release.

3

The procedural rule addresses only the process for submitting such substituted compliance
requests to the Commission. It does not address issues regarding whether substituted compliance
would be available in connection with particular regulatory requirements, and, if so, under what
conditions. We expect to address those matters as part of later rulemakings.

4

See Cross-Border Security-Based Swap Activities; Re-Proposal of Regulation SBSR and Certain
Rules and Forms Relating to the Registration of Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major
Security-Based Swap Participants, Exchange Act Release No. 69490 (May 1, 2013), 78 FR 30968
(May 23, 2013) (“Cross-Border Proposing Release”).

1

definitions and procedural rule noted above, the Cross-Border Proposing Release also addressed
a range of other cross-border issues, including issues regarding the requirements applicable to
dealers and major participants, and requirements relating to mandatory clearing, trade execution,
regulatory reporting, and public dissemination. The Cross-Border Proposing Release stated that
it was possible that we would consider final rules and guidance related to some of those issues in
the adopting releases related to the relevant substantive rulemakings, and that we would address
others in a separate rulemaking. 5
This rulemaking’s focus on the cross-border application of the dealer and major
participant definitions reflects the critical and foundational role that those definitions occupy
with regard to the implementation of Title VII. 6 We expect to address other matters raised by the
Cross-Border Proposing Release as part of subsequent rulemakings, to allow us to consider the
cross-border application of the substantive requirements imposed by Title VII – including the
economic consequences of that cross-border application – in conjunction with the final rules that
will implement those substantive requirements. 7 Market participants are not required to comply
with certain of those Title VII requirements pending the publication of final rules or other
5

See id. at 30974.

6

This rulemaking does not address the requirements under section 5 of the Securities Act
applicable to security-based swap transactions. Security-based swaps, as securities, are subject to
the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.) (“Securities Act”) and the
rules and regulations thereunder applicable to securities. The Securities Act requires that any
offer and sale of a security must either be registered under the Securities Act (see section 5 of the
Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. 77e) or made pursuant to an exemption from registration (see, e.g.,
sections 3 and 4 of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. 77c and 77d, respectively). In addition, the
Securities Act requires that any offer to sell, offer to buy or purchase, or purchase or sale of, a
security-based swap to any person who is not an eligible contract participant must be registered
under the Securities Act (see section 5(e) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. 77e(e)). Because of the
statutory language of section 5(e) of the Securities Act, exemptions from this requirement in
sections 3 and 4 of the Securities Act are not available.

7

Those subsequent rulemakings may make use of definitions of “U.S. person” and certain other
terms that we are adopting today.

Commission action, and temporarily are exempt from having to comply with certain other
requirements added by or arising from Title VII. 8
These final rules and guidance do not address one key issue related to the application of
the “security-based swap dealer” definition in the cross-border context. In the Cross-Border
Proposing Release, we proposed that non-U.S. persons must count, against the relevant
thresholds of the de minimis exemption, their dealing activity involving “transactions conducted
within the United States.” 9 Commenters raised a number of significant issues related to this
proposed requirement, including issues regarding the Commission’s authority to impose this
requirement and regarding the costs associated with this requirement. While we continue to
preliminarily believe that the cross-border application of the security-based swap dealer
definition should account for activities in the United States related to dealing – even when
neither party to the transaction is a U.S. person – we also believe that the final resolution of this
issue can benefit from further consideration and public comment. Accordingly, we anticipate
soliciting additional public comment regarding approaches by which the cross-border application
of the dealer definition appropriately can reflect activity between two non-U.S. persons where

2011) (clarifying the compliance date for certain requirements added by Title VII, and in some
cases providing temporary exemptive relief in connection with those requirements); Order

revision of the Exchange Act definition of “security” to encompass security-based swaps).

9

See proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b). The proposal further would have defined a
“transaction conducted within the United States” to encompass transactions that are solicited,
executed, or booked within the United States by or on behalf of either counterparty, regardless of
either counterparty’s location, domicile or residence status, subject to an exception for
transactions conducted through the foreign branches of U.S. banks. See proposed Exchange Act
rule 3a71-3(a)(5).

one or both are conducting dealing activity within the United States.
B. The Dodd-Frank Act
As discussed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the 2008 financial crisis highlighted
significant issues in the over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives markets, which had experienced
dramatic growth in the years leading up to the crisis and are capable of affecting significant
sectors of the U.S. economy. 10 The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted, among other reasons, to
promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency
in the financial system, including in connection with swaps and security-based swaps. 11
Title VII provides for a comprehensive new regulatory framework for swaps and
security-based swaps. Under this framework, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(“CFTC”) regulates “swaps” while the Commission regulates “security-based swaps,” and the
Commission and CFTC jointly regulate “mixed swaps.” The new framework encompasses the
registration and comprehensive regulation of dealers and major participants, as well as
requirements related to clearing, trade execution, regulatory reporting, and public
dissemination. 12 Security-based swap transactions are largely cross-border in practice, 13 and the
10

See generally Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 30972-73.

11

See Pub. L. No. 111-203, Preamble (stating that the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted “[t]o promote
the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the
financial system, to end ‘too big to fail’, to protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, to
protect consumers from abusive financial services practices, and for other purposes”).

12

The Commission has proposed a series of rules regarding these matters. See Cross-Border
Proposing Release, 78 FR at 30972 nn.11-18. Most recently, the Commission proposed rules
governing recordkeeping, reporting, and notification requirements for dealers and major
participants. See Exchange Act Release No. 71958 (Apr. 17, 2014), 79 FR 25194 (May 2, 2014).
The Dodd-Frank Act further provides that the SEC and CFTC jointly should further define certain
terms, including “security-based swap dealer” and “major security-based swap participant.” See
Dodd-Frank Act section 712(d). Pursuant to that requirement, the SEC and CFTC jointly adopted
rules to further define those terms. See Further Definition of “Swap Dealer,” “Security-Based
Swap Dealer,” “Major Swap Participant,” “Major Security-Based Swap Participant” and “Eligible
Contract Participant,” Exchange Act Release No. 66868 (Apr. 27, 2012), 77 FR 30596 (May 23,

various market participants and infrastructures operate in a global market. To ensure that our
regulatory framework appropriately reflects and addresses the nature and extent of the potential
impact that the global market can have on U.S. persons and the U.S. financial system, it is
critically important that we provide market participants with clear rules and guidance regarding
how the regulatory framework mandated by Title VII will apply in the cross-border context.
In developing these final rules and guidance, we have consulted and coordinated with the
CFTC, the prudential regulators, 14 and foreign regulatory authorities in accordance with the
consultation provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, 15 and more generally as part of our domestic and
international coordination efforts. 16 Commission staff has participated in numerous bilateral and
2012) (“Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release”); see also Cross-Border Proposing Release,
78 FR at 30972 n.9 (discussing joint rulemaking to further define various Title VII terms).
13

See section II.A, infra, regarding the preponderance of cross-border activity in the security-based
swap market.

14

The term “prudential regulator” is defined in section 1a(39) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 1a(39), and that
definition is incorporated by reference in section 3(a)(74) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.
78c(a)(74). Pursuant to the definition, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
(“Federal Reserve Board”), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, the Farm Credit Administration, or the Federal Housing Finance Agency
(collectively, the “prudential regulators”) is the “prudential regulator” of a security-based swap
dealer or major security-based swap participant if the entity is directly supervised by that
regulator.

15

Section 712(a)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act provides in part that the Commission shall “consult and
coordinate to the extent possible with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the
prudential regulators for the purposes of assuring regulatory consistency and comparability, to the
extent possible.”
In addition, section 752(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act provides in part that “[i]n order to promote
effective and consistent global regulation of swaps and security-based swaps, the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the prudential
regulators . . . as appropriate, shall consult and coordinate with foreign regulatory authorities on
the establishment of consistent international standards with respect to the regulation (including
fees) of swaps.”

16

In 2009, leaders of the Group of 20 (“G20”)—whose membership includes the United States, 18
other countries, and the European Union (“EU”)—called for global improvements in the
functioning, transparency, and regulatory oversight of OTC derivatives markets. See G20
Leaders’ Statement, Pittsburgh, United States, September 24-25, 2009, available at:
http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/international/g7-

multilateral discussions with foreign regulatory authorities addressing the regulation of OTC
derivatives. 17 Through these discussions and the Commission staff’s participation in various
international task forces and working groups, 18 we have gathered information about foreign
regulatory reform efforts and the possibility of conflicts and gaps, as well as inconsistencies and
overlaps, between U.S. and foreign regulatory regimes. We have taken this information into
consideration in developing the final rules and guidance.
C. The Cross-Border Proposing Release and the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance
In expressing our preliminary views regarding the application of Title VII to securitybased swap activity carried out in the cross-border context (including to persons engaged in such
activities), the Cross-Border Proposing Release recognized that the security-based swap market
is global in nature and that it developed prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. 19 The

g20/Documents/pittsburgh_summit_leaders_statement_250909.pdf. (“G20 Leaders’ Pittsburgh
Statement”).
In subsequent summits, the G20 leaders have reiterated their commitment to OTC derivatives
regulatory reform. For example, in September 2013, the leaders of the G20 reaffirmed their
commitments with respect to the regulation of the OTC derivatives markets, welcoming Financial
Stability Board (“FSB”) members’ confirmed actions and committed timetables to put the agreed
OTC derivatives reforms into practice. See the G20 Leaders Declaration (September 2013), para.
71, available at:

Senior representatives of authorities with responsibility for regulation of OTC derivatives have
met on a number of occasions to discuss international coordination of OTC derivatives
regulations. See, e.g., Report of the OTC Derivatives Regulators Group (“ODRG”) on CrossBorder Implementation Issues March 2014 (Mar. 31, 2014), available at:

Commission representatives participate in the FSB’s Working Group on OTC Derivatives
Regulation (“ODWG”), both on its own behalf and as the representative of the International
Organization of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”), which is co-chair of the ODWG. A
Commission representative also serves as one of the co-chairs of the IOSCO Task Force on OTC
Derivatives Regulation.

proposal further recognized that the rules we adopt and guidance we provide regarding the crossborder application of Title VII could significantly affect the global security-based swap market. 20
Reflecting the range of regulatory requirements that Title VII imposes upon the securitybased swap market, the Cross-Border Proposing Release addressed the cross-border application
of: (a) the de minimis exception to the “security-based swap dealer” definition; (b) the entitylevel and transaction-level requirements applicable to security-based swap dealers (e.g., margin,
capital, and business conduct requirements); (c) the “substantial position” and “substantial
counterparty exposure” thresholds for the “major security-based swap participant” definition and
the requirements applicable to major participants; (d) the registration of security-based swap
clearing agencies and mandatory clearing requirements; (e) the registration of security-based
swap execution facilities and mandatory trade execution requirements; and (f) the registration of
security-based swap data repositories and regulatory reporting and public dissemination
requirements. The proposal also addressed the potential for market participants to satisfy certain
of those Title VII requirements by complying with comparable foreign rules as a substitute. This
rulemaking establishes a process for submission of such requests.
Following the Commission’s proposal, the CFTC issued guidance regarding Title VII’s
application to cross-border swap activity. 21 The CFTC Cross-Border Guidance differed from the
Commission’s proposed rules in certain ways, including, as discussed below, with regard to the
meaning of “U.S. person,” the cross-border application of the de minimis exception to the dealer

definition, the cross-border application of the major participant definition, and the process for
submitting substituted compliance requests. 22
Certain foreign regulators also have addressed or are in the process of addressing issues
related to the cross-border implementation of requirements applicable to OTC derivatives. 23
D. Comments on the Proposal
The Commission received 36 comments in connection with the proposal. 24 Several of the
commenters addressed differences between the SEC’s proposed rules and the CFTC CrossBorder Guidance, and urged the Commission to harmonize its rules with the approaches taken by
the CFTC and by foreign regulators. 25

22

The CFTC Cross-Border Guidance currently is subject to legal challenge. See Complaint,
Securities Indus. & Fin. Mkts. Ass’n. v. CFTC, No. 1:13-cv-1916 (D.D.C. filed Dec. 4, 2013).

The comment letters are located at: http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-02-13/s70213.shtml. The
majority of those commenters addressed, at least in part, the definitional issues that are the
subject of this release. A number of commenters also addressed aspects of the proposal that are
outside the scope of this release, and a few of those commenters only addressed issues that were
outside the scope of this release (for example, addressing only proposed Regulation SBSR). We
will consider those comments in connection with the relevant rulemakings.

25

See, e.g., Managed Funds Assoc. and Alternative Investment Management Assoc.
(“MFA/AIMA”) Letter at 3 (“We recognize that there are differences between the Commission’s
proposed approach and the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, and we expect that other international
regulators will similarly issue proposals related to the cross-border application of their
regulations. Thus, in light of the global nature of the derivatives market, we urge continued
harmonization with the CFTC and other regulatory authorities with respect to the extraterritorial
scope of all these regimes. In particular, we encourage international coordination of substituted
compliance regimes to ensure appropriate recognition of comparable regulations, create practical
and administrable frameworks, and alleviate duplicative regulation.” (footnotes omitted)). See
also letter from six members of the United States Senate at 2 (stating that there should be no gaps
or loopholes between the Commission’s and the CFTC’s rules); Futures and Options Association
(“FOA”) Letter at 8 (urging the Commission and the CFTC “to coordinate, to the extent possible,
on their approaches in order to minimise distortions or other unintended consequences for market
participants”); letter from Senator Jeffrey A. Merkley, et al., Congress of the United States (Aug.
6, 2013).
Some commenters generally suggested that we harmonize with aspects of the CFTC CrossBorder Guidance, but also expressed preferences for particular elements of our proposed
approach. See, e.g., Institute of International Bankers (“IIB”) Letter at 3-4 (generally

Many of those commenters particularly focused on differences between the two
regulators’ meanings of the term “U.S. person,” with several suggesting that we change our
proposed definition to align with the CFTC’s approach. 26 A number of commenters also
addressed the definition of “transaction conducted within the United States,” with several
opposing any use of the concept as part of the Commission’s rules. 27
Commenters further raised a number of more general concerns in connection with the
proposal, including concerns regarding cost-benefit issues, 28 the clarity of the proposal as a

emphasizing the need for consistency with the CFTC and European Securities and Markets
Authority (“ESMA”) approaches, unless the SEC requirement is more flexible than those other
requirements). One commenter took the view that the Commission’s rules should be at least as
strong as the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, but should go further than the CFTC wherever
necessary. See Better Markets (“BM”) Letter. See also Chris Barnard Letter at 2 (recommending
that the Commission and the CFTC propose one set of rules applicable to cross-border activities
to avoid duplicative and conflicting rules).
26

See notes 192-224, infra, and accompanying text.

27

As noted above, these final rules and guidance do not address the application of the “transaction
conducted within the United States” concept to the dealer definition. We instead anticipate
soliciting additional public comment regarding the issue.

28

For example, a few commenters took the view that cost-benefit principles weighed in favor of
consistency with the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance. See Securities Industry and Financial
Markets Association/Futures Industry Association/Financial Services Roundtable
(“SIFMA/FIA/FSR”) Letter at 3; PensionsEurope Letter (incorporating by reference
SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter; all references to SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter incorporate reference to
PensionsEurope Letter); IIB Letter at 2, 3. One commenter further took the view that cost-benefit
principles merited rejection of the use of the “transaction conducted within the United States”
concept. See SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at 3. See also Chris Barnard Letter at 2 (suggesting that
there is insufficient administrative, legal, or economic rationale for having “very different rules”
of cross-border application between the SEC and the CFTC); Coalition for Derivatives End-Users
(“CDEU”) Letter at 2 (stating that conflicting regulatory regimes will result in increased
compliance and regulatory costs and an inefficient financial system); Association of Financial
Guaranty Insurers (“AFGI”) Letter, dated August 20, 2013 (“AFGI Letter I”) at 2 (stating that the
security-based swap dealer and major security-based swap participant regime would be disruptive
and have financial consequences for guaranty insurers and their counterparties who have legacy
transactions with a projected run-off date in the near future); AFGI letter, dated July 22, 2013
(“AFGI Letter II”) at 4 (incorporated by reference in AFGI Letter I); AFGI letter, dated February
15, 2013 (“AFGI Letter III”) at 4 (incorporated by reference in AFGI Letter I).
One commenter conversely argued that, in lieu of cost-benefit principles, the Commission instead
should be guided by public interest and investor protection principles, as well as the Dodd-Frank

concessions to the financial industry. 31
In addition, commenters addressed issues specific to the cross-border application of the
entity-level and transaction-level requirements for dealers, 32 as well as requirements specific to
clearing, trade execution, regulatory reporting and public disclosure. 33 We expect to address
those comments regarding the relevant substantive requirements in subsequent rulemakings and
guidance regarding the relevant substantive requirements.

Act’s intent to increase financial system soundness and prevent another financial crisis. See BM
Letter at 4, 37-45 (stating, inter alia, that “Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act knowing full well
that it would impose significant costs on industry, yet it determined those costs were not only
justified but necessary to stabilize our financial system and avoid another financial crisis”).
One commenter challenged the adequacy – indeed, the existence – of the cost-benefit analysis in
the proposing release. See CDEU Letter at 6 (“To better understand the negative effects of
imposing conflicting rules on the market, the SEC should conduct a direct cost-benefit analysis of
the conflicting rule regimes (e.g., with the European Market Infrastructure Regulation and the
CFTC’s cross-border guidance). Instead, the SEC asks the public to conduct such an analysis for
the SEC: ‘what would be the economic impact, including the costs and benefits, of these
differences on market participants. . .?’”).

30

See Americans for Financial Reform (“AFR”) Letter, dated August 22, 2013 (“AFR Letter I”) at
3-4 (criticizing the proposal as having failed to apply the rules based on the geographic location
of the entity ultimately responsible for the resulting liabilities, and stating that the rules should
apply to transactions engaged in by “guaranteed foreign subsidiaries of U.S. entities”).

31

See BM Letter at 7-8 (stating that the proposal was the result of unwarranted and inappropriate
concessions, such as with regard to the application of the de minimis threshold to U.S.-guaranteed
entities). See also Karim Shariff letter at 1 (stating that the proposal will allow banks to take risks
that will lead to an economic collapse).

32

See, e.g., BM Letter at 3, 20-21, 28 (stating that transactions conducted through foreign branches
of U.S. dealers with non-U.S. persons should be subject to external business conduct
requirements, and that margin should be treated as a transaction-level requirement);

business conduct and certain other requirements).

33

See, e.g., BM Letter at 3, 21-22 (criticizing exceptions from mandatory clearing and trade
execution requirements); SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at A-38 to A-52 (in part urging that application
of regulatory reporting, public dissemination, trade execution and clearing requirements should
follow the same rules as external business conduct requirements).

10

Commenters also addressed the proposed availability of substituted compliance. 34
Although today we are adopting a procedural rule regarding requests for substituted compliance,
we generally expect to address the potential availability of substituted compliance for specific
Title VII requirements in connection with subsequent rulemakings regarding each substantive
requirement.
We have carefully considered the comments received in adopting the final rules and
providing guidance. Our final rules and guidance further reflect consultation with the CFTC,
prudential regulators, and foreign regulatory authorities with regard to the development of
consistent and comparable standards. Accordingly, certain aspects of the final rules and
guidance – such as, for example, the treatment of guaranteed affiliates of U.S. persons for
purposes of the dealer de minimis exception – have been modified from the proposal. 35

34

See, e.g., AFR Letter I at 8, 12 (opposing rationale for substituted compliance, and noting need
for the Commission to retain discretion to find a lack of comparability based on substantive
enforcement issues); AFR letter to CFTC, dated August 27, 2012 (“AFR Letter II”) (stating that
CFTC should narrow the scope of substituted compliance) (incorporated by reference in AFR
Letter I); Michael Greenberger letter to CFTC, dated February 6, 2013 at 13 (“Greenberger Letter
I”) (stating that substituted compliance should be a last resort and that the CFTC regime be
enforced vigorously) (incorporated by reference in AFR Letter I); Michael Greenberger letter to
CFTC, dated August 27, 2012 at 8, 19-23 (“Greenberger Letter II”) (explaining that international
comity does not require that the CFTC exempt foreign subsidiaries from compliance with U.S.
financial regulation) (incorporated by reference in AFR Letter I); BM Letter at 3, 26-27
(questioning authority for substituted compliance and suggesting potential for loopholes; also
stating that substituted compliance should not be allowed for transactions with U.S. persons or for
transactions in the United States and urging limited use of exemptive authority; further stating
that the proposal gave only passing reference to foreign supervision and enforcement);
SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at A-30 to A-38 (in part supporting the approach to focus on similar
regulatory objectives rather than requiring foreign rules to be identical, stating that foreign
branches should be able to make use of substituted compliance for certain purposes, stating that
variations in foreign supervisory practices should not be assumed to be defects, and requesting
further clarity regarding substituted compliance assessment factors); ESMA Letter at 1, 3-4
(suggesting particular expansions of the proposed scope of substituted compliance); European
Commission (“EC”) Letter (supporting “holistic” approach toward substituted compliance based
on comparison of regulatory outcomes).

In this regard, the final rules in a number of areas take approaches that are similar to the
approaches taken by the CFTC in its own cross-border guidance, although independent

II. The Economic, Legal, and Policy Principles Guiding the Commission’s Approach to
the Application of Title VII to Cross-Border Activities
In this section, we describe the most significant economic considerations regarding the
security-based swap market that we have taken into account in implementing the cross-border
application of the security-based swap dealer and major security-based swap participant
definitions of Title VII. We are sensitive to the economic consequences and effects, including
costs and benefits, of our rules, including with respect to the scope of our application of the
security-based swap dealer and major security-based swap participant definitions in the crossborder context. We have taken into consideration the costs and benefits associated with persons
being brought within one of these definitions through our cross-border application, as well as the
costs market participants may incur in determining whether they are within the scope of these
definitions and thus subject to Title VII, while recognizing that the ultimate economic impact of
these definitions will be determined in part by the final rules regarding the substantive
requirements applicable to security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap
participants. Some of these economic consequences and effects stem from statutory mandates,
while others result from the discretion we exercise in implementing the mandates.

considerations have driven our approaches. Moreover, throughout the Cross-Border Proposing
Release we recognized and solicited comment on the differences between our proposal and the
CFTC’s proposed guidance on the cross-border application of swap regulation. As noted above,
many commenters urged harmonization with various aspects of the CFTC’s guidance. We have
taken these comments into account, and in developing final rules we have carefully considered
the CFTC’s guidance and the underlying policy rationales. Further, where we have determined
such policy rationales and approaches are applicable in the context of the market for securitybased swaps, we have adopted similar approaches to the CFTC (see, e.g., application of the de
minimis exception to non-U.S. persons’ dealing transactions with foreign branches of U.S.
banks).

12

A. Economic Considerations in the Cross-Border Regulation of Security-Based Swaps
1. Economic Features of the Security-Based Swap Market
As noted above, the cross-border implementation of the rules defining security-based
swap dealer and major security-based swap participant is the first in a series of final rules that
consider the cross-border implications of security-based swaps and Title VII. In determining
how Title VII security-based swap dealer and major security-based swap participant definitions
should apply to persons and transactions in the cross-border context, the Commission has been
informed by our analysis of current market activity, including the extent of cross-border trading
activity in the security-based swap market. Several key features of the market inform our
analysis.
First, the security-based swap market is a global market. Security-based swap business
currently takes place across national borders, with agreements negotiated and executed between
counterparties often in different jurisdictions (and at times booked, managed, and hedged in still
other jurisdictions). The global nature of the security-based swap market is evidenced by the
data available to the Commission. 36 Based on market data in the Depository Trust and Clearing
Corporation’s Trade Information Warehouse (“DTCC-TIW”), 37 viewed from the perspective of
the domiciles of the counterparties booking credit default swap (“CDS”) transactions,
approximately 48 percent of price forming North American corporate single-name CDS
transactions 38 from January 2008 to December 2012 were cross-border transactions between a
36

See section III.A.2, infra (discussing in detail the global nature of the security-based swap
market).

37

The information was made available to the Commission under an agreement with the DTCC-TIW
and in accordance with guidance provided to DTCC-TIW by the OTC Derivatives Regulatory
Forum (“ODRF”).

38

This figure is based on all price-forming DTCC-TIW North American corporate single-name
CDS transactions. Price-forming transactions include all new transactions, assignments,

13

U.S.-domiciled 39 counterparty and a foreign-domiciled counterparty 40 and an additional 39
percent of such CDS transactions were between two foreign-domiciled counterparties. 41 Thus,
approximately 13 percent of the North American corporate single-name CDS transactions in
2008-2012 were between two U.S.-domiciled counterparties. 42 These statistics indicate that,
rather than being an exception, cross-border North American corporate single-name CDS
modifications to increase the notional amounts of previously executed transactions, and
terminations of previously executed transactions. Transactions terminated, transactions entered
into in connection with a compression exercise, and expiration of contracts at maturity are not
considered price-forming and are therefore excluded, as are replacement trades and all
bookkeeping-related trades.
“North American corporate single-name CDS transactions” are classified as such because they
use The International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (“ISDA”) North American
documentation. These may include certain transactions involving non-U.S. reference entities. We
do not have sufficiently reliable data on reference entity domicile (as opposed to counterparty
domicile, which we have sought to identify in the manner described in note 39, infra) to limit our
analysis to only U.S. single-name CDS. Although the inclusion of transactions involving such
non-U.S. reference entities introduces some noise into the data, we do not believe that this noise
is sufficiently significant to alter the conclusions we draw from the data.
39

The domicile classifications in DTCC-TIW are based on the market participants’ own reporting
and have not been verified by Commission staff. Prior to enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act,
funds and accounts did not formally report their domicile to DTCC-TIW because there was no
systematic requirement to do so. After enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the DTCC-TIW has
collected the registered office location of the account or fund. This information is self-reported
on a voluntary basis. It is possible that some market participants may misclassify their domicile
status because the databases in DTCC-TIW do not assign a unique legal entity identifier to each
separate entity. It is also possible that the domicile classifications may not correspond precisely
to treatment as a U.S. person under the rules adopted today. Notwithstanding these limitations,
we believe that the cross-border and foreign activity presented in the analysis by the
Commission’s Division of Economic and Risk Analysis demonstrates the nature of the singlename CDS market. See section III.A.2, infra.

40

DTCC-TIW classifies a foreign branch or foreign subsidiary of a U.S.-domiciled entity as
foreign-domiciled. Therefore, CDS transactions classified as involving a foreign-domiciled
counterparty in the DTCC-TIW data may include CDS transactions with a foreign branch or
foreign subsidiary of a U.S.-domiciled entity as counterparty.

41

Put another way, between 2008 and 2012, a vast majority (approximately 87 percent) of North
American corporate single-name CDS transactions directly involved at least one foreigndomiciled counterparty. This observation is based on the data compiled by the Commission’s
Division of Economic and Risk Analysis on North American corporate single-name CDS
transactions from DTCC-TIW between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2012. See section
III.A.2, infra.

transactions are as common as intra-jurisdictional transactions in the security-based swap
market. 43
Second, dealers and other market participants are highly interconnected within this global
market. While most market participants have only a few counterparties, dealers can have
hundreds of counterparties, consisting of both non-dealing market participants (e.g., non-dealers,
including commercial and financial market participants and investment funds) and other
dealers. 44 Furthermore, as described in more detail below, the great majority of trades are
dealer-to-dealer, rather than dealer-to-non-dealer or non-dealer-to-non-dealer, and a large
fraction of single-name CDS volume is between counterparties domiciled in different
jurisdictions. This interconnectedness facilitates the use of security-based swaps as a tool for
sharing financial and commercial risks. In an environment in which market participants can
have diverse and offsetting risk exposures, security-based swap transactions can allow
participants to transfer risks so that they are borne by those who can do so efficiently. The
global scale of the security-based swap market allows counterparties to access liquidity across
jurisdictional boundaries, providing U.S. market participants with opportunities to share these

43

We note, however, that, in addition to classifying transactions between a U.S. counterparty and a
foreign branch of a U.S. bank as cross-border transactions, see note 40, supra, these statistics
characterize as cross-border transactions some transactions in which all or substantially all of the
activity takes place in the United States and all or much of the risk of the transactions ultimately
is borne by U.S. persons. That is, a transaction is classified as cross-border if the legal domicile
of at least one of the counterparties to the transaction is outside the United States, but if the
transaction is classified as cross-border solely on the basis of legal domicile, the risk associated
with these transactions may still ultimately be borne by U.S. persons. In this sense, our estimates
of the cross-border allocation of security-based swap activity may not precisely reflect the
proportion of transactions that are cross-border in nature.

44

Based on an analysis of 2012 transaction data by staff in the Division of Economic and Risk
Analysis, accounts associated with market participants recognized by ISDA as dealers had on
average 403 counterparties. All other accounts (i.e., those more likely to belong to non-dealers)
averaged four counterparties.

15

risks with counterparties around the world. As discussed further in section VIII, a broad set of
counterparties across which risks can be shared may result in more efficient risk sharing.
However, these opportunities for international risk sharing also represent channels for
risk transmission. In other words, the interconnectedness of security-based swap market
participants provides paths for liquidity and risk to flow throughout the system, so that it can be
difficult to isolate risks to a particular entity or geographic segment. Because dealers facilitate
the great majority of security-based swap transactions, with bilateral relationships that extend to
potentially hundreds of counterparties, liquidity problems or other forms of financial distress that
begin in one entity or one corner of the globe can potentially spread throughout the network,
with dealers as a central conduit.
Third, as highlighted in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, dealing activity
within the market for security-based swaps is highly concentrated. 45 This concentration in large
part appears to reflect the fact that larger entities possess competitive advantages in engaging in
OTC security-based swap dealing activities, particularly with regard to having sufficient
financial resources to provide potential counterparties with adequate assurances of financial
performance.
The security-based swap market developed as an OTC market, without centralized
trading venues or dissemination of pre- or post-trade pricing and volume information. In
markets without transparent pricing, access to information confers a competitive advantage. In
the current security-based swap market, large dealers and other large market participants with a
large share of order flow have an informational advantage over smaller dealers and non-dealers
who, in the absence of pre-trade transparency, observe a smaller subset of the market. Greater
45

16

private information about order flow enables better assessment of current market values by
dealers, permitting them to extract economic rents from counterparties who are less informed. 46
Non-dealers are aware of this information asymmetry, and certain non-dealers – particularly
larger entities who transact with many dealers – may be able to obtain access to competitive
pricing or otherwise demand a price discount that reflects the information asymmetry. Typically,
however, the value of private information (i.e., the economic rent or informational premium) will
be earned by those who have the most information. In the case of security-based swap markets,
it is predominantly dealers who observe the greatest order flow and benefit from market opacity.
Taken together, the need for financial resources and the private information conveyed by
order flow suggest that new entrants who intend to engage in security-based swap dealing
activity in fact face high barriers to entry. One consequence of the current concentrated market
structure is the potential for risk spillovers and contagion, which can occur when the financial
sector as a whole (or certain key segments) becomes undercapitalized. 47 Unlike most other
securities transactions, a security-based swap gives rise to ongoing obligations between
transaction counterparties during the life of the transaction. This means that each counterparty to
the transaction undertakes the obligation to perform the security-based swap in accordance with
its terms and bears counterparty credit risk and market risk until the transaction expires or is
46

In this situation, economic rents are the profits that dealers earn by trading with counterparties
who are less informed. In a market with competitive access to information, there is no
informational premium; dealers only earn a liquidity premium. The difference between the
competitive liquidity premium and the actual profits that dealers earn is the economic rent.

47

See Viral V. Acharya, Lasse H. Pedersen, Thomas Philippon, and Matthew Richardson,
“Measuring Systemic Risk” (May 2010), available at: http://vlab.stern.nyu.edu/public/static/SRv3.pdf. The authors use a theoretical model of the banking sector to show that, unless the
external costs of their trades are considered, financial institutions will have an incentive to take
risks that are borne by the aggregate financial sector. Under this theory, in the context of Title
VII, the relevant external cost is the potential for risk spillovers and sequential counterparty
failure, leading to an aggregate capital shortfall and breakdown of financial intermediation in the
financial sector.

17

terminated. 48 Within this interconnected market, participants may have ongoing bilateral
obligations with multiple counterparties, allowing for efficient risk-sharing and access to
liquidity throughout the global network. However, a primary risk of the integrated market is the
potential for sequential counterparty failure and contagion when one or more large market
participants become financially distressed, causing the market participant to default on its
obligations to its counterparties. 49 A default by one or more security-based swap dealers or
major security-based swap participants, or even the perceived lack of creditworthiness of these
large entities, could produce contagion, either through direct defaults and risk spillovers, reduced
willingness to extend credit, reduced liquidity, or reduced valuations for financial instruments.
As financial distress spreads, the aggregate financial system may become undercapitalized,
hindering its ability to provide financial intermediation services, including security-based swap
intermediation services.
In other words, the failure of a single large firm active in the security-based swap market
can have consequences beyond the firm itself. One firm’s default may reduce the willingness of
dealers to trade with, or extend credit to, both non-dealers and other dealers. By reducing the
availability of sufficient credit to provide intermediation services, and by reducing transaction
volume that reveals information about underlying asset values, the effects of a dealer default
may, through asset price and liquidity channels, spill over into other jurisdictions and even other
markets in which security-based swap dealers participate.
48

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30616-17 (noting that “the completion
of a purchase or sale transaction” in the secondary equity or debt markets “can be expected to
terminate the mutual obligations of the parties,” unlike security-based swap transactions, which
often give rise to “an ongoing obligation to exchange cash flows over the life of the agreement”).

Given that firms may be expected to consider the implications of security-based swap
activity only on their own operations, without considering aggregate financial sector risk, 50 the
financial system may end up bearing more risk than the aggregate capital of the intermediaries in
the system can support and may cease to function normally during times of market distress. For
example, during times of financial distress a dealer’s leverage constraints may begin to bind,
either because lenders require more collateral or because market declines erode a dealer’s capital
position, forcing the dealer to de-lever, either by selling assets or raising additional capital.
Without adequate capital, the dealer may be unable to intermediate trades, potentially reducing
liquidity in the markets it serves. Security-based swap positions replicate leveraged positions in
the underlying asset, with a small amount of capital supporting large notional exposures. 51
Given the leveraged nature of swap transactions, and the concentrated structure of the dealer
market, in which a large amount of highly leveraged risk exposures may be concentrated in a
relatively small number of entities that are responsible for the vast majority of global dealing
activity, 52 the potential consequences arising from financial instability in the security-based swap
market may be acute.
In sum, the security-based swap market is characterized by a high level of

which the potential for significant inter-jurisdictional activity and access to liquidity may
enhance risk sharing among counterparties. At the same time, channels for risk sharing also
represent channels for risk transmission. The global nature of this market, combined with the
interconnectedness of market participants, means that liquidity shortfalls or risks that begin
pooling in one corner of the market can potentially spread beyond that corner to the entire
security-based swap market, with dealers as a key conduit. Because dealers and major
participants are a large subset of all participants in the global security-based swap market and
facilitate the majority of transactions (and thus reach many counterparties), concerns surrounding
these types of spillovers are part of the framework in which we analyze the economic effects of
our final rules implementing the security-based swap dealer and major participant definitions in
the cross-border context. 53
2. Context for Regulatory Determinations
In determining how Title VII requirements should apply to persons and transactions in a
market characterized by the types of risks we have described, we are aware of the potentially
significant tradeoffs inherent in our policy decisions. Our primary economic considerations for
promulgating rules and guidance regarding the application of the security-based swap dealer and
major participant definitions to cross-border activities include the effect of our choices on
efficiency, competition, and capital formation, 54 the potential risks of security-based swaps to

53

We have previously noted that, depending on the size of the security-based swap dealer, default
by a security-based swap dealer “could have adverse spillover or contagion effects that could
create instability for the financial markets more generally.” See Capital, Margin, and Segregation
Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants and
Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers, Exchange Act Release No. 68071 (Oct. 18, 2012), 77

20

U.S. market participants that could affect financial stability, 55 the level of transparency and
counterparty protection in the security-based swap market, and the costs to market participants. 56
As noted above, participants may use security-based swaps to manage financial and
commercial risks and benefit from a liquid market with broad participation that facilitates risk
sharing. We also recognize the possibility that the same channels that enable risk sharing also
facilitate the transmission of risks and liquidity problems that begin pooling in one geographic
segment of the market to the global security-based swap market. As described more fully in
section III.A.1, U.S. entities may take on risk exposures in the security-based swap market by
transacting with non-U.S. counterparties through non-U.S. affiliates. This suggests that an
approach that applied these Title VII definitions to transactions only where all activity occurs
inside the United States would have little effect in addressing the risks associated with securitybased swaps, including risks and associated economic consequences flowing from contagion that
may originate abroad and reach U.S. market participants through security-based swap activities
and the multiple bilateral relationships that may form as a result of those activities. The global
reach of security-based swap dealers, including U.S. dealers, participating in the vast majority of
55

Title VII imposes financial responsibility and risk mitigation requirements on registered securitybased swap dealers and major security-based swap participants. As we noted in proposing rules
regarding capital and margin requirements applicable to security-based swap dealers, “the capital
and margin requirements in particular are broadly intended to work in tandem to strengthen the
financial system by reducing the potential for default to an acceptable level and limiting the
amount of leverage that can be employed by [security-based swap dealers] and other market
participants.” See Capital and Margin Proposing Release, 77 FR at 70304. We also noted that
“[r]equiring particular firms to hold more capital or exchange more margin may reduce the risk of
default by one or more market participants and reduce the amount of leverage employed in the
system generally, which in turn may have a number of important benefits.” Id.

56

As we noted in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission generally understands the
“U.S. financial system” to include the U.S. banking system and the U.S. financial markets,
including the U.S. security-based swap market, the traditional securities markets (e.g., the debt
and equity markets), and the markets for other financial activities (e.g., lending). See CrossBorder Proposing Release, 78 FR at 30980 n.97.

21

trades 57 and extending to upwards of hundreds of counterparties, 58 provides paths for these risks
to flow back into the United States. 59
At the same time, the Commission recognizes that the regulatory requirements we adopt
for security-based swap dealers and major participants under Title VII may not reach all market
participants that act as dealers or that have positions that pose considerable risk concerns in the
global security-based swap markets. These limits to the application of Title VII raise several
issues. First, market participants may shift their behavior. Final Title VII requirements may
impose significant direct costs on participants falling within the security-based swap dealer and
major security-based swap participant definitions that are not borne by other market participants,
including costs related to capital and margin requirements, regulatory reporting requirements,
and business conduct requirements. The costs of these requirements may provide economic
incentive for some market participants falling within the dealer and major participant definitions
to restructure their security-based swap business to seek to operate wholly outside of the Title
VII regulatory framework by exiting the security-based swap market in the United States and not
transacting with U.S. persons, potentially fragmenting liquidity across geographic boundaries. 60

57

See note 139, infra, and accompanying text.

58

See note 44, supra.

59

As discussed above, the global security-based swaps network, characterized by multiple bilateral
relationships between counterparties, has the potential for risk spillovers and sequential
counterparty failure. These exposures are not unique to the U.S. financial system. Indeed, the
global scope of the security-based swap market suggests that, given our territorial approach to
Title VII, there will be the fewest potential gaps in coverage if other jurisdictions also adopt
similar comprehensive and comparable derivative regulations. See Section III.B for a discussion
of global regulatory efforts in this space.

60

To the extent that registered dealers are ultimately subject to more extensive reporting and public
dissemination requirements than other market participants under Title VII, these requirements
may also alter the incentives of market participants to transact with registered dealers if, for
example, public dissemination requirements reveal information that participants wish to treat as
confidential about trading strategies or future hedging needs. Incentives for these participants to

22

Conversely, such incentives potentially may be mitigated by the fact that capital and margin
requirements, counterparty protections, and business conduct standards required by Title VII 61
may promote financial stability and lead to non-dealer market participants exhibiting a
preference for transacting with registered dealers and major participants.
Second, to the extent that other jurisdictions may adopt requirements with different
scopes or on different timelines, the requirements we adopt may also result in competitive
distortions. That is, differences in regulatory requirements across jurisdictions, or the ability of
certain non-U.S. market participants to avoid security-based swap dealer regulation under Title
VII, may generate competitive burdens and provide incentives for non-U.S. persons to avoid
transacting with U.S. persons.
Third, key elements of the rules adopted today – the definition of “U.S. person,” as well
as rules covering treatment of guaranteed transactions, transactions with foreign branches,
transactions conducted through conduit affiliates, and cleared anonymous transactions, and rules
covering aggregation standards – all have implications for how U.S. and non-U.S. entities
perform their de minimis and major participant threshold calculations and may affect the number
of participants who ultimately register as security-based swap dealers or major security-based
swap participants. The number of persons required to register will affect the costs and benefits
of the substantive Title VII requirements that will ultimately be adopted; depending on the final
rules, more or fewer entities, and therefore more or fewer security-based swaps, will be subject
to Title VII requirements applicable to security-based swap dealers and major security-based
avoid registered dealers could potentially isolate liquidity to less transparent corners of the
market.
61

See, e.g., Exchange Act sections 15F(e), (f), (h) (providing that security-based swap dealers and
major security-based swap participants be subject to requirements relating to capital and margin,
reporting and recordkeeping, and business conduct).

23

swap participants. 62 Title VII requires the Commission to create a new regulatory regime that
includes capital, margin, registration and reporting requirements aimed at increasing
transparency and customer protections as well as mitigating the risk of financial contagion. Each
of these requirements will impose new costs and regulatory burdens on persons that engage in
security-based swap dealing activity at levels above the de minimis thresholds and on persons
whose security-based swap positions are large enough to cause them to be major security-based
swap participants.
We expect that these requirements’ application to security-based swap dealers and major
security-based swap participants subject to Title VII will be associated with a number of benefits
to the security-based swap market and security-based swap market participants, including
transparency, accountability, and increased counterparty protections. 63 Nevertheless, as we
discuss later in this release, the de minimis rules for non-U.S. persons could allow certain nonU.S. entities to avoid the costs of dealer registration, which could reduce the number of entities
that register as security-based swap dealers, relative to the Commission’s estimates in the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release. Although the number of entities that are not
required to register will depend on the availability of the de minimis exclusions, we believe that,
to the extent that the final rules change the number of eventual registrants, the ultimate

62

Any forward-looking analysis of the costs and benefits that flow from these Title VII
requirements necessarily encompasses uncertain elements, since the final requirements have not
been adopted. For example, whether foreign security-based swap dealers will be subject to the
full range of Title VII requirements in all of their transactions will be determined in subsequent
rulemaking.

63

Title VII imposes a number of business conduct requirements designed to protect counterparties
to security-based swaps, including disclosures about material risks and conflicts of interest,
disclosures concerning the daily mark, or value of the position, and segregation of customer
assets and collateral from the dealer’s assets.

24

programmatic costs and benefits expected from Title VII may differ from those that were
described in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release. 64
Finally, the final rules determining how non-U.S. persons must perform their de minimis
and major participant threshold calculations may face limits as to how precisely they address the
risk mitigation goals of Title VII that are reflected in our rules implementing the de minimis
exception and the “major security-based swap participant” definition. On the one hand, the
scope of dealer and major participant regulation under Title VII may be subject to limitations on
the ability to control risk because the global nature of counterparty interconnections means that it
is difficult to prevent risk that pools in one geographic segment of the market from flowing
throughout the entire security-based swap network. On the other hand, there is a possibility that
the rules defining the scope of dealer and major participant regulation, including the territorial
application of the definitions, may capture certain activity that does not represent risk to the U.S.
financial system. Because these rules and guidance implementing Title VII regulatory
definitions will not capture all transactions and all entities that engage in security-based swap
activity, these rules and guidance therefore may create incentives for those entities at the
boundaries of the definitions to restructure their business in a way that allows them to operate
outside the scope of Title VII. However, as we described in the Intermediary Definitions
Adopting Release, we have sought to implement the statutory dealer and major participant
definitions in such a way as to impose the substantive rules of Title VII on those entities most

64

See section IV.I.1 for a discussion of how we expect the cross-border application of the de
minimis exception to alter the number of entities required to register with the Commission, and
how that may affect the programmatic costs and benefits of Title VII.

25

likely to contribute to those risks that Title VII is intended to address without imposing
unnecessary burdens on those who do not pose comparable risks to the U.S. financial system. 65
B. Scope of Title VII’s Application to Cross-Border Security-Based Swap Activity
Congress has given the Commission authority in Title VII to implement a security-based
swap regulatory framework to address the potential effects of security-based swap activity on
U.S. market participants, the financial stability of the United States, on the transparency of the
U.S. financial system, and on the protection of counterparties. 66 The global nature of the
security-based swap market and the high proportion of cross-border transactions in that market 67
mean that much of this activity occurs at least in part outside the United States and frequently
involves persons that are incorporated, organized, or established in a location outside the United

65

In adopting the definition of “security-based swap dealer,” we intended to determine the set of
entities in the security-based swap market for whom regulation “is warranted due to the nature of
their interactions with counterparties, or is warranted to promote market stability and
transparency.” See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30726. Similarly, in
adopting rules governing the “major security-based swap participant” definition, we sought to
impose regulations applicable to major security-based swap participants in a way that reflects
“when it would be ‘prudent’ that particular entities be subject to monitoring, management and
oversight of entities that may be systemically important or may significantly impact the U.S.
financial system.” See id. at 30666.
Future rulemakings that depend on these definitions are intended to address the transparency,
risk, and customer protection goals of Title VII. For example, to further risk mitigation in the
security-based swap market, we explained that “section 15F(e) of the Exchange Act and related
rules impose capital and margin requirements on dealers and major participants, which will
reduce the financial risks of these institutions and contribute to the stability of the security-based
swap market in particular and the U.S. financial system more generally.” See id. at 30723.

66

See note 11, supra. See also Pub. L. No. 111-203 sections 701-774 (providing for, among other
things, a comprehensive new regulatory framework for security-based swaps, including by: (i)
providing for the registration and comprehensive regulation of security-based swap dealers and
major security-based swap participants; (ii) imposing clearing and trade execution requirements
on security-based swaps, subject to certain exceptions; and (iii) creating real-time reporting and
public dissemination regimes for security-based swaps).

67

See section II.A, supra (noting that cross-border activity accounts for the majority of securitybased swaps involving U.S. firms).

26

States. 68 In light of these market realities, we noted in the proposal that applying Title VII only
to persons incorporated, organized, or established within the United States or only to securitybased swap activity occurring entirely within the United States would inappropriately exclude
from regulation a majority of security-based swap activity that involves U.S. persons or
otherwise involves conduct within the United States, even though such activity raises the types
of concerns that we believe Congress intended to address through Title VII. 69
Because some commenters had, prior to the proposal, argued that section 30(c) of the
Exchange Act limited our ability to reach certain types of activity occurring at least in part
outside the United States, 70 we discussed in some detail in the proposal our preliminary views on
the appropriate approach to determining whether certain security-based swap activity that
involves some conduct outside the United States also occurs within the United States for
purposes of Title VII. 71 In this subsection, we discuss comments received on this question
following publication of our proposal and explain our final views – which remain largely
unchanged from the proposal – on the proper approach to determining whether cross-border
security-based swap activity occurs, in relevant part, within the United States. 72 We then briefly

For example, a single financial firm engaged in dealing activity may utilize two or more entities
domiciled in different countries to effectuate a single transaction with a counterparty that may
similarly use multiple entities domiciled in different countries.

See id. at 30983. Exchange Act section 30(c) was added to the Act by Title VII and provides,
among other things, that “[n]o provision of [Title VII] . . . shall apply to any person insofar as
such person transacts a business in security-based swaps without the jurisdiction of the United
States,” unless that business is transacted in contravention of rules prescribed to prevent evasion
of Title VII. See section 30(c) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78dd(c), added by section 772(b)
of the Dodd-Frank Act.

adopting here. 73
1. Commenters’ Views
Prior to our proposal, several commenters raised concerns about the application of Title
VII to security-based swap activity in the cross-border context and specifically about the
possibility that we would impose Title VII requirements on “extraterritorial” conduct. We
received only a few comments on this issue in response to our preliminary views set forth in the
proposal, and these generally focused on the application of section 30(c) of the Exchange Act to
specific types of activity that we proposed to subject to Title VII rather than the proposed
territorial framework more broadly.
One commenter expressed general agreement with our proposed guidance. 74 Three
commenters suggested that textual differences between section 30(c) of the Exchange Act and
section 2(i) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”) do not require the Commission to take a
different approach to application of Title VII to cross-border security-based swap activity from
that taken by the CFTC. 75 Two commenters expressed the view that section 30(c) of the
73

The following discussion does not reflect a comprehensive analysis of the full range of
transactions that may fall within our territorial approach to application of Title VII or of the full
range of substantive requirements to which such transactions may be subject under Title VII.
It is important to note that our approach to the application of Title VII security-based swap dealer
and major security-based swap participant registration requirements does not limit, alter, or
address the cross-border reach or extraterritorial application of any other provisions of the federal
securities laws, including Commission rules, regulations, interpretations, or guidance.

consultation and coordination between the SEC, CFTC, and prudential regulators, and arguing
that differences between Exchange Act section 30(c) and CEA section 2(i) do not require the
Commission to take an approach to regulation of cross-border security-based swap activity that is
“fundamentally different” from that taken by the CFTC); SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at A-4 to A-5

of congressional intent that rules be harmonized); FOA Letter at 7 (referring to this element of the

28

Exchange Act, considered in light of what they described as the risk-based focus of Title VII,
prohibited the Commission from imposing Title VII requirements on transactions carried out
within the United States but booked in locations outside the United States. 76 One commenter
stated that section 30(c) of the Exchange Act prevents us from imposing Title VII requirements
on transactions of guaranteed foreign affiliates of U.S. persons. 77 One commenter argued that
section 30(c) prevents application of Title VII to certain joint ventures. 78
2. Scope of Application of Title VII in the Cross-Border Context
We continue to believe that a territorial approach to the application of Title VII is
appropriate. This approach, properly understood, is grounded in the text of the relevant statutory
provisions and is designed to help ensure that our application of the relevant provisions is
SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter). Section 2(i) of the CEA provides, inter alia, that Title VII requirements
will not apply to activities outside the United States unless they “have a direct and significant
connection with activities in, or effect on, commerce of the United States.” 7 U.S.C. 2(i). The
CFTC Cross-Border Guidance was adopted as an interpretation of this provision. See CFTC
Cross-Border Guidance, 78 FR at 45295.
76

See SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at 4, A-4 to A-6 (acknowledging that proposed application of Title
VII to transactions conducted within the United States between two non-U.S. persons is
consistent with Commission practice in traditional securities markets but arguing that similar
language in sections 30(b) and 30(c) of the Exchange Act should be read differently, given the
different nature of security-based swap transactions and focus of Title VII on risk); FOA Letter at
7 (referring to this element of the SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter). These commenters argue that we
should focus on risks to the U.S. financial system and the protection of U.S. counterparties, and
that neither concern is raised by transactions between two non-U.S. persons that happen to occur
within the United States. See SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at A-5 to A-6. We continue to believe that
this argument does not account for the full range of concerns addressed by Title VII, but, as
discussed further below, we are not addressing issues surrounding the proposed “transaction
conducted within the United States” definition in this release.
Because, as discussed above, we are not adopting “transaction conducted within the United
States” as part of the final rule, we anticipate considering these comments in connection with
soliciting additional public comment.

29

consistent with the goals that the statute was intended to achieve.
(a) Overview and General Approach
As in our proposal, our analysis begins with an examination of the text of the statutory
provision that imposes the relevant requirement. The statutory language generally identifies the
types of conduct that trigger the relevant requirement and, by extension, the focus of the
statute. 79 Once we have identified the activity regulated by the statutory provision, we can
determine whether a person is engaged in conduct that the statutory provision regulates and
whether this conduct occurs within the United States. When the statutory text does not describe
the relevant activity with specificity or provides for further Commission interpretation of
statutory terms or requirements, this analysis may require us to identify through interpretation of
the statutory text the specific activity that is relevant under the statute or to incorporate prior
interpretations of the relevant statutory text. 80

79

See Morrison v. National Australia Bank, Ltd., 130 S. Ct. 2869, 2884 (2010) (identifying focus of
statutory language to determine what conduct was relevant in determining whether the statute was
being applied to domestic conduct).
Section 772(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act amends section 30 of the Exchange Act to provide that
“[n]o provision of [Title VII] . . . shall apply to any person insofar as such person transacts a
business in security-based swaps without the jurisdiction of the United States,” unless that
business is transacted in contravention of rules prescribed to prevent evasion of Title VII. See
section 30(c) of the Exchange Act. As noted above, some commenters suggest that statutory
language requiring us to coordinate and consult with the CFTC also requires us to interpret
section 30(c) of the Exchange Act in a manner similar to the CFTC’s interpretation of CEA
section 2(i). See note 75, supra. However, in light of the differences between Exchange Act
section 30(c) and CEA section 2(i), we do not find this argument persuasive. As noted above,
however, in developing final rules we have carefully considered the CFTC’s guidance and the
underlying policy rationales, consistent with the statutory requirement that we consult and
coordinate with the CFTC.

80

The Dodd-Frank Act provides that the CFTC and SEC “shall further define” several terms,
including “security-based swap dealer” and “major security-based swap participant.” DoddFrank Act section 712(d) (emphasis added). The Commissions fulfilled this mandate in the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77
FR at 30973.

30

As noted above, the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted, in part, with the intent to address the
risks to the financial stability of the United States posed by entities engaged in security-based
swap activity, to promote transparency in the U.S. financial system, and to protect counterparties
to such transactions. 81 These purposes, considered together with the specific statutory
requirement, lead us to conclude that it is appropriate to impose the statutory requirements, and
rules or regulations thereunder, on security-based swap activity occurring within the United
States even if certain conduct in connection with the security-based swap also occurs in part
outside the United States.
Contrary to the views expressed by some commenters, 82 we do not agree that the location
of risk alone should necessarily determine the scope of an appropriate territorial application of
every Title VII requirement, given that the definition and the relevant regulatory regime address
not only risk but other concerns as well, as just described. For example, neither the statutory
definition of “security-based swap dealer,” our subsequent further definition of the term pursuant
to section 712(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act, nor the regulatory requirements applicable to securitybased swap dealers focus solely on risk to the U.S. financial system. 83
We believe that this approach to territorial application of Title VII provides a reasonable
means of helping to ensure that our regulatory framework focuses on security-based swap
activity that is most likely to raise the concerns that Congress intended to address in Title VII,
81

See e.g., note 11, supra. See also Exchange Act section 15F(h) (establishing business conduct
standards for security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants).

31

including the potential effects of security-based swap activity on U.S. market participants, on the
financial stability of the United States, on the transparency of the U.S. financial markets, and on
the protection of counterparties. 84 Persons that engage in relevant conduct, as identified through
this analysis, within the United States are not, in our view, “transact[ing] a business in securitybased swaps without the jurisdiction of the United States,” 85 and thus are properly subject to
regulation under Title VII.
(b) Territorial Approach to Application of Title VII Security-Based Swap Dealer
Registration Requirements
In determining whether specific transactions should be included in a person’s dealer de
minimis calculation, we begin by looking to the statutory text to identify the type of dealing
activity that the statute describes as relevant to a person’s status as a security-based swap
dealer. 86 Section 3(a)(71) of the Exchange Act 87 defines security-based swap dealer as a person
that engages in any of the following types of activity:
(i)

holding oneself out as a dealer in security-based swaps,

(ii)

making a market in security-based swaps,

(iii)

regularly entering into security-based swaps with counterparties as an ordinary course of

business for one’s own account, or

See note 11, supra.

Exchange Act section 30(c).

86

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30616-30619 (further defining
“security-based swap dealer” by identifying the types of activities that characterize dealing and
that would therefore lead a transaction to be required to be included in a person’s de minimis
calculation under Exchange Act rule 3a71-2).

87

15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(71).

32

(iv)

engaging in any activity causing oneself to be commonly known in the trade as a dealer

in security-based swaps. 88
In accordance with the authority provided by section 712(d)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act, which
provides that the CFTC and the Commission shall by rule further define, among other things,
“security-based swap dealer,” 89 we further interpreted the statutory definition by identifying the
types of activities that are relevant in determining whether a person is a security-based swap
dealer. 90 Pursuant to this further definition, indicia of security-based swap dealing activity
include any of the following activities:
•

providing liquidity to market professionals or other persons in connection with
security-based swaps;

•

seeking to profit by providing liquidity in connection with security-based swaps,

•

providing advice in connection with security-based swaps or structuring securitybased swaps;

•

having a regular clientele and actively soliciting clients;

•

using inter-dealer brokers; and

•

acting as a market maker on an organized security-based swap exchange or
trading system. 91

As the foregoing lists illustrate, both the statutory text and our interpretation further
defining the statutory term include within the security-based swap dealer definition a range of
activities. In the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, we stated that transactions arising

from dealing activity, as identified by the indicia described above, would generally be subject to
relevant Title VII requirements applicable to dealers, including that such transactions be included
in a person’s calculations for purposes of the dealer de minimis calculations. Our territorial
approach applying Title VII to dealing activity similarly looks to whether any of the activities
described above occur within the United States, and not simply to the location of the risk, as
some commenters suggested is required under section 30(c) of the Exchange Act. 92 To the
extent that such activity does occur within the United States, the person engaged in such activity,
in our view, is transacting a business in security-based swaps within the United States, 93 and
therefore applying Title VII to the activity by, among other things, requiring the person to
include transactions arising from such activity in its de minimis calculation is consistent with a
territorial approach, even if some of this activity (or other activity bearing the indicia of dealing
activity) relating to the transaction also occurs outside the United States.
This approach is consistent with the purposes of the dealer definition and the de minimis
exception as they relate to dealer regulation under Title VII. The de minimis exception excludes
from the dealer registration requirement those entities that may engage in dealing activity but
that do so in amounts that may not raise, to a degree that warrants application of security-based
swap dealer requirements, the risk, counterparty protection, or other concerns that the dealer
registration and regulatory framework were intended to address. 94 On the other hand, dealing
activity, as identified by the types of activities described above, carried out within the United

Cf. Exchange Act section 30(c) (limiting the application of, among other provisions, Title VII to

94

See, e.g., Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30629-30 (noting that the de
minimis threshold is intended to capture firms that engage in a level of dealing activity that is
likely to raise the types of concerns that the dealer regulatory framework is intended to address).

34

States at levels exceeding the de minimis threshold is likely to raise these concerns, which would
be addressed by requiring persons engaged in that volume of dealing activity to register as
security-based swap dealers under Title VII and to comply with relevant requirements applicable
to security-based swap dealers. Accordingly, to the extent that a person engages in dealing
activity within the United States that results in transactions in a notional amount exceeding the
applicable de minimis threshold, it is appropriate to require the person to register as a securitybased swap dealer.
i.

Dealing Activity of U.S. Persons

Under the foregoing analysis and consistent with our proposal, when a U.S. person as
defined under this final rule 95 engages in dealing activity, it necessarily engages in such activity
within the United States, even when it enters into such transactions through a foreign branch or
office. As discussed in further detail below, the definition of “U.S. person” in the final rule is
intended, in part, to identify those persons for whom it is reasonable to infer that a significant
portion of their financial and legal relationships are likely to exist within the United States and
that it is therefore reasonable to conclude that risk arising from their security-based swap
activities could manifest itself within the United States, regardless of the location of their
counterparties, given the ongoing nature of the obligations that result from security-based swap
transactions. 96
Wherever a U.S. person enters into a transaction in a dealing capacity, it is the U.S.
person as a whole that is holding itself out as a dealer in security-based swaps, given that the

95

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(4).

96

See section IV.C, infra. In our view, dealing activity involving such persons is particularly likely
to raise the types of concerns Title VII was intended to address, including those related to risk to
the U.S. financial system, transparency of the U.S. financial markets, and customer protection.

35

financial resources of the entire person stand behind any dealing activity of the U.S. person, both
at the time it enters into the transaction and for the life of the contract, even when the U.S. person
enters into the transaction through a foreign branch or office. Moreover, the U.S. person as a
whole seeks to profit by providing liquidity and engaging in market-making in security-based
swaps, and the financial resources of the entire person enable it to provide liquidity and engage
in market-making in connection with security-based swaps. Its dealing counterparties will look
to the entire U.S. person, even when the U.S. person enters into the transaction through a foreign
branch or office, for performance on the transaction. The entire U.S. person assumes, and stands
behind, the obligations arising from the resulting agreement and is directly exposed to liability
arising from non-performance of the non-U.S. person. 97
For these reasons, in our view a person does not hold itself out as a security-based swap
dealer as anything other than a single person even when it enters into transactions through its
foreign branch or office. 98 Because the foreign branch generally could not operate as a dealer
absent the financial and other resources of the entire U.S. person, its dealing activity with all of
its counterparties, including dealing activity conducted through its foreign branch or office, is
best characterized as occurring, at least in part, within the United States and should therefore be
included in the person’s de minimis threshold calculation. 99

97

Cf. SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at 4, A-5 (stating that main purpose of Title VII is to address risk
arising from security-based swap activity).

98

This is consistent with the view expressed in our proposing release. See Cross-Border Proposing
Release, 78 FR at 30985.

99

As discussed in further detail below, this interpretation is consistent with the goals of dealer
regulation under Title VII. Security-based swap activity that results in a transaction involving a
U.S.-person counterparty creates ongoing obligations that are borne by a U.S. person and, as
such, is properly viewed as occurring within the United States. See note 186, infra.

36

ii.

Dealing Transactions of Non-U.S. Persons that are Subject to Recourse
Guarantees by their U.S. Affiliates

In the proposing release, we explained that we preliminarily believed that a territorial
approach consistent with the text and purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act encompasses transactions
involving a non-U.S. person counterparty whose dealing activity is guaranteed by a U.S.
person. 100 However, because we proposed to treat non-U.S. persons receiving a guarantee on
their security-based swap transactions from a U.S. person like any other non-U.S. person for
purposes of the de minimis exception (i.e., requiring them to include in their calculations only
dealing activity involving U.S.-person counterparties or transactions conducted within the United
States), we did not elaborate specifically on how the presence of a guarantee related to a
territorial application of the dealer definition, including the de minimis exception. Because our
final rule requires transactions of non-U.S. persons whose obligations under the security-based
swap are subject to recourse guarantees enforceable against their U.S. affiliates to be included in
the dealer de minimis calculation of the non-U.S. person, we address it here.

100

In our proposal, we noted that in a security-based swap transaction between two non-U.S. persons
where the performance of at least one side of the transaction is guaranteed by a U.S. person, the
guarantee gives the guaranteed person’s counterparty recourse to the U.S. person for performance
of obligations owed by the guaranteed person under the security-based swap, and the U.S.
guarantor exposes itself to the risk of the security-based swap as if it were a counterparty to the
security-based swap through the security-based swap activity engaged in by the guaranteed
person. See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 30986-87. This interpretation of
guarantee was consistent with our discussion of the application of the major participant tests to
guaranteed positions in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, where we, together with
the CFTC, noted that a person’s security-based swap positions are attributed to a parent, other
affiliate, or guarantor for purposes of the major participant analysis to the extent that the
counterparties to those positions have recourse to that parent, other affiliate, or guarantor in
connection with the position; as we noted in that release, positions are not attributed in the
absence of recourse. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30689. In this
release, we continue to use the term “guarantee” to refer to an arrangement pursuant to which one
party to a security-based swap transaction has recourse to its counterparty’s parent, other affiliate,
or guarantor with respect to the counterparty’s obligations owed under the transaction. See
section IV.E.1(b), infra.

37

In our view, a non-U.S. person engaged in dealing activity, to the extent that one or more
transactions arising from such activity are guaranteed by a U.S. person, is engaged in relevant
activity for purposes of the security-based swap dealer definition within the United States, with
respect to those transactions. By virtue of the guarantee, the non-U.S. person effectively acts
together with the U.S. person to engage in the dealing activity that results in the transactions, and
the non-U.S. person’s dealing activity with respect to such transactions cannot reasonably be
isolated from the U.S. person’s activity in providing the guarantee. The U.S.-person guarantor
together with the non-U.S. person whose dealing activity it guarantees, and not just the non-U.S.
person, may seek to profit by providing liquidity and engaging in market-making in securitybased swaps, and the non-U.S. person provides liquidity and engages in market-making in
connection with security-based swaps by drawing on the U.S. person’s financial resources. 101
The non-U.S. person’s counterparty, pursuant to the recourse guarantee, looks to both the nonU.S. person and its U.S. guarantor, which is responsible for performance on the transaction that
is part of the non-U.S. person’s dealing activity. In sum, the non-U.S. person is engaged in the
United States in relevant dealing activity identified in the statutory definition and in our jointly
adopted further definition of “security-based swap dealer.”

101

Even if the U.S. guarantor generally does not hold itself out as a dealer or make a market in
security-based swaps, the U.S. guarantor enables the non-U.S. person whose dealing activity it
guarantees to engage in dealing activity by providing financial backing. We note that references
to “guarantee,” “recourse guarantee,” or “rights of recourse,” as those terms are used in this
release, may describe economic relationships that are different from “guarantee” under section
2(a)(1) of the Securities Act. We note, however, that, depending on the nature of the “guarantee,”
“recourse guarantee,” or “rights of recourse” provided by the guarantor, the transaction at issue
may involve not only a security-based swap between two non-U.S. persons but also the offer and
sale of a security by a U.S. person, given that a “guarantee” of a security-based swap is itself a
separate security issued by the U.S. guarantor. See, e.g., Securities Act section 2(a)(1), 15 U.S.C.
77b(a)(1) (including in the statutory definition of “security” a guarantee of a security).

38

Moreover, the economic reality of the non-U.S. person’s dealing activity, where the
resulting transactions are guaranteed by a U.S. person, is identical, in relevant respects, to a
transaction entered into directly by the U.S. guarantor. By virtue of the guarantee, transactions
arising from the non-U.S. person’s dealing activity result in risk from the transaction being borne
by a U.S. person (the guarantor, which is responsible for the transactions it guarantees in a
manner similar to a direct counterparty to the transactions) and potentially the U.S. financial
system in a manner similar to a dealing transaction entered into directly by a U.S. person. As
with transactions entered into directly by a U.S. person, transactions for which a counterparty has
a right of recourse against a U.S. person create risk to a U.S. person and potentially the U.S.
financial system regardless of the location of the counterparty.
Our interpretation of the statutory text of the definition, as well as our further definition
of the term, as it applies to these entities is consistent with the purposes of Title VII, as discussed
above. The exposure of the U.S. guarantor creates risk to U.S. persons and potentially to the
U.S. financial system via the guarantor to a comparable degree as if the transaction were entered
into directly by a U.S. person. We understand that in some circumstances a counterparty may
choose not to enter into a security-based swap transaction (or may not do so on the same terms)
with a non-U.S. subsidiary of a U.S. person when that non-U.S. subsidiary is acting in a dealing
capacity to the extent that its dealing activity is not subject to a recourse guarantee by a U.S.
affiliate, absent other circumstances (e.g., adequate capitalization of the hitherto-guaranteed
affiliate).
One commenter noted that U.S. guarantors may provide guarantees for a variety of
reasons, including to satisfy regulatory requirements, to “manage capital treatment across an
entity,” and to “avoid negative credit rating consequences,” and argued that a guarantee may

39

therefore not create risk within the United States. 102 Absent the creation of such risk, this
commenter further argued that a guarantee creates “no nexus for purposes of section 30(c) of the
Exchange Act.” 103 However, regardless of the motivation for providing the guarantee, the nonU.S. person’s dealing activity still occurs within the United States and creates risk within the
United States in the manner described above. The commenter provided no evidence that the
motivation for providing a guarantee affects this analysis: It neither alters the risk created within
the United States by such a guarantee when it is provided by a U.S. person nor affects the
economic reality of the transaction. Moreover, even if a person provides guarantees not in
response to counterparty demands but to satisfy regulatory requirements or to avoid negative
credit rating consequences, the very reasons for issuing the guarantee suggest that the non-U.S.
person would not be able to engage in dealing activity, or to do so on the same terms, without the
guarantee. 104
In sum, the guarantee provided by a U.S. person poses risk to U.S. persons and
potentially to the U.S. financial system, and both the non-U.S. person whose dealing activity is

103

104

In addition, this commenter suggested that any risk created by guarantees provided to prudentially
regulated foreign entities is adequately addressed by the foreign prudential regulation. See id.
Although we recognize that foreign prudential regulation may reduce the risk that a guaranteed
foreign affiliate’s counterparties will seek to enforce the terms of the guarantee against the U.S.
guarantor (depending on the quality of prudential regulation in the foreign jurisdiction), it does
not eliminate this risk, and the counterparty continues to retain a right of recourse under the
guarantee against the guarantor.
Given the role of a foreign person whose activity is guaranteed in creating risk within the United
States through its dealing activity, we believe that it is important to ensure that such a foreign
person be required to register as a security-based swap dealer to the extent that its guaranteed
dealing transactions (together with any dealing transactions with U.S. persons) are included in its
de minimis threshold calculations. As noted above, our proposal set forth a framework under
which substituted compliance potentially would be available for certain Title VII requirements,
including for dealer-specific requirements such as capital and margin, which should mitigate
concerns about overlapping regulation of such entities.

40

guaranteed and its counterparty rely on the creditworthiness of the U.S. guarantor when entering
into a security-based swap transaction and for the duration of the security-based swap. The
economic reality of this transaction, even though entered into by a non-U.S. person, is
substantially identical, in relevant respects, to a transaction entered into directly by a U.S.
person. Accordingly, in our view, it is consistent with both the statutory text and with the
purposes of the statute to identify such transactions as occurring within the United States for
purposes of Title VII.
iii.

Dealing Activity of Other Non-U.S. Persons

In our proposal, we stated that non-U.S. persons engaging in dealing activity would be
required to count toward their de minimis thresholds only transactions arising from their dealing
activity with U.S. persons or dealing activity otherwise conducted within the United States.
Under the approach described above, and consistent with our proposal, we believe that a nonU.S. person engaged in dealing activity with U.S. persons engages in relevant activity for
purposes of the security-based swap dealer definition within the United States. 105
Dealing activity of non-U.S. persons that involves counterparties who are U.S. persons,
as that term is defined in the final rule, necessarily involves the performance by the non-U.S.
person of relevant activity under the “security-based swap dealer” definition at least in part
within the United States. For example, in our view, a non-U.S. person engaging in dealing
activity with a U.S. person is holding itself out as a dealer in security-based swaps within the

105

We continue to believe that security-based swap activity carried out within the United States may
also be relevant activity under our territorial approach, even if the resulting transaction involves
two non-U.S. counterparties. As discussed below, however, we anticipate soliciting additional
public comment regarding the issue.

41

United States. 106 Similarly, by entering into a transaction with a U.S. person in a dealing
capacity, it is seeking to profit by providing liquidity within the United States and possibly
engaging in market-making in security-based swaps within the United States, given that its
decision to engage in dealing activity with U.S. persons, as defined by the rule, affects the
liquidity of the security-based swap market within the United States. Particularly at volumes in
excess of the de minimis threshold, entering into security-based swap transactions in a dealing
capacity with U.S. persons likely is the type of activity that would cause a non-U.S. person “to
be commonly known in the trade as a dealer in security-based swaps” 107 within the United
States, that constitutes “regularly entering into security-based swaps with counterparties as an
ordinary course of business for one’s own account” 108 within the United States, and that permits
a reasonable inference that it has a regular clientele and actively solicits clients within the United
States. 109
Our application of the statute to non-U.S. persons is consistent with the purposes of Title
VII, as discussed above. U.S. persons incur risks arising from this dealing activity, which in turn
potentially creates risk to other market participants and the U.S. financial system more generally,
and transactions with U.S. persons raise counterparty protection and market transparency
concerns that Title VII is intended to address. Accordingly, we believe that the dealing activity

106

Given the global nature of the security-based swap market, U.S. persons seeking to access this
market may readily do so through both U.S.-person dealers and foreign dealers. That a foreign
dealer holding itself out as a dealer to U.S. persons is based in, and operating out of, a foreign
jurisdiction does not alter the economic reality of its activity: It is holding itself out as a dealer
within the United States in a manner largely indistinguishable from a U.S.-person dealer that
“hangs out its shingle” in Manhattan.

of a non-U.S. person that involves a U.S.-person counterparty is appropriately characterized as
occurring, at least in part, within the United States. 110
(c) Territorial Approach to Application of Title VII Major Security-Based Swap
Participant Registration Requirements
As in our territorial approach to the security-based swap dealer definition (including the
de minimis exception) described above, our territorial approach to the application of the major
security-based swap participant definition looks first to the statutory text to identify the types of
activity that are relevant for purposes of the definition. Section 3(a)(67) of the Exchange Act
provides that a major security-based swap participant is any person who is not a dealer and who
satisfies one or more of the following requirements:
(i)

maintains a substantial position in security-based swaps for any of the major securitybased swap categories, 111 excluding certain positions;

(ii)

has outstanding security-based swaps that create substantial counterparty exposure that
could have serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the U.S. banking system or
financial markets; or

(iii)

is a highly leveraged financial entity that maintains substantial position in outstanding
security-based swaps in any major security-based swap category. 112

110

Although at least one commenter suggested that we lack the authority under section 30(c) of the
Exchange Act to require non-U.S. person joint-ventures to aggregate relevant dealing transactions
with the relevant dealing transactions of multiple investors in the joint-venture, see note 78,
supra, we believe that our limitation on application of the aggregation requirement only to the
transactions of such non-U.S. persons that occur within the United States (because they involve
U.S.-person counterparties or are subject to a recourse guarantee against a U.S. person) is
consistent with our territorial approach.

111

The statute further provides the Commission with the authority to determine the scope of these
categories. See Exchange Act section 3(a)(67)(A)(ii)(I).

112

Exchange Act section 3(a)(67)(A).

43

The statute directs us to further define, jointly with the CFTC, “major security-based swap
participant” 113 and separately provides us with authority to “define . . . the term ‘substantial
position’ at the threshold that the Commission determines to be prudent for the effective
monitoring, management, and oversight of entities that are systemically important or can
significantly impact the financial system of the United States.” 114
Pursuant to these provisions, we further interpreted this definition by, among other
things, defining what constitutes a “substantial position” and “substantial counterparty exposure”
for purposes of the major security-based swap participant definition. 115 In doing so, we set forth
calculation methodologies and thresholds for each and adopted rules requiring persons that
exceeded these thresholds to register as major security-based swap participants. 116 These
thresholds were designed to identify persons that were likely to pose counterparty credit risks, as
such risks are “more closely linked to the statutory criteria that the definition focuses on entities
that are ‘systemically important’ or can ‘significantly impact’ the U.S. financial system.” 117 We
also noted that our definition of “substantial position” was intended to address the risk that
would be posed by the default of multiple entities close in time and the aggregate risks presented
by a person’s security-based swap activity, as these considerations reflect the market risk
concerns expressly identified in the statute. 118

44

The statutory focus of the major security-based swap participant definition differs from
that of security-based swap dealer, in that the security-based swap dealer definition focuses on
activity that may raise the concerns that dealer regulation is intended to address, while the major
security-based swap participant definition focuses on positions that may raise systemic risk
concerns within the United States. Accordingly, a territorial approach to application of the
definition of major security-based swap participant involves identifying security-based swap
positions that exist within the United States. 119 In our view, and consistent with the approach
taken in our proposal, a security-based swap position exists within the United States when it is
held by or with a U.S. person, or when it is subject to a recourse guarantee against a U.S.
person, 120 as the risks associated with such positions are borne within the United States, and
given the involvement of U.S. persons may, at the thresholds established for the major securitybased swap participant definition, give rise to the types of systemic risk within the United States
that major security-based swap regulation is intended to address. To the extent that a position
exists within the United States in this sense, we believe that it is appropriate under a territorial
approach to require a market participant, whether a U.S. person or otherwise, that is a
counterparty or guarantor with respect to that position, to include that position in its major
security-based swap participant threshold calculations, wherever the security-based swap was
entered into.

substantial counterparty exposure that could have serious adverse effects on the financial stability
of the United States banking system or financial markets”).
119

Cf. Morrison, 130 S. Ct. at 2884 (performing a textual analysis to identify the focus of the
statute).

120

The economic reality of a position subject to such a guarantee, even though entered into by a nonU.S. person, is substantially identical in relevant respects to a position entered into directly by the
U.S. guarantor. See section II.B.2(b)ii, supra.

45

(d) Regulations Necessary or Appropriate to Prevent Evasion of Title VII
Consistent with our proposal, we interpret section 30(c) of the Exchange Act as not
requiring us to find that actual evasion has occurred or is occurring to invoke our authority to
reach activity “without the jurisdiction of the United States” or to limit application of Title VII to
security-based swap activity “without the jurisdiction of the United States” only to business that
is transacted in a way that is purposefully intended to evade Title VII. Section 30(c) of the
Exchange Act authorizes the Commission to apply Title VII to persons transacting a business
“without the jurisdiction of the United States” if they contravene rules that the Commission has
prescribed as “necessary or appropriate to prevent the evasion of any provision” of Title VII.
The focus of this provision is not whether such rules impose Title VII requirements only on
entities engaged in evasive activity but whether the rules are generally “necessary or
appropriate” to prevent potential evasion of Title VII. In other words, section 30(c) of the
Exchange Act permits us to impose prophylactic rules intended to prevent possible purposeful
evasion, even though such rules may affect or prohibit some non-evasive conduct. Moreover,
exercising the section 30(c) authority does not require us to draw a distinction between conduct
“without the jurisdiction of the United States” that is purposely evasive as opposed to identical
conduct that was motivated by some non-evasive purpose. Indeed, to interpret section 30(c)
authority otherwise could create a bifurcated regulatory regime where the same conduct is
treated differently based on parties’ underlying purpose for engaging in it, which could create
extraordinary oversight challenges involving difficult subjective considerations concerning
parties’ true intentions in entering any given transaction or establishing particular business

46

structures, and could create significant competitive advantages for incumbent firms. 121 Thus, we
read the statute to permit us to prescribe such rules to conduct without the jurisdiction of the
United States, even if those rules would also apply to a market participant that has been
transacting business through a pre-existing market structure, such as a foreign branch or foreign
affiliate whose positions are guaranteed by the market participant, established for valid business
purposes, provided the proposed rule or guidance is designed to prevent possibly evasive
conduct. 122
C. Principles Guiding Final Approach to Applying “Security-Based Swap Dealer” and
“Major Security-Based Swap Participant” Definitions in the Cross-Border Context
As in our proposal, our final rules and guidance reflect our careful consideration of the
global nature of the security-based swap market and the types of risks created by security-based
swap activity to the U.S. financial system and market participants and other concerns that the
dealer and major security-based swap participant definitions were intended to address, as well as
the needs of a well-functioning security-based swap market. 123 We also have been guided by the
purpose of Title VII 124 and the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, including the
following:

121

Such an interpretation of our anti-evasion authority, for example, could privilege incumbent firms
by allowing them to leverage existing business models that may not be available to new entrants
under rules promulgated pursuant to that authority.

122

As a general matter, the final rules adopted in this release are not being applied to persons who
are “transacting a business in security-based swaps without the jurisdiction of the United States”
within the meaning of section 30(c) of the Exchange Act. See sections II.B.2(a)-(c), supra.
However, as noted below, the Commission also believes that these rules are necessary or
appropriate as a prophylactic measure to help prevent the evasion of the provisions of the
Exchange Act that were added by the Dodd-Frank Act and thus help ensure that the particular
purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act addressed by the rule are not undermined. See, e.g., section
II.B.2(d) and note 186, infra.

Consistent International Standards—To promote effective and consistent global
regulation of swaps and security-based swaps, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the
Commission and the CFTC to consult and coordinate with foreign regulatory
authorities on the “establishment of consistent international standards” with respect to
the regulation of swaps and security-based swaps. 131 In this regard, the Commission
recognizes that regulators in other jurisdictions are currently engaged in
implementing their own regulatory reforms of the OTC derivatives markets and that
our application of Title VII to cross-border activities may affect the policy decisions
of these other regulators as they seek to address potential conflicts or overlaps in the
regulatory requirements that apply to market participants under their authority. 132

At times, these principles reinforce one another; at other times, they may be in tension.
For instance, regulating risk posed to the United States may, depending on the final rules, make
it more costly for U.S.-based firms to conduct security-based swap business, particularly in
foreign markets, compared to foreign firms; it could make foreign firms less willing to deal with
U.S. persons; and it could discourage foreign firms from carrying out security-based swap
dealing activity through branches or offices located in the United States. On the other hand,
providing U.S. persons greater access to foreign security-based swap markets may, depending on
the final rules, fail to appropriately address the risks posed to the United States from transactions

conducted in part outside the United States or create opportunities for market participants to
evade the application of Title VII, particularly until such time as other jurisdictions adopt similar
comprehensive and comparable derivative regulations.
Balancing these sometimes competing principles has been complicated by the fact that
Title VII imposes a new regulatory regime in a global marketplace. Title VII establishes reforms
that will have implications for entities that compete internationally in the global security-based
swap market. We have generally sought, in accordance with the statutory factors described
above, to avoid creating opportunities for market participants to evade Title VII requirements,
whether by restructuring their business or other means, or the potential for overlapping or
conflicting regulations. We also have considered the needs for a well-functioning security-based
swap market and for avoiding disruption that may reduce liquidity, competition, efficiency,
transparency, or stability in the security-based swap market.
III.

Baseline
To assess the economic impact of the final rules described in this release, we are using as

our baseline the security-based swap market as it exists at the time of this release, including
applicable rules we have already adopted but excluding rules that we have proposed but not yet
finalized. 133 The analysis includes the statutory and regulatory provisions that currently govern
the security-based swap market pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. 134 We acknowledge limitations
in the degree to which we can quantitatively characterize the current state of the security-based

133

We also consider, where appropriate, the impact of rules and technical standards promulgated by
other regulators, such as the CFTC and the European Securities and Markets Authority, on
practices in the security-based swap market.

134

As noted above, we have not yet adopted other substantive requirements of Title VII that may
affect how firms structure their security-based swap business and market practices more
generally.

swap market. As we describe in more detail below, because the available data on security-based
swap transactions do not cover the entire market, we have developed an understanding of market
activity using a sample that includes only certain portions of the market.
A. Current Security-Based Swap Market
Our analysis of the state of the current security-based swap market is based on data
obtained from DTCC-TIW, especially data regarding the activity of market participants in the
single-name CDS market during the period from 2008 to 2012. While other repositories may
collect data on transactions in total return swaps on equity and debt, we do not currently have
access to such data for these products (or other products that are security-based swaps). We have
previously noted that the definition of security-based swaps is not limited to single-name CDS
but we believe that the single-name CDS data are sufficiently representative of the market and
therefore can directly inform the analysis of the state of the current security-based swap
market. 135 Additionally, the data for index CDS encompass both broad-based security indices
and narrow-based security indices, and “security-based swap” in relevant part encompasses
135

According to data published by the Bank for International Settlements (“BIS”), the global
notional amount outstanding in equity forwards and swaps as of June 2013 was $2.32 trillion.
The notional amount outstanding in single-name CDS was approximately $13.14 trillion, in
multi-name index CDS was approximately $10.17 trillion, and in multi-name, non-index CDS
was approximately $1.04 trillion. See Semi-annual OTC derivatives statistics at end-June 2013
(Nov. 2013), Table 19, available at: http://www.bis.org/statistics/dt1920a.pdf. As we stated in
the Cross-Border Proposing Release, for the purposes of this analysis, we assume that multi-name
index CDS are not narrow-based index CDS and therefore, do not fall within the security-based
swap definition. See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31120 n.1301; see also
Exchange Act section 3(a)(68)(A); Further Definition of “Swap,” “Security-Based-Swap,” and
“Security-Based Swap Agreement”; Mixed Swaps; Security-Based Swap Agreement
Recordkeeping, Exchange Act Release No. 67453 (July 18, 2012), 77 FR 48208 (Aug. 13, 2012)
(“Product Definitions Adopting Release”), 77 FR 48208. We also assume that all instruments
reported as equity forwards and swaps are security-based swaps, potentially resulting in
underestimation of the proportion of the security-based swap market represented by single-name
CDS. Based on those assumptions, single-name CDS appear to constitute roughly 80 percent of
the security-based swap market. No commenters disputed these assumptions, and we therefore
continue to believe that, although the BIS data reflect the global OTC derivatives market, and not
just the U.S. market, these ratios are an adequate representation of the U.S. market.

51

swaps based on single securities or reference entities or on narrow-based security indices.
Accordingly, with the exception of the analysis regarding the degree of overlap between
participation in the single-name CDS market and the index CDS market (cross-market activity),
our analysis below does not include data regarding index CDS.
We believe that the data underlying our analysis here provide reasonably comprehensive
information regarding the single-name CDS transactions and composition of the single-name
CDS market participants. We note that the data available to us from DTCC-TIW do not
encompass those CDS transactions that both: (i) do not involve U.S. counterparties; 136 and (ii)
are based on non-U.S. reference entities. Notwithstanding this limitation, we believe that the
DTCC-TIW data provide sufficient information to identify the types of market participants active
in the security-based swap market and the general pattern of dealing within that market. 137
1.

Security-Based Swap Market Participants

A key characteristic of security-based swap activity is that it is concentrated among a
relatively small number of entities that engage in dealing activities. In addition to these entities,
thousands of other participants appear as counterparties to security-based swap contracts in our
sample, and include, but are not limited to, investment companies, pension funds, private (hedge)
funds, sovereign entities, and industrial companies. We observe that most non-dealer users of
security-based swaps do not engage directly in the trading of swaps, but use dealers, banks, or

136

We note that DTCC-TIW’s entity domicile determinations may not reflect our definition of “U.S.
person” in all cases.

137

The challenges we face in estimating measures of current market activity stems, in part, from the
absence of comprehensive reporting requirements for security-based swap market participants.
The Commission has proposed rules regarding trade reporting, data elements, and real-time
public reporting for security-based swaps that would provide us with appropriate measures of
market activity. See Regulation SBSR - Reporting and Dissemination of Security-Based Swap
Information, Exchange Act Release No. 34-63346 (Nov. 19, 2010), 75 FR 75208 (Dec. 2, 2010).

investment advisers as intermediaries or agents to establish their positions. Based on an analysis
of the counterparties to trades reported to the DTCC-TIW, there are 1,695 entities that engaged
directly in trading between November 2006 and December 2012.
Table 1, below, highlights that more than three-quarters of these entities (DTCC-defined
“firms” shown in DTCC-TIW, which we refer to here as “transacting agents”) were identified as
investment advisers, of which approximately 40 percent (about 30 percent of all transacting
agents) were registered investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
(“Investment Advisers Act”). 138 Although investment advisers comprise the vast majority of
transacting agents, the transactions they executed account for only 10.8 percent of all singlename CDS trading activity reported to the DTCC-TIW, measured by number of transaction-sides
(each transaction has two transaction sides, i.e., two transaction counterparties). The vast
majority of transactions (81.9 percent) measured by number of transaction-sides were executed
by ISDA-recognized dealers. 139

138

See 15 U.S.C. 80b1–80b21. Transacting agents participate directly in the security-based swap
market, without relying on an intermediary, on behalf of principals. For example, a university
endowment may hold a position in a security-based swap that is built up by an investment adviser
that transacts on the endowment’s behalf. In this case, the university endowment is a principal
that uses the investment adviser as its transacting agent.

139

The 1,695 entities included all DTCC-defined “firms” shown in DTCC-TIW as transaction
counterparties that report at least one transaction to DTCC-TIW as of December 2012. The staff
in the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis classified these firms, which are shown as
transaction counterparties, by machine matching names to known third-party databases and by
manual classification. This is consistent with the methodology used in the proposal. See CrossBorder Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31120 n.1304. Manual classification was based in part on
searches of the EDGAR and Bloomberg databases, the SEC’s Investment Adviser Public
Disclosure database, and a firm’s public website or the public website of the account represented
by a firm. The staff also referred to ISDA protocol adherence letters available on the ISDA
website.

Principal holders of CDS risk exposure are represented by “accounts” in the DTCCTIW. 141 The staff’s analysis of these accounts in DTCC-TIW shows that the 1,695 transacting
agents classified in Table 1 represent over 9,238 principal risk holders. Table 2, below, classifies
these principal risk holders by their counterparty type and whether they are represented by a
registered or unregistered investment adviser. 142 For instance, 256 banks in Table 1 allocated
transactions across 364 accounts, of which 25 were represented by investment advisers. In the
remaining 339 instances, banks traded for their own accounts. Meanwhile, 17 ISDA-recognized
dealers in Table 1 allocated transactions across 65 accounts.
140

For the purpose of this analysis, the ISDA-recognized dealers are those identified by ISDA as
belonging to the G14 or G16 dealer group during the period: JP Morgan Chase NA (and Bear
Stearns), Morgan Stanley, Bank of America NA (and Merrill Lynch), Goldman Sachs, Deutsche
Bank AG, Barclays Capital, Citigroup, UBS, Credit Suisse AG, RBS Group, BNP Paribas, HSBC
Bank, Lehman Brothers, Société Générale, Credit Agricole, Wells Fargo and Nomura. See, e.g.,
http://www.isda.org/c_and_a/pdf/ISDA-Operations-Survey-2010.pdf.

141

“Accounts” as defined in the DTCC-TIW context are not equivalent to “accounts” in the
definition of “U.S. person” provided by Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(i)(C). They also do not
necessarily represent separate legal persons. One entity or legal person may have multiple
accounts. For example, a bank may have one DTCC account for its U.S. headquarters and one
DTCC account for one of its foreign branches.

142

Unregistered investment advisers include all investment advisers not registered under the
Investment Advisers Act and may include investment advisers registered with a state or a foreign
authority.

54

Among the accounts, there are 1,000 Dodd-Frank Act-defined special entities and 570
investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. 143 Private funds
comprise the largest type of account holders that we were able to classify, and although not
verified through a recognized database, most of the funds we were not able to classify appear to
be private funds. 144

143

See 15 U.S.C. 80a1 through 80a64. There remain over 4,000 DTCC “accounts” unclassified by
type. Although unclassified, each was manually reviewed to verify that it was not likely to be a
special entity within the meaning of the Dodd-Frank Act and instead was likely to be an entity
such as a corporation, an insurance company, or a bank.

144

Private funds for this purposes encompasses various unregistered pooled investment vehicles,
including hedge funds, private equity funds, and venture capital funds.

(a) Dealing Structures
Security-based swap dealers use a variety of business models and legal structures to
engage in dealing business with counterparties in jurisdictions all around the world. As we noted
in the proposal, both U.S.-based and foreign-based entities use certain dealing structures for a
variety of legal, tax, strategic, and business reasons. 146 Dealers may use a variety of structures in

145

56

part to reduce risk and enhance credit protection based on the particular characteristics of each
entity’s business.
Bank and non-bank holding companies may use subsidiaries to deal with counterparties.
Further, dealers may rely on multiple sales forces to originate security-based swap transactions.
For example, a U.S. bank dealer may use a sales force in its U.S. home office to originate
security-based swap transactions in the United States and use separate sales forces spread across
foreign branches to originate security-based swap transactions with counterparties in foreign
markets.
In some situations, an entity’s performance under security-based swaps may be supported
by a guarantee provided by an affiliate. More generally, guarantees may take the form of a
blanket guarantee of an affiliate’s performance on all security-based swap contracts, or a
guarantee may apply only to a specified transaction or counterparty. Guarantees may give
counterparties to the dealer direct recourse to the holding company or another affiliate for its
dealer-affiliate’s obligations under security-based swaps for which that dealer-affiliate acts as
counterparty.
(b) Participant Domiciles
The security-based swap market is global in scope, with counterparties located across
multiple jurisdictions. As depicted in Figure 1, the domicile of new accounts participating in the
market has shifted over time.

57

account of a foreign branch of a U.S. bank, and account of a foreign subsidiary of a U.S.
entity (collectively referred to below as “Foreign Managed by US”). 147 Unique, new
accounts are aggregated each quarter and shares are computed on a quarterly basis, from

Over time a greater share of accounts entering the market either have a foreign domicile,
or have a foreign domicile while being managed by a U.S. person. The increase in foreign
accounts may reflect an increase in participation by foreign accountholders while the increase in
foreign accounts managed by U.S. persons may reflect the flexibility with which market
participants can restructure their market participation in response to regulatory intervention,
competitive pressures, and other stimuli. There are, however, alternative explanations for the

58

shifts in new account domicile we observe in Figure 1. Changes in the domicile of new accounts
through time may reflect improvements in reporting by market participants to DTCC-TIW. 148
Additionally, because the data only include accounts that are domiciled in the United States,
transact with U.S.-domiciled counterparties, or transact in single-name CDS with U.S. reference
entities, changes in the domicile of new accounts may reflect increased transaction activity
between U.S. and non-U.S. counterparties.
A U.S.-based holding company may conduct dealing activity through a foreign subsidiary
that faces both U.S. and foreign counterparties. Similarly, foreign dealers may choose to deal
with U.S. and foreign counterparties through U.S. subsidiaries. Non-dealer users of securitybased swaps may participate in the market using an agent in their home country or abroad. An
investment adviser located in one jurisdiction may transact in security-based swaps on behalf of
beneficial owners that reside in another.
The various layers separating origination from booking by dealers, and management from
ownership by non-dealer users, highlights the potential distinctions between the location where a
transaction is arranged, negotiated, or executed, the location where economic decisions are made
by managers on behalf of beneficial owners, and the jurisdiction ultimately bearing the financial
risks associated with the security-based swap transaction that results. As a corollary, a
participant in the security-based swap market may be exposed to counterparty risk from a
jurisdiction that is different from the market center in which it participates.
148

Consistent with the guidance on CDS data access, see text accompanying note 37, supra, DTCCTIW surveyed market participants, asking for the physical address associated with each of their
accounts (i.e., where the account is incorporated as a legal entity). This is designated the
registered office location. For purposes of this discussion, we have assumed that the registered
office location reflects the place of domicile for the fund or account. When the fund does not
report a registered office location, we assume that the settlement country reported by the
investment adviser or parent entity to the fund or account is the place of domicile.

59

(c) Current Estimates of Dealers and Major Participants.
In the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, we estimated, based on an analysis of
DTCC-TIW data, that out of more than 1,000 entities engaged in single-name CDS activity
worldwide in 2011, 166 entities engaged in single-name CDS activity at a sufficiently high level
that they would be expected to incur assessment costs to determine whether they meet the
“security-based swap dealer” definition. 149 Analysis of those data further indicated that
potentially 50 entities may engage in dealing activity that would exceed the de minimis threshold
and thus ultimately have to register as security-based swap dealers. 150

149

Based on the de minimis threshold of $3 billion for single-name CDS, we estimated that there
were 123 entities engaged in engaged in single-name CDS transactions in 2011 that had more
than $3 billion in single-name CDS transactions over the previous 12 months. We also estimated
that 43 entities with between $2 and $3 billion in transactions over the trailing 12 months may opt
to engage in the dealer analysis out of an abundance of caution or to meet internal compliance
guidelines, thus leading to the 166 total. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR
at 30731-32; see also Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31139-40. We adopted a phasein period during which the de minimis threshold will be $8 billion and during which Commission
staff will study the security-based swap market as it evolves under the new regulatory framework,
resulting in a report that will consider the operation of the security-based swap dealer and major
security-based swap participant definitions. At the end of the phase-in period, the Commission
will take into account the report, as well as public comment on the report, in determining whether
to terminate the phase-in period or propose any changes to the rule implementing the de minimis
exception, including any increases or decreases to the $3 billion threshold. See Intermediary
Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30640.

150

In particular, we estimated that 28 entities and corporate groups had three or more counterparties
that are not ISDA dealers (which we viewed as a useful proxy for application of the dealer-trader
distinction) and that 25 of those entities had trailing notional transactions exceeding $3 billion.
See id. at 30725 n.1457; SEC Staff Report, “Information regarding activities and positions of
participants in the single-name credit default swap market (“CDS Data Analysis”) (Mar. 15,
2012), available at: http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-39-10/s73910-154.pdf at 14. Our
additional estimate of up to 50 potential dealers reflected our recognition of the potential for
growth in the security-based swap market, for new entrants into the dealing space, and the
possibility that some corporate groups may register more than one entity. See Intermediary
Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30725 n.1457.
In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, we revised those estimates to reflect a more granular
analysis of the data. Under this refined approach – which identified the number of entities within
a corporate group that may have to register – we estimated that 46 individual firms had three or
more non-ISDA dealer counterparties, and that, of those, 31 firms engaged in at least $3 billion of
security-based swap activity in 2011. We further estimated that, under the cross-border

60

Analysis of more recent data regarding the single-name CDS market using the same
methodology suggests comparable results that are consistent with the reduction in transaction
volume noted below. In particular, single-name CDS data from 2012 indicate that out of more
than 1,000 entities engaged in single-name CDS activity, approximately 145 engaged in singlename CDS activity at a level high enough such that they may be expected to perform the dealertrader analysis prescribed under the security-based swap dealer definition. 151 These data suggest
that, consistent with the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release analysis, up to
approximately 50 entities would engage in dealing activity that would exceed the de minimis
threshold. 152

provisions of proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b), 27 of those entities engaged in at least $3
billion notional activity that they would have to count against the de minimis threshold, and that
accounting for the aggregation requirement may result in an additional two firms being required
to register, for a total of 29. We also concluded that our original estimate of there being up to 50
dealers was still valid, noting that the revised estimate included individual entities within
corporate groups (thus accounting for the possibility that some corporate groups may register
more than one dealer), and also accounted for the likely results of the proposed aggregation
requirement. See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31137-38 n.1407.
151

Consistent with the earlier analysis, this figure is derived from the fact that 110 transacting agents
had total single-name security-based swap activity above the $3 billion de minimis threshold,
while another 35 transacting agents had activity between $2 and $3 billion and hence out of
caution may be expected to engage in the dealer-trader analysis.
In calculating this estimate, Commission staff used methods identical to those used referenced in
the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30732 n.1509, aggregating the activity
of DTCC accounts to the level of transacting agents and estimating the number of transacting
agents with gross transaction notional amounts exceeding $2 billion in 2012. While the analysis
contained in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release used a sample that ended in
December 2011, the sample has been updated through the end of December 2012.
In connection with the economic analysis of the final cross-border dealer de minimis rules, we
also have estimated the number of entities that may perform the dealer-trader analysis using a
more granular methodology that considers data both at the account level and at the transacting
agent level. See notes 456 through 458, infra, and accompanying text.

152

As discussed below, and consistent with the methodology used in the Cross-Border Proposing
Release, 78 FR at 31137 n.1407, data from 2012 indicates that 40 entities engaged in the singlename security-based swap market had three or more counterparties that were not identified by
ISDA as dealers, and that 27 of those entities had $3 billion or more in notional single-name CDS
activity over a 12 month period. Applying the principles reflected in these final rules regarding

61

Additionally, in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, we estimated, based on
position data from DTCC-TIW for 2011, that as many as 12 entities would be likely to perform
substantial position and substantial counterparty exposure tests, and thus incur assessment costs,
prescribed under the major security-based swap participant definition. Of these 12 firms, we
estimated that the number of persons with positions sufficiently large to bring them within the
scope of the definition of major security-based swap participant likely would be fewer than five.
Although we did not specify how the major security-based swap participant definition would
apply to foreign persons in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, our approach in
estimating the assessment costs caused by our final definition used available single-name CDS
data as a proxy for the market as a whole, and assumed that all potential major security-based
swap participants would be required to include in their threshold calculations all positions with
all counterparties.
Analysis of more recent data regarding the single-name CDS market suggests comparable
results. In particular, single-name CDS data from 2012 indicate that out of over 1,100 DTCCTIW firms holding positions in single-name CDS activity and not expected to register as
the counting of transactions against the de minimis thresholds suggests that 25 of those entities
would have $3 billion or more in notional transactions counted against the thresholds, and that
applying the aggregation rules increases that number to 26 entities. Based on this data, we
believe that it is reasonable to conclude that up to 50 entities ultimately may register as securitybased swap dealers, although the number may be smaller. See note 444, infra.
In this regard it is important to note that, due to limitations in the availability of the underlying
data, this analysis does not include information about transactions involving single-name CDS
with a non-U.S. reference entity when neither party is domiciled in the United States or
guaranteed by a person domiciled in the United States. This is because for single-name CDS with
a non-U.S. reference entity, the data supplied to the Commission by the DTCC-TIW encompasses
only information regarding transactions involving at least one counterparty domiciled in the
United States or guaranteed by a person domiciled in the United States, based on physical
addresses reported by market participants. That data exclusion introduces the possibility that
these numbers may underestimate the number of persons that would engage in the dealer-trader
analysis (and hence incur assessment costs) or that exceed $3 billion in dealing transactions on an
annual basis (and hence would potentially be linked to programmatic costs and benefits).

62

security-based swap dealers, nine had worldwide single-name CDS positions at a level high
enough such that they may be expected to perform the major security-based swap participant
threshold analysis prescribed under the security-based swap dealer definition. Analysis based on
these more recent data is consistent with the prior conclusion that five or fewer entities would be
likely to register as major security-based swap participants. 153
2. Levels of Security-Based Swap Trading Activity
Single-name CDS contracts make up the vast majority of security-based swap products
and most are written on corporate issuers, corporate securities, sovereign countries, or sovereign
debt (reference entities and reference securities). Figure 1 below describes the percentage of
global, notional transaction volume in North American corporate single-name CDS reported to
the DTCC-TIW between January 2008 and December 2012, separated by whether transactions
are between two ISDA-recognized dealers (interdealer transactions) or whether a transaction has
at least one non-dealer counterparty.
The level of trading activity with respect to North American corporate single-name CDS
in terms of notional volume has declined from more than $5 trillion in 2008 to approximately $2
trillion in 2012. 154 While notional volume has declined over the past five years, the share of

153

In calculating this estimate, Commission staff used methods identical to those used referenced in
the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30734, note 1529, estimating the
number of participants with notional positions exceeding $100 billion in 2012. The analysis
contained in the Intermediary Adopting Release used a sample that ended in December 2011,
aggregated the activity of DTCC accounts to the level of transacting agents, and did not attribute
positions to parent companies. For the purposes of analysis of the final rules, the sample has been
updated through the end of December 2012 and positions falling short of the $100 billion
threshold have been attributed to parent companies.

154

The start of this decline predates the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act and the proposal of rules
thereunder, which is important to note for the purpose of understanding the economic baseline for
this rulemaking. The timing of this decline seems to indicate that CDS market demand shrank
prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, and therefore the causes of this reduction in trading
volume may be related to market dynamics and not directly related to the enactment of statutes

63

interdealer transactions has remained fairly constant and interdealer transactions continue to
represent the bulk of trading activity, whether measured in terms of notional value or number of
transactions (see Figure 2).

Against this backdrop of declining North American corporate single-name CDS activity,
about half of the trading activity in North American corporate single-name CDS reflected in the

and the development of security-based swap market regulation. If the security-based swap
market experiences further declines in trading activity, it would be difficult to identify the effects
of the newly developed security-based swap market regulation apart from changes in trading
activity that may be due to natural market forces, or the anticipation of (or reaction to) proposed
(or adopted) Title VII requirements or requirements being considered or implemented in other
jurisdictions.

64

set of data we analyzed was between counterparties domiciled in the United States and
counterparties domiciled abroad. Basing counterparty domicile on the self-reported registered
office location of the DTCC-TIW accounts, the Commission estimates that only 13 percent of
the global transaction volume by notional volume between 2008 and 2012 was between two
U.S.-domiciled counterparties, compared to 48 percent entered into between one U.S.-domiciled
counterparty and a foreign-domiciled counterparty and 39 percent entered into between two
foreign-domiciled counterparties (see Figure 3). 155
When the domicile of DTCC-TIW accounts are instead defined according to the domicile
of their ultimate parents, headquarters, or home offices (e.g., classifying a foreign bank branch or
foreign subsidiary of a U.S. entity as domiciled in the United States), the fraction of transactions
entered into between two U.S.-domiciled counterparties increases to 29 percent, and to 53
percent for transactions entered into between a U.S.-domiciled counterparty and a foreigndomiciled counterparty.
Differences in classifications across different definitions of domicile illustrate the effect
of participant structures that operate across jurisdictions. Notably, the proportion of activity
between two foreign-domiciled counterparties drops from 39 percent to 18 percent when
domicile is defined as the ultimate parent’s domicile. As noted earlier, foreign subsidiaries of

155

Following publication of the Warehouse Trust Guidance on CDS data access, the DTCC-TIW
surveyed market participants, asking for the physical address associated with each of their
accounts (i.e., where the account is organized as a legal entity). This is designated the registered
office location by the DTCC-TIW. When an account does not report a registered office location,
we assume that the settlement country reported by the investment adviser or parent entity to the
fund or account is the place of domicile. For purposes of this discussion, we have assumed that
the registered office location reflects the place of domicile for the fund or account.
Changes to these estimates relative to figures presented in the proposing release represent
additional data regarding new accounts in the time series as well as the use of a longer sample
period.

65

U.S. parent companies and foreign branches of U.S. banks, and U.S. subsidiaries of foreign
parent companies and U.S. branches of foreign banks may transact with U.S. and foreign
counterparties. However, this decrease in share suggests that the activity of foreign subsidiaries
of U.S. firms and foreign branches of U.S. banks is generally higher than the activity of U.S.
subsidiaries of foreign firms and U.S. branches of foreign banks.
By either of those definitions of domicile, the data indicate that a large fraction of North
American corporate single-name CDS transaction volume is entered into between counterparties
domiciled in two different jurisdictions or between counterparties domiciled outside the United
States. For the purpose of establishing an economic baseline, this observation indicates that a
large fraction of security-based swap activity would be affected by the scope of any cross-border
approach we take in applying the Title VII requirements. Further, the large fraction of North
American corporate single-name CDS transactions between U.S.-domiciled and foreigndomiciled counterparties also highlights the extent to which security-based swap activity
transfers risk across geographical boundaries, both facilitating risk sharing among market
participants and allowing for risk transmission between jurisdictions.

B. Global Regulatory Efforts
Efforts to regulate the swaps market are underway not only in the United States but also
abroad. In 2009, leaders of the G20—whose membership includes the United States, 18 other
countries, and the EU—called for global improvements in the functioning, transparency, and
regulatory oversight of OTC derivatives markets agreeing that “all standardised OTC derivatives
contracts should be traded on exchanges or electronic trading platforms, where appropriate, and
cleared through central counterparties (“CCPs”) by end-2012 at the latest. OTC derivatives
contracts should be reported to trade repositories. Non-centrally cleared contracts should be
subject to higher capital requirements.” 156 In subsequent summits, the G20 leaders have
reiterated their commitment to OTC derivatives regulatory reform and encouraged international

156

See G20 Leaders’ Statement cited in note 16, supra.

67

consultation in developing standards for these markets. 157 The FSB monitors implementation of
OTC derivatives reforms and provides progress reports to the G20. 158
Pursuant to these commitments, jurisdictions with major OTC derivatives markets have
taken steps toward substantive regulation of these markets, though the pace of regulation varies.
This suggests that many foreign participants will face substantive regulation of their securitybased swap activities that is intended to implement the G20 objectives and that may therefore
address concerns similar to those addressed by rules the Commission has proposed but not yet
adopted.
Foreign legislative and regulatory efforts have focused on five general areas: requiring
post-trade reporting of transactions data for regulatory purposes, moving OTC derivatives onto
organized trading platforms, requiring central clearing of OTC derivatives, establishing or
enhancing capital requirements, and establishing or enhancing margin requirements for OTC
derivatives transactions.

Leaders’ Cannes Declaration”). In the G20 Leaders’ Cannes Declaration, the G20 Leaders
agreed to develop standards on margin for non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives.

158

The FSB has published seven progress reports on OTC derivatives markets reform
implementation: FSB Progress Report April 2014 (available at:
http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_140408.pdf); September 2013 (available at:

http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_110415b.pdf) (collectively, “FSB Progress
Reports”) . The ODWG prepares the FSB Progress Reports. The Commission participates in the
ODWG, both on its own behalf and as the representative of IOSCO, which is co-chair of the
ODWG.

The first two areas of regulation should help improve transparency in OTC derivatives
markets, both to regulators and market participants. Regulatory transaction reporting
requirements have entered into force in a number of jurisdictions including the EU, Hong Kong
SAR, Japan, and Singapore, and other jurisdictions are in the process of proposing legislation
and rules to implement these requirements. 159 The European Parliament has adopted legislation
for markets in financial instruments that addresses trading OTC derivatives on regulated trading
platforms. 160 This legislation also should promote post-trade public transparency in OTC
derivatives markets by requiring the price, volume, and time of OTC derivatives transactions
conducted on these regulated trading platforms to be made public in as close to real time as
technically possible.
Regulation of derivatives central clearing, capital requirements, and margin requirements
aims to improve management of financial risks in these markets. Japan has rules in force
mandating central clearing of certain OTC derivatives transactions. The EU has its legislation in
place but has not yet made any determinations of specific OTC derivatives transactions subject to
mandatory central clearing. Most other jurisdictions are still in the process of formulating their
legal frameworks that govern central clearing. While the EU is the only major foreign
jurisdiction that has initiated the process of drafting rules to implement margin requirements for
OTC derivatives transactions, we understand that several other jurisdictions anticipate taking
steps towards implementing such requirements.

C. Cross-Market Participation
Persons registered as security-based swap dealers or major security-based swap
participants are likely also to engage in swap activity, which is subject to regulation by the
CFTC. In the release proposing registration requirements for security-based swap dealers and
major security-based swap participants, we estimated, based on our experience and
understanding of the swap and security-based swap markets that of the 55 firms that might
register as security-based swap dealers or major security-based swap participants, approximately
35 would also register with the CFTC as swap dealers or major swap participants. 161
This overlap reflects the relationship between single-name CDS contracts, which are
security-based swaps, and index CDS contracts, which may be swaps or security-based swaps.
A single-name CDS contract covers default events for a single reference entity or reference
security. These entities and securities are often part of broad-based indices on which market
participants write index CDS contracts. Index CDS contracts and related products make payouts
that are contingent on the default of index components and allow participants in these
instruments to gain exposure to the credit risk of the basket of reference entities that comprise the
index, which is a function of the credit risk of the index components. As a result of this
construction, a default event for a reference entity that is an index component will result in
payoffs on both single-name CDS written on the reference entity and index CDS written on
indices that contain the reference entity. Because of this relationship between the payoffs of

161

See Registration of Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants,
Exchange Act Release No. 65543 (Oct. 12, 2011), 76 FR 65784, 65808 (Oct. 24, 2011). Based
on its analysis of 2012 DTCC-TIW and the list of swap dealers provisionally-registered with the
CFTC, and applying the methodology used in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, the
Commission estimates that substantially all registered security-based swap dealers would also
register as swap dealers with the CFTC. See also CFTC list of provisionally registered swap
dealers, available at: http://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/DoddFrankAct/registerswapdealer.

70

single-name CDS and index CDS products, prices of these products depend upon one another.
This dependence is particularly strong between index CDS contracts and single-name CDS
contracts written on index components. 162
Because payoffs associated with these single-name CDS and index CDS are dependent,
hedging opportunities exist across these markets. Participants who sell protection on reference
entities through a series of single-name CDS transactions can lay off some of the credit risk of
their resulting positions by buying protection on an index that includes a subset of those
reference entities. Participants that are active in one market are likely to be active in the other.
Commission staff analysis of approximately 4,400 DTCC-TIW accounts that participated in the
market for single-name CDS in 2012 revealed that approximately 2,700 of those accounts, or 61
percent, also participated in the market for index CDS. Of the accounts that participated in both
markets, data regarding transactions in 2012 suggest that, conditional on an account transacting
in notional volume of index CDS in the top third of accounts, the probability of the same account
landing in the top third of accounts in terms of single-name CDS notional volume is
approximately 62 percent; by contrast, the probability of the same account landing in the bottom
third of accounts in terms of single-name CDS notional volume is only 14 percent.
In an effort to comply with CFTC rules and applicable statutory provisions in the crossborder context, swap market participants, many of whom, as discussed above, likely also
participate in the security-based swap market, may have already changed some market

162

“Correlation” typically refers to linear relationships between variables; “dependence” captures a
broader set of relationships that may be more appropriate for certain swaps and security-based
swaps. See, e.g., Casella, George and Roger L. Berger, “Statistical Inference” (2002), at 171.

71

practices. 163 Although a commenter suggested that swap market participants have already
conformed their business practices to the CFTC’s approach to cross-border regulation, the
commenter did not supply particular details as to the scope of that operations restructuring. 164
We believe, however, based on these comments, it is likely that all participants who
preliminarily believe they may be subject to the CFTC’s registration requirements will have
expended resources to build systems and infrastructure that will permit them to determine and
then record the U.S.-person status of their counterparties consistent with applicable requirements,
as interpreted by the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance.
The CFTC’s rules and cross-border guidance have likely influenced the information that
market participants collect and maintain about the swap transactions they enter into and the
counterparties they face. For example, the CFTC’s guidance describes a majority-ownership
approach for collective investment vehicles that are offered to U.S. persons, contemplating that
managers of these vehicles would assess, on an ongoing basis, the proportion of ownership by
U.S. persons. As another example, the CFTC’s guidance articulates an approach by which all

163

See, e.g., SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at 2-3. We understand that new capabilities have been built by
swap market participants following issuance of the CFTC’s guidance. To the extent that such
capabilities can be transferred to these participants’ security-based swap activities (e.g., to the
extent that a market participant’s assessment practices regarding whether a counterparty would
generally be considered a U.S. person for purposes of the CFTC guidance also can help determine
the corresponding assessment for purposes of these final rules and guidance), such capabilities
may tend to mitigate the costs that market participants otherwise would incur in connection with
the Commission’s final cross-border rules.

164

Id. at 2-4. The commenter notes the “technological, operational, legal and compliance systems”
necessary for complying with the Commission’s proposed rules, and taking account of the CFTC
Cross-Border Guidance, outlining the general categories of changes to practice necessary for
compliance. The commenter further indicates a potential need to “build[] separate systems for a
small percentage of the combined swaps and SBS market instead of using the systems already
built for compliance with the CFTC’s cross-border approach,” suggesting that market participants
have already altered market practices to follow the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance.

72

swap transactions by a non-U.S. person that rely on guarantees from U.S. affiliates would
generally count against that non-U.S. person’s dealer de minimis exception. 165
Thus, as discussed in more detail in sections IV.I.2 and V.H.2 below, the adoption of
rules that would seek similar information from security-based swap market participants as the
CFTC seeks from swap market participants, may allow such participants to use infrastructure
already in place as a result of CFTC regulation to comply with Commission regulation. Among
those entities that participate in both markets, entities that are able to apply to security-based
swap activity new capabilities they have built in order to comply with requirements applicable to
cross-border swap activity may experience lower costs associated with assessing which crossborder security-based swap activity counts against the dealer de minimis exception or towards
the major participant threshold, relative to those that are unable to redeploy such capabilities.
The Commission remains sensitive to the fact that in cases where its final rules differ from the
CFTC approach, additional outlays related to information collection and storage may be required
even of market participants that conformed to the CFTC’s guidance regarding the applicable
cross-border requirements. 166 These costs are discussed in sections IV.I.1 and V.H.1(b).
IV. Cross-Border Application of Dealer De Minimis Exception
A. Overview
The Exchange Act excepts from designation as “security-based swap dealer” entities that
engage in a “de minimis” quantity of security-based swap dealing activity with or on behalf of
165

See section IV.I.2(c), supra, for a discussion of costs to market participants that may arise from
differences between the CFTC approach to guarantees and the Commission’s final rules.

166

We recognize that the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance is the subject of ongoing litigation. Our
economic analysis is not intended to draw any conclusions about the ultimate outcome of that
litigation; rather, the economic analysis relies on the current practices and operational abilities of
firms that are, we understand, either in accordance with the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance or are
in the process of adapting their systems to account for the CFTC’s approach to cross-border
issues.

73

customers. 167 Under the final rules adopted in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, a
person may take advantage of that exception if, in connection with CDS that constitute securitybased swaps, the person’s dealing activity over the preceding 12 months does not exceed a gross
notional amount of $3 billion, subject to a phase-in level of $8 billion. 168 The phase-in level will
remain in place until – following a study regarding the definitions of “security-based swap
dealer” and “major security-based swap participant” – the Commission either terminates the
phase-in period or establishes an alternative threshold following rulemaking. 169
To apply the exception to cross-border dealing activity, the Cross-Border Proposing
Release would have required that a U.S. person count against the de minimis thresholds all of its
security-based swap dealing activity, including transactions conducted through a foreign branch
of a U.S. bank. 170 Non-U.S. persons, in contrast, would have included only dealing transactions
entered into with U.S. persons other than foreign branches of U.S. banks, plus dealing
transactions where the transaction is “conducted within the United States.” 171 To implement,
within the cross-border context, the existing rule that requires a person to aggregate the dealing
activity of its affiliates against its own de minimis thresholds, 172 the proposal would have
required a person to count: (i) dealing transactions by its affiliates that are U.S. persons; and (ii)

Act rule 3a71-2(a)(1)(ii).

74

dealing transactions by non-U.S. affiliates that either are entered into with U.S. persons other
than foreign branches, or that are conducted within the United States. 173 The proposal further
would have permitted a person to exclude, from the de minimis analysis, transactions by
affiliates that are registered security-based swap dealers, provided that the person’s dealing
activity is “operationally independent” from the registered dealer’s dealing activity. 174 The
proposal, moreover, set forth definitions relevant to the application of the de minimis exception
in the cross-border context, including proposed definitions of the terms “U.S. person” and
“transaction conducted within the United States.” 175
Commenters raised issues related to various aspects of this proposed approach to
application of the de minimis exception in the cross-border context. As discussed below, these
include issues regarding: the scope of the “U.S. person” definition, the proposal to require
counting of certain “transactions conducted within the United States” between two non-U.S.
persons, the treatment of the dealing activity of non-U.S. persons that is guaranteed by U.S.
persons, and the application of the exception to non-U.S. persons whose counterparties are
foreign branches of U.S. banks. Some commenters also urged us to more closely harmonize

173

See proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b)(2).

174

See proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-4.

175

The proposal also set forth definitions of “foreign branch” and “transaction conducted through a
foreign branch” in connection with the de minimis exception. See proposed Exchange Act rule
3a71-3(a). The proposed definitions of “U.S. person,” “transaction conducted within the United
States,” “foreign branch,” and “transaction conducted through a foreign branch” also are relevant
to the Commission’s proposed rules regarding the cross-border application of certain other Title
VII requirements. See, e.g., proposed Exchange Act regulation SBSR (regarding regulatory
reporting and public dissemination).
Proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3 also contained a provision and associated definitions related
to the cross-border application of counterparty protection requirements in connection with
security-based swap activities. As discussed above, those matters are not the subject of the
present rulemaking, and the Commission intends to address those matters as part of a subsequent
rulemaking.

75

particular aspects of our proposal with the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance.
After considering commenters’ views regarding the cross-border application of the de
minimis exception, we are adopting final rules that have been modified from the proposal in
certain important respects. While these changes are discussed in more detail below, key
elements include:
•

Modifications to the proposed definition of “U.S. person”;

•

Provisions to distinguish non-U.S. persons’ dealing activity involving security-based
swaps that are guaranteed by their U.S. affiliates from such non-U.S. persons’ other
dealing activity for purposes of the de minimis exception, by requiring a non-U.S.
person to count against the de minimis thresholds all dealing activity involving
security-based swaps for which its counterparty has rights of recourse against a U.S.
guarantor that is affiliated with the non-U.S. person;

•

Provisions to distinguish non-U.S. persons that act as conduit affiliates (by entering
into certain security-based swap transactions on behalf of their U.S. affiliates) from
other non-U.S. persons for purposes of the de minimis exception, in that conduit
affiliates are required to count all of their dealing activity against the de minimis
thresholds regardless of counterparty;

•

Modifications to the application of the de minimis exception to dealing activity by
non-U.S. persons when the counterparty is the foreign branch of a U.S. bank.

•

The addition of an exclusion related to cleared, anonymous transactions; and

•

Modifications of the proposed aggregation provisions, in part by removing the
“operational independence” condition to excluding dealing positions of affiliates that
are registered dealers.
76

The final rules we are adopting reflect a territorial approach that is generally consistent
with the principles that the Commission traditionally has followed with respect to the registration
of brokers and dealers under the Exchange Act. Under this territorial approach, registration and
other requirements applicable to brokers and dealers generally are triggered by a broker or dealer
physically operating in the United States, even if its activities are directed solely toward nonU.S. persons outside the United States. The territorial approach further generally requires
broker-dealer registration by foreign brokers or dealers that, from outside the United States,
induce or attempt to induce securities transactions by persons within the United States – but not
when such foreign brokers or dealers conduct their activities entirely outside the United States. 176
In the cross-border context, moreover, the application of the “security-based swap dealer”
definition and its de minimis exception remains subject to general principles that we addressed in
the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release. Accordingly, the term “person” as used in the
“security-based swap dealer” definition and in the Commission’s rules implementing the de
minimis exception should be interpreted to refer to a particular legal person, meaning that a
trading desk, department, office, branch or other discrete business unit that is not a separately
organized legal person will not be viewed as a security-based swap dealer. As a result, a legal
person with a branch, agency, or office that is engaged in dealing activity above the de minimis
threshold is required to register as a security-based swap dealer, even if the legal person’s
dealing activity is limited to such branch, agency, or office. 177

177

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30624; see also Cross-Border
Proposing Release at 30993.

77

Cross-border security-based swap transactions also are subject to the principle that
transactions between majority-owned affiliates need not be considered for purposes of
determining whether a person is a dealer. 178
As discussed below, these final rules and guidance do not address the proposed
provisions regarding the cross-border application of the dealer definition to “transactions
conducted within the United States,” as defined in the Cross-Border Proposing Release. We
anticipate soliciting additional public comment on potential approaches for applying the dealer
definition to non-U.S. persons in connection with activity between two non-U.S. persons where
one or both are conducting dealing activity that occurs within the United States. 179
B. Application of De Minimis Exception to Dealing Activities of U.S. Persons
1. Proposed Approach and Commenters’ Views
Under the proposal, a U.S. person would have counted all of its security-based swap
dealing activity against the de minimis thresholds, including transactions that it conducted
through a foreign branch. 180 Although some persons who submitted comments in connection
with the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release expressed the view that dealing activity by
foreign branches should not be counted as part of a U.S. person’s de minimis calculation, 181 we
did not propose such an approach. 182 Moreover, commenters to the Cross-Border Proposing
178

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-1(d).

179

See section I.A, supra.

180

See proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(i).

See, e.g., ISDA Letter (Feb. 22, 2011) (“Non-U.S. entities (including non-U.S. affiliates and
branches of U.S. banks) should not be required to register as Dealers when they are conducting
business with non-U.S. counterparties”). This and other comments in connection with the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release are located at: http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-3910/s73910.shtml.

182

We considered these comments in connection with the Cross-Border Proposing Release. See
Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 30990, 30994.

78

Release did not specifically express opposition to this aspect of the proposal, although several
commenters addressed related issues regarding the proposed scope of the “U.S. person”
definition. 183
2. Final Rule
Consistent with the proposal, the final rules require U.S. persons to apply all of their
dealing transactions against the de minimis thresholds, including activity they conduct through
their foreign branches. 184 Such dealing transactions must be counted regardless of where they
are arranged, negotiated, or executed.
As discussed above, it is our view that any dealing activity undertaken by a U.S. person,
as defined in this final rule, occurs at least in part within the United States and therefore warrants
the application of Title VII regardless of where particular aspects of dealing activity are
conducted. 185 Whenever a U.S. person enters into a security-based swap in a dealing capacity, it
is the U.S. person as a whole – and not merely any applicable foreign branch or office of that
U.S. person – that holds itself out as a dealer in security-based swaps. It is the U.S. person as a
whole that seeks to profit by providing liquidity and making a market in security-based swaps,
and it is the financial resources of the U.S. person as a whole that enable it to do so. Even if the
U.S. person engages in dealing activity through a foreign branch or office, its dealing
counterparties will look to the entire U.S. person – and not merely its foreign branch or office –
for performance on the transaction, and the U.S. person as a whole assumes and stands behind
the obligations arising from the security-based swap, thereby creating risk to the U.S. person and
183

We address these comments in the context of our discussion of our final definition of “U.S.
person.” See notes 192-231, infra, and accompanying text.

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(i). Issues regarding how the de minimis exception applies to
a non-U.S. person whose counterparty is a foreign branch are addressed in section IV.E.2, infra.

potentially to the U.S. financial system. A dealer that is organized or has its principal place of
business in the United States thus cannot hold itself out as anything other than a single person,
and generally cannot operate as a dealer absent the financial and other resources of that single
person. Accordingly, we conclude that U.S. persons that engage in security-based swap dealing
activity through foreign branches or offices should be subject to the regulatory framework for
dealers even if those U.S. persons deal exclusively with non-U.S. persons. 186

186

The definition of “U.S. person” is addressed below. The definitions of “foreign branch” and
“transaction conducted through a foreign branch” are addressed in section IV.E.2, infra.
This interpretation, moreover, is consistent with the goals of security-based swap dealer
regulation under Title VII. Security-based swap activity that results in a transaction involving a
U.S. counterparty creates ongoing obligations that are borne by a U.S. person, and thus is
properly viewed as occurring within the United States. The events associated with AIG FP,
described in detail in our proposal, illustrate how certain transactions of U.S. persons can pose
risks to the U.S. financial system even when they are conducted through foreign operations. See
Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 30980-81. Such risks, and their role in the financial
crisis and in the enactment of Title VII, suggest that the statutory framework established by
Congress and the objectives of Title VII would be undermined by an analysis that excludes from
Title VII’s application certain transactions involving U.S. persons solely because they involve
conduct carried out through operations outside the United States, particularly when those
transactions raise concerns about risk to the U.S. person and to the U.S. financial system that are
similar or identical to those raised by such conduct when carried out by the U.S. person entirely
inside the United States.
For the above reasons, we conclude that our approach does not apply to persons who are
“transact[ing] a business in security-based swaps without the jurisdiction of the United States,”
within the meaning of section 30(c) of the Exchange Act. See section II.B.2(d), supra. A
contrary interpretation would, in our view, reflect an understanding of what it means to conduct a
security-based swaps business within the jurisdiction of the United States that is divorced both
from Title VII’s statutory objectives and from the reality of the role of U.S. persons within the
global security-based swap market. But in any event we also believe that this final rule is
necessary or appropriate as a prophylactic measure to help prevent the evasion of the provisions
of the Exchange Act that were added by the Dodd-Frank Act, and thus help ensure that the
relevant purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act are not undermined. Otherwise, U.S. persons could
simply conduct dealing activities with non-U.S. persons using foreign branches and remain
outside of the application of the dealer requirements of Title VII, bringing the same risk into the
United States that would be associated with such dealing activity that is conducted out of their
U.S. offices.

80

C. Definition of “U.S. Person”
1. Proposed Approach
Consistent with our territorial approach to application of Title VII to cross-border
security-based swap activity, our Cross-Border Proposal defined “U.S. person” to mean:
•

Any natural person resident in the United States;

•

Any partnership, corporation, trust, or other legal person organized or incorporated
under the laws of the United States 187 or having its principal place of business in the
United States; and

•

Any account (whether discretionary or non-discretionary) of a U.S. person. 188

The Commission also proposed that the term “U.S. person” would exclude the following
international organizations: the International Monetary Fund (“IMF”), the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian
Development Bank, the African Development Bank, the United Nations, and their agencies and
pension plans, and any other similar international organizations, their agencies and pension
plans. 189
This proposed definition of “U.S. person” generally followed an approach to defining
U.S. person that is similar to that used by the Commission in other contexts, 190 though it was

187

Proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(9) under the Exchange Act defined “United States” as
“the United States of America, its territories and possessions, any States of the United States, and
the District of Columbia.”

188

Proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(7)(i) under the Exchange Act.

189

See proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(7)(ii).

190

See, e.g., Securities Act Release No. 6863 (“Regulation S Adopting Release”) (April 24, 1990),
55 FR 18306, 18308 (May 2, 1990), 55 FR at 18308 (adopting regulation “based on a territorial
approach to [s]ection 5 of the Securities Act”). Although the proposed rule followed the
approach to defining “U.S. person” in Regulation S in certain respects, we stated that we
preliminarily believed that it was necessary to depart from Regulation S in defining “U.S. person”

81

tailored to the specific goals of Title VII. As we noted in the proposal, we sought with the
proposed definition to identify those types of individuals or entities whose security-based swap
activity is likely to impact the U.S. market even if they transact with security-based swap dealers
that are not U.S. persons and to identify those types of individuals or entities that are part of the
U.S. security-based swap market and should receive the protections of Title VII. 191
2. Commenters’ Views
We received extensive comments on our proposed definition of “U.S. person.” In these
comments, many commenters also expressed their views on the interpretation of “U.S. person” in
the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance. As explained in more detail below, several commenters
emphasized that we should minimize divergence from the CFTC’s approach, including by
adding certain elements to our definition of “U.S. person” that we had not proposed. Many

in the context of the cross-border application of Title VII. See Cross-Border Proposing Release,
78 FR at 31007-08 (comparing the proposed definition of “U.S. person” with the definition of
“U.S. person” in Regulation S). For example, Regulation S expressly excludes foreign branches
of U.S. banks from the definition of “U.S. person,” whereas our proposed definition provided that
U.S.-person status would be determined at the entity level, meaning that a foreign branch of a
U.S. person would, as part of that U.S. person, share in that U.S.-person status of the entity as a
whole. See section II.B.2(b)i, supra. Thus, under our proposed approach, the term “U.S. person”
would have been interpreted to include any foreign trading desk, office, or branch of an entity that
is organized under U.S. law or that has its principal place of business in the United States. See
Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 30996.
The proposed definition of “U.S. person” was similar in many respects to the definition provided
by CFTC staff in its October 12, 2012 no-action letter. See Time-Limited No-Action Relief:
Swaps Only With Certain Persons to be Included in Calculation of Aggregate Gross Notional
Amount for Purposes of Swap Dealer De Minimis Exception and Calculation of Whether a
Person is a Major Swap Participant (Oct. 12, 2012), available at:
http://www.cftc.gov/ucm/groups/public/@lrlettergeneral/documents/letter/12-22.pdf; see also
Final CFTC Cross-Border Exemptive Order, 78 FR at 862 (indicating that for purposes of its
temporary conditional relief the CFTC is taking a similar approach to the “U.S. person” definition
as that set forth in the October 12, 2012 no-action letter). In July 2013, the CFTC issued its
cross-border guidance, which modified its interpretation of U.S. person in certain respects,
discussed in greater detail below.
191

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 30996.

82

commenters also identified specific elements of the CFTC interpretation that we should not
adopt in our final rule.
(a) Definition of “U.S. Person” Generally
Several commenters expressed the view that our proposed definition of “U.S. person”
was clear, objective, and territorial in scope. 192 At the same time, many commenters, including
some who expressed agreement with our proposed approach, urged us to adopt, in whole or in
part, a definition of “U.S. person” that is consistent with the interpretation of “U.S. person” in
the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance. 193 In contrast, two commenters disagreed with our approach
as being underinclusive and urged us to define U.S. person more broadly than the CFTC had
interpreted it. 194 Two commenters addressed whether our “U.S. person” definition should follow

192

See, e.g., SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at A-6 (stating that the Commission’s proposed “U.S. person”
definition was “clear, objective and ascertainable”); American Bar Association (“ABA”) Letter at
1-2, 4 (commending the Commission for a “clear and objective” approach to the “U.S. person”
definition that is consistent with its statutory authority and respects principles of comity); IIB
Letter at 5 (stating that the Commission’s proposed “U.S. person” definition is sensible in its
jurisdictional scope and is consistent with territorial principles). But see EC Letter at 2 (generally
supporting the territorial scope of the “U.S. person” definition, with the exception of the
“principal place of business” requirement, arguing that it is inconsistent with the territorial
approach); ESMA Letter at 2 (supporting a definition of “U.S. person” that covers only persons
located or incorporated in the United States).

193

See, e.g., SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at 2-3, A-7 (suggesting that the Commission coordinate with
the CFTC in order to provide a “consistent set of standards for determining an entity’s principal
place of business”); IIB Letter at 2 (noting that its recommendations are generally intended to
emphasize consistency across regimes). See also Chris Barnard Letter at 2 (stating belief that the
“U.S. person” definition should be aligned with the CFTC’s definition, specifically with respect
to commodity pools, pension plans, estates, and trusts); Japan Financial Markets Council
(“JFMC”) Letter at 4 (noting that, even though JFMC does not support all aspects of the CFTC’s
definition, it believes the Commission should adopt the same definition as the CFTC); Japan
Securities Dealers Association (“JSDA”) Letter at 3 (expressing hope that the Commission and
the CFTC do not adopt different definitions of U.S. person); Investment Adviser Association
(“IAA”) Letter at 3 (noting that, given the finalization of the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, the
Commission should modify its proposal in several respects to be more consistent with the
CFTC’s definition of “U.S. person”).

194

See AFR Letter I at 3, 5 (stating that the proposed definition of “U.S. person” is overly narrow
because it does not include foreign subsidiaries of the seven largest U.S. bank holding
companies); BM Letter at 5, 9, 14-15 (stating that the proposed definition of “U.S. person” is too

the U.S. person analysis in Regulation S. 195
(b) Treatment of Investment Vehicles
In response to our questions about whether our proposed definition of “U.S. person”
provided sufficient guidance to investment vehicles and similar legal persons, commenters
generally requested guidance but expressed a range of views as to what guidance we should
provide. One commenter requested that we ensure that foreign investment vehicles with a “U.S.
nexus” be considered U.S. persons. 196 This commenter expressed support for what it described
as our “complementary” proposed approach that would have required legal persons, including
investment vehicles, to perform a principal place of business assessment to determine whether
they are U.S. persons, and would have subjected all transactions conducted within the United
States to Title VII requirements. 197 One commenter conversely argued that a “principal place of
business” test for investment vehicles would be inappropriate. 198
Several commenters requested that we provide additional guidance regarding the
application of the “principal place of business” test to investment vehicles. Some commenters
narrow because it excludes guaranteed affiliates and other affiliates in a control relationship with
a U.S. person; further suggesting that, should such guaranteed entities, whether they are implicitly
or explicitly guaranteed, not be considered U.S. persons, they be separately “ring-fenced” from
their U.S. affiliate in order to ensure that the U.S. affiliate does not cover any of the guaranteed
affiliates obligations; further stating that such entities are within the scope of the Commission’s
broad authority under Exchange Act section 30(c) to regulate cross-border activity).
195

See Citadel Letter at 3 (supporting our proposal to not rely on Regulation S as it would not
capture certain foreign funds that the commenter believed should be considered U.S. persons);
ICI Letter at 6 (recommending that our analysis be consistent with Regulation S because fund
managers are accustomed to that definition). Cf. note 190, supra (describing elements of “U.S.
person” definition contained in Regulation S).

196

See Citadel Letter at 2-3 (noting further that such an approach will ensure that these entities will
be subject to clearing, reporting, and other transaction-level requirements).

197

See id.

198

See ICI Letter at 4-5 (arguing that a “principal place of business” test is inappropriate for
investment vehicles because they generally have no employees or offices of their own).

84

specifically requested that we avoid diverging from the CFTC’s interpretation of “U.S. person”
in our own final definition. 199 One commenter urged us to help ensure that market participants
are able to make rational and consistent determinations regarding the U.S.-person status of
investment vehicles, and suggested that an appropriate test would look to the location of the
person responsible for the fund’s operational management, which the commenter identified as
the person that establishes the investment vehicle and selects persons to carry out functions on
behalf of the vehicle, as opposed to the person responsible for the fund’s investment
management activities. 200 Another commenter requested guidance regarding the application of
the “principal place of business” test, while expressing support for using an approach similar to
the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance. 201 One commenter requested that the location of an asset
manager retained by a person not be the sole factor used to determine the person’s principal
place of business or U.S.-person status. 202
A few commenters responded to our question whether the proposed definition should
encompass funds that are majority-owned by U.S. persons, as the CFTC’s interpretation does,

199

See IAA Letter at 3 (urging the Commission to coordinate with the CFTC to develop a consistent
definition of principal place of business); SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at A-8 (urging harmonization
with the CFTC).

200

See IIB Letter at 6. But see ICI Letter at 5 n.13 (requesting that the U.S.-person status of an
investment vehicle not turn on the location of the vehicle’s activities, employees, or the offices of
its sponsor or adviser because such considerations are not relevant to whether risk is transferred
to the United States).

201

See Citadel Letter at 2. This commenter suggested looking to those senior personnel responsible
for implementing the investment vehicle’s investment and trading strategy as well as those
responsible for “investment selections, risk management decisions, portfolio management, or
trade execution.” See id.

202

See IAA Letter at 4 (suggesting that the Commission follow the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance by
specifically providing that non-U.S. persons are not U.S. persons simply by virtue of using a
U.S.-person asset manager); SIFMA/FIA/FSA at A-8 (same).

85

with two commenters advocating against and three advocating in favor of such an approach. 203
One of the commenters that opposed such a test urged, however, that if we were to adopt such a
test, the test be identical to the approach taken by the CFTC. 204
One commenter suggested that we adopt the CFTC’s approach by which collective
investment vehicles that are offered publicly only to non-U.S. persons, and not offered to U.S.
persons, would not generally be considered “U.S. persons.” 205 Another commenter urged that
the definition exclude “non-U.S. regulated funds” that are offered publicly only to non-U.S.
persons but are offered privately to U.S. persons in certain specific circumstances. 206
(c) Treatment of Legal Persons More Generally
Two commenters urged us to include in the definition of “U.S. person” guaranteed
subsidiaries and affiliates of U.S. persons. 207 Alternatively, these commenters suggested that we
203

Compare ICI Letter at 7 (arguing that a majority-ownership test is not workable for non-U.S.
regulated funds that are offered publicly abroad because it may be impossible or inconsistent with
local law to identify or reveal investor information) and IAA Letter at 4 (explaining that a
majority-ownership test would capture non-U.S. funds with minimal nexus to the United States
and present implementation challenges) with AFR Letter I at 8 (recommending that the U.S.person status of investment vehicles be based on majority ownership and/or actual locations of
the person, regardless of the location of incorporation), and Greenberger Letter I at 6-7 (making a
similar argument with respect to CFTC’s interpretation of U.S. person), and BM Letter at 10
(recommending that the “U.S. person” definition include collective investment vehicles that are
majority-owned by U.S. persons).

204

See IAA Letter at 5.

205

See id. at 3, 5 (noting that the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance has been finalized and urging the
Commission to adopt the CFTC approach to permit market participants to operate “under the
certainty and clarity” of consistent definitions of U.S. persons).

206

See ICI Letter at 5-6 (noting that such investment vehicles have only minimal nexus to the United
States and stating that institutional investors that invest in such funds would not expect U.S. law
to apply to the vehicles’ transactions).

207

See AFR Letter I at 3, 5-7 (stating that proposed definition is too narrow and would allow U.S.
entities to avoid regulation and engage in regulatory arbitrage); BM Letter at 9, 11-15 (requesting
that the “U.S. person” definition be broadened to include any person that is “indistinguishable”
from a U.S. person, such as by implicit or explicit guarantees from a U.S. person, including any
affiliate controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a person that is headquartered,
incorporated, or otherwise residing in the United States). These commenters further argued that

86

should require dealing transactions with such persons to be included in the dealing
counterparty’s security-based swap dealer de minimis calculation. 208 However, another
commenter supported our proposed approach not to look to whether a person’s transactions are
guaranteed by a U.S. person for purposes of determining that person’s U.S.-person status, stating
that our proposal to address such risk through major security-based swap participant registration
was sufficient. 209
One commenter suggested that the Commission follow the CFTC in including in its final
“U.S. person” definition legal persons that are directly or indirectly majority-owned by one or
more U.S. persons who bear unlimited responsibility for the obligations of that legal person,
stating that such a provision is necessary to prevent evasion of Title VII. 210

the acknowledgement in the Cross-Border Proposing Release that guarantees of foreign entities
by a U.S. person may subject the U.S. financial system to risk is inconsistent with a definition
that does not include such entities in the “U.S. person” definition. See id. at 5-6; BM letter at 8,
12. Cf. AFR Letter II at 2 (urging CFTC to include guaranteed affiliates in of U.S. persons in the
interpretation of U.S. person); Greenberger Letter II at 3, 16 (requesting that the CFTC classify
foreign subsidiaries of U.S. financial institutions as U.S. persons); AFR letter to CFTC, dated
August 13, 2012 (“AFR Letter III”) (stating that the CFTC’s Final Exemptive Order Regarding
Compliance with Certain Swap Regulation, 78 FR 858, will pose a risk to U.S. taxpayers due to
the delay in applying requirements to foreign affiliates of U.S. banks) (incorporated by reference
in AFR Letter I); Michael Greenberger letter to CFTC, dated August 13, 2012 (“Greenberger
Letter III”) (incorporated by reference in AFR Letter I).
208

See AFR Letter I at 7; BM Letter at 17 (stating that the exclusion from the de minimis calculation
for guaranteed transactions is “indefensible” and “must be eliminated”). See also Chris Barnard
Letter at 2 (stating that Title VII should apply to transactions involving a guarantee by a U.S.
person).

209

See SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at A-11 to A-12 (stating that to treat the existence of a U.S. parent as
relevant to determining whether a person is a U.S. person would disregard the legal independence
of affiliates and imply that persons within the same corporate group necessarily coordinate their
security-based swap activities).

210

See BM Letter at 10. Cf. CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, 78 FR at 45312.

87

One commenter expressed support for a principal place of business component to the
“U.S. person” definition as set forth in our proposal. 211 Several commenters requested that the
Commission provide additional guidance regarding relevant factors in identifying a legal
person’s principal place of business. 212 One commenter suggested that the location of a
company’s headquarters should be determinative and that a particular legal person should have
only one principal place of business. 213
Several commenters suggested that the Commission harmonize its approach to
determining a person’s principal place of business to the approach in the CFTC Cross-Border
Guidance, 214 while at least one commenter suggested that the Commission work with the CFTC
to develop a new, common definition. 215 At least two commenters, on the other hand, objected
to the use of a “principal place of business” test. 216 One commenter suggested an alternative

211

See Citadel Letter at 2 (stating that Commission was correct to incorporate a principal place of
business determination into the “U.S. person” definition).

212

See IIB Letter at 5 (noting the difficulty of implementing the “principal place of business” test
without further guidance and requesting the Commission to provide workable criteria); ABA
Letter at 2-3 (requesting clarification of “principal place of business” test and recommending that
the Commission confirm that an entity may rely on its counterparty’s written representations
regarding the counterparty’s principal place of business).

213

See IIB Letter at 5-6. Another commenter suggested that the location of the personnel directing
the security-based swap activity of the legal person be determinative. See Citadel Letter at 2.

214

See JFMC Letter at 4 (notwithstanding burdensome aspects of the CFTC’s interpretation, and the
difficulties of the “principal place of business” test in particular, urging the Commission to adopt
the same definition as the CFTC); SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at A-8 (explaining the difficulty in
having to determine a counterparty’s principal place of business under two different standards);
Citadel Letter at 2 (requesting that the Commission provide further guidance “to parallel the
CFTC’s guidance” on principal place of business).

215

See IAA Letter at 3 (urging that, if the Commission adopts a “principal place of business” test, it
coordinate with the CFTC to develop a consistent and harmonized definition).

216

See ESMA Letter at 2 (arguing that the “U.S. person” definition should be limited to entities that
are established within the United States and should not in any case extend to an entity, such as a
U.S. branch of a foreign bank, whose presence in the United States is “complementary” to its
principal activity outside the United States and which is already regulated by a non-U.S.
jurisdiction); JSDA Letter at 3 (recommending that the Commission and the CFTC eliminate the

88

approach that would establish criteria for this determination, such as quantitative thresholds, and
would also consider not requiring a principal place of business analysis if the jurisdiction of
incorporation has an acceptable regulatory framework. 217 Another commenter stated that a U.S.
branch of a person established in another jurisdiction should not be considered to have its
principal place of business in the United States. 218 Another suggested that requiring a principal
place of business analysis represented a departure from the Commission’s stated territorial
approach to U.S. person. 219
Several commenters recommended that, if the Commission were to adopt a “principal
place” of business test in its “U.S. person” definition, market participants be allowed to rely on a
counterparty’s representations as to the counterparty’s principal place of business. 220 Another
suggested that the test look to information found in the public filings of a public company or,
with respect to a private company, the location of its business. 221

with respect to its proposed “U.S. person” definition, particularly the “principal place of
business” test).

and conflicting requirements on the person in the case of European persons that would also be
subject to the European Market Infrastructure Regulation).

representations “absent evidence to the contrary,” regarding their principal place of business);

business” test, they permit entities to rely on counterparty representations); IIB Letter at 5 n.9
(recommending that a counterparty representation as to U.S.-person status be sufficient to fulfill a
person’s diligence requirements). One of these commenters specifically requested that the
reasonable reliance standard be limited to representations regarding principal place of business.

(d) Accounts
One commenter supported the Commission’s proposal for determining the U.S.-person
status of an account, which would look to whether the owner of the account itself is a U.S.
person, 222 but suggested that the Commission provide bright-line thresholds to clarify that de
minimis ownership by U.S. persons would not cause the account to be considered a U.S.
person. 223 The commenter further requested that the Commission clarify that the “account”
prong of the “U.S. person” definition would not apply to collective investment vehicles but was
intended to capture persons that should be considered U.S. persons even though they are
conducting trades, as the direct counterparty, through an account. 224
(e) International Organizations
A number of commenters expressed support for the Commission’s proposal to exclude
certain international organizations (e.g., multilateral development banks, or “MDBs”) from the
“U.S. person” definition. 225 Three commenters specifically requested that the Commission list

223

See id. at A-9. See also IAA Letter at 4-5 (requesting that, should the Commission adopt an
ownership test, it adopt a test consistent with and no more restrictive than the CFTC test for
collective investment vehicles).

224

See SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at A-8 to A-9. Another commenter expressed disagreement with the
Commission’s proposed treatment of accounts in the “U.S. person” definition, expressing concern
that inclusion of accounts in the definition may affect the U.S.-person status of funds. See IAA
Letter at 4 (explaining that an ownership test applying to accounts would potentially capture nonU.S. funds that may have U.S. investors but whose “purposeful activities” such as “marketing or
offering” are not aimed at U.S. persons, meaning the fund would have “little nexus to the U.S.”).

See SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at A-10 (supporting an exclusion for all Foreign Public Sector
Financial Institutions (including MDBs) (“FPSFIs”) and their affiliates from the “U.S. person”
definition); JFMC Letter at 4 (supporting an exclusion from “U.S. person” definition for FPSFIs
and their affiliates); JSDA letter at 3 (supporting the Commission’s proposed exclusion from the
“U.S. person” definition for certain “international organizations” and expressing support for an
exclusion for FPSFIs); International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, International
Finance Corporation et al. Letter (“WB/IFC Letter”) at 1, 6 (supporting an exclusion for
multilateral development institutions and their affiliates from the “U.S. person” definition, and

90

all such institutions that would be excluded from the “U.S. person” definition, similar to the
approach the CFTC took in its guidance, 226 rather than refer to “other similar international
organizations.” 227 These commenters also argued that certain organizations have absolute
immunity under federal law and should be excluded from regulation under Title VII entirely. 228
Three commenters requested that affiliates of MDBs and similar organizations also be excluded
from the definition of “U.S. person.” 229

whose activities must be consistent with and in furtherance of the MDB’s purpose and mission;

itself engage and provide that it is not authorized to engage in any other activities; and (4) which
is under the “control” of the MDB as that term is used in securities laws (Securities Act Rule
405). See also note 225, supra.

(f) Status Representations
Some commenters requested that a potential dealer expressly be permitted to rely on a
counterparty representation to fulfill its diligence requirements in determining whether its
counterparty is a U.S. person under the final rule. 230 Several commenters, as discussed above,
specifically requested that we permit reliance on representations as to a person’s principal place
of business. 231 Two commenters requested that market participants be permitted to rely on the
representations prepared by counterparties under the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance. 232
3. Final Rule
Consistent with the proposal, we are adopting a final definition of “U.S. person” that
continues to reflect a territorial approach to the application of Title VII and is in most respects
unchanged from the proposal. 233 In response to comments, the final definition reflects certain
changes intended to clarify the scope of the definition. Also in response to comments, we are
adopting a general definition of “principal place of business” and a specific application of the
term to externally managed investment vehicles. We are also adding a prong relating
specifically to the U.S.-person status of estates.
The final rule defines “U.S. person” to mean:
•

Any natural person resident in the United States;

230

See IIB Letter at 5 n.9. This commenter suggested that we should permit reliance on a
representation “absent knowledge of facts that would cause a reasonable person to question the
accuracy of the representation.” See also JSDA Letter at 3.

231

See note 220, supra.

232

See SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at A-8 (noting that performing a separate analysis would be
burdensome); IIB Letter at 5, note 9 (noting that the CFTC’s interpretation of “U.S. person” is
broader than, and encompasses the three elements of, the Commission’s proposed “U.S. person”
definition).

233

Cf. note 192, supra (citing comment letters expressing general agreement with our territorial
approach to defining U.S. person).

92

•

Any partnership, corporation, trust, investment vehicle, or other legal person
organized, incorporated, or established under the laws of the United States or
having its principal place of business in the United States;

•

Any account (whether discretionary or non-discretionary) of a U.S. person; or

•

Any estate of a decedent who was a resident of the United States at the time of
death. 234

The final rule defines “principal place of business” to mean “the location from which the
officers, partners, or managers of the legal person primarily direct, control, and coordinate the
activities of the legal person.” 235 It also provides that, with respect to an externally managed
investment vehicle, this location “is the office from which the manager of the vehicle primarily
directs, controls, and coordinates the investment activities of the vehicle.” 236
Also consistent with the proposal, the final definition excludes the following international
organizations from the definition of “U.S. person”: the IMF, the International Bank for
234

Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(i). The second prong has been modified from the proposal to
include an express reference to “investment vehicle” and to clarify that any legal person
“established” under United States law is a U.S. person, as discussed further below. See Exchange
Act rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(i)(B). The fourth prong has been added to include an express reference to
“estate.” See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(i)(D). In the text of the final rule we have made a
technical change to the proposal to clarify that the “U.S. person” definition is met if any one of
the applicable prongs is satisfied (in part by replacing “and” with “or” in connection with the
enumeration of the prongs). See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(i).
Consistent with the proposal, “special entities,” as defined in section 15F(h)(2)(C) of the
Exchange Act, are U.S. persons because they are legal persons organized under the laws of the
United States. Section 15F(h)(2)(C) of the Exchange Act defines the term “special entity” as: a
Federal agency; a State, State agency, city, county, municipality, or other political subdivision of
a State; any employee benefit plan, as defined in section 3 of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. 1002; any governmental plan, as defined in section 3 of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. 1002; or any endowment,
including an endowment that is an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986. 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h)(2)(C).

To address commenters’ requests, 238 the final rule also has been revised from the
proposal to provide that a person may rely on a counterparty’s representation regarding its status
as a U.S. person, unless such person knows, or has reason to know, that the representation is
inaccurate. 239
Although one commenter requested that we use a definition of “U.S. person” that is
consistent with Regulation S, we are declining to do so for the reasons described in our CrossBorder Proposing Release. 240 We acknowledge that many market participants are accustomed to
Regulation S and may find such a definition relatively easy to implement. As we discussed in
our proposal, however, Regulation S addresses different concerns from those addressed by Title
VII. 241 In light of these differences, the Commission believes that adopting the definition of
“U.S. person” in Regulation S would not achieve the goals of Title VII and that a definition of
U.S. person specifically tailored to the regulatory objectives it is meant to serve, as we are
adopting here, is appropriate.

Regulation S and Title VII). For example, with its exclusions for certain foreign branches and
agencies of U.S. persons from the definition of “U.S. person,” Regulation S would not address the
entity-wide nature of the risks that Title VII seeks to address. See id.

94

(a) Natural Persons
As in our proposed definition, the final definition of “U.S. person” provides that any
natural person resident in the United States 242 is a U.S. person. This definition encompasses
persons resident within the United States regardless of the individual’s citizenship status, 243 but it
does not encompass individuals who are resident abroad, even if they possess U.S. citizenship. 244
As we noted in the proposal, it is consistent with the approach we have taken in prior
rulemakings relating to the cross-border application of certain similar regulatory requirements to
subject natural persons residing within the United States to our regulatory framework. 245
Moreover, we believe that natural persons residing within the United States who engage in
security-based swap transactions are likely to raise the types of concerns intended to be
addressed by Title VII, including those related to risk, transparency, and counterparty
protection. 246 We believe that it is reasonable to infer that a significant portion of such persons’
financial and legal relationships are likely to exist within the United States and that it is therefore
reasonable to conclude that risks arising from the security-based swap activities of such persons

242

Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(5) defines “United States” to mean “the United States of America,
its territories and possessions, any State of the United States, and the District of Columbia.”

244

This approach to treating natural persons as U.S. persons solely based on residence, rather than
citizenship, differs from the approach to legal persons, such as partnerships and corporations,
discussed below.
Notwithstanding slight differences between the language of our final rule and the CFTC CrossBorder Guidance, we expect that a natural person’s U.S.-person status under our final definition
would be the same as under the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance. Cf. note 193, supra (citing
commenters urging the Commission to harmonize its definition of “U.S. person” with the
interpretation set forth by the CFTC).

could manifest themselves within the United States, regardless of the location of their
counterparties.
(b) Corporations, Organizations, Trusts, Investment Vehicles, and Other Legal
Persons
The final definition of “U.S. person” as applied to legal persons has been modified to
clarify certain aspects of the rule. Also, in response to comments, we are adopting a definition of
“principal place of business.” In general, the scope of the definition as applied to legal persons
does not differ materially from the scope of our proposal. 247
i.

Entities incorporated, organized, or established under U.S. law

As with the proposed rule, the final definition provides that any partnership, corporation,
trust, or other legal person organized or incorporated under the laws of the United States or
having its principal place of business in the United States would be a U.S. person. 248 The final
definition also includes two changes that are intended to make explicit certain concepts that were
implicit in the proposed definition. First, the final rule provides that a legal person “established”
under the laws of the United States is a U.S. person, just as if it had been “organized” or
“incorporated” under the laws of the United States. This change is intended to clarify the
Commission’s intention that any person formed in any manner under the laws of the United
States will be a U.S. person for purposes of Title VII.
Second, the final rule adds an express reference to “investment vehicle” in the nonexclusive list of legal persons to clarify that any such person, however formed, will be treated as
a U.S. person for purposes of Title VII if it is organized, incorporated, or established under the
247

Moreover, we expect that a legal person’s U.S.-person status under the Commission’s final
definition of “U.S. person” and under the definition “principal place of business” would as a
general matter be the same as under similar prongs on the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance.

96

laws of the United States or has its principal place of business in the United States. 249
Investment vehicles are commonly established as partnerships, trusts, or limited liability entities
and, therefore, fall within the scope of the rule as proposed. However, given the significant role
that such vehicles have played and likely will continue to play in the security-based swap market,
we believe that the final rule should incorporate an express reference to such vehicles to avoid
any ambiguity regarding whether the definition of “U.S. person,” including the principal place of
business component of that definition, applies to them.
As noted in our proposal, we have previously looked to where a legal person is
organized, incorporated, or established to determine whether it is a U.S. person. 250 We continue
to believe that place of organization, incorporation, or establishment is relevant in the context of
Title VII. In our view, the decision of a corporation, trustee, or other person to organize under
the laws of the United States indicates a degree of involvement in the U.S. economy or legal
system that warrants subjecting it to security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap
participant registration requirements under Title VII if its security-based swap dealing activity or
its security-based swap positions exceed the relevant thresholds. 251 We believe that it is
reasonable to infer that an entity incorporated, organized, or established under the laws of the
United States is likely to have a significant portion of its financial and legal relationships in the
United States and that it is therefore reasonable to conclude that the risks arising from its
security-based swap activities are likely to manifest themselves in the United States, regardless

of the location of its counterparties. Accordingly, the final rule retains this element of the
definition.
As under the proposal, the final definition determines a legal person’s status at the entity
level and thus applies to the entire legal person, including any foreign operations that are part of
the U.S. legal person. Consistent with this approach, a foreign branch, agency, or office of a
U.S. person is treated as part of a U.S. person, as it lacks the legal independence to be considered
a non-U.S. person for purposes of Title VII even if its head office is physically located within the
United States. We continue to believe that there is no basis to treat security-based swap
transactions or positions of a foreign branch, agency, or office of a U.S. person differently from
similar transactions or positions of the home office for purposes of the dealer de minimis or
major security-based swap participant threshold calculations, given that the legal obligations and
economic risks associated with such transactions or positions directly affect the entire U.S.
person.
Under the final definition, the status of a legal person as a U.S. person has no bearing on
whether separately incorporated or organized legal persons in its affiliated corporate group are
U.S. persons. Accordingly, a foreign subsidiary of a U.S. person is not a U.S. person merely by
virtue of its relationship with its U.S. parent. Similarly, a foreign person with a U.S. subsidiary
is not a U.S. person simply by virtue of its relationship with its U.S. subsidiary. Although two
commenters urged that most foreign affiliates of U.S. persons be treated as U.S. persons
themselves, 252 we continue to believe that it is appropriate for each affiliate to determine its U.S.-

252

See note 194, supra (citing AFR and BM Letters). One of these commenters argued that the final
definition of “U.S. person” should include guaranteed foreign affiliates of U.S. persons, whether
the guarantee is explicit or implicit, and that affiliates should be presumed to be receiving
guarantees. See AFR Letter I at 3, 5-7. The other urged that the final definition of “U.S. person”

98

person status independently, given the distinct legal status of each of the affiliates, and that such
status should turn on each affiliate’s place of incorporation, organization, or establishment, or on
its principal place of business. 253 We recognize that certain foreign persons, including foreign
persons whose security-based swap activity is subject to a recourse guarantee against a U.S.
person, may create risk to persons within the United States such as counterparties or
guarantors. 254 We continue to believe, however, that, to the extent that such persons are
established under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction and have their principal place of business
abroad, they should not be included in the definition of “U.S. person.” 255 As discussed in further

include guaranteed foreign affiliates and “de facto guaranteed” affiliates of U.S. persons that may
not be explicitly guaranteed. See BM Letter at 9, 11-15.
253

But see section IV.F, infra (discussing the aggregation of affiliate positions for purposes of the de
minimis calculation).

254

See note 207 (citing AFR and BM Letters).

255

As we noted above, our “U.S. person” definition is intended to identify those persons whose
financial and legal relationships are likely to be located in significant part within the United
States. The mere fact of an affiliate relationship with, or a guarantee from, a U.S. person does not
appear to us to indicate that such person has such relationships within the United States.
Similarly, the mere fact that a person’s security-based swap activity poses some degree of risk to
the United States does not necessarily indicate that the person has the types of financial and legal
relationships within the United States that warrant treating it as a U.S. person. However, we
recognize that non-U.S. persons may in fact pose risk to the United States, particularly when their
security-based swap transactions are subject to a recourse guarantee against a U.S.-person
affiliate, and, even though we do not include them in our “U.S. person” definition, we do address
such risk through our final rules applying the security-based swap dealer de minimis exception
and the major security-based swap participant thresholds.
One commenter also urged us to follow the CFTC in including within the final definition any
legal person that is directly or indirectly majority-owned by one or more U.S. persons that bear
unlimited responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of such legal person. See note 210,
supra (citing BM Letter). Cf. CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, 78 FR at 45312, 45317. Although
we recognize that such persons give rise to risk to the U.S. financial system, as with non-U.S.
persons whose security-based swap transactions are subject to explicit financial support
arrangements from U.S. persons, we do not believe that it is appropriate in the context of
security-based swap markets to treat such persons as U.S. persons given that they are
incorporated under foreign law, unless their principal place of business is in the United States.
See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(i)(B). Moreover, to the extent that a non-U.S. person’s
counterparty has recourse to a U.S. person for the performance of the non-U.S. person’s
obligations under a security-based swap by virtue of the U.S. person’s unlimited responsibility for

99

detail below, we believe that our final rules regarding application of the dealer de minimis
exception and the major security-based swap participant thresholds adequately address concerns
about the treatment of these persons under the dealer and major participant definitions without
categorizing them as U.S. persons. 256
ii.

Entities having their principal place of business in the United States
a. In general

Consistent with our proposal, we are defining “U.S. person” to include persons that are
organized, incorporated, or established abroad, but have their principal place of business in the
United States. For purposes of this final rule, and in response to commenters’ request for further
guidance, 257 we are defining “principal place of business” generally to mean “the location from

the non-U.S. person, the non-U.S. person would be required to include the security-based swap in
its own dealer de minimis calculations (if the transaction arises out of the non-U.S. person’s
dealing activity) and its major participant threshold calculations. See sections IV.E.1 and V.D.3,
infra. For example, if a counterparty to a transaction is a general partnership that is not a U.S.
person but has a U.S.-person general partner that has unlimited responsibility for the general
partnership’s liabilities, including for its obligations to security-based swap counterparties, we
would view the general partner’s obligations with respect to the security-based swaps of the
partnership as recourse guarantees for purposes of this final rule, absent countervailing factors.
256

See section IV.E.1 (describing application of de minimis exception to transactions of non-U.S.
persons that are subject to a recourse guarantee against a U.S. person) and section V.D.3
(describing application of major security-based swap participant threshold calculations to
positions of non-U.S. persons that are subject to a recourse guarantee against a U.S. person),
infra. As discussed above, we will address the application of other Title VII requirements to
these persons in subsequent releases.

257

In the proposing release, we did not provide guidance regarding the meaning of “principal place
of business,” but we requested comment whether such guidance was desirable, including whether
it would be appropriate to adopt a definition similar to that adopted in rules under the Investment
Advisers Act. See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 30999 n.306 (noting that the focus
of one possible definition would be similar to that of the definition used in rules promulgated
under the Investment Advisers Act, which define principal place of business as “the executive
office of the investment adviser from which the officers, partners, or managers of the investment
adviser direct, control, and coordinate the activities of the investment adviser”) (citing 17 CFR
275.222-1(b)). As noted above, several commenters requested that we provide guidance
regarding the concept, and some provided suggested interpretations of the phrase with respect to
operating companies and investment vehicles. See, e.g., note 213, supra (citing IIB Letter). See
also SIFMA/FIA/FSR letter at A-8; Citadel Letter at 2. Several of these commenters urged us to

100

which the officers, partners, or managers of the legal person primarily direct, control, and
coordinate the activities of the legal person.” 258 As with the “U.S. person” definition more
generally, our definition of “principal place of business” is intended to identify the location
where a significant portion of the person’s financial and legal relationships would be likely to
exist, and we think it is reasonable to assume, for purposes of this final rule, that this location
also generally corresponds to the location from which the activities of the person are primarily
directed, controlled, and coordinated. In our view, to the extent that this location is within the
United States, it is reasonable to conclude that the risks arising from that entity’s security-based
swap activity could manifest themselves within the United States, regardless of location of its
counterparties.
This definition is intended to help market participants make rational and consistent
determinations regarding whether their (or their counterparty’s) principal place of business is in
the United States. 259 Under the final rule, the principal place of business is in the United States if
minimize divergence from the approach taken subsequent to our proposal by the CFTC in its July
2013 guidance (or from likely outcomes under that approach). See note 214, supra (citing letters
from JFMC, SIFMA/FIA/FSR, Citadel, and IAA). Another commenter urged us to work closely
with the CFTC in developing guidance regarding the meaning of principal place of business. See
note 215, supra (citing IAA Letter).
258

Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(ii). Cf. 17 CFR 275.222-1(b) (defining principal place of
business for investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act to mean “the executive office
of the investment adviser from which the officers, partners, or managers of the investment adviser
direct, control, and coordinate the activities of the investment adviser”).
Because the definition of “principal place of business” in this final rule is tailored to the unique
characteristics of the security-based swap market, it does not limit, alter, or address any guidance
regarding the meaning of the phrase “principal place of business” that may appear in other
provisions of the federal securities laws, including the Investment Advisers Act, Commission
rules, regulations, interpretations, or guidance.

259

Cf. IIB Letter at 6 (urging an approach that “enable[s] market participants to reach rational,
consistent U.S. person determinations for funds”). We also believe that our definition of
“principal place of business” should reduce the potential that a particular entity would have a
different U.S.-person status by virtue of the “principal place of business” prong under our
definition and under the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance.

101

the location from which the overall business activities of the entity are primarily directed,
controlled, and coordinated is within the United States. With the exception of externally
managed entities, as discussed further below, we expect that for most entities the location of
these officers, partners, or managers generally would correspond to the location of the person’s
headquarters or main office. 260
Although we recognize that several commenters objected to including a “principal place
of business” test in our definition of “U.S. person,” 261 we believe that a definition that focused
solely on whether a legal person is organized, incorporated, or established in the United States
could encourage some entities to move their place of incorporation to a non-U.S. jurisdiction to
avoid complying with Title VII, while maintaining their principal place of business—and thus,
reasonably likely, risks arising from their security-based swap transactions—in the United

As discussed in further detail below, we also are including in our definition of “U.S. person” a
provision permitting persons to rely on representations from a counterparty regarding whether the
counterparty’s principal place of business is in the United States, unless these persons know or
have reason to know that the representation is false. See section IV.C.4, infra. Cf. note 220,
supra (citing letters requesting that the Commission’s final rule permit reliance on representations
regarding principal place of business). This provision should further facilitate consistent
application of the “U.S. person” to specific entities across market participants. We are not,
however, specifically providing that entities may rely solely on representations prepared by
counterparties under the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, see note 232, supra, given that the CFTC
has articulated a facts-and-circumstances approach to the principal place of business
determination that is susceptible to significant further development and interpretation. However,
depending on how market participants have applied the CFTC’s facts-and-circumstances analysis,
they may be able to rely on such representations. Because we are permitting persons to rely on
counterparty representations, we do not think it necessary to provide guidance regarding specific
factors a person may consider in determining its counterparty’s principal place of business, as
some commenters requested. Cf. note 221, supra (citing IIB Letter).
260

Cf. note 213, supra (citing IIB letter suggesting that an entity’s principal place of business should
be the location of its headquarters). Our definition of “principal place of business” is in this
respect similar to the guidance issued by the CFTC regarding the application of “principal place
of business” to operating companies. See CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, 78 FR at 45309. We
expect that outcomes of our final definition of “principal place of business” for such entities
would generally be similar to those produced under the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance.

261

See note 216, supra.

102

States. 262 Moreover, we believe that a definition of “U.S. person” that did not incorporate a
“principal place of business” element potentially would result in certain entities falling outside
the Title VII regulatory framework, even though the nature of their legal and financial
relationships in the United States is, as a general matter, indistinguishable from that of entities
incorporated, organized, or established in the United States. 263 Given that such entities raise the
types of concerns that Title VII was intended to address, we believe it is both appropriate under
our territorial approach and consistent with the purposes of Title VII to treat such entities as U.S.
262

For this reason, although we believe that the definition of “principal place of business” set forth
in the final rule is consistent with our territorial approach to application of Title VII, we also
believe that it is necessary or appropriate to prevent the evasion of Title VII. See Exchange Act
section 30(c). The final definition of “principal place of business” will help ensure that entities
do not restructure their business by incorporating under foreign law while continuing to direct,
control, and coordinate the operations of the entity from within the United States, which would
enable them to maintain a significant portion of their financial and legal relationships within the
United States while avoiding application of Title VII requirements to such transactions.

263

In addition, some foreign regulators expressed concerns about our proposed inclusion of a
“principal place of business” element in the “U.S. person” definition, see notes 216-217, supra,
and one foreign regulator encouraged us to focus our final “U.S. person” definition on where a
legal person is established. See note 216, supra. We note that under the European Market
Infrastructure Regulation, a foreign fund is treated identically to a European financial
counterparty if it is managed by a European investment manager. See Regulation (EU) No
648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on OTC derivatives, CCPs, and trade
repositories, Article 2(8) (defining “financial counterparty” to include “an alternative investment
fund managed by [alternative investment fund managers] authorised or registered in accordance
with Directive 2011/61/EU”). This appears to reflect a recognition that where legal person is
established should not be treated as the sole relevant factor in determining whether legal person
should be subject to such jurisdiction’s rules.
We also note that limiting our definition of “U.S. person” to entities incorporated, established, or
organized in the United States as some commenters requested would not eliminate the potential
that entities would be simultaneously classified as U.S. persons and as local persons under foreign
law. Even under such a definition, some persons could be classified both as U.S. persons for
purposes of Title VII and as persons established in foreign jurisdictions under a foreign regulatory
regime. Cf. EC Letter. Although we are adopting a definition of “U.S. person” that should
mitigate this likelihood, we recognize that such entities may be subject to overlapping regulation,
and we intend to address the availability of substituted compliance with respect to specific
substantive requirements in subsequent releases, which should mitigate the concerns expressed by
these commenters. Cf. note 218, supra (citing ESMA Letter noting possibility of duplicative and
conflicting regulation of certain persons as a result of the Commission’s inclusion of a principal
place of business element in the “U.S. person” definition).

103

persons for purposes of the final rule.
We also have considered the suggestion by one commenter that “principal place of
business” be defined to incorporate certain quantitative thresholds and an exception for firms
whose jurisdiction of incorporation has an acceptable regulatory framework in place. 264
However, we do not believe such thresholds are necessary. Because the analysis is applied on an
entity-wide basis, consistent with our entity-based approach generally, the “principal place of
business” analysis generally will not encompass companies incorporated, organized, or
established outside the United States merely because they have an office or branch within the
United States. Similarly, we do not believe that the determination whether a legal person’s
jurisdiction of incorporation, organization, or establishment has an acceptable regulatory
framework is relevant to the question whether a specific person has its principal place of
business in the United States any more than it would be relevant for a person incorporated within
the United States but subject to regulation abroad. The question whether such a company should
be permitted to fulfill relevant Title VII requirements by complying with the law of the
jurisdiction in which it is incorporated, organized, or established is a separate issue that may be
addressed in a separate substituted compliance determination. 265
Finally, we recognize that one commenter suggested that a “principal place of business”
test should look to the location of personnel directing the security-based swap activity of the
entity, 266 but we are not convinced that the location of such personnel, without more, would
264

See note 217, supra (citing EC Letter); note 216, supra (citing ESMA Letter urging the
Commission not to include U.S. branches of foreign banks in its “U.S. person” definition under a
“principal place of business” test).

265

Cf. Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31085-102 (setting forth proposed substituted
compliance framework).

See note 206, supra (citing Citadel Letter).

104

necessarily correspond to the location of a significant portion of the entity’s financial and legal
relationships, which is the focus of our “U.S. person” definition. We also note that a focus on
the location of personnel directing the entity’s security-based swap activity would provide an
incentive for market participants to move such personnel outside the United States while
maintaining their executive offices, and the bulk of their operations, within the United States.
Such restructuring would allow an entity to avoid application of Title VII to its security-based
swap activities while continuing to maintain a significant portion of its financial and legal
relationships within the United States, leaving unchanged the likelihood that risks arising from
its security-based swap activity could manifest themselves within the United States while
avoiding application of Title VII to such activities. 267
b. Externally managed investment vehicles
Application of the “principal place of business” test to externally managed investment
vehicles presents certain challenges not present when determining the principal place of business
of an operating company or other internally managed legal person. For example, an operating
company generally will carry out key functions (including directing, controlling, and
coordinating its business activities) on its own behalf and generally will have offices through
which these functions are performed. Responsibility for key functions of an externally managed
investment vehicle, on the other hand, generally will be allocated to one or more separate
persons (such as external managers, or other agents), with few or no functions carried out

267

As noted above, we believe that the definition of “principal place of business” set forth in the
final rule is consistent with our territorial approach to application of Title VII. We also note,
however, that for the reasons just discussed the final definition’s focus on activity of the person as
a whole, as opposed to a focus on the security-based swap activity of the person, is in our view
necessary or appropriate to prevent the evasion of Title VII. See Exchange Act section 30(c).

105

through an office of the vehicle itself. 268 Further complicating the application of this definition
is the organizational and operational diversity of such vehicles.
Notwithstanding these challenges, we also recognize that externally managed investment
vehicle are active participants in the security-based swap market 269 and, in our view, should be
treated as U.S. persons if their operations are primarily directed, controlled, and coordinated
from a location within the United States. For example, we understand that a significant portion
of the investment vehicles that participate in the security-based swap market are private funds
such as hedge funds. We have observed that such private funds commonly may be organized
under non-U.S. law – frequently in the Cayman Islands – but are managed by investment
advisers headquartered in the United States. 270 We also understand that those advisers
commonly manage or direct the investment activities of these vehicles, including the
arrangement of security-based swaps, through locations within the United States. We further
understand that a significant portion of the financial and legal relationships of such vehicles, as a
general matter, are in the United States, including some combination of equity ownership by
managers (or their affiliates) and outside investors, credit relationships with prime brokers and
other lenders, and relationships with other market participants and service providers. These
vehicles, therefore, raise concerns that are similar to those raised by the security-based swap
268

Such functions may not even be carried out in the jurisdiction in which the externally managed
vehicle is incorporated, organized, or established. Indeed, many private investment funds are
incorporated, organized, or established under the laws of a jurisdiction with which they have only
a nominal connection.

269

See Tables 1 and 2, supra (noting involvement of investment advisers and private funds in the
security-based swap market).

270

This observation is consistent with data reported to us by private fund managers. See Staff of the
Division of Investment Management, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Annual Staff
Report Relating to the Use of Data Collected from Private Fund Systemic Risk Reports (July 25,
2013) at Appendix A (providing aggregated, non-proprietary data on percentages of reporting
private funds organized under non-U.S. law and on locations of advisers to such funds).

106

activities of market participants that are incorporated, established, or organized in the United
States. Over the past two decades, failures of investment vehicles of various types organized
under foreign law, but directed, controlled, or coordinated from within the United States have
had significant negative impact on U.S. financial institutions, potentially threatening the stability
of the U.S. financial system more generally. 271 We believe that it is reasonable to expect that the
security-based swap activities of such vehicles may pose similar risks. 272
To address the unique characteristics of externally managed investment vehicles, we are
including in our definition of “principal place of business” language specifying that an externally
managed investment vehicle’s principal place of business is “the office from which the
manager 273 of the vehicle primarily directs, controls, and coordinates the investment activities of
the vehicle.” This definition directs market participants to consider where the activities of an
271

For example, Long Term Capital Management (“LTCM”), a Delaware partnership with its
principal place of business in Connecticut, established a master fund, Long-Term Capital
Portfolio, L.P. (“LTCP”), in the Cayman Islands. Mine Aysen Doyran, Financial Crisis
Management and the Pursuit of Power: American Pre-Eminience and the Credit Crunch 83-84
(Ashgate 2011). LTCP attracted investments from both U.S. and foreign investors. Id. When it
failed in 1998, fourteen domestic and foreign banks and securities firms (“the Consortium”) that
were major creditors or counterparties of the fund agreed to recapitalize it. GAO, Responses to
Questions Concerning Long-Term Capital Management and Related Events 1 n.2, (identifying
these fourteen firms); id. at 8-9 (stating that “[t]hese firms contributed about $3.6 billion into
[LTCP]”) (available at: http://www.gao.gov/archive/2000/gg00067r.pdf). The Federal Reserve
Board of New York played a key role in initiating discussion among the banks that ultimately
formed the Consortium. Id. at 10.
Other, more recent, examples of risks of such entities established under foreign law manifesting
themselves within the United States include the failure of two Bear Stearns hedge funds, which
had significant repercussions within the United States, and the bailouts of bank-sponsored
structured investment vehicles. See, e.g., FCIC Report at 241, 289-90; Henry Tabe, The
Unravelling of Structured Investment Vehicles: How Liquidity Leaked Through SIVs (2010), at
192-94.

272

For these reasons, we are declining to follow the suggestion of one commenter that we not
include a principal place of business element of the “U.S. person” definition for investment
vehicles. See note 198, supra.

273

Identifying the manager for purposes of this definition will depend on the structure and
organizing documents of the investment vehicle under consideration.

107

externally managed investment vehicle generally are directed, controlled, and coordinated, even
if this conduct is performed by one or more legally separate persons. 274 For an investment
vehicle, for example, the primary manager is responsible for directing, controlling, and
coordinating the overall activity of the vehicle, such that the business of the vehicle, such as its
investment and financing activity, is principally carried out at the location of the primary
manager. Such an investment vehicle’s principal place of business under the final rule would be
the location from which the manager carries out those responsibilities. 275
As noted above, at least one commenter suggested that a “principal place of business”
test should look to the location of personnel directing the security-based swap activity of the
vehicle. 276 Although we believe that the manager responsible for directing, controlling, and
coordinating the activities of the externally managed investment vehicle also would generally be
responsible for directing, controlling, and coordinating the security-based swap activity of such
vehicle, we do not believe that an externally managed vehicle should be excluded from the U.S.
person definition merely because the manager that otherwise directs, controls, and coordinates its

274

Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(ii). At least one commenter also recognized that differences
between categories of legal persons may require different tests for determining whether a person
has its principal place of business in the United States. See IIB Letter at 5-6 (suggesting separate
“principal place of business” tests for operating companies and investment vehicles). The CFTC
Cross-Border Guidance, which provides separate guidance for operating companies, trusts, and
investment vehicles, tailored to the characteristics of each, appears to reflect this distinction. See
CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, 78 FR at 45309-311.

275

As noted above, one commenter suggested that we adopt a definition of “principal place of
business” that looked to where the operational management activities of the fund are carried out.
Cf. note 200, supra. We are not convinced, however, that the location of such activities (which
the commenter identified as including “establishing the fund and selecting its investment
manager, broker, and underwriter/placement agent”), absent an ongoing role by the person
performing those activities in directing, controlling, and coordinating the investment activities of
the fund, generally will be as indicative of activities, financial and legal relationships, and risks
within the United States of the type that Title VII as the location of a fund manager.

276

See note 213, supra (citing Citadel Letter).

108

activity has effectively shifted responsibility for the security-based swap activity of the
externally managed vehicle to a non-U.S. person. As noted above, such an approach would
provide an incentive to move responsibility for the security-based swap activity of externally
managed vehicles outside the United States while retaining control of all other activities relating
to management of such vehicles within the United States. As with the “principal place of
business” definition more generally, and for similar reasons, we believe that the definition of
“principal place of business” set forth in the final rule with respect to externally managed
vehicles is consistent with our territorial approach to application of Title VII. We also note,
however, that for the reasons just discussed the final definition’s focus on where the activity of
the vehicle as a whole is primarily directed, controlled, and coordinated, as opposed to a focus on
its security-based swap activity, is in our view necessary or appropriate to prevent the evasion of
Title VII. 277
In our proposal, we stated that we did not think that the U.S.-person status of a
commodity pool operator (“CPO”) or fund adviser (as opposed to the fund actually entering into
the transaction) was in itself relevant in determining the U.S.-person status of an investment
vehicle. 278 Although the definition of “principal place of business” we are adopting in this final
rule may lead to similar classifications of investment vehicles for purposes of the “U.S. person”
definition as a test that looked to the U.S.-person status of a CPO or fund adviser, we believe that
the definition we are adopting is more appropriately designed to capture externally managed
investment vehicles that raise the kinds of concerns that Title VII was intended to address.
Moreover, we note that mere retention of an asset manager that is a U.S. person, without more,
277

See Exchange Act section 30(c).

278

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31144 n.1454.

109

would not necessarily bring an offshore investment vehicle or other person within the scope of
the “U.S. person” definition. 279 However, where an asset manager, whether or not a U.S. person,
is primarily responsible for directing, controlling, and coordinating the activities of an externally
managed vehicle and carries out this responsibility within the United States, we believe that it is
reasonable to include the externally managed vehicle in the definition of “U.S. person” 280 and to
require foreign dealers to include dealing activity with such vehicles in their de minimis
threshold calculations.
iii.

Fund ownership

Some commenters urged us to include in the definition investment vehicles that are
majority-owned by U.S. persons. 281 One of these commenters noted that the CFTC had reasoned
that “‘passive investment vehicles’” designed to “‘achieve the investment objectives of their
beneficial owner’” were distinguishable from majority-owned entities that are “‘separate, active
operating businesses.’” 282 We are not persuaded, however, that this distinction between
investment vehicles and operating companies warrants treating ownership interests in these two
types of entities differently for purposes of the “U.S. person” definition, particularly given that
the exposure of investors in a collective investment vehicle engaging in security-based swap
279

Cf. note 195, supra (citing IAA letter urging the Commission to follow the CFTC in clarifying
that retention of an asset manager that is a U.S. person alone would not bring a person within the
scope of the “U.S. person” definition).

280

We also noted in our proposal that a transaction by an adviser on behalf of a fund could be a
“transaction conducted within the United States” as defined in the proposal and thus fall within
the scope of Title VII. See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31144 n.1454. As noted
above, we are not addressing the “transaction conducted within the United States” element of our
proposal in the final rule and instead intend to address this element of the proposed dealer de
minimis threshold calculations in a subsequent reproposal.

281

See note 203, supra (citing BM Letter and AFR Letter). The CFTC also incorporated a majorityownership inquiry in its interpretation of “U.S. person” as it applies to funds. See CFTC CrossBorder Guidance, 78 FR at 45313.

282

BM Letter at 10 (quoting CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, 78 FR at 45314).

110

transactions typically is capped at the amount of their investment and such investors generally
are unlikely to seek to make the investment vehicle’s counterparties whole for reputational or
other reasons in the event of a default. 283 We do not believe risks created through ownership
interests in collective investment vehicles are the types of risks that Title VII is intended to
address with respect to security-based swaps. 284
Because we are not adopting an ownership test for funds, we are also not following the
suggestion of some commenters that we exclude from the “U.S. person” definition investment
vehicles that are offered publicly only to non-U.S. persons and are not offered to U.S. persons. 285
Although we recognize that the CFTC reasoned that such investment vehicles would generally
not be within its interpretation of “U.S. person,” 286 we do not believe that it would be relevant

283

See Cross-Border Proposal, 78 FR at 31144 (noting that losses arising from investments in
investment vehicles “are generally limited to their investments in the form of equity or debt
securities” and that these risks are “addressed by other provisions of U.S. securities law
pertaining to issuances and offerings of equity or debt securities”).

284

Several commenters also argued that a majority-ownership test, including any look-through
requirements, may be difficult to implement in this context. See note 203, supra (citing ICI Letter
and IAA Letter). We believe that our definition of “principal place of business” with respect to
externally managed entities should help to ensure that the “U.S. person” definition encompasses
investment vehicles that may generally have a significant portion of their financial and legal
relationships within the United States and that may therefore raise the types of risk concerns
within the United States that Title VII was intended to address.
We note that, because we are not following a majority-ownership approach for collective
investment vehicles as part of the “U.S. person” definition, the U.S.-person status of accounts
investing in such investment vehicles will not affect the U.S.-person status of such vehicles. Cf.
IAA Letter at 4 (explaining that a majority-ownership test would capture non-U.S. funds with
minimal nexus to the United States and present implementation challenges).

285

See note 205, supra (citing IAA Letter). Cf. CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, 78 FR at 45314,
45317. One commenter suggested that the exclusion apply to funds offered publicly only to nonU.S. persons and are regulated in a foreign jurisdiction. See note 205, supra (citing ICI Letter,
which suggested that funds regulated under foreign law be excluded from the “U.S. person”
definition if they are (1) offered publicly only to non-U.S. persons; (2) offered publicly only to
non-U.S. persons but offered privately to U.S. persons; or (3) authorized to offer publicly within
the United States. but elect to offer only privately to non-U.S. institutional investors).

286

See CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, 78 FR at 45314.

111

under our final definition, which does not focus on an investment vehicle’s ownership by U.S.
persons. 287
(c) Accounts
The final definition of “U.S. person” continues to mean “any account (whether
discretionary or not) of a U.S. person,” irrespective of whether the person at which the account is
held or maintained is a U.S. person. 288 As a general matter, we expect that market participants
will determine their U.S.-person status under the prongs of that definition relating to natural
persons or to legal persons. 289 This “account” prong of the definition is intended to clarify that a
person’s status for purposes of this rule generally does not differ depending on whether the
person enters into security-based swap transactions through an account, or depending on whether
the account is held or maintained at a U.S. person or a non-U.S. person intermediary or financial
institution.290
Consistent with the overall approach to the definition of “U.S. person,” our focus under
the “account” prong of this definition is on the party that actually bears the risk arising from the

287

We also note that our guidance regarding the meaning of “principal place of business” is designed
to identify, among other entities, investment vehicles that may pose risks to the United States,
regardless of where they may be offered.

288

Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(i)(C). Thus, if a partnership, corporation, trust, investment
vehicle, or other legal person is a U.S. person, any account of that person is a U.S. person.

289

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(i)(A) and (B).

290

As we noted in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, this approach is consistent with the
treatment of managed accounts in the context of the major security-based swap participant
definition, whereby the swap or security-based swap positions in client accounts managed by
asset managers or investment advisers are not attributed to such entities for purposes of the major
participant definitions, but rather are attributed to the beneficial owners of such positions based
on where the risk associated with those positions ultimately lies. See Intermediary Definitions
Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30690.

112

security-based swap transactions. 291 Accordingly, an account owned solely by one or more U.S.
persons is a U.S. person, even if it is held or maintained at a foreign financial institution or other
person that is itself not a U.S. person; an account owned solely by one or more non-U.S. persons
is not a U.S. person, even if it is held or maintained at a U.S. financial institution or other person
that is itself a U.S. person. For purposes of this “account” prong of the “U.S. person” definition,
account ownership is evaluated only with respect to direct beneficial owners of the account.
Because the status of an account turns on the status of the account’s beneficial owners, the status
of any nominees of an account is irrelevant in determining whether the account is a U.S. person
under the final rule.
Where an account is owned by both U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons, the U.S.-person
status of the account, as a general matter, should turn on whether any U.S.-person owner of the
account incurs obligations under the security-based swap. 292 Consistent with the approach to

291

In other words, the U.S.-person status of an account is relevant under our final rule to the extent
that the security-based swap activity is carried out by or through the account. Because our final
definition of “U.S. person” does not include investment vehicles that are majority-owned by U.S.
persons, the underlying ownership of an investment vehicle that engages in security-based swap
activity through an account is not relevant in determining the U.S.-person status of an account.
Cf. note 224, supra (citing IAA Letter expressing concern about the relationship between the
definition of accounts and treatment of funds).

292

Two commenters urged us to exclude from the definition of “U.S. person” any account with a de
minimis level of ownership by a U.S. person. See note 223, supra (citing letters from IAA and
SIFMA/FIA/FSR). We, however, do not believe it would be appropriate to incorporate this
concept wholesale into the definition of “U.S. person,” as a de minimis level of ownership by a
U.S. person in the account does not necessarily indicate that such a U.S. person incurs only a de
minimis level of risk or obligations under the security-based swap transactions entered into
through the account. For example, the U.S. person may be jointly and severally liable with all of
the other account owners for obligations incurred under a security-based swap. We recognize
that account ownership may take different forms and that security-based swap transactions may
impose risks and obligations on account holders in different ways. The approach we are taking
here is intended to take into account the concerns expressed by commenters regarding de minimis
U.S.-person interests in such accounts, while also recognizing that security-based swap
transactions carried out through such accounts may pose risks to U.S. persons and to the U.S.
financial system.

113

U.S.-person and non-U.S.-person accounts described above, neither the status of the fiduciary or
other person managing the account, nor the discretionary or non-discretionary nature of the
account, nor the status of the person at which the account is held or maintained are relevant in
determining the account’s U.S.-person status.
(d) Estates
The final rule incorporates a new prong that expressly includes certain estates within the
definition of “U.S. person.” Under the final rule any estate of a natural person who was a
resident of the United States at the time of death is itself a U.S. person. 293 Our proposed rule did
not expressly address estates because we did not believe that they typically engage in securitybased swap activity and, to the extent that they do, their U.S.-person status would have been
determined under the standard applicable to any legal person under our proposed rule. We
received no comments in response to our questions regarding whether we should adopt a final
rule that expressly addresses estates or that reflects the CFTC’s proposed approach. 294
We continue to believe that estates are not likely to be significant participants in the
security-based swap market, but we also believe that, given the unique characteristics of estates,
it is appropriate to include in the “U.S. person” definition an express reference to estates of
decedents who were residents of the United States at the time of death. This element of our final
definition reflects similar considerations to those that informed our inclusion of natural persons
who are residents of the United States within the scope of that definition. We noted above that
the security-based swap activity of a natural person who is a resident of the United States raises
the types of risks that Title VII is intended to address, given that person’s residence status and
293

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(i)(D).

294

The CFTC subsequently issued an interpretation of “U.S. person” that expressly incorporates
estates. See CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, 78 FR at 45314.

114

likely financial and legal relationships, and we expect that the estate of a natural person who was
a resident of the United States at the time of his or her death is likely to operate within the same
relationships that warranted subjecting such transactions to Title VII during the life of the
decedent.
(e) Certain International Organizations
As under the proposal, the final rule expressly excludes certain international
organizations from the definition of U.S. person. 295 This list includes “the [IMF], the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank,
the Asian Development Bank, the African Development Bank, the United Nations, and their
agencies and pension plans, and any other similar international organizations, their agencies and
pension plans.” 296 Although these organizations may have headquarters in the United States, the
Commission continues to believe that their status as international organizations warrants
excluding them from the definition of “U.S. person.” 297
4. Representations Regarding U.S.-person status
Our proposed definition of “U.S. person” did not expressly provide that parties could rely
on representations from their counterparties as to their counterparties’ U.S.-person status,

295

Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(iii).

296

Id. Although three commenters requested that we list all such organizations that are excluded
from U.S. persons, see note 226, supra, we do not believe it appropriate to attempt to enumerate
an exclusive list of entities that may be eligible for such exclusion.

297

Although three commenters requested that the final rule also exclude “controlled affiliates” of
these international organizations from the definition of “U.S. person,” see note 229, supra (citing
SC Letter, WB/IFC Letter, and IDB Letter), our final rule does not incorporate such an exclusion,
as commenters did not provide us with information that leads us to change our view that we
should not treat such affiliates’ security-based swap or other activities differently from other
persons that are incorporated, organized, or established in the United States or have their principal
place of business here.

115

although we did anticipate that parties likely would request such representations. 298 On further
consideration, we believe that market participants would benefit from an express provision
permitting reliance on such representations. 299 Accordingly, under the final rule, a person need
not consider its counterparty to be a U.S. person for purposes of Title VII if that person receives
a representation from the counterparty that the counterparty does not satisfy the criteria set forth
in Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(i), unless such person knows or has reason to know that the
representation is not accurate. For purposes of the final rule a person would have reason to know
the representation is not accurate if a reasonable person should know, under all of the facts of
which the person is aware, that it is not accurate. 300
Expressly permitting market participants to rely on such representations in the “U.S.
person” definition should help mitigate challenges that could arise in determining a
counterparty’s U.S.-person status under the final rule. It permits the party best positioned to
make this determination to perform an analysis of its own U.S.-person status and convey, in the
298

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31140.

299

Cf. note 230, supra (citing IIB Letter requesting the Commission to confirm that, as a general
matter, a representation is sufficient to fulfill diligence requirements under these rules).

300

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(iii). This provision applies to each prong of the “U.S.
person” definition, including the principal place of business prong. Cf. note 220, supra. As noted
above, we are not providing that persons may rely solely on representations from counterparties
that have been developed for purposes of the CFTC’s interpretation of U.S. person. However,
depending on how market participants have applied the CFTC’s general facts-and-circumstances
inquiry, they may be able to rely on such representations.
As we noted in the proposal, for purposes of the de minimis threshold, the U.S.-person status of a
non-U.S. person’s counterparty would be relevant only at the time of a transaction that arises out
of the non-U.S. person’s dealing activity. See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 30994
n.264. Any change in a counterparty’s U.S.-person status after the transaction is executed would
not affect the original transaction’s treatment for purposes of the de minimis exception, though it
would affect the treatment of any subsequent dealing transactions with that counterparty. See
also Product Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 48286 (“If the material terms of a Title VII
instrument are amended or modified during its life based on an exercise of discretion and not
through predetermined criteria or a predetermined self-executing formula, the Commissions view
the amended or modified Title VII instrument as a new Title VII instrument”).

116

form of a representation, the results of that analysis to its counterparty. In addition, such
representations should help reduce the potential for inconsistent classification and treatment of a
person by its counterparties and promote uniform application of Title VII. 301
The final rule reflects a constructive knowledge standard for reliance. Under this
standard, a counterparty is permitted to rely on a representation, unless the person knows or has
reason to know that the representation is inaccurate. A person would have reason to know the
representation is not accurate for purposes of the final rule if a reasonable person should know,
under all of the facts of which the person is aware, that it is not accurate. 302 We believe that this
“know or have reason to know” standard should help ensure that potential security-based swap
dealers and major security-based swap participants do not disregard facts that call into question
the validity of the representation.
D. Application of De Minimis Exception to Dealing Activities of Conduit Affiliates
1. Proposed Approach and Commenters’ Views
The Cross-Border Proposing Release did not include requirements specific to “conduit
affiliates” or other non-U.S. persons that enter into security-based swap transactions on behalf of
301

The final rule permitting reliance on representations with respect to a counterparty’s U.S.-person
status applies only to the definition of “U.S. person” as used in this final rule and does not apply
to any determinations of a person’s U.S.-person status under any other provision of the federal
securities laws, including Commission rules, regulations, interpretations, or guidance.

302

Cf. IIB Letter at 5 n.9 (urging the Commission to permit reliance on counterparty representations,
“absent knowledge of facts that would cause a reasonable person to question the accuracy of the
representation”). To the extent that a person has knowledge of facts that would lead a reasonable
person to believe that a counterparty may be a U.S. person under the final definitions it may need
to conduct additional diligence before relying on the representation.
We recognize that one commenter urged us to limit a reasonable reliance standard for such
representations to representations concerning whether a person had its principal place of business
in the United States. Cf. note 220, supra (citing ABA Letter). However, we believe that applying
a single standard of reliance to all representations regarding a person’s U.S.-person status will
reduce the potential complexity of establishing policies and procedures associated with
identifying the U.S.-person status of counterparties.

their U.S. affiliates. Instead, the proposal would have treated those entities like other non-U.S.
persons, and required them to count, against the de minimis thresholds, only their dealing
transactions with U.S. persons other than foreign branches, and their dealing transactions
conducted in the United States. 303 The proposal also noted that the general rule implementing
the de minimis exception excludes transactions between majority-owned affiliates from the
analysis. 304
The proposal acknowledged the difference between its approach and the CFTC’s
approach in its proposed cross-border guidance, which encompassed special provisions for
foreign affiliates that act as conduits for U.S. persons. 305 We thus cited the CFTC’s proposed
approach toward conduit affiliates in requesting comment regarding whether the Commission
should follow a similar approach. 306 We also requested comment as to whether the Commission
should, consistent with the CFTC’s proposed approach, require a person that operates a “central
booking system” – whereby security-based swaps are booked to a single legal person – be
subject to applicable dealer registration requirements as if the person had entered into the
security-based swaps directly. 307 More generally, we requested comment as to whether foreign
affiliates of U.S. persons, such as majority-owned subsidiaries of U.S. parents, should be
considered to be U.S. persons. 308

One commenter took the view that the Commission’s rules should not make use of the
conduit affiliate concept notwithstanding its use in the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, stating
that the concept lacks any statutory or regulatory authority, would not advance efforts to reduce
systemic risk, and, if applied to end-users, would interfere with internal risk allocations within a
corporate group. 309 In contrast, one commenter depicted conduit affiliates as being a type of
person that is subject to a de facto guarantee by a U.S. affiliate and that should thus be treated as
a U.S. person, and also argued that the dealer registration requirement should apply to other
types of entities subject to a de facto guarantee. 310
One commenter further opposed the adoption of an approach that would require a
“central booking system” or any other affiliate to register as a security-based swap dealer based
solely on its inter-affiliate security-based swap transactions, arguing that such an approach would
tie registration requirements to firms’ internal risk management practices, and would hamper the
ability to manage risk across a multinational enterprise. 311

Final Rule

The final rule distinguishes “conduit affiliates” from other non-U.S. persons by requiring
such entities to count all of their dealing transactions against the de minimis thresholds,
regardless of the counterparty. 312 As discussed below, for these purposes a “conduit affiliate” is
309

See CDEU Letter at 3-5 (adding that if the conduit concept is not rejected, at a minimum it should
exclude non-dealers and should not be applied to security-based swaps in which neither party is a
dealer or a major participant).

310

See BM Letter at 3, 14-15.

311

See SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at A-16 to A-17 (also stating that the final CFTC cross-border
guidance does not include the central booking system concept). See also CDEU Letter at 3-5
(raising concerns that the regulation of conduit affiliates may have the potential to interfere with
the use of centralized treasury units that corporate groups may use as a market-facing entity for a
non-dealer’s corporate group).

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(ii).

a non-U.S. affiliate of a U.S. person that enters into security-based swaps with non-U.S. persons,
or with certain foreign branches of U.S. banks, on behalf of one or more of its U.S. affiliates
(other than U.S. affiliates that are registered as security-based swap dealers or major securitybased swap participants), and enters into offsetting transactions with its U.S. affiliates to transfer
the risks and benefits of those security-based swaps.
After careful consideration, we believe that requiring such conduit affiliates to count their
dealing transactions against the de minimis thresholds is appropriate to help ensure that non-U.S.
persons do not facilitate the evasion of registration requirements under Dodd-Frank by
participating in arrangements whereby a non-U.S. person engages in security-based swap activity
outside the United States on behalf of a U.S. affiliate that is not a registered security-based swap
dealer or major security-based swap participant, 313 and the U.S. affiliate assumes economic risks
and benefits of those positions by entering into offsetting transactions with the non-U.S. affiliate.
Absent such a requirement that conduit affiliates count their dealing transactions for purposes of
the de minimis exception, a U.S. person may be able to effectively engage in unregistered
dealing activity involving non-U.S. persons by having a non-U.S. affiliate enter into dealing
transactions with other non-U.S. persons (which would not be counted against the de minimis
thresholds because both counterparties are non-U.S. persons) or with foreign branches of U.S.
banks that are registered as security-based swap dealers (which would not be counted against the
de minimis thresholds because of an exclusion for dealing transactions with foreign branches of
U.S. banks that are registered as security-based swap dealers). The U.S. person could enter into
313

As discussed below, the “conduit affiliate” definition does not encompass persons that engage in
such offsetting transactions solely with U.S. persons that are registered with the Commission as
security-based swap dealers or major security-based swap participants because we do not believe
that such transactions raise the types of evasion concerns that the conduit affiliate concept is
designed to address.

120

offsetting transactions with those non-U.S. affiliates, and those offsetting transactions would not
be counted against the de minimis thresholds due to the inter-affiliate exception to the dealer
analysis. 314
Accordingly, in our view, requiring conduit affiliates to count their dealing transactions
against the thresholds is necessary or appropriate to prevent the evasion of any provision of the
amendments made to the Exchange Act by Title VII for the reasons given above. 315 We believe
that this requirement is appropriately tailored to prevent the evasion of the dealer
requirements, 316 while preserving participants’ flexibility in managing risk exposures through
inter-affiliate transactions. 317

314

The rule requires that a conduit affiliate count all of its dealing activity, and is not limited to the
conduit affiliate’s dealing transactions that specifically are linked to offsetting transactions with a
U.S. affiliate. This is because there may not be a one-to-one correspondence between dealing
transactions and their offsets for reasons such as netting.

315

See Exchange Act section 30(c); section II.B.2(d), supra. In noting that this requirement is
consistent with our anti-evasion authority under Exchange Act section 30(c), we are not taking a
position as to whether such activity by a conduit affiliate otherwise constitutes a “business in
security-based swaps without the jurisdiction of the United States.”

316

We recognize that not all dealing structures involving conduit affiliates may be evasive in
purpose. We believe, however, that the anti-evasion authority of section 30(c) permits us to
prescribe prophylactic rules to conduct without the jurisdiction of the United States, even if those
rules would also apply to a market participant that has been transacting business through a preexisting market structure established for valid business purposes, so long as the rule is designed to
prevent possible evasive conduct. See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 30987; see also
section II.B.2(d), supra (discussion of anti-evasion authority); Abramski v. United States, No. 121493, slip op. at 14 (S. Ct. June 16, 2014) (noting “courts’ standard practice, evident in many
legal spheres and presumably known to Congress, of ignoring artifice when identifying the parties
to a transaction”).
We also note that while this requirement appears consistent with the views of a commenter that
supported the use of the conduit affiliate concept, we take no position on that commenter’s view
that conduit affiliates represent a type of entity that is subject to a de facto guarantee by a U.S.
person. See note 310, supra. Indeed, in our view the conduit affiliate concept will serve as a
useful anti-evasion tool even in the situation where the conduit affiliate’s counterparty does not
consider the U.S. person’s creditworthiness in determining whether to enter into a security-based
swap with the conduit affiliate.

317

For example, one potential alternative anti-evasion safeguard could be to narrow the inter-affiliate
exception to counting dealing transactions against the de minimis thresholds, such as by making

121

In light of the anti-evasion rationale for this use of the conduit affiliate concept, which is
consistent with our statutory anti-evasion authority, we are not persuaded by a commenter’s view
that the use of the concept is outside of our authority. 318 We also are not persuaded by that
commenter’s suggestion that the use of the conduit affiliate concept would not advance riskmitigation goals, given that the concept can be expected to help ensure that the provisions of
Title VII applicable to dealers (including risk mitigation provisions such as margin and capital
requirements) are implemented, which can be expected to produce risk mitigation benefits.
At the same time, we recognize the significance of commenter concerns that the use of
the “conduit affiliate” concept or the use of a “central booking system” approach to registration
could impede efficient risk management practices. 319 The conduit affiliate concept serves as a
prophylactic anti-evasion measure, and we do not believe that any entities currently act as
conduit affiliates in the security-based swap market, particularly given that a framework for the
comprehensive regulation of security-based swaps did not exist prior to the enactment of Title
VII, suggesting that market participants would have had no incentives to use such arrangements
for evasive purposes.
Moreover, in light of this anti-evasion purpose, the definition of “conduit affiliate” does
not include entities that may otherwise engage in relevant activity on behalf of affiliated U.S.
persons that are registered with the Commission as security-based swap dealers or major

the exception unavailable in the context of transactions between non-U.S. persons and their U.S.
affiliates. We believe, however, that such an approach would be less well-targeted than the use of
the conduit affiliate concept, as that alternative could impact a corporate group’s ability to use
specific market-facing entities to facilitate the group’s security-based swap activities (given that
the market-facing entities would arguably be acting as a dealer on behalf of its affiliates).
318

See CDEU Letter at 3 (“The concept of a conduit affiliate is not based on statutory or regulatory
authority, and does not decrease the potential for systemic risk.”). See also note 309, supra.

319

See note 311, supra (citing CDEU Letter).

122

security-based swap participants, as we do not believe that transactions involving these types of
registered entities and their foreign affiliates raise the types of evasion concerns that the conduit
affiliate concept is designed to address. 320
In addition, in the context of the dealer de minimis exception, the relevant rules would
require the conduit affiliate to count only its dealing transactions. The rules accordingly
distinguish dealing activity by a conduit affiliate from a corporate group’s use of affiliates for
non-dealing purposes, such as a corporate group’s use of a single affiliated person to enter into
transactions with the market for risk management not involving dealing activity (accompanied by
offsetting inter-affiliate transactions that place the economic substance of the instrument into
another person within the group). The requirement we are adopting here – under which a conduit
affiliate will count only its dealing transactions against the de minimis thresholds – is not
expected to impact persons that enter into security-based swaps with affiliates for non-dealing
purposes. 321
Consistent with these goals, the final rule defines “conduit affiliate” in part as a non-U.S.
person that directly or indirectly is majority-owned by one or more U.S. persons. 322 To be a

320

As discussed below, we also are applying the conduit affiliate concept to the major participant
analysis to help guard against evasive practices. See section V.C, infra.

321

One commenter particularly suggested that the conduit affiliate concept, if implemented, should
exclude non-dealers. See CDEU Letter. As the requirement related to counting by conduit
affiliates for purposes of the de minimis dealer exception is relevant only to the extent that a
conduit affiliate engages in dealing activity, however, we do not believe that it is necessary to
otherwise tailor the requirement to address the possibility that a conduit affiliate is acting on
behalf of an affiliated U.S. non-dealer for risk management or other non-dealing purposes.
Moreover, as discussed above, over a recent six-year period, entities that are recognized as
dealers are responsible for almost 85 percent of transactions involving single-name CDS. See
Table 1, section III.A.1, supra.

322

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(1)(i)(A).
For purposes of the definition, the majority-ownership standard is met if one or more U.S.
persons directly or indirectly own a majority interest in the non-U.S. person, where “majority

conduit affiliate, moreover, such a person must in the regular course of business enter into in
security-based swaps with one or more other non-U.S. persons or with foreign branches of U.S.
banks that are registered as security-based swap dealers, 323 for the purposes of hedging or
mitigating risks faced by, or otherwise taking positions on behalf of, one or more U.S. persons 324
(other than U.S. persons that are registered as security-based swap dealers or major securitybased swap participants) that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with the
potential conduit affiliate, and enter into offsetting security-based swaps or other arrangements
with such affiliated U.S. persons to transfer risks and benefits of those security-based swaps. 325

interest” is the right to vote or direct the vote of a majority of a class of voting securities of an
entity, the power to sell or direct the sale of a majority of a class of voting securities of an entity,
or the right to receive upon dissolution, or the contribution of, a majority of the capital of a
partnership. See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(1)(ii). This parallels the majority-ownership
standard in the inter-affiliate exclusion from the dealer analysis. See Exchange Act rule 3a711(d).
323

The definition does not require a conduit affiliate to exclusively transact with such non-U.S.
persons and foreign branches. Accordingly, transactions with other types of U.S. persons would
not cause a person to fall outside the “conduit affiliate’ definition.

324

For these purposes, it would not be necessary that the non-U.S. person transfer the risks and
benefits of all of its security-based swaps. It also would not be necessary that the non-U.S.
person transfer all of the risks and benefits of any particular security-based swap; for example, the
non-U.S. person may retain the credit risk associated with a security-based swap with a non-U.S.
counterparty, but transfer to its U.S. affiliate the market risk associated with the instrument.

325

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(1)(i)(B).
The reference to “other arrangements” to transfer the risks and benefits of security-based swaps,
as an alternative to entering into offsetting security-based swaps, may encompass, for example,
the use of swaps to transfer risks and benefits of the security-based swaps (for example, two CDS
based on slightly different indices of securities could be used to approximately replicate a
security-based swap such as a CDS based on a single reference entity).
We note that while the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance also states the view that as a general matter
conduit affiliates should count their dealing activity against the de minimis thresholds (see 78 FR
at 45318-19), the CFTC’s interpretation of what constitutes a “conduit affiliate” differs in certain
ways from our final rule. For example, the CFTC’s approach takes into account whether the
conduit affiliate’s financial results are consolidated in the U.S. person’s financial statements, and
the CFTC states that it did not “intend that the term ‘conduit affiliate’ would include affiliates of
swap dealers.” See CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, 78 FR at 45359; see also id. at 45318-19
n.258.

124

E. Application of De Minimis Exception to Dealing Activities of Other Non-U.S.
Persons
As noted above, the proposal would have required non-U.S. persons to count, against the
de minimis thresholds, only their dealing transactions involving U.S. persons other than foreign
branches, and their dealing transactions conducted within the United States. 326
Aside from issues related to conduit affiliates, addressed above, commenters discussed
other issues regarding the application of the de minimis exception to the dealing activities of
non-U.S. persons, particularly relating to: (i) dealing transactions of non-U.S. persons that are
guaranteed by their U.S. affiliates; (ii) activities within the United States; and (iii) dealing
activities of other non-U.S. persons whose counterparties are U.S. persons (including foreign
branches of U.S. banks) or non-U.S. persons guaranteed by U.S. persons. We are addressing
those groups of issues separately, given the distinct issues relevant to each. 327 As discussed
below, the final rule requires non-U.S. persons (apart from the conduit affiliates addressed
above) to count all of their dealing transactions where: (1) the transaction is subject to a recourse
guarantee against a U.S. affiliate of the non-U.S. person; or (2) the counterparty to the
transaction is a U.S. person, other than the foreign branch of a registered security-based swap
dealer.

In our view, the final rule’s definition – including its prerequisite that the conduit affiliate be
majority-owned by non-natural U.S. persons appropriately focuses the meaning of the term
“conduit affiliate” on persons who may engage in security-based swap activity on behalf of U.S.
affiliates in connection with dealing activity (and, as discussed below, see section V.C, infra, in
connection with other security-based swap activity in the context of the major participant
definition).
326

See proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(ii).

327

In addition, some commenters requested an exclusion for transactions that are executed
anonymously and cleared. Those comments – and our incorporation of an exception for certain
cleared anonymous transactions – are addressed below. See section IV.G, infra.

125

1. Dealing Transactions of Non-U.S. Persons that are Subject to Recourse Guarantees
by their U.S. Affiliates
(a) Proposed Approach and Commenters’ Views
Under the proposal, a non-U.S. person’s transactions involving security-based swaps
guaranteed by its U.S. affiliate would have been treated the same as other transactions of nonU.S. persons for purposes of the de minimis exception. In other words, the non-U.S. guaranteed
affiliate would have counted, against the de minimis thresholds, only its dealing transactions
involving U.S. persons other than foreign branches, and its dealing transactions otherwise
conducted within the United States. 328
In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, we solicited comment regarding whether the
“U.S. person” definition should incorporate foreign entities that are guaranteed by their U.S.
affiliates. 329 We also expressed the preliminary view that the primary risk related to such
guaranteed transactions of non-U.S. persons was the risk posed to the United States via the
guarantee from a U.S. person, rather than the dealing activity occurring between two non-U.S.
persons outside the United States, and sought to address this risk via the proposed attribution
principles in the “major security-based swap participant” definition, and we also expressed the
view that the use of the major participant definition effectively would address those regulatory
concerns. 330
328

See proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(ii).

329

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 30998.

330

See id. at 31006. As part of the proposal, we also expressed the preliminary view that dealer
regulation of such persons would not materially increase the programmatic benefits of the dealer
registration requirement, and that such an approach would impose programmatic costs without a
corresponding increase in programmatic benefits to the U.S. security-based swap market. See id.
at 31146-47. For the reasons discussed below, however, we have concluded that it is appropriate
to require non-U.S. guaranteed affiliates of U.S. persons to count, against the de minimis
thresholds, their dealing transactions that are subject to a right of recourse against a U.S. person.
See IV.E.1(b) (discussing the final rule’s changes to the preliminary view).

126

Two commenters supported an alternative approach to require such guaranteed non-U.S.
persons to count all of their dealing transactions against the thresholds. One commenter stated
that non-U.S. persons that receive guarantees from U.S. persons should count all of their dealing
transactions toward the de minimis thresholds, arguing that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the resulting flow of risk to the United States and that major participant
regulation was not the appropriate means of addressing those risks. 331 Another commenter took
the position that the proposed approach would provide a loophole whereby U.S. entities trading
in security-based swaps could avoid regulation under the Dodd-Frank Act. 332 Both commenters
further suggested that affiliates of U.S. persons be presumed to be beneficiaries of guarantees, 333
with the presumption potentially subject to rebuttal if there is notice that no guarantee would be
provided. 334
One comment letter did not explicitly address this issue, but did support the
Commission’s proposed approach not to require non-U.S. persons to aggregate the dealing
transactions of their U.S.-guaranteed affiliates against the de minimis thresholds, stating that this
would pose too tenuous a nexus with the U.S. to justify registration. 335

331

332

See AFR Letter I at 7-8, 14.

333

See id. at 14 (“In cases where a guarantee is implicit, the use of a rebuttable presumption of a
guarantee will put the burden on the foreign affiliate in question to demonstrate to regulators that
it is not guaranteed.”); BM Letter at 14 (suggesting in part that support should be presumed if a
foreign affiliate incorporates a “de facto guarantor’s name in its own”).

334

See AFR Letter I at 7 (“This presumption could be rebutted by showing clear evidence that
counterparties were informed of the absence of a guarantee.”); BM Letter at 14-15 (suggesting
that presumptions of support might be rebutted by explicit statements within trade documentation
accompanied by explicit counterparty waivers, and discussing the potential additional use of
associated public filing requirements and of possible “ring-fence” systems for determining which
affiliates should be considered U.S persons).

See SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at A-17.

127

(b) Final Rule
Under the final rule, a non-U.S. person (other than a conduit affiliate, as discussed above)
must count, against the de minimis thresholds, any security-based swap transaction connected
with its dealing activity for which, in connection with that particular security-based swap, the
counterparty to the security-based swap has rights of recourse against a U.S. person that is
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the non-U.S. person. 336 For these
purposes, the counterparty would be deemed to have a right of recourse against a U.S. affiliate of
the non-U.S. person if the counterparty has a conditional or unconditional legally enforceable
right, in whole or in part, to receive payments from, or otherwise collect from, the U.S. affiliate
in connection with the non-U.S. person’s obligations under the security-based swap.
We understand that such rights may arise in a variety of contexts. For example, a
counterparty would have such a right of recourse against the U.S. person if the applicable
arrangement provides the counterparty the legally enforceable right to demand payment from the
U.S. person in connection with the security-based swap, without conditioning that right upon the
non-U.S. person’s non-performance or requiring that the counterparty first make a demand on
the non-U.S. person. A counterparty also would have such a right of recourse if the counterparty
itself could exercise legally enforceable rights of collection against the U.S. person in connection
with the security-based swap, even when such rights are conditioned upon the non-U.S. person’s
insolvency or failure to meet its obligations under the security-based swap, and/or are

336

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(B). Consistent with the rule generally requiring a person
to consider its affiliates’ dealing activities for purposes of the de minimis exception (Exchange
Act rule 3a71-2(a)(1)), the Commission interprets control to mean the possession, direct or
indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person,
whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. See Intermediary
Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30631 n.437.

128

conditioned upon the counterparty first being required to take legal action against the non-U.S.
person to enforce its rights of collection.
The terms of the guarantee need not necessarily be included within the security-based
swap documentation or even otherwise reduced to writing (so long as legally enforceable rights
are created under the laws of the relevant jurisdiction); for instance, such rights of recourse
would arise when the counterparty, as a matter of law in the relevant jurisdiction, would have
rights to payment and/or collection that may arise in connection with the non-U.S. person’s
obligations under the security-based swap that are enforceable. 337 We would view the
transactions of a non-U.S. person as subject to a recourse guarantee if at least one U.S. person
(either individually or jointly and severally with others) bears unlimited responsibility for the
non-U.S. person’s obligations, including the non-U.S. person’s obligations to security-based
swap counterparties. Such arrangements may include those associated with foreign unlimited
companies or unlimited liability companies with at least one U.S.-person member or shareholder,
general partnerships with at least one U.S.-person general partner, or entities formed under
similar arrangements such that at least one U.S. persons bears unlimited responsibility for the
non-U.S. person’s liabilities. In our view, the nature of the legal arrangement between the U.S.
person and the non-U.S. person – which makes the U.S. person responsible for the obligations of
the non-U.S. person – is appropriately characterized as a recourse guarantee, absent
countervailing factors. More generally, a recourse guarantee is present if, in connection with the

337

For purposes of the dealer de minimis exception, rights of recourse would not be present if legally
enforceable rights were to arise by operation of law following the transaction, such as due to later
actions that evidence the disregard of corporate form by a party to the transaction and its affiliate.
Rights of recourse, in contrast, would encompass rights existing at the time of the transaction but
conditioned upon the non-U.S. person’s insolvency or failure to meet its obligations under the
security-based swap or conditioned upon the counterparty first being required to take legal action
against the non-U.S. person to enforce its right of collection.

129

security-based swap, the counterparty itself has a legally enforceable right to payment or
collection from the U.S. person, regardless of the form of the arrangement that provides such a
legally enforceable right to payment or collection.
Accordingly, the final rule clarifies that for these purposes a counterparty would have
rights of recourse against the U.S. person “if the counterparty has a conditional or unconditional
legally enforceable right, in whole or in part, to receive payments from, or otherwise collect
from, the U.S. person in connection with the security-based swap.” 338
In revising the proposal, we have been influenced by commenter concerns that the
proposed approach could allow non-U.S. persons to conduct a dealing business involving
security-based swaps that are guaranteed by a U.S. affiliate without being regulated as a dealer,
even though the guarantee exposes the U.S. person guarantor to risk in connection with the
dealing activity. 339
This final rule also reflects our conclusion that a non-U.S. person – to the extent it
engages in dealing activity involving security-based swaps subject to a recourse guarantee by its
U.S. affiliate – engages in dealing activity that occurs, at least in part, within the United States.
338

339

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(B). This approach of looking to the presence of rights of
recourse to identify guarantees is consistent with our prior views in connection with Title VII
implementation. See generally Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30689
(stating that in connection with the application of the major participant definition, “positions in
general would be attributed to a parent, other affiliate or guarantor for purposes of the major
participant analysis to the extent that the counterparties to those positions would have recourse to
that other entity in connection with the position”); Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at
30977 (noting that a guarantee would typically give the counterparties to a U.S. non-bank dealer
direct recourse to a holding company, as though the guarantor had entered into the transactions
directly).
See BM Letter at 12, 17-18 (stating that the “proposed exemption has the potential to create a
large loophole for foreign market participants, while leaving the risk with the American
taxpayer,” also stating that “de facto guaranteed affiliates” should be classified as U.S. persons
“under the SEC’s territorial or anti-evasion authority”); AFR Letter I at 5 (suggesting that the
proposed treatment of U.S.-guaranteed affiliates, as well as certain other aspects of the proposal,
could result in regulatory arbitrage).

130

As discussed above, the economic reality is that by virtue of the guarantee the non-U.S. person
effectively acts together with its U.S. affiliate to engage in the dealing activity that results in the
transactions, and the non-U.S. person’s dealing activity cannot reasonably be isolated from the
U.S. person’s activity in providing the guarantee. The U.S. person guarantor together with the
non-U.S. person whose dealing activity it guarantees jointly may seek to profit by providing
liquidity and otherwise engaging in dealing activity in security-based swaps, and it is the U.S.
guarantor’s financial resources that enable the guarantor to help its affiliate provide liquidity and
otherwise engage in dealing activity. It is reasonable to assume that the counterparties of the
non-U.S. person whose dealing activity is guaranteed look to both the non-U.S. person and the
U.S. guarantor for performance on the security-based swap. Moreover, the U.S. guarantor bears
risks arising from any security-based swap between the non-U.S. person whose dealing activity it
guarantees and that affiliate’s counterparties, wherever located.
This approach is consistent with the purposes of Title VII. The exposure of the U.S.
guarantor creates risk to U.S. persons and potentially to the U.S. financial system via the
guarantor to a comparable degree as if that U.S. person had directly entered into the transactions
that constituted dealing activity by the affiliate. In many cases the counterparty to the non-U.S.
person whose dealing activity is guaranteed may not enter into the transaction with that non-U.S.
person, or may not do so on the same terms, absent the guarantee. The U.S. guarantor usually
undertakes obligations with respect to the security-based swap regardless of whether that nonU.S. person ultimately defaults in connection with the security-based swap. 340
340

We understand that, in practice, a guarantor’s obligation to a derivatives counterparty of a person
whose security-based swap activity is guaranteed may be based on the same terms as that of the
guaranteed person, and that the guarantor’s obligation to make payments under the contract may
not be contingent upon the guaranteed person’s default. Moreover, we understand that margin
payments under a contract at times may be made directly by a U.S. guarantor to the counterparty

131

In requiring non-U.S. persons whose dealing involves security-based swaps that are
guaranteed by a U.S. person to apply those dealing transactions against the de minimis
thresholds, the final rule further reflects the fact that the economic reality of an offshore dealing
business using such non-U.S. persons may be similar or identical to an offshore dealing business
carried out through a foreign branch. In both cases the risk of the dealing activity has directly
been placed into the United States, and non-U.S. counterparties generally may be expected to
look to a U.S. person’s creditworthiness in deciding whether to enter into the transaction with the
guarantor’s non-U.S. affiliate or the foreign branch (and on what terms). The final rule thus
should help apply dealer regulation in similar ways to differing organizational structures that
serve similar economic purposes, and help avoid disparities in applying dealer regulation to
differing arrangements that pose similar risks to the United States. 341
We believe, moreover, that this final rule is necessary or appropriate as a prophylactic
measure to help prevent the evasion of the provisions of the Exchange Act that were added by
the Dodd-Frank Act, and thus help ensure that the relevant purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act are
not undermined. Without this rule, U.S. persons may have a strong incentive to evade dealer
regulation under Title VII simply by conducting their dealing activity via a guaranteed affiliate,
while the economic reality of transactions arising from that activity – including the risks these
transactions introduce to the U.S. market – would be no different in most respects than

of the guaranteed person, particularly when the corporate group uses a consolidated back office
located within a parent guarantor, or when the derivative is denominated in U.S. dollars. We
further understand that a counterparty may, for risk management purposes, use a single credit
limit for all transactions guaranteed by a parent, regardless of which particular affiliate may be
used for booking the transaction with that counterparty.
341

For the above reasons, we conclude that this final rule is not being applied to persons who are
“transact[ing] a business in security-based swaps without the jurisdiction of the United States,”
within the meaning of Exchange Act section 30(c). See section II.B.2(a), supra.

132

transactions directly entered into by U.S. persons. In other words, for example, if a U.S. entity
engaged in security-based swap dealing wanted to either avoid registration or otherwise have its
security-based swap transactions with foreign counterparties be outside the various Title VII
requirements with respect to those transactions, it could establish an overseas affiliate and simply
extend a payment guarantee. The purpose for doing so would be to evade the requirements of
Title VII and the incentives to do so could be high, making it necessary and appropriate to
invoke our Title VII authority, because the economic reality of these transactions would be no
different in most respects, including the risks these transactions could introduce to the U.S.
market. Arrangements between a U.S. person and a non-U.S. person that, as a matter of law in
the relevant jurisdiction, make the U.S. person responsible for the non-U.S. person’s liabilities
may create similarly strong incentives to restructure business operations to avoid the application
of Title VII by providing the economic equivalent of an express guarantee through an
arrangement that under relevant law provides the non-U.S. person counterparty with direct
recourse against the U.S. person. For these reasons, we believe that it is necessary and
appropriate to adopt this rule pursuant to our anti-evasion authority under Exchange Act section
30(c). 342
Compared to the proposal, this approach also more fully accounts for differences between
the regulatory regimes applicable to security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap
participants. The definition of “major security-based swap participant” focuses on systemic risk
issues, in that it particularly targets persons that maintain “substantial positions” that are

342

Exchange Act section 30(c) particularly provides that “[n]o provision of [Title VII] . . . shall
apply to any person insofar as such person transacts a business in security-based swaps without
the jurisdiction of the United States,” unless that business is transacted in contravention of rules
prescribed to prevent evasion of Title VII.

133

“systemically important,” or that pose “substantial counterparty exposure that could have serious
adverse effects on the financial stability of the United States banking system or financial
markets.” 343 The thresholds associated with the major participant definition reflect that systemic
risk focus. 344 The dealer definition, in contrast, is activity-focused, addresses the significance of
a person’s dealing activity only via the de minimis exception, and addresses regulatory interests
apart from risk. 345 Accordingly, upon further consideration, we believe that availability of major
participant regulation does not mitigate the above considerations regarding risk and regulatory
treatment of similar business models, and those considerations are better addressed by counting
dealing activities guaranteed by U.S. affiliates against the de minimis thresholds of the non-U.S.
persons whose transactions are subject to the guarantees. 346
In adopting these provisions, we acknowledge that the final rule does not go as far as
some commenters have requested, in that it does not require a non-U.S. person to count its
dealing transactions involving security-based swaps that do not grant its counterparty a recourse
guarantee against the U.S. affiliate of that non-U.S. person, even if the U.S. affiliate is subject to
a recourse guarantee with respect to other security-based swaps of the same non-U.S. person.
The final rule also does not incorporate the suggestion from certain commenters that we should
treat U.S. entities and their affiliates as equivalent for purposes of the cross-border
343

See Exchange Act section 3(a)(67).

344

For example, for cleared security-based CDS, a person would have to write $200 billion notional
of CDS protection to meet the relevant $2 billion “potential future exposure” threshold that is
used as part of the major participant analysis. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77
FR at 30671 n.914.

345

See id. at 30629 (“The statutory requirements that apply to swap dealers and security-based swap
dealers include requirements aimed at the protection of customers and counterparties, . . . as well
as requirements aimed at helping to promote effective operations and transparency of the swap
and security-based swap markets.”; footnotes omitted).

346

This is consistent with the view of one commenter that highlighted the differences in purpose
between dealer and major participant regulation. See BM Letter.

134

implementation of Title VII. 347 The final rule further does not incorporate the suggestion that
affiliates of a U.S. person should be presumed to be recipients of de facto guarantees, which
could be rebutted via disclosure. 348
Those commenters raise important concerns regarding the possibility that, even absent
explicit financial support arrangements, U.S. entities that are affiliated with non-U.S. persons for
reputational reasons may determine that they must support their non-U.S. affiliates at times of
crisis. In those commenters’ view, such considerations impose risks upon U.S. markets even
absent explicit legal obligations. As a result, the commenters suggest that foreign affiliates of
U.S. entities should have to count all their dealing transactions against the de minimis thresholds,
or that such foreign affiliates should be deemed to be “U.S. persons” for purposes of Title VII. 349

347

See id. at 14, 17-18 (“Thus, regardless of whether an affiliate is ‘guaranteed’ by a U.S. person,
that affiliate may be effectively guaranteed, having the same connection with and posing the same
risks to the United States.”). See also AFR Letter I at 7-8.

348

See notes 333 and 334, supra and accompanying text. We note that any U.S. person that is
subject to the reporting requirements of section 13(a) or section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, 15
U.S.C. 78m(a) or 15 U.S.C. 78o(d) respectively, regardless of whether that person provides a
recourse guarantee relating to its non-U.S. affiliates’ obligations, must consider whether there are
disclosures that must be made in its periodic reports regarding any of its obligations. These
disclosures would include any known trends, events, demands, commitments and uncertainties
that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the financial condition or operating
performance of the U.S. person that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 303 of
Regulation S-K. As required by Item 303 of Regulation S-K, the disclosures are presented with
regard to the registrant (the U.S. person) and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. See Item
303 of Regulation S-K, 17 CFR 229.303, and Commission's Guidance Regarding Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Securities Act Release
No. 8350 (Dec. 19, 2003), 68 FR 75056 (Dec. 29, 2003). See also Item 305 of Regulation S-K,
17 CFR 229.305.

349

See AFR Letter I at 7 (stating that “[b]oth explicit and implicit guarantees of support from the
parent institution should be counted,” with a rebuttable presumption that a subsidiary of a U.S.
entity is guaranteed, and that “[s]hould the SEC not include guaranteed affiliates and subsidiaries
in the definition of ‘U.S. person’, at the very least SBS with such entities should count toward
entities de minimis calculation”); BM Letter at 12, 17 (stating that guaranteed affiliate should be
defined “to include those affiliates that are de factor guaranteed, even though not explicitly
subject to a guarantee agreement,” and that transactions with non-U.S. persons that receive
guarantees from U.S. persons should be included in the de minimis calculation).

135

Our modification requiring these non-U.S. persons to count certain of their dealing
transactions with non-U.S. persons against the de minimis thresholds partially addresses those
commenter concerns. 350 We also recognize that there may be circumstances in which a U.S.
person provides its foreign affiliate with non-recourse support that is not specifically linked to
particular instruments or to derivatives activities generally. Our final rule, however, targets
recourse-based arrangements whereby the counterparties to the non-U.S. affiliate would be
particularly likely to look to the U.S. person for satisfaction of some or all of the obligations
arising under the security-based swap. On balance, we believe that an approach that focuses on
the presence of recourse arrangements appropriately addresses dealing activities that have a
particularly direct effect on the U.S. market, as well as the ability of a U.S. person to use such
guarantees to conduct a security-based swap dealing business as an alternative to using a foreign
branch.
This is not to say that more general financial support arrangements do not also pose risks
to U.S. persons and potentially to the U.S. financial system, including risks posed by the activity
of non-U.S. persons to their U.S. parents or affiliates. However, we believe that this focus on
recourse guarantees appropriately addresses the most direct risks posed by such guarantee
arrangements to U.S. persons and potentially to the U.S. financial system. We also note that
Congress has provided additional regulatory tools apart from Title VII to address such risks.
Indeed, in enacting the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress provided general tools – not merely tools
focusing on derivatives activities – to address the risks associated with U.S.-based financial
350

This final rule regarding the de minimis exception does not encompass non-U.S. persons who
receive a guarantee from an unaffiliated U.S. person. We do not expect that U.S. persons would
use guarantees of unaffiliated persons as a substitute for dealing activity via a foreign branch, and
we do not believe such arrangements comprise a significant part of dealing activity in the market.
Our final rules do, however, generally require such non-affiliate arrangements to be included in
the major security-based swap participant threshold calculations. See section V.D.3, infra.

136

groups as a whole, including the risks posed by such groups’ non-guaranteed foreign affiliates
engaged in financial services business. This holistic approach to risks that could flow back to the
United States may reflect the fact that financial services activities apart from security-based
swaps constitute the great majority of such groups’ overall financial activities outside the United
States that can produce such risks. The regulatory tools substantially enhanced by the DoddFrank Act to better address these cross-border risks posed by financial services activities other
than security-based swaps and such tools include globally consolidated capital requirements
(including enhanced capital and leverage standards, group-wide single-counterparty credit limits,
and capital surcharges for firms with particularly high levels of risk), and globally consolidated
liquidity and risk management standards (including stress testing, debt-to-equity limitations,
living will requirement, and timely remediation measures). By accounting for risks at the
consolidated level, these tools address risks posed by guaranteed and non-guaranteed subsidiaries
within U.S.-based financial groups, regardless of whether the subsidiaries are based in the United
States or outside the United States. 351 Our focus on recourse guarantees appropriately targets the
351

See, e.g., Pub. L. No. 111-203, sections 165-166 of the Dodd Frank Act, 124 Stat. 1376, 1423-32
(2010). In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, in connection with our preliminary view that the
risks posed by guarantees could be adequately addressed via the regulation of major securitybased swap participants, we referenced the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, and the
provisions of Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act regarding the regulation of certain nonbank financial
companies and bank holding companies that pose a threat to the financial stability of the United
States. See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31006 n.360.
For the reasons discussed above, however, we have concluded that the presence of those
particular regulatory safeguards do not warrant the conclusion that non-U.S. guaranteed affiliates
of U.S. persons should not have to count, against the de minimis thresholds, their dealing activity
involving other non-U.S. persons when the transaction is subject to a right of recourse against the
U.S. affiliate. Although those provisions encompass regulatory safeguards that can be expected
to address the risks associated with U.S.-based financial groups, upon further consideration we
conclude that it is appropriate for the application of the de minimis test to directly account for
those specific security-based swap transactions that are subject to recourse guarantees, as opposed
to more generalized risks arising from the range of activities conducted by non-guaranteed
foreign affiliates, given the U.S. person’s participation in the security-based swap transaction
through the guarantee.

137

concerns raised by security-based swap activity that Title VII was intended to address,
recognizing that Congress has established other regulatory tools that are specifically intended,
and better suited, to address risks to bank holding companies and financial holding companies,
arising from the financial services activities of a foreign affiliate of those holding companies
where the foreign affiliate does not engage in security-based swap activity in the United States.
Conversely, one commenter implicitly appeared to oppose any requirement that non-U.S.
persons count their guaranteed transactions carried out in a dealing capacity with non-U.S.
person counterparties against their de minimis thresholds. 352 For the reasons discussed above,
however, we believe that the targeted counting required by the final rule is appropriate to reflect
activity involving security-based swaps that occurs in the United States and presents risks to U.S.
persons and potentially to the U.S. financial system.
Finally, in adopting these provisions we recognize that the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance
appears to broadly opine that non-U.S. persons who receive any express guarantee from a U.S.
affiliate should, as a general matter, count all of their dealing activity against the de minimis
thresholds, regardless of whether a counterparty has recourse against the U.S. person in
connection with the swap. 353 Our final rule is more targeted than the CFTC approach, in that our
final rule requires a non-U.S. guaranteed affiliate to count only those dealing transactions for

352

See note 335, supra, and accompanying text.

353

See CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, 78 FR at 45319. For those purposes, the CFTC Cross-Border
Guidance interprets guarantees generally to include “not only traditional guarantees of payment
or performance of the related swaps, but also other formal arrangements that, in view of all the
facts and circumstances, support the non-U.S. person’s ability to pay or perform its swap
obligations with respect to its swaps,” and also refers to “keepwells and liquidity puts, certain
types of indemnity agreements, master trust agreements, liability or loss transfer or sharing
agreements, and any other explicit financial support arrangements” as being types of guarantees
notwithstanding that that they “may provide for different third-party rights and/or address
different risks than traditional guarantees.” See id. at 45319-20.

138

which the counterparty to the security-based swap has recourse against a U.S. person that is
affiliated with the non-U.S. person. This reflects our decision to focus the application of the de
minimis exception on recourse arrangements involving security-based swaps, while recognizing
that some non-recourse arrangements could influence a U.S. person to provide financial support
to non-U.S. persons and thereby present risk to the U.S. person and potential risk to the U.S.
financial system.
2. Dealing Transactions of Non-U.S. Persons Involving U.S. and Other
Counterparties
(a) Proposed Approach and Commenters’ Views
Under the proposal, non-U.S. persons also would be required to count their dealing
transactions entered into with a U.S. person, other than a foreign branch. 354 As discussed below,
this proposed exclusion for transactions in which the counterparty is a foreign branch reflected
concerns regarding U.S. banks being limited in their access to foreign counterparties when
conducting dealing activity through their foreign branches.
The proposal solicited comment regarding whether non-U.S. persons should be required
to count, towards their de minimis thresholds, transactions with U.S. persons or with foreign
branches of U.S. banks. It also solicited comment regarding whether non-U.S. persons should be
354

See proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(ii). For those purposes, “foreign branch” was
defined to mean any branch of a U.S. bank if: the branch is located outside the United States; the
branch operates for valid business reasons; and the branch is engaged in the business of banking
and is subject to substantive banking regulation in the jurisdiction where it is located. See
proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(1). The proposal also included a definition of “transaction
conducted through a foreign branch” that encompassed transactions solicited, negotiated, or
executed through a foreign branch where the foreign branch is the counterparty to the transaction,
and the transaction was not solicited, negotiated, or executed by a person within the United
States. See proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(4).
Under the CFTC’s cross-border guidance, as a general matter non-U.S. persons may exclude their
dealing activities involving foreign branches of U.S. persons only if the U.S. person is registered
with the CFTC as a swap dealer. See CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, 78 FR at 45319.

139

required to count the dealing transactions they enter into with registered security-based swap
dealers, and regarding whether non-U.S. persons should be able to conduct dealing transactions
within the United States without registering if their transactions are with a registered securitybased swap dealer. 355
Two commenters took the position that non-U.S. persons should have to count their
transactions with foreign branches of U.S. banks against the de minimis thresholds, noting that
those foreign branches themselves fall within the “U.S. person” definition, 356 and stating that
excluding those transactions would serve as a loophole from regulation. 357 In contrast, one
commenter stated that such transactions should be excluded from the de minimis analysis even if
U.S. personnel are involved in soliciting, negotiating, executing or booking the transaction. 358
Commenters also addressed the application of the exception to non-U.S. persons’ dealing
activities involving counterparties that are guaranteed affiliates of non-U.S. persons. The
proposal did not require such transactions to be counted. One commenter expressed support for
the fact that our proposal, unlike the CFTC’s guidance, did not require non-U.S. persons to count

355

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 30995.

356

See AFR Letter I at 6 (supporting the premise that offices and branches of U.S. persons are “an
integral part of the U.S. person” but arguing that it is inconsistent to treat such foreign branches
different from their U.S. parent institutions); BM Letter at 18 (noting that the foreign branch of a
U.S. person should be treated no differently than the U.S. person).

357

See AFR Letter I at 6-7 (“With these incentives [related to transactions with foreign branches,
offices and guaranteed subsidiaries and affiliates of U.S. persons], it is unlikely that any foreign
entities will choose to trade within the United States directly, and quite likely that U.S. financial
institutions will simply advise their clients to trade with their foreign branches if they want to
avoid Dodd-Frank”); BM Letter at 3, 18-19 (“This exception is no more than a loophole based
upon a scare tactic, which will cause U.S. firms to operate their SBS business through offshore
branches.”).

358

See SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at A-15 to A-16 (supporting the proposed approach and urging the
Commission to extend the exclusion to transactions between non-U.S. persons and foreign
branches even if they are conducted within the United States).

140

certain transactions with non-U.S. counterparties that are guaranteed by U.S. persons. 359 On the
other hand, one commenter stated that non-U.S. persons should count against the thresholds
security-based swaps entered into with guaranteed affiliates and subsidiaries of U.S. persons if
those affiliates and subsidiaries are not included within the “U.S. person” definition. 360 Also, as
noted above, that commenter and one other commenter generally suggested that the presence of
explicit or implicit guarantees of foreign affiliates should trigger application of the Exchange
Act. 361
(b) Final Rule
The final rule has been modified from the proposal to require non-U.S. persons (other
than conduit affiliates 362) to count, against the de minimis thresholds, their dealing transactions
with U.S. persons other than certain transactions with the foreign branches of registered securitybased swap dealers. 363 The proposal would have excluded all of the non-U.S. person’s
transactions with a foreign branch (other than “transactions conducted within the United States”)
regardless of the branch’s registration status.
359

See SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at A-17. Under the CFTC’s guidance, non-U.S. persons would
generally count certain dealing transactions involving counterparties that are guaranteed affiliates
of U.S. persons, subject to exceptions. See CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, 78 FR at 45319.

360

See AFR Letter I at 7-8 and note 28 (stating that the proposal “incentivizes U.S. institutions to
execute SBS indirectly by using foreign affiliates, subsidiaries, branches and offices,” and thus
lead U.S. institutions to incur risks “by trading with foreign entities without the full regulatory
protections of Dodd-Frank”; also acknowledging that U.S. guarantors would count those trades
for determining whether the guarantor is a major participant, but adding that major participants
are subject to fewer requirements than dealers “so this is not a satisfactory method for addressing
the risks presented by U.S. parent institutions guaranteeing the swaps of foreign subsidiaries and
affiliates”).

361

See note 333, supra.

362

The separate counting requirements applicable to conduit affiliates are addressed above. See
section IV.D, supra.

363

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(A). “Foreign branch” is defined in Exchange Act rule
3a71-3(a)(2).

141

The requirement that such non-U.S. persons must count their dealing transactions with
U.S. persons against the de minimis thresholds reflects the fact that dealing activity involving
counterparties who are U.S. persons necessarily involves the performance, at least in part, of
dealing activity within the United States. As discussed above, a non-U.S. person engaged in
dealing activity with U.S. persons in an amount sufficient to implicate the de minimis thresholds
reasonably can be concluded to constitute dealing activity within the United States by virtue of
indicating that the non-U.S. person is commonly known in the trade as a security-based swap
dealer within the United States, and that the non-U.S. person is regularly entering into securitybased swaps as an ordinary course of business within the United States. 364 Similarly, that nonU.S. person seeks to profit by, among other things, providing liquidity within the United States
and engaging in market making in security-based swaps within the United States, and its
364

See section II.B.2(b)iii, supra. We also note that the Commission’s traditional approach toward
the registration of securities brokers and dealers under the Exchange Act generally requires
registration of foreign brokers or dealers that, from outside the United States, induce or attempt to
induce securities transactions by persons within the United States. See Cross-Border Proposing
Release, 78 FR at 30990 n.213 and accompanying text.
In this regard we recognize that Exchange Act rule 15a-6, which provides an exemption for the
activities of certain foreign broker-dealers, includes an exemption for transactions in securities
with or for persons “that have not been solicited by the foreign broker or dealer.” Exchange Act
rule 15a-6(a)(1). In adopting this provision, the Commission stated that it “does not believe, as a
policy matter, that registration is necessary if U.S. investors have sought out foreign brokerdealers outside the United States and initiated transactions in foreign securities markets entirely
of their own accord.” See 54 FR 30013, 30017 (Jul. 18, 1989). The Commission further stated
that a narrow construction of “solicitation” would be inconsistent with the Exchange Act. See id.
at 30018. We do not believe that a similar unsolicited exception – which reflects a policy
decision rather than a matter of statutory scope – would be appropriate in this context, particularly
given that situations in which non-U.S. persons engage in dealing activity with U.S. persons in an
amount that is significant enough to implicate the de minimis thresholds would not appear
consistent with a policy allowing non-U.S. persons to accommodate transactions which U.S.
persons initiate “entirely of their own accord.” Moreover, we note that the definition of
“security-based swap dealer” includes persons that hold themselves out as security-based swap
dealers or that are commonly known in the trade as security-based swap dealers. See Exchange
Act section 3(a)(71)(A). Such persons may not actively solicit transactions from particular
customers, and nothing in the statutory definition suggests that active solicitation on the part of
such persons is required for them to fall within the definition of “security-based swap dealer.”

142

decision to engage in dealing activity with U.S. persons affects the liquidity of the security-based
swap market within the United States. U.S. persons incur risks arising from this dealing activity,
which in turn potentially creates risk to the U.S. financial system more generally. Transactions
with U.S. persons further raise market transparency and counterparty protection concerns that
Title VII is intended to address. Accordingly, the dealing activity of such a non-U.S. person is
best characterized as occurring, at least in part, within the United States to the extent that the
dealing activity involves a U.S. person. 365 No commenters to the Cross-Border Proposing
Release expressed opposition to generally requiring non-U.S. persons to count their dealing
transactions with U.S. persons (other than comments regarding transactions with foreign
branches, as discussed below).
The final rule permits such non-U.S. persons not to count certain dealing transactions
conducted through a foreign branch of a counterparty that is a U.S. bank as part of the de
minimis analysis. For this exclusion to be effective, persons located within the United States
cannot be involved in arranging, negotiating, or executing the transaction. Moreover – and in
contrast to the proposal – the counterparty bank must be registered as a security-based swap
dealer, 366 unless the transaction occurs prior to 60 days following the effective date of final rules
365

For the above reasons, we conclude that this final rule is not being applied to persons who are
“transact[ing] a business in security-based swaps without the jurisdiction of the United States,”
within the meaning of Exchange Act section 30(c). See section II.B.2(b)iii, supra. We also
believe, moreover, that this final rule is necessary or appropriate as a prophylactic measure to
help prevent the evasion of the provisions of the Exchange Act that were added by the DoddFrank Act, and thus help ensure that the relevant purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act are not
undermined. Without this rule, market participants could engage in dealing activity with persons
within the U.S. market, causing the U.S. person counterparties to incur associated risks simply by
using non-U.S. persons to engage in those transactions with U.S. counterparties.

366

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(A)(1).
As addressed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the ability of U.S. banks to conduct
security-based swap activity potentially will be limited by section 716 of the Dodd-Frank Act,
which in part prohibits certain federal assistance to security-based swap dealers, and by section

143

providing for the registration of security-based swap dealers. 367 Registration of the counterparty
U.S. bank would not be required for the exclusion to be effective before then, given that the nonU.S. person would not be able to know with certainty whether the U.S. bank in the future would
register with the Commission as a security-based swap dealer. 368
As we noted in the proposal, although a foreign branch is part of a “U.S. person,” and
dealing transactions with foreign branches pose risk to the U.S. financial system, requiring nonU.S. persons to count transactions with foreign branches “could limit access of U.S. banks to
non-U.S. counterparties when they conduct their foreign security-based swap dealing activity
through foreign branches because non-U.S. persons may not be willing to enter into transactions
with them in order to avoid being required to register as a security-based swap dealer.” 369 We
continue to believe that generally permitting a non-U.S. person not to count those types of
transactions that do not involve U.S. personnel against the thresholds thus should help avoid the
disparate treatment of foreign branches that engage in security-based swap dealing activity and
that seek to access offshore dealing services, compared to other persons that engage in securitybased swap dealing activities outside the U.S.
619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which in part prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary
trading. See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31002 n.326. The prohibitions of section
619 do not extend to certain market making activities. See Dodd-Frank Act section 619(d)(1)(B).
In December of 2013, the Commission, together with the Office of the Comptroller of Currency,
the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the CFTC, issued
final rules implementing section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act. See 79 FR 5536 (Jan. 31, 2014). In
addition, based on our understanding of changes in the way major U.S. dealers engage with nonU.S. counterparties in the single-name CDS market following the issuance of the CFTC CrossBorder Guidance, we believe that few, if any, U.S. persons currently may participate in the
single-name CDS market through their foreign branches.
367

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(A)(2).

368

In other words, this provision will help to avoid requiring non-U.S. persons to speculate whether
their counterparties would register, and to face the consequences of their speculation being
wrong.

The final rule differs from the proposal in that the final rule permits a non-U.S. person
not to count its transactions with a foreign branch of a U.S. person against the de minimis
thresholds only when the foreign branch is part of a registered security-based swap dealer (or for
a temporary period of time prior to 60 days prior to the effectiveness of the dealer registration
requirements), rather than transactions with any foreign branch. This tailoring of the proposal
seeks to balance the above concerns that the proposed approach would result in disparate
treatment of foreign branches and U.S. persons having inadequate access to liquidity located
outside the United States, against the purposes of dealer regulation under Title VII. This
consideration of competing interests results in an approach that will help to focus the application
of the de minimis exception in such a way as to ensure that a registered security-based swap
dealer is involved in the transaction, and thus that relevant Title VII provisions applicable to
dealers (such as margin requirements) will apply to the transaction. 370 This manner of focusing
the exclusion also is consistent with the approach taken by the CFTC in its cross-border
guidance. 371
In adopting an exclusion for certain transactions with foreign branches, we recognize that
some commenters opposed having any such exclusion for a non-U.S. person’s transactions with
a foreign branch, stating that the breadth of the proposed exclusion would facilitate the
avoidance of the Dodd-Frank Act even while U.S. entities incur the risks of transactions with

370

We note that the mere involvement of a registered dealer in a transaction by itself would not
implicate the above concerns regarding disparate treatment and liquidity that balance against the
purposes of dealer regulation when it is not acting through a foreign branch, and thus by itself
would not be sufficient to justify a more general exception to these counting principles (e.g., an
exception for a non-U.S. person’s dealing transactions involving any U.S. person that is
registered as a security-based swap dealer).

371

See CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, 78 FR at 45319.

145

foreign entities, and that the exclusion would be based on a “scare tactic.” 372 We nonetheless
believe that this approach is justified by concerns about disparate treatment, along with
associated liquidity concerns. 373 We also note that the modification of the proposal – such that
transactions with foreign branches are excluded only if the foreign branch is part of a registered
dealer – should help address concerns that the exclusion would promote evasion of the dealer
requirements. 374 Also, as discussed below, a transaction would not constitute a “transaction
conducted through a foreign branch” if personnel located in the United States were responsible
for arranging, negotiating or executing the transaction.
We also recognize that commenters took the view that such an exclusion is inconsistent
with the fact that foreign branches fall within the “U.S. person” definition. 375 In our view, the
exclusion does not disregard the U.S.-person status of foreign branches. Instead, as discussed
above, we believe that this exclusion is appropriate to address market concerns regarding
disparate treatment of the dealing activity of foreign branches, notwithstanding that U.S.-person
status.

372

See note 357, supra.

373

In this regard we recognize that dealing activity involving foreign branches of U.S. banks does
pose risks to the U.S. bank of which the foreign branch is a part and potentially to the U.S.
financial system. Such risks are mitigated in part, however, in that foreign branches of banks that
are registered security-based swap dealers will be subject to a number of Title VII regulatory
requirements, including capital and margin requirements, that are designed to protect the system
against those risks. Furthermore, this limitation is designed to help preserve liquidity throughout
the system, given that absent the exclusion non-U.S. dealers may have reasons to favor non-U.S.
counterparties to avoid the regulatory requirements of Title VII, which could threaten to fragment
liquidity across geographical or jurisdictional lines.

374

This modification – in conjunction with the fact that dealing transactions conducted through the
foreign branch of a U.S. bank will have to be counted against the bank’s de minimis thresholds
regardless of counterparty (as was proposed) – will limit the possibility that U.S. banks could
engage in a significant amount of security-based swap business through their foreign branches
without either the banks or their non-U.S. counterparties being subject to dealer regulation.

375

See note 356, supra.

146

We also have considered the view of one commenter that all of a non-U.S. person’s
transactions with foreign branches should be excluded from the analysis, even if U.S. personnel
are involved in soliciting, negotiating, executing or booking the transaction. 376 As discussed
elsewhere, we conclude that a non-U.S. person’s dealing transactions within the United States
should be counted against the thresholds. 377 More generally, for the reasons addressed above we
conclude that the proposed exclusion related to a non-U.S. person’s transactions with a foreign
branch should be narrowed – not widened.
The final rule retains the proposed definition of “foreign branch,” which encompasses
any branch of a U.S. bank that is located outside the United States, operates for valid business
reasons, and is engaged in the business of banking and is subject to substantive banking
regulation in the jurisdiction where it is located. 378 As discussed in the Cross-Border Proposing
Release, we believe these factors appropriately focus on the location of the branch, the nature of
its business and its regulation in a foreign jurisdiction. 379
The final rule modifies the proposed definition of “transaction conducted through a
foreign branch” to provide that the definition addresses transactions that are arranged, negotiated,
and executed by a U.S. person through a foreign branch if both: (a) the foreign branch is the

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(2).

379

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31002. No commenters specifically addressed the
proposed definition of “foreign branch.”
We are adopting this definition as proposed while recognizing that it differs from the CFTC’s
interpretation of “foreign branch” in its cross-border guidance. See CFTC Cross-Border
Guidance, 78 FR at 45329 (interpreting “foreign branch” in part by reference to designation by
banking regulators, and by reference to the accounting of profits and losses). However, we
believe that any foreign branch of a U.S. bank that would generally be considered a foreign
branch under the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance also likely would be a foreign branch under our
final rule.

147

counterparty to the transaction; and (b) the security-based swap transaction is arranged,
negotiated, and executed on behalf of the foreign branch solely by persons located outside the
United States. 380 We believe that this definition identifies the functions associated with foreign
branch activity in a manner that appropriately focuses the exclusion for non-U.S. person’s
transactions toward situations in which the branch performs the core dealing functions outside
the United States. 381
Similar to the proposal, the final definition of “transaction conducted through a foreign
branch” also states that a person need not consider its counterparty’s activities in connection with
the transaction – i.e., where its counterparty’s personnel arranged, negotiated and executed the
transaction – if the person received a representation from the counterparty that the transaction is
arranged, negotiated, and executed on behalf of the branch solely by persons located outside the
United States, unless the person knows or has reason to know that the representation is not
accurate. For these purposes a person would have reason to know the representation is not
accurate if a reasonable person should know, under all of the facts of which the person is aware,
380

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(3)(i). No commenters specifically addressed the proposed
definition.

381

The proposed definition would have addressed transactions that are “solicited, negotiated, or
executed” by persons outside the United States. The final rule refers to “arranged” in lieu of
“solicited” to reflect the fact that a person may engage in dealing activity not only through
transactions that the person actively solicits, but also through transactions that result from
counterparties reaching out to the person. See generally Exchange Act section 3(a)(71)(A)(i)
(defining “security-based swap dealer” in part to encompass any person who “holds themselves
out as a dealer in security-based swaps”).
Under the proposed rule, “transaction conducted through a foreign branch” was defined, in part,
to exclude any transaction solicited, negotiated, or executed by a person within the United States
on behalf of the foreign branch. See proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(i)(B). Under the
final rule, this element of the definition is set forth in the affirmative and provides that the
transaction must be arranged, negotiated, and executed on behalf of the foreign branch solely by
persons located outside the United States. See Exchange Act Rule 3a71-3(a)(3)(i)(B). Consistent
with the proposed rule, the final definition requires all relevant activity to be performed outside
the United States for a transaction to fall within the definition of “transaction conducted through a
foreign branch.”

148

that it is not accurate. 382 This is intended to help address operational difficulties that a non-U.S.
person otherwise could face in investigating the activities of its counterparty to ensure
compliance with the rule.
Separately, the final rule, consistent with the proposal, does not require such non-U.S.
persons to count, against the de minimis thresholds, their dealing transactions with non-U.S.
persons whose security-based swap transactions are guaranteed by a U.S. person. We recognize
the significance of commenter concerns regarding the risk posed to the United States by such
security-based swaps, and regarding the potential use of such guaranteed affiliates to evade the
Dodd-Frank Act. 383 We nonetheless believe that such concerns are adequately addressed by the
requirement that guaranteed affiliates count their own dealing activity against the de minimis
thresholds when the counterparty has recourse to a U.S. person. Although there can remain
residual risk to U.S. markets associated with the security-based swaps involving such non-U.S.
guaranteed affiliates, we do not believe that such risk is significant enough to warrant a
requirement that non-U.S. persons count all of their dealing activity involving such non-U.S.
382

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(3)(ii). This representation provision within the final definition
also contains certain clarifying changes from the proposal, in part to reflect the reference to
“arranged” in lieu of “solicited.” See note 364, supra. The final rule has been modified from the
proposal to reflect the change in the definition of “transaction conducted through a foreign
branch” described above. See note 382, supra. Also, consistent with the analogous
representation provisions of the “U.S. person” definition, the final rule also changes the proposal
to reflect that the non-U.S. person may not rely on the representation if it knows that the
representation is not accurate, or has reason to know that the representation is not accurate; for
these purposes a person would have reason to know the representation is not accurate if a
reasonable person should know, under all of the facts of which the person is aware, that it is not
accurate. This “know or have reason to know” standard should help ensure that potential
security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants do not disregard facts
that may call into question the validity of the representation. See note 302, supra, and
accompanying text. In addition, applying a single standard of reliance to all representations
regarding the status of a person or transaction for purposes of the final rule will reduce the
potential complexity of establishing policies and procedures associated with reliance on such
representations. See section IV.C.4, supra.

383

See note 360, supra.

149

guaranteed affiliates against their own de minimis thresholds. In this regard we note that such a
requirement would necessitate certain non-U.S. persons to incur compliance costs associated
with assessing whether their counterparties are guaranteed affiliates. 384 For similar reasons, the
final rule does not require such non-U.S. persons to count, against the thresholds, their dealing
transactions involving non-U.S. persons that are conduit affiliates.
F. Application of the Exception’s Aggregation Principles to Cross-Border Dealing
Activity
1. Proposed Approach and Commenters’ Views
The Cross-Border Proposing Release also addressed the cross-border implementation of a
previously adopted rule requiring a person to count dealing transactions by its affiliates against
its own de minimis thresholds. 385 Under the proposal, a person engaged in dealing activity
would have had to count: (i) dealing transactions by its U.S. affiliates, including transactions
conducted through a foreign branch; and (ii) all dealing transactions of its non-U.S. affiliates
where the counterparty is a U.S. person other than a foreign branch, or where the transaction is
conducted within the United States. 386
In the Cross-Border Proposing Release we took the view that the approach would be
consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act’s statutory focus on the U.S. security-based swap market, in

384

In taking this position we also recognize that the CFTC takes a different approach in its crossborder guidance, which generally considers it appropriate for such non-U.S. persons to count their
dealing transactions with guaranteed affiliate counterparties, subject to certain exceptions. See
CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, 78 FR at 45319, 45324 (stating there generally is no need for nonU.S. persons to count such dealing transactions with a counterparty that is a registered dealer, an
affiliate of a registered dealer whose own dealing activities are below the relevant de minimis
thresholds, or is guaranteed by a U.S. person that is not a financial entity).

385

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-2 (requiring that a person count against the thresholds its dealing
activity plus that of “any other entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
the person”).

386

See proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b)(2).

150

that the dealing of a person’s U.S. affiliates would impact the U.S. financial system regardless of
the location of the affiliate’s counterparty, but that the dealing of a person’s non-U.S. affiliates
with other non-U.S. persons outside the United States would not impact the U.S. financial system
to the same extent. We also took the view that the aggregation approach would minimize the
opportunity for a person to evasively engage in large amounts of dealing activity, and that the
approach would be in accordance with other aspects of the proposal governing which
transactions would be applied against the thresholds. 387
The proposal separately would have permitted a person not to include, as part of the de
minimis analysis, transactions by an affiliate that is registered as a security-based swap dealer, so
long as the person’s dealing activity is “operationally independent” of the dealer’s activity. 388
For these purposes, the person and its registered dealer affiliate would be considered to be
“operationally independent” if the two entities maintained separate sales and trading functions,
operations (including separate back offices) and risk management. 389
This aspect of the proposal recognized that any person affiliated with a registered dealer
otherwise would have to count the registered affiliate’s dealing activity against the person’s own
de minimis thresholds, which likely would require the person to register as a dealer if it engages
in any dealing activity. We stated in the Cross-Border Proposing Release that, in our preliminary
view, this outcome of preventing all affiliates of a dealer from taking advantage of the de
minimis exception would not be consistent with the statutory purpose of the exception. We
noted, moreover, that this scenario would not appear to raise the anti-evasion concerns at the

151

core of the aggregation provisions, given that it would apply only where a corporate group
already included a registered dealer subject to Commission oversight. 390
A number of commenters opposed the operational independence condition to the
proposed exclusion, arguing that it would hinder operational efficiency – including the use of
group-wide risk management – without any countervailing benefit, 391 and that the requirement
was vague and would impede the growth of different business models. 392 Commenters also
pointed out that, in the parallel discussion in the CFTC’s cross-border guidance, the CFTC did
not interpret its cross-border statute as requiring operational independence. 393 One of these
commenters further opposed the use of any aggregation requirement in connection with the de
minimis exception. 394 One commenter expressed particular concerns regarding the application
of aggregation principles in connection with joint venture arrangements involving dealer

390

See id.

391

See SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at A-13 to A-15 (stating that the operational independence condition
is overbroad and unnecessary to achieve the statutory goals in that it “would have the effect of
tying registration requirements to firms’ internal risk management strategies or limited efficient
leverage of back office functions” without any regulatory benefit and noting that the requirement
would be burdensome for smaller market participants who would need to register solely due to
their affiliation with larger entities); IIB Letter at 14-15 (stating that preventing the sharing of
group-wide risk management and other resources would have the effect of nullifying the
exclusion from the aggregation requirement for affiliates that are registered security-based swap
dealers); JSDA Letter at 4-5 (stating that the “operationally independent” condition would
discourage efficient global management of transactions).

aggregation requirement been proposed as part of the underlying definitional rules SIFMA would

shareholders. 395 One commenter supported the proposed approach as an anti-evasion
safeguard. 396 One commenter suggested we eliminate the “operationally independent”
requirement but, to prevent evasion of the dealer requirements, prohibit a registered dealer from
using an unregistered affiliate as a booking vehicle. 397
2. Final Rule
The final rule governing aggregation, like the proposal, generally applies the principles
that govern the counting of a person’s own dealing activity to also determine how the person
must count its affiliates’ dealing activities for purposes of the de minimis exception.
Accordingly, the rule has been modified from the proposal to be consistent with changes to the
proposed provisions regarding the counting of a person’s dealing activity.
Moreover, the final rule modifies the exclusion from having to aggregate the dealing
transactions of a person’s registered dealer affiliate from the proposal, both to remove the
operational independence condition and to address situations in which a person’s affiliate has
exceeded the de minimis thresholds but is in the process of registering as a dealer.
(a) General Provisions Regarding Aggregation of Cross-Border Transactions
The final rule, like the proposal, provides in part that if a person engages in dealing
transactions counted against the de minimis thresholds, the person also must count all dealing
transactions in which any U.S. person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with

395

See JSDA Letter at 5 (requesting that aggregation not be required of the minority shareholder of a
joint venture); see also MUFJ Letter at 2-8 (generally opposing aggregation for such joint venture
arrangements).

153

the person engages, including transactions conducted through a foreign branch. 398 The final rule
has been revised from the proposal to further provide that the person should count all dealing
transactions of its conduit affiliates. 399 Finally, the final rule has been modified from the
proposal to provide that the person must count all dealing transactions of non-U.S. person
affiliates that: (a) are entered into with U.S. persons other than the foreign branches of registered
dealers; or (b) constitute dealing activity subject to a guarantee giving the non-U.S. person’s
counterparty rights of recourse against a U.S. person affiliated with the non-U.S. person. 400
These modifications from the proposal are consistent with similar modifications made to
the rules regarding the counting of a person’s own transactions for purposes of the de minimis
exception, and reflect the risk concerns and interests discussed above. The aggregation
requirement serves to prevent evasion of the dealer registration requirements by persons that
otherwise may seek to avoid dealer registration by simply dividing up dealing activity in excess
of the de minimis thresholds among multiple affiliates. 401 In keeping with that purpose, in the
cross-border context it is appropriate to require a person’s affiliates to count the same dealing
transactions that the person itself would be required to count for purposes of the de minimis
398

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b)(2)(i). Consistent with our position in the Intermediary
Definitions Adopting Release (see 77 FR at 30631 n.437) and in the Cross-Border Proposing
Release (see 78 FR at 31004), and with our position regarding the de minimis exception when
there is a right of recourse against a U.S. person (see note 336, supra) for purposes of determining
whether a person is controlling, controlled by, or under common control with another person (i.e.,
an affiliate), we interpret control to mean the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the
direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting
securities, by contract or otherwise.

399

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b)(2)(ii).

400

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b)(2)(iii) (cross-referencing the direct counting provisions of
paragraph (b)(1)(iii), applicable to non-U.S. persons other than conduit affiliates); see also
Sections IV.E, supra (addressing counting by non-U.S. persons engaged in dealing activity whose
counterparties are U.S. persons); and IV.E.1 (addressing counting by non-U.S. persons engaged
in dealing activity when their counterparties have recourse against a U.S. person).

401

154

exception – unless, as discussed below, the person is registered as a dealer. 402 Because this
approach incorporates the direct counting standards discussed above, we believe that the
approach implements the de minimis exception in a manner that is consistent with the DoddFrank Act’s focus on the U.S. security-based swap market. 403
(b) Application to Dealing Activities of Registered Affiliates
In addition, we are adopting an exception which provides that a person need not count
against the de minimis thresholds the security-based swap transactions of an affiliate that either
is: (1) registered with the Commission as a dealer; or (2) deemed not to be a dealer pursuant to

402

As noted above, one commenter questioned whether any aggregation principles should be applied
in the de minimis context, arguing that the requirement disregards the legal independence of
entities and disregards the possibility that two entities under common control may operate
independently of each other. The comment further stated that the Commission’s existing antievasion capacities are sufficient to guard against abuse without requiring aggregation. See note
391, supra. In our view, however, the aggregation provision is tailored appropriately to prevent
evasion of the limits of the de minimis exception. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting
Release, 77 FR at 30631 (discussing the use of the aggregation principles in light of the
“increased notional thresholds of the final [definitional] rules, and the resulting opportunity for a
person to evasively engage in large amounts of dealing activity if it can multiply those
thresholds”; and addressing the use of the common control standard “as a means reasonably
designed to prevent evasion of the limitations of that exception”). We further believe that this
aggregation approach would be more effective at implementing the de minimis exception than a
case-by-case approach, because the aggregation provision would provide upfront objective
standards regarding which affiliate transactions must be counted against the thresholds, and thus
help avoid uncertainty. Moreover, as discussed below, we are revising the aggregation provisions
to allow the exclusion of the positions of affiliates that are registered as dealers (or that are in the
process of registering), in response to comments.

403

In short, we believe that this final rule is necessary or appropriate as a prophylactic measure to
help prevent the evasion of the provisions of the Exchange Act that were added by the DoddFrank Act, and thus help ensure that the relevant purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act are not
undermined. Without this rule, corporate groups may engage in dealing activity above the de
minimis thresholds within the United States while avoiding dealer regulation under Title VII by
dividing up the dealing activity among multiple affiliated entities, none of which individually
engages in dealing activity above the thresholds.

155

the provisions of Exchange Act rule 3a71-2(b), which addresses persons who have exceeded the
de minimis thresholds but are in the process of registering. 404
In part, this final rule has been modified from the proposal by removing the proposed
operational independence condition. After considering the views of several commenters that the
proposed operational independence condition would tend to inhibit operational efficiencies, 405
we are persuaded that excluding the condition from the final rule would help facilitate efficiency
and avoid deterring beneficial group-wide risk management practices. In this regard we also
note that even with the removal of the proposed operational independence condition, the
aggregation provisions would prevent a corporate group from cumulatively engaging in
aggregate relevant dealing activity – outside of its registered dealers – in excess of the de
minimis thresholds.406

404

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-4. This exception, when available, applies to all of the dealing of a
person’s registered dealing affiliate (or affiliate deemed not to be a dealer pursuant to the
provisions of Exchange Act rule 3a71-2(b)), regardless of the counterparty or the location of the
transaction, and regardless of whether the dealing transaction otherwise implicates cross-border
issues.

405

See notes 391 and 392, supra.

406

We recognize that one commenter supported the proposed operational independence condition,
stating that the condition would address evasion concerns while promoting the statutory purpose
of the de minimis exception. See note 396, supra. After further consideration, however, we
believe that the fact that the aggregation provision will still limit cumulative group-wide dealing
activity by unregistered entities to no more than the de minimis thresholds should suffice as a
safeguard against evasive activity. This is particularly true given that those thresholds are
significantly below the amounts of dealing typically engaged in by persons above the thresholds.
See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30636 (noting that, out of 28 potential
dealers that had three or more counterparties that themselves were not recognized as dealers by
ISDA, 15 of those exceeded a notional transaction threshold of $100 billion and accounted for
over 98 percent of the total activity of all 28 entities).
We also note that certain commenters raised concerns about the application of the aggregation
provisions generally in the context of joint ventures, particularly in the context of minority
shareholders. See note 395, supra. Those issues regarding the scope of the aggregation
provisions that the Commission previously adopted are not unique to the cross-border context,
and in our view are outside the scope of this release. We note generally, however, that in the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release we concluded that a common control standard is more

156

The final rule also has been modified from the proposal to permit a person to rely on this
provision if its affiliate is in the process of registering as a dealer. The de minimis rule generally
provides that a person that is not registered as a dealer but that no longer falls below the
applicable de minimis thresholds nonetheless will be deemed not to be a dealer until the earlier
of the date in which it submits a complete application for registration as a dealer, or two months
after the end of the month that it becomes no longer able to take advantage of the exception. 407
That provision was intended to avoid market disruption in conjunction with the registration
process. 408 Upon further consideration, we similarly believe that the provision at issue here
should allow a person not to count the transactions of its affiliates that are in the process of
registering as dealers, to avoid market disruption that may otherwise result due to the prospect of
a person intermittently exceeding the de minimis thresholds when its affiliates are in the process
of registering. Such situations, moreover, would not appear to provide practical opportunities for
corporate groups to evade dealer registration by dividing dealing activities among multiple
affiliates.
G. Exception for Cleared Anonymous Transactions
1. Proposed Approach and Commenters’ Views
Three commenters expressed the view 409 that the Commission’s final rules should
include a provision similar to an aspect of the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, which stated the
CFTC’s view that certain dealing transactions that are executed anonymously and cleared

appropriate than a majority-ownership standard in the context of the anti-evasive purposes of the
aggregation requirement. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30631 n.437.

generally would not be counted against the de minimis thresholds. 410 One commenter
particularly emphasized that market participants would not have information available regarding
a counterparty’s identity in an anonymous transaction, and suggested that the prospect of
becoming subject to dealer registration could deter non-U.S. liquidity providers from
participating on security-based swap markets that provide access to U.S. persons. 411
2. Final Rule
After considering commenter views we have concluded that this type of exception is
appropriate, particularly given that the final de minimis rules turn in part on the domicile of the
counterparty to the non-U.S. person, and this information would be unavailable to the non-U.S.
person that is a counterparty to a cleared anonymous transaction. Absent such an exception, it is
possible that execution facilities would exclude U.S. market participants to prevent their non-

See CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, 78 FR at 45325 (stating that when a non-U.S. person that is
not a guaranteed or conduit affiliate enters in to swaps anonymously on CFTC-registered
platforms, and the swaps are cleared, the non-U.S. person would generally not have to count
those swaps against the applicable thresholds, noting that, in such circumstances, the non-U.S.
person would not have any prior information regarding its counterparty; also interpreting the
CFTC’s cross-border jurisdiction such that, with respect to such cleared and anonymously
executed swaps, the non-U.S. person would generally satisfy certain transaction-level
requirements).
The Cross-Border Proposing Release generally requested comment as to whether the proposed de
minimis approach would place market participants at a competitive advantage or disadvantage,
and as to whether there are other measures the Commission should consider to implement the de
minimis exception. See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 30996. More generally, the
Commission also requested comment regarding the proposals as whole, and regarding
consistency with the CFTC’s cross-border approach, including comments regarding the impact of
differences between the two approaches, and comments regarding whether the Commission’s
proposed approach should be modified to conform with that taken by the CFTC. See id. at
31102.

U.S. members from having to face the prospect of dealer regulation, which could impair market
liquidity and increase costs and risks. 412
For those reasons, the final rule has been revised from the proposal to except, from
having to be counted against the de minimis thresholds, certain security-based swap transactions
that a non-U.S. person enters into anonymously on an execution facility or national securities
exchange and that are cleared through a clearing agency. 413

412

The exclusion for cleared anonymous transactions is intended to avoid placing market
participants in a position where counterparty-related information needed for compliance would be
unavailable, which may in turn lead execution facilities to exclude U.S. persons. We also note
that the exclusion would strengthen incentives for shifting activity to transparent trading venues,
which is a key goal of Title VII. While these transactions may pose risks to U.S. persons and to
the U.S. financial system as a whole, those risks may be offset by the liquidity and transparency
benefits that occur due to trading on transparent venues. Furthermore, the characteristics
expected to be associated with central clearing (e.g., the daily exchange of mark-to-market
margin) have parallels to the capital and margin requirements for registered dealers in terms of
helping to protect the financial system against the risks introduced by particular transactions. On
the other hand, such risk mitigation may be absent to the extent that the relevant clearing agency
– which under the exception is not required to be registered with the Commission – does not
follow standards consistent with the Title VII requirements applicable to registered clearing
agencies.

413

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-5. This exception solely addresses the issue of whether a particular
transaction needs to be counted against the de minimis thresholds. It does not address the issue of
when a particular execution facility or clearing agency needs to register with the Commission.
The Cross-Border Proposing Release separately addressed cross-border issues regarding when an
execution facility or clearing agency would have to register with the Commission. See CrossBorder Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31054-58 (regarding security-based swap execution facility
registration), 78 FR at 31038-40 (regarding clearing agency registration); see also Registration
and Regulation of Security-Based Swap Execution Facilities, Exchange Act Release No. 63825
(Feb. 2, 2011), 76 FR 10948 (Feb. 28, 2011) (proposed rules regarding registration and other
requirements applicable to security-based swap execution facilities).
This exception also does not address the application of section 5 of the Securities Act to such
transactions. Rule 239 under the Securities Act (17 CFR 230.239) provides an exemption under
the Securities Act for certain security-based swap transactions involving an eligible clearing
agency. This exemption does not apply to security-based swap transactions not involving an
eligible clearing agency, such as the anonymous transactions entered into on the execution facility
or national securities exchange, regardless of whether the security-based swaps subsequently are
cleared by an eligible clearing agency. See Exemptions for Security-Based Swaps Issued By
Certain Clearing Agencies, Securities Act Release No. 9308 (Mar. 30, 2012), 77 FR 20536 (Apr.
5, 2012).

159

In particular, the final rule in part provides that a non-U.S. person need not count such
cleared anonymous transactions against the threshold, unless the non-U.S. person is a conduit
affiliate. 414 In addition, the final rule permits an affiliate (that itself may be a U.S. or non-U.S.
person) of such a non-U.S. person not to count such transactions of the non-U.S. person against
the affiliate’s own thresholds for purposes of the aggregation provisions, unless the non-U.S.
person is a conduit affiliate. 415
The exception is not available when the non-U.S. person is a conduit affiliate because
conduit affiliates are required to count all of their dealing transaction against the thresholds
regardless of whether their counterparty is a U.S. or a non-U.S. person. As a result, the
anonymous nature of the transaction would not cause implementation issues for conduit
affiliates.
For purposes of the exception, a transaction would be “anonymous” only if the
counterparty to the transaction in fact is unknown to the non-U.S. person prior to the transaction.
The transaction would not be “anonymous” if, for example, a person submitted the transaction to
an execution facility after accepting a request for quotation from a known counterparty or a
known group of potential counterparties, even if the process of submitting the transaction itself
did not involve a named counterparty.
H. Additional Issues
1. Particular Activities and Entities
414

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-5(a). This exception applies regardless of whether the execution
facility on which the transaction is entered into, or the clearing agency through which it is
cleared, needs to be registered with the Commission. This is because the exclusion of U.S.
market participants from an overseas execution or clearing facility – a result this exception is
intended to guard against – could impair the markets regardless of whether the facility from
which U.S. persons are excluded in fact are registered, and thus lead to increased costs and risks.

415

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-5(a)(2), (b).

160

Commenters to the Cross-Border Proposing Release raised issues regarding the
application of the dealer registration requirement to limited security-based swap activities by
certain “run-off” entities, 416 and in the context of portfolio compression. 417 Those issues are not
unique to the cross-border context, and are outside of the scope of this release. We generally
note, moreover, that in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release we considered and
rejected certain requests for categorical exclusions from dealer definition. With regard to issues
regarding the relevance of those or other activities to the de minimis analysis, we generally note
that the dealer registration requirement necessarily distinguishes between a person’s dealing and
non-dealing activities. 418
2. Foreign Public Sector Financial Institutions and Government-Related Entities
As discussed above, the final rule defining “U.S. person” (like the proposed definition of
that term) specifically excludes several foreign public sector financial institutions and their
agencies and pension plans, and more generally excludes any other similar international
organization and its agencies and pension plans. 419 Certain commenters requested that we take
further action to address the application of the dealer definition and its de minimis exception to
security-based swap activities involving such foreign public sector financial institutions. Those
416

See SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at A-18 (addressing entities that are consolidating U.S.-facing
dealing activities worldwide into one or a few registered dealers, but that may not be able to
transfer or terminate their legacy security-based swap portfolios and thus may need to enter into
new transactions in connection with those legacy portfolios); JSDA Letter at 4 (suggesting that
including contract cancellations, alternations and transfers within the de minimis calculation
“might invite a rush of cancellation before the enforcement of the proposed rules and make it
difficult to cancel or transfer contracts for reducing risks”).

See TriOptima Letter at 3-4 (explaining that portfolio compression services do not involve any of
the enumerated factors that the Commission has identified as indicators of dealing activity).

application of the dealer-trader distinction to security-based swap transactions).

161

commenters in part stated that such organizations should not be required to register as securitybased swap dealers, and that those organizations’ affiliates should be considered immune from
domestic regulation to the same extent as the organizations themselves. 420 In our view, however,
such issues are outside the scope of this release, given that the source of any such privileges and
immunities is found outside of the Dodd-Frank Act and the federal securities laws.
Separately, commenters stated that non-U.S. persons should not have to count their
dealing transactions involving those organizations against the non-U.S. persons’ dealer de
minimis thresholds, on the grounds that counting such transactions would constitute the
impermissible regulation of such organizations even if those were “transactions conducted within
the United States.” 421 As noted below, we have determined not to include the “transaction
conducted within the United States” provisions in this final rule. With that said, we do not
concur with the suggestion that counting a person’s dealing transactions with such organizations
against the de minimis thresholds – when otherwise provided for by the rules – involves the
regulation of such organizations. Requiring a person to count, against the de minimis thresholds,
the person’s dealing transactions involving such an international organization as counterparty
simply reflects the application of the federal securities laws to that person and its dealing
420

See, e.g., WB/IFC Letter at 2-4, 6-7 (also stating that such organizations should not be required
to register as major participants or to clear security-based swaps, and that affiliates of such
organizations should be excluded from the “U.S. person” definition); SC Letter at 16-24
(contending that the privileges and immunities afforded such organizations would be violated by
their direct regulation as dealers or major participants, or by direct regulation equivalents, and
that affiliates of such organizations also are immune from regulation); IDB Letter at 5. See also
notes 225 and 229, supra.

421

See SC Letter at 18-19 (stating that the inclusion of such transactions against a counterparty’s de
minimis thresholds would be “tantamount to regulation of the operations of the World Bank and
the IFC, in violation of their privileges and immunities”); WB/IFC Letter (incorporating SC
Letter). These comments did not object to the inclusion of transactions between a U.S. person
and an FPSFI, because the Commission would have jurisdiction to regulate that “U.S. person” for
other reasons and it would not be regulated simply because it does business with the FPSFI. See
SC Letter at note 21.

activities, and does not constitute the regulation of the international organization. A person’s
security-based swap dealing transaction with such an international organization accordingly are
considered the same, for purposes of applying the de minimis thresholds and other Title VII
requirements, as a dealing transaction with some other non-U.S. person counterparty.
Finally, two commenters stated that they should not be subject to the possibility of dealer
regulation for comity reasons, on the grounds that they are arms of a foreign government. 422 We
believe that such issues best are addressed on a case-by-case basis, but we generally note that the
prospect of dealer regulation is relevant only to the extent that a person engages in dealing
activity.
I. Economic Analysis of the Final Cross-Border Dealer De Minimis Rule
These final rules and guidance regarding the cross-border implementation of the de
minimis exception to the “security-based swap dealer” definition will affect the costs and
benefits of dealer regulation by determining which dealing transactions will be counted against
the exception’s thresholds. 423 The cross-border rules have the potential to be important in
determining the extent to which the risk mitigation and other benefits of Title VII (such as
market transparency and customer protection) are achieved, given the core role that dealers play
within the security-based swap market and the market’s cross-border nature. 424

422

See KfW Letter; FMS-WM Letter.

423

As we noted in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, because the de minimis exception
will determine which entities engaged in security-based swap dealing activity ultimately will be
regulated as dealers under Title VII, the exception will have an effect on the burdens and benefits
associated with dealer regulation. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at
30628-30. The thresholds used in the de minimis exception accordingly were set at a level that
sought to meet the goals of Title VII while appropriately minimizing the costs to market
participants by providing for the regulation, as dealers, “of persons responsible for the vast
majority of dealing activity within the market.” See id. at 30638-40.

424

See section III.A, supra.

163

Commenters addressed the associated cost-benefit issues from a variety of perspectives.
Some directly addressed the link between the cross-border scope of the dealer definition and the
associated costs and benefits, by arguing that cost-benefit principles warranted greater
harmonization with approaches taken by the CFTC or foreign regulators. 425 Commenters also
addressed the need for cost-benefit analysis, 426 or questioned the adequacy of the Cross-Border
Proposal’s cost-benefit assessment. 427 Other comments that addressed the dealer definition
425

See, e.g., IIB Letter (stating that cost-benefit considerations warrant harmonization to the CFTC
and foreign regulatory authorities with regard to cross-border rules, and that divergence generally
would be warranted only if the Commission’s rules are more flexible, and thence would not
preclude the voluntary adoption of consistent practices).
Although we have considered those comments that expressed complete or partial support in favor
of consistency with the CFTC guidance, these final rules nonetheless follow approaches that
differ from those taken by the CFTC in certain regards, generally by taking approaches that are
narrower in scope than those adopted by the CFTC. See supra note 255 (Commission’s definition
of “U.S. person” differs from the CFTC approach in part by not including investment companies
that beneficially are majority-owned by U.S. persons); note 353 and accompanying text
(Commission’s rules regarding the treatment of guaranteed affiliates of U.S. persons focuses on
the presence of recourse against a U.S. guarantor, in contrast to the CFTC approach that more
generally accounts for financial support commitments regardless of recourse rights), note
325(Commission’s definition of “conduit affiliate” differs from the CFTC’s approach in part by
not considering financial statement treatment); note 379 (discussing expectation that any foreign
branch of a U.S. bank that generally would be considered a foreign branch under the CFTC
Cross-Border Guidance also likely would be a foreign branch under our final rule).
We also have considered initiatives by foreign regulators related to the regulation of OTC
derivatives. In that regard, we note that the regulatory regimes in certain other jurisdictions do
not provide for the registration of persons who function as dealers, in contrast to the approach
Congress took in Title VII. Also, we expect to take into account the regulatory frameworks
followed in other jurisdictions as we assess requests for substituted compliance in connection
with the substantive requirements applicable to security-based swap dealers and other market
participants. Those substituted compliance assessments are geared to promote Title VII in a way
that fairly accounts for other regimes by assessing the requirements of those regimes on a
function-by-function basis.

426

See BM Letter, note 28, supra. As stated above, the Commission in fact is sensitive to the
economic consequences of its rules, and has taken the costs and benefits into account in adopting
these rules.

427

See CDEU Letter, note 28, supra. This commenter particularly expressed the view that the
Commission’s proposal had failed to engage in an adequate consideration of cost-benefit
principles, and instead stated that the Commission should “conduct a direct cost-benefit analysis
of the conflicting rule regimes (e.g., with the European Market Infrastructure Regulation and the
CFTC’s cross-border guidance).” That commenter further expressed the view that, in requesting

164

implicate the tradeoff between the costs and benefits associated with the definition’s scope, even
when the commenters did not directly address the economic analysis in the Cross-Border
Proposing Release or otherwise explicitly raise cost-benefit considerations. 428
We have taken economic effects into account in adopting these final cross-border rules
and providing guidance. In doing so, we believe that a narrow application of dealer regulation
under Title VII – such as one that is limited to dealing activity that might be viewed as occurring
solely within the United States – would not be sufficient to achieve the purposes of Title VII in
light of the attributes of the security-based swap market, including the market’s global nature, the
concentration of dealing activity, the key role played by dealers and the risks posed by dealers
via their legal and financial relationships. At the same time, we recognize that the cross-border
application of Title VII has the potential to reduce liquidity within the U.S. market to the extent
it increases the costs of entering into security-based swaps or provides incentives for particular
market participants to avoid the U.S. market by operating wholly outside the Title VII
framework.

comment on the proposal’s cost-benefit analysis, the Commission actually “asks the public to
conduct such an analysis for the SEC” in lieu of the Commission having conducted its own
analysis. See id.
In actuality, our request for comment simply gave the public the opportunity to address our
economic analysis. The economic assessment in this release specifically addresses those
economic impacts in a context where many entities may have taken steps to follow the CFTC’s
cross-border guidance, and also recognizes that market participants may seek to structure their
activities to avoid Title VII given differences between Title VII regulation and the regulation
present in foreign regimes.
428

For example, one comment in opposition to the proposed “operational independence” condition
to the exception to the aggregation requirement for positions of affiliates that are registered as
security-based swap dealers in part addressed the extra costs that would be associated with such a
provision. See SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter, note 391, supra. As discussed above, that proposed
condition has been removed. See section IV.F, supra.

165

The cross-border rules applying the “security-based swap dealer” definition to crossborder dealing activity implicate two categories of costs and benefits. First, certain current and
future participants in the security-based swap market will incur assessment costs in connection
with determining whether they fall within the “security-based swap dealer” definition and thus
would have to register with the Commission.
Second, the registration and regulation of some entities as security-based swap dealers
will lead to programmatic costs and benefits arising as a consequence of the Title VII
requirements that apply to registered security-based swap dealers, such as the capital, margin,
and business conduct requirements. 429 These requirements may be expected to impose certain
costs on participants acting as dealers, but also to produce benefits to the market and its
participants, including counterparty protections and risk-mitigation benefits.
We discuss the programmatic and assessment costs and benefits associated with the final
rules more fully below. We also discuss the economic impact of certain potential alternatives to
the approach taken by the final rules.
1. Programmatic Costs and Benefits
(a) Cost-benefit Considerations of the Final Rules
Exchange Act rules 3a71-3, 3a71-4, and 3a71-5 will permit market participants to
exclude certain dealing transactions from their de minimis calculations, and thus may cause
particular entities that engage in certain dealing activities not to be regulated as security-based
swap dealers. The rules accordingly may be expected to affect the programmatic costs and
benefits associated with the regulation of security-based swap dealers under Title VII, given that

429

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31135.

166

those costs and benefits are determined in part by which persons will be regulated as securitybased swap dealers. 430
This does not mean that there is a one-to-one relationship between a person not being a
“security-based swap dealer” as a result of these cross-border rules, and the resulting change to
programmatic benefits and costs. Indeed, although these rules may determine which particular
entities will be regulated as dealers, it does not follow that total programmatic costs and benefits
will vary by an amount proportional to the volume of those entities’ dealing activity. As the
Commission explained in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, some of the costs and
benefits of regulating dealers may be fixed, while others may be variable depending on a
particular person’s security-based swap dealing activity. 431 In practice, the programmatic
benefits associated with the regulation of persons engaged in security-based swap dealing
activity – in other words, the expected transparency, customer protection and market efficiency
objectives associated with dealer regulation – likely will vary depending on the type and nature
of those persons’ dealing activity, including the degree to which those persons engage in
security-based swap dealing activity within the United States or in a manner likely to give rise to
Title VII concerns within the United States.
We believe that the cross-border rules we are adopting today will focus the regulation of
security-based swap dealers under Title VII upon those entities that engage in security-based
430

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30724.

431

See id. (“Some of the costs of regulating a particular person as a dealer or major participants,
such as costs of registration, may largely be fixed. At the same time, other costs associated with
regulating that person as a dealer or major participant (e.g., costs associated with margin and
capital requirements) may be variable, reflecting the level of the person’s security-based swap
activity. Similarly, the regulatory benefits that would arise from deeming that person to be a
dealer or major participant (e.g., benefits associated with increased transparency and efficiency,
and reduced risks faced by customers and counterparties), although not quantifiable, may be
expected to be variable in a way that reflects the person’s security-based swap activity.”).

167

swap transactions that occur in the United States, or on the prevention of evasion. Our definition
of “security-based swap dealer” seeks to capture those entities for which regulation of securitybased swap activity is warranted due to the nature of their activities with other market
participants. 432 Specifically, we have focused the rules on those market participants that are
likely to have financial and legal relationships within the United States. This set of entities
includes those that currently provide liquidity to U.S. persons as market makers in the OTC
security-based swap market and those that trade with U.S. persons as market makers for securitybased swaps on organized trading venues. Regulation of these entities will mitigate risk and
promote stability for U.S. persons and potentially the U.S. financial markets by increasing the
likelihood that they are able to meet their obligations under security-based swap contracts against
counterparties with ties to the U.S. financial system once they are subject to the final adopted
rules regarding the requirements applicable to dealers (rules establishing capital and margin
requirements for registered security-based swap dealers). Furthermore, regulation of these
entities as dealers may enable them to continue to provide liquidity to their counterparties,
particularly in times when the markets are under financial stress and their counterparties may
struggle to meet their financial obligations. We also believe that regulation of these entities will
further other goals of Title VII, particularly as we consider future substantive regulation of the
security-based swap market. In other words, these requirements will direct the application of the
de minimis thresholds – which themselves are the product of cost-benefit considerations –
toward those dealing activities in U.S. financial markets that most directly implicate the purposes
of Title VII. As such, these rules reflect our assessment and evaluation of those programmatic
costs and benefits:
432

See id. at 30617.

168

•

Dealing by U.S. persons – The “U.S. person” definition captures entities whose securitybased swap activities pose risks to the United States that may raise the concerns intended
to be addressed by Title VII, regardless of the status of their counterparty. 433 The
requirement that U.S. persons, including foreign branches, count all of their dealing
transactions against the de minimis thresholds reflects the domestic nature of their
dealing activity, particularly given that it is the financial resources of the entire person
that enable it to engage in dealing activity. 434

•

Dealing by guaranteed affiliates of U.S. persons – The requirement that non-U.S. persons
count all their dealing transactions that are subject to a recourse guarantee by a U.S.
affiliate, even when the counterparty is another non-U.S. person, reflects the domestic
nature of that activity and the risks that those recourse guarantees pose to U.S. persons
and potentially to the U.S. financial system via the U.S. person guarantor. 435

•

Dealing by other non-U.S. persons with U.S.-person counterparties – The general
requirement that non-U.S. persons count their dealing transactions with counterparties
that are U.S. persons reflects the domestic nature of that activity and the concerns raised
by the performance of dealing activity within the United States, impacts on U.S. market
liquidity, risks that this dealing activity poses to U.S. persons and potentially toward the
U.S. financial system as a whole, and counterparty and market transparency concerns. 436
This general requirement is limited, however, as it does not extend to transactions with

See section IV.C.3, supra.

434

See section IV.B.2, supra.

435

See section IV.E.1(b), supra. In the Cross-Border Proposing Release we preliminarily concluded
that the risks associated with such guarantees could be adequately addressed through major
participant regulation. We have reconsidered that view for the reasons discussed above.

169

foreign branches of U.S. banks that are registered as dealers, or to certain cleared
anonymous transactions. While those excluded transactions also involve the
performance, at least in part, of relevant dealing activity within the United States,
implicate Title VII concerns, and import risk into the United States – and their counting
against the thresholds thus would be consistent with achieving the programmatic benefits
of dealer regulation – their exclusion is nevertheless warranted by considerations
regarding market access by U.S. persons (in the case of transactions with certain foreign
branches of U.S. banks) 437 and by considerations regarding information availability and
market liquidity (in the case of the exclusion for cleared anonymous transactions). 438
•

Anti-evasion provisions – The requirement that conduit affiliates count all of their dealing
activities against the thresholds, and the cross-border application of the aggregation

437

See section IV.E.2(b), supra. Although dealing activity involving foreign branches of U.S. banks
does pose risks to the U.S. bank of which the foreign branch is a part and potentially to the U.S.
financial system, foreign branches of registered security-based swap dealers will be subject to a
number of Title VII regulatory requirements, including capital and margin requirements, that are
designed to protect the system against those risks. Furthermore, this limitation is guided in part
by the desire to preserve liquidity throughout the system, given that absent the exclusion non-U.S.
dealers may have reasons to favor non-U.S. counterparties to avoid the regulatory requirements of
Title VII, which could threaten to fragment liquidity across geographical or jurisdictional lines.

438

See section IV.G.2, supra. As noted above, see note 412, supra, the exclusion for cleared
anonymous transactions is driven by concerns about counterparty-related information needed for
compliance being unavailable, which in turn may lead U.S. persons to be excluded from certain
execution facilities. The exclusion for such transactions also would be expected to have the effect
of strengthening incentives for shifting activity to transparent trading venues, a key goal of Title
VII. While these transactions of non-U.S. persons may pose risks to the U.S. bank of which the
foreign branch is a part and potentially to the U.S. financial system as a whole, those risks may be
offset by the liquidity and transparency benefits that occur due to trading on transparent venues.
Furthermore, certain of the characteristics we expect to be associated with central clearing (e.g.,
the daily exchange of mark-to-market margin) serve similar functions as the capital and margin
requirements for registered dealers in terms of helping to protect the financial system against the
risks introduced by particular transactions. Of course, such risk mitigation may be absent to the
extent that the relevant clearing agency – which under the exception is not required to be
registered with the Commission – does not follow standards consistent with the Title VII
requirements applicable to registered clearing agencies. As noted above, moreover, see note 413,
supra, we are not addressing the registration requirements for such clearing agencies in this
release.

170

requirements related to the de minimis exception, both reflect targeted efforts to prevent
evasion of the security-based swap dealer requirements of Title VII. 439 We are adopting a
definition of “conduit affiliate” that excludes affiliates of registered security-based swap
dealers and major security-based swap participants to avoid imposing costs on registered
persons in situations where the types of evasion concerns that the conduit affiliate definition
is intended to address are minimal.
In short, these final rules apply the de minimis thresholds – which themselves reflect
cost-benefit considerations 440 – to cross-border security-based swap activity in a way that directs
the focus of dealer regulation toward those entities whose security-based swap dealing activities
most fully implicate the purposes of Title VII, or that is reasonably designed to prevent evasion
of dealer regulation under Title VII.
In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, we concluded that “[t]o the extent that an entity
engaged in dealing activity wholly outside the United States poses risks to the U.S. financial
system, we preliminarily believe that subjecting it to dealer registration and the related

439

See sections IV.D.2 and IV.F.2, supra.

440

Based on an analysis of dealing activity within the security-based swap market, we concluded
that a de minimis threshold of $3 billion for dealing activity involving security-based swaps
would capture over 99 percent of dealing activity within the single-name CDS market under the
ambit of dealer regulation. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30639. We
also concluded that this amount constituted a reasonable threshold, though not the only such
threshold, for addressing the relevant competing factors – including the fact that the economic
benefits provided by dealer requirements in large part will depend on the proportion of securitybased swaps that are transacted subject to those requirements, while certain of the costs
associated with dealer regulation would include costs that are independent of the amount of a
person’s dealing activity. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30629,
30639.
As noted above, in application the general de minimis threshold currently is subject to an $8
billion phase-in level, and that phase-in level will remain in place until the Commission,
following a study, either determines to terminate the phase-in level or adopts a different
threshold. See part IV.A, supra.

171

requirements would not generate the types of programmatic benefits that Title VII dealer
regulation is intended to produce, as the dealing activity of such entity poses risks to
counterparties outside the United States.” 441 These final rules and guidance regarding which
transactions are to be counted against the de minimis thresholds are consistent with that
principle, although in part they reflect a further assessment of the programmatic benefits
resulting from the application of dealer regulation to non-U.S. persons when there is a recourse
guarantee against a U.S. affiliate, including the benefits resulting from the application of
financial responsibility requirements imposed upon registered security-based swap dealers. In
this regard, the final rules and guidance reflect a reconsideration of our earlier conclusion that the
risks to U.S. persons arising from such guarantees could adequately be addressed by the
regulation of major security-based swap participants. In addition, these final rules and guidance
more fully account for anti-evasion concerns associated with the potential for a U.S. person to
engage in dealing activity using a guaranteed non-U.S. affiliate that is economically equivalent
to the U.S. person itself entering into those dealing transactions.
(b) Evaluation of Programmatic Impacts
In setting the de minimis thresholds as part of the Intermediary Definitions Adopting
Release, we attempted to identify a level of dealing activity that would identify and capture the
entities for which the Title VII dealer requirements are most appropriate, without imposing the
costs of Title VII on those entities for which regulation currently may not be justified in light of
the purposes of the statute. 442 We particularly took into account data regarding the activities of
participants in the security-based swap market, including data regarding activity suggestive of

dealing. Based on this analysis, we estimated that up to 50 entities in the security-based swap
market might register as security-based swap dealers. 443 Those estimates – made outside of the
context the cross-border application of the dealer definition – provide a baseline against which
the Commission can analyze the programmatic costs and benefits and assessment costs of the
final rules applying the de minimis exception to cross-border activities.
We believe the methodology used in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release also
is appropriate for considering the potential programmatic costs and benefits associated with the
final cross-border rules. This methodology particularly can help provide context as to how rules
regarding the cross-border application of the de minimis exception may change the number of
entities that must register as security-based swap dealers, and thus help provide perspective
regarding the corresponding impact on the programmatic costs and benefits of Title VII.
Applying that methodology to 2012 data regarding the single-name CDS market suggests that
under these final rules approximately 50 entities may have to register as dealers – a number that
is consistent with our estimates as part of the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release. 444
443

See section III.A.1, supra; see also Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30635.
We stated that this was a “conservative” estimate. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting
Release, 77 FR at 30725 and n.1457. In establishing the de minimis threshold, we analyzed the
percentage of the market activity that would likely be attributable to registered security-based
swap dealers under various thresholds and various screens designed to identify entities that are
engaged in dealing activity. See id. at 30636. Our analysis placed particular weight on the screen
that identified entities that engaged in security-based swap transactions with three or more
counterparties that themselves were not identified as dealers by ISDA. See id. at 30636. Of the
28 firms and corporate groups that satisfied this criterion, 25 also engaged in activity over the $3
billion threshold. See id. Based on this analysis, together with our expectation that some of the
included corporate groups would register more than a single security-based swap dealer and that
new entrants may be likely to enter the market, we estimated that as many as 50 entities would
ultimately be required to register as a security-based swap dealer. See id. at 30725 n.1457.

444

While these revised figures are based on methodology similar to what Commission staff
employed in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, they make use of newer data and
also account for the final rules’ approach to counting dealing transactions against the de minimis
thresholds.

173

We recognize that there are limitations to using this methodology to consider the
potential programmatic impact of the cross-border rules. These include limitations associated
with the fact that the available data does not extend to all types of security-based swaps, 445 and
challenges in extrapolating transaction data into inferences of dealing activity. 446 Also, the

Consistent with that methodology regarding the use of market data to identify entities that may be
engaged in dealing activity pursuant to the dealer-trader distinction (see id. 30636 n.478), the data
indicated that in 2012, 40 entities engaged in the single-name security-based swap market had
three or more counterparties that were not identified by ISDA as dealers. Of those 40 entities, 27
had $3 billion or more in notional single-name CDS activity over a 12 month period. Applying
the principles reflected in these final rules regarding the counting of transactions against the de
minimis thresholds suggests that 25 of those entities would have $3 billion or more in notional
transactions counted against the thresholds. Applying the aggregation rules (by aggregating the
transactions, that are subject to counting, of other affiliates within a corporate group that
individually do not have $3 billion in transactions subject to counting) increases that number to
26 entities. Based on this data, we believe that it is reasonable to conclude that up to 50 entities
ultimately may register as security-based swap dealers, although fewer dealers also is possible.
To apply the counting tests of these final rules to the data, Commission staff identified DTCCTIW accounts associated with foreign branches and foreign subsidiaries of U.S. entities and
counted all transaction activity in these accounts against the firm’s de minimis threshold.
Commission staff further counted non-U.S. persons’ activity against U.S. persons and foreign
branches and subsidiaries of U.S. persons against the de minimis thresholds.
445

In these assessments, we have taken into account data obtained from DTCC-TIW regarding the
activity of participants in the single-name CDS market. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting
Release, 77 FR at 30635. The present assessments use data from 2012, rather than the 2011
period used in connection with the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release.
As part of the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release we also considered more limited
publicly available data regarding equity swaps. See id. at 30636 n.476, and 30637 n.485. The lack
of market data is significant in the context of total return swaps on equity and debt, in that we do
not have the same amount of information regarding those products as we have in connection with
the present market for single name CDS. See id. at 30724 n.1456. Although the definition of
security-based swaps is not limited to single-name CDS, we believe that the single-name CDS
data are sufficiently representative of the market to help inform the analysis. See id. at 30636.

446

As we noted in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, the data incorporates transactions
reflecting both dealing activity and non-dealing activity, including transactions by persons who
may engage in no dealing activity whatsoever. See id. at 30635-36. For these purposes we have
identified potential dealers based on whether an entity engaged in the single-name security-based
swap market had three or more counterparties that were not identified by ISDA as dealers. We
recognize that this may be imperfect as a tool for identifying dealing activity, given that the
presence or absence of dealing activity ultimately turns upon the relevant facts and circumstances
of an entity’s security-based swap transactions, as informed by the dealer-trader distinction.

174

available single-name CDS data in certain regards potentially may lead the impact of these rules
to be underestimated or overestimated:
•

The Commission’s access to data on CDS that are written on non-U.S. reference entities
does not extend to data regarding transactions between two counterparties that are not
domiciled in the United States, or guaranteed by a person domiciled in the United
States. 447 More generally, the Commission’s access to data also does not extend to
transactions among affiliated entities. The available data thus does not extend to the
activities of non-U.S. conduit affiliates, to the extent that they engage in transactions with
non-U.S. persons (that themselves are not the subject of a guarantee), and potentially
makes the assessment underinclusive to the extent that conduit affiliates engaged in
dealing activity during the relevant period.

•

The available data also does not specifically distinguish those transactions of non-U.S.
persons that are subject to a guarantee by a U.S. person, and other (non-guaranteed)
transactions by such non-U.S. persons. As a result, we have assumed that all foreign
subsidiaries of U.S. persons rely on guarantees for all transactions, which potentially
overestimates the level of transaction activity that would count toward de minimis
thresholds for U.S. persons with foreign subsidiaries.
Separately, the programmatic costs and benefits associated with the implementation of

these rules cannot be quantified with any degree of precision because the full range of the de
minimis exception’s effects on the programmatic costs and benefits also will reflect final rules –

447

The Commission has more complete access to data regarding transactions involving single-name
CDS on U.S. reference entities.

175

which have yet to be finalized – implementing the Title VII entity-level and transaction-level
requirements applicable to security-based swap dealers.
In addition, the programmatic benefits and costs associated with the cross-border
application of the de minimis exception may change as market participants modify their business
structure or practices in response to these rules. To avoid the prospect of being regulated as a
security-based swap dealer, some market participants may restructure their businesses or take
other steps (such as avoiding engaging in security-based swap activities involving U.S. persons)
to avoid having their dealing transactions counted against the de minimis thresholds. Other
market participants may take similar steps in response to counterparty demands. We understand
that some market participants already have taken these types of steps to restructure their
derivatives operations in response to the implementation of Title VII requirements related to
swaps. More fundamentally, there are inherent challenges associated with attempting to quantify
the risk-mitigation and other benefits of financial regulation. 448 The programmatic impact of
these rules may further reflect the fact that certain entities that are deemed to be security-based
swap dealers, and hence are subject to the applicable Title VII dealer requirements, separately
may be subject to other regulatory requirements that are analogous to the security-based swap
dealer requirements. For example, we recognize that certain entities that are deemed to be
448

In the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, we and the CFTC noted that we are “not of the
general view that the costs of extending regulation to any particular entity must be outweighed by
the quantifiable or other benefits to be achieved with respect to that particular entity.” See
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30630. We also noted that “it does not
appear possible to demonstrate empirically – let alone quantify – the increase or decrease in the
possibility that a financial crisis would occur at a particular future time and with a particular
intensity in the absence of financial regulation or as a result of varying levels or types of financial
regulation.” See id. at 30630 n.421 (also noting the difficulty of demonstrating empirically “that
the customer protections associated with dealer regulation would increase or decrease the
likelihood that any particular market participant would suffer injury (or the degree to which the
participant would suffer injury) associated with entering into an inappropriate swap or securitybased swap”).

176

security-based swap dealers pursuant to these rules also may be registered as swap dealers with
the CFTC, pursuant to the CEA. Those entities’ compliance with CFTC requirements applicable
to swap dealers potentially may mitigate the programmatic effect of these rules – in terms of both
costs and benefits – to the extent that those CFTC requirements are comparable with the SEC’s
yet-to-be-finalized substantive rules applicable to security-based swap dealers. The potential
availability of substituted compliance, whereby a market participant may comply with a Title VII
security-based swap dealer requirement by complying with a comparable requirement of a
foreign financial regulator, also may affect the final programmatic impact of these rules.
In general, however, and consistent with our territorial approach, we believe that these
rules are targeted appropriately, and do not apply dealer regulation to those entities that have a
more limited involvement in the U.S. financial system and hence whose regulation as a securitybased swap dealer under Title VII would be less linked to programmatic benefits (i.e., non-U.S.
persons that engage in security-based swap dealing activity entirely, or almost entirely, outside
the United States with non-U.S. persons or with certain foreign branches), while applying dealer
regulation to those entities whose dealing activity would be more likely to produce programmatic
benefits under Title VII. The nexus between specific aspects of these requirements and the
programmatic costs and benefits also is addressed below in connection with our consideration of
various alternatives to the approach taken in the final rules.
Finally, we recognize that the U.S. market participants and transactions regulated under
Title VII are a subset of the overall global security-based swap market and that shocks to risk or
liquidity arising from a foreign entity’s dealing activity outside the United States may spill into
the United States. Such spillover risks associated with dealing activity that falls outside the
scope of Title VII have the potential to affect U.S. persons and the U.S. financial system either

177

through a foreign entity’s transactions with foreign entities, which, in turn, transact with U.S.
persons (and may, as a result, be registered security-based swap dealers or major security-based
swap participants), or through membership in a clearing agency that may provide CCP services
in the United States or have a U.S. person as a clearing member. We also have considered these
spillovers in connection with our analysis of the effects of these final cross-border rules on
efficiency, competition and capital formation. 449
2. Assessment Costs
The analysis of how these cross-border rules will affect the assessment costs associated
with the “security-based swap dealer” definition and its de minimis exception is related to the
assessment cost analysis described in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 450 but must
also account for certain issues specific to these cross-border rules. While in certain regards those
assessment costs can more readily be estimated than the programmatic effects discussed above,
the assessment costs associated with the cross-border application of the Title VII dealer
requirements will be considerably smaller in significance than those programmatic effects.
The Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release addressed how certain market
participants whose security-based swap activities exceed or are not materially below the de
minimis threshold may be expected to incur assessment costs in connection with the dealer
analysis. 451 In that release we estimated that 166 entities – out of over one thousand U.S. and
non-U.S. entities that engaged in single-name CDS transactions in 2011 – had more than $2
billion in single-name CDS transactions over the previous 12 months, and as a result would
449

See section VIII, supra.

450

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30731-32.

451

See id. at 30731. These assessment costs include costs associated with analyzing a person’s
security-based swap activities to determine whether those activities constitute dealing activity and
the costs of monitoring the volume of dealing activity against the de minimis threshold.

178

engage in the dealer analysis. 452 Based on those numbers, and assuming that that all of those
entities retain outside counsel to analyze their status under the security-based swap dealer
definition, including the de minimis exception, we estimated that the legal costs associated with
assessing market participants’ potential status as security-based swap dealers may approach $4.2
million.453
Application of these cross-border rules to the de minimis exception can be expected to
affect the assessment costs that market participants will incur. In part, certain non-U.S. persons
may be expected to incur personnel costs and legal costs – beyond the legal costs addressed as
part of the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release – associated with analyzing these crossborder rules and developing systems and procedures to assess which transactions would have to
be counted against the de minimis thresholds (or with the purpose of avoiding activities within
the United States that would be sufficient to meet the applicable thresholds). On the other hand,
while certain market participants also would incur additional legal costs associated with the
dealer determination (i.e., the assessment of whether particular activities constitute dealing
activity for purposes of the analysis) addressed in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting
Release, the application of the cross-border rules may reduce the number of entities that incur
such legal costs.

452

Id. at 30731-32. As discussed below, a comparable assessment using 2012 data indicates that
there were approximately 210 entities in the single-name CDS market with more than $2 billion
in transactions over 12 months. That analysis accounts for the aggregation of affiliate activity for
purposes of the de minimis analysis, by first counting individual accounts with more than $2
billion in activity, and then aggregating any remaining accounts to the level of the ultimate parent
and counting those also.

453

See id. We estimated that the per-entity cost of the dealer analysis would be approximately
$25,000. Our estimate of aggregate industry-wide costs of $4.2 million reflected the costs that
may be incurred by all 166 entities. See id.

179

In adopting these rules we estimate the assessment costs that market participants may
incur as a result. As discussed below, however, these costs in practice may be mitigated in large
part by steps that market participants already have taken in response to other regulatory
initiatives, including the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance.
(a) Legal Costs
The implementation of these cross-border rules in some circumstances has the potential
to change the legal costs identified in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, including
by adding new categories of legal costs that non-U.S. persons may incur in connection with
applying the de minimis exception in the cross-border context.
Legal costs related to application of the dealer-trader distinction – As discussed in the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, certain market participants will incur assessment
costs relating to performing the analysis as to whether their security-based swap activities
constitute dealing. For purposes of that release we assumed that only entities with more than $2
billion in security-based swap transactions over the previous 12 months would be likely to
engage in the full dealer analysis, and, based on analysis of single-name CDS data, we concluded
that there were 166 market participants that would meet those criteria. 454
In the cross-border context, we believe that some non-U.S. persons that have more than
$2 billion in total security-based swap transactions over the previous 12 months nonetheless may
be expected to forgo the costs of performing the dealing activity analysis, if only a comparatively
low volume of their security-based swap activity involves U.S. counterparties or otherwise
potentially needs to be counted against the de minimis thresholds. In particular, we believe that

454

See id. at 30731-32. Using an estimate of $25,000 in legal costs per firm, this led to a total
estimate of $4.2 million. See id. at 30732.

180

it is unlikely that non-U.S. persons would engage in the dealer analysis (and hence would not be
likely to incur such legal costs described in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release) if
over the previous 12 months they have less than $2 billion in security-based swap transactions
that potentially would have to be counted against the thresholds. 455
Available data from 2012 indicates that 218 entities worldwide (147 of which are
domiciled in the United States and 71 domiciled elsewhere) had security-based swap activity,
with all counterparties, of $2 billion or more. Of those 218 entities 202 had total activity of $2
billion or more that – to the extent it constituted dealing activity – would appear to have to be
counted against the de minimis thresholds. Those 202 entities consisted of 147 entities
domiciled in the United States (which would have to count all of their dealing transactions), and
55 entities domiciled elsewhere that have $2 billion in transactions with U.S. counterparties or
that otherwise may have to be counted for purposes of the de minimis analysis. 456 To the extent
that all 202 of those entities engage in the legal analysis related to which of their security-based
swap activities constitutes dealing under the dealer-trader distinction (while recognizing that
some such entities may conclude that, based on the nature of their business, they engage in
dealing activities and that no such additional analysis is necessary), and assuming that such

455

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31141.

456

A total of 16 of those 71 entities that are not domiciled in the United States appear to have less
than $2 billion in activity that involve U.S. counterparties or that otherwise would appear to
potentially have to be counted against the de minimis thresholds.

181

analyses amount to $30,000 per entity, 457 those 202 entities would incur a total of approximately
$6.1 million in such legal costs. 458
Legal costs related to systems and analysis – As noted above, out of the 218 entities that
had total security-based swap activity of $2 billion or more in 2012, 71 are domiciled outside of
the United States. Upon further consideration (and in addition to the estimates in the CrossBorder Proposing Release), we also believe that it is reasonable to conclude that those 71 entities
may have to incur one-time legal expenses related to the development of systems and analysis
expenses – discussed below – to identify which of their total security-based swap transactions
potentially must be counted for purposes of the de minimis analysis consistent with these crossborder rules. This additional cost estimate reflects the fact that the development of such systems
and procedures must address cross-border rules that require accounting for factors such as
whether an entity’s security-based swaps are subject to guarantees from affiliated U.S. persons,

457

In the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, we estimated that such costs may range from
$20,000 to $30,000. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30732. For
purposes of this analysis, we conservatively are using the upper end of that range.

458

This analysis of data related to potential assessment costs reflects both the activities of individual
DTCC-TIW accounts as well as the activities of transacting agents. The analysis in particular
first considers the number of accounts that have $2 billion or more in annual security-based swap
activity, and then, after removing those particular accounts, considers activity aggregated at the
level of individual transacting agents. This analysis is comparable to the analysis we use to
estimate the potential number of dealers under the final rules. See note 444, supra. This analysis
is distinct from the analogous analysis we used in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release
to estimate the number of entities that may be expected to perform the dealer-trader analysis (see
notes 149 through 151 and accompanying text, supra), which focuses on activity at the transacting
agent level, because further experience with the associated data permits us to conduct a more
granular analysis of that data. See generally Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31137
n.1407.
These estimates do not reflect a new category of costs arising from the cross-border rules. They
instead are a revision of a category of previously identified costs that market participants may
incur in engaging in the dealer-trader analysis, using newer data and reflecting only trades that are
counted under the final cross-border rules.

182

and whether its counterparties are U.S. persons. 459 We estimate that such legal costs would
amount to approximately $30,400 per entity, and that those 60 entities would incur total costs of
approximately $2.2 million. 460
(b) Costs related to Systems, Analysis, and Representations
Transaction-monitoring systems – The elements introduced by the final cross-border
rules may cause certain non-U.S. persons to implement systems to identify whether their dealing
transactions exceed the de minimis thresholds. 461 Such systems may reflect the need for nonU.S. persons to: (i) identify whether their dealing counterparties are “U.S. persons”; (ii)
determine whether their dealing transactions with a U.S. person constitutes “transactions
conducted through a foreign branch” (which itself requires consideration of whether their
counterparty is a “foreign branch”) and – of those – determine which transactions involve a
foreign branch of a U.S. bank that itself is registered as a security-based swap dealer; (iii)
determine whether particular transactions are subject to a recourse guarantee against a U.S.
459

We would not expect U.S. persons with more than $2 billion in activities to incur such costs,
given that U.S. persons would need to count all of their dealing activities against the de minimis
thresholds.

460

This estimate of $30,400 reflects an assumption that such efforts would require 80 hours of inhouse legal or compliance staff’s time. Based upon data from SIFMA’s Management &
Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2012 (modified by the Commission staff to
account for an 1800-hour-work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size,
employee benefits, and overhead), the staff estimates that the average national hourly rate for an
in-house attorney is $380.

461

It is possible that a subset of non-U.S. dealers may reasonably conclude they are above the de
minimis thresholds and should register with the Commission as security-based swap dealers,
without establishing systems to analyze their status under the exception, in light of the nature of
their operations and their activity within the United States.
Moreover, in considering the assessment costs associated with the final rules, we continue to hold
the expectation, noted in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, that market participants
generally would be aware of the notional amount of their activity involving security-based swaps
as a matter of good business practice. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at
30732. These systems cost estimates for non-U.S. persons are provided in recognition of the fact
that non-U.S. persons will likely need to distinguish those transactions that must be counted
against their de minimis thresholds and those that do not need to be included.

183

affiliate; (iv) evaluate the applicability of the aggregation principles; and (v) evaluate the
availability of the exception for cleared anonymous transactions. 462
In general, we believe that the costs of such systems should be similar to the costs
estimated in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release for a system to monitor positions for
purposes of the major security-based swap participant thresholds. In both cases –the assessment
of dealer status in the cross-border context and the assessment of major participant status – such
systems would have to flag a person’s security-based swaps against the specific criteria
embedded in the final rules, and then compare the cumulative amount of security-based swaps
that meet those criteria against regulatory thresholds. 463 Based on the methodology set forth in
the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release related to systems associated with the major
participant analysis, we estimate that such systems would be associated with one-time
programming costs of $14,904 and ongoing annual systems costs of $16,612 per entity. 464

462

In considering the assessment costs associated with the final rules, we believe that a potential
dealer assessment of whether it is a “conduit affiliate” would not require the use of any systems.
A conduit affiliate must count all of its dealing transactions, making transaction-specific tracking
unnecessary. Moreover, the question of whether a person acts as a conduit affiliate would turn
upon whether it engages in certain security-based transactions on behalf of a U.S. affiliate,
accompanied by back-to-back transactions with that affiliate. That analysis fundamentally is
different from the transaction-specific assessments that are more likely to require the
development of new systems for monitoring the attributes of particular transactions.

463

As discussed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, we would expect that market participants
would be aware of the notional amount of their security-based swap activity as a matter of good
business practice. See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31140.

464

In the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, we estimated that the one-time programming
costs of $13,692 per entity and annual ongoing assessment costs of $15,268. See Intermediary
Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30734-35 and accompanying text (providing an
explanation of the methodology used to estimate these costs). The hourly cost figures in the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release for the positions of Compliance Attorney,
Compliance Manager, Programmer Analyst, and Senior Internal Auditor were based on data from
SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2010.
For purposes of the cost estimates in this release, we have updated these figures with more recent
data as follows: the figure for a Compliance Attorney is $334/hour, the figure for a Compliance
Manager is $283/hour, the figure for a Programmer Analyst is $220/hour, and the figure for a

184

Analysis of counterparty status, including representations – Non-U.S. market participants
also would be likely to incur costs arising from the need to assess the potential U.S.-person status
of their counterparties, and in some cases to obtain and maintain records related to
representations regarding their counterparties’ U.S.-person status. 465 We anticipate that non-U.S.
persons are likely to review existing information (e.g., information already available in
connection with account opening materials and “know your customer” practices) to assess
whether their counterparties are U.S. persons. Non-U.S. persons at times may also request and
maintain representations from their counterparties to help determine or confirm their
Senior Internal Auditor is $209/hour, each from SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings
in the Securities Industry 2013, modified by SEC staff to account for an 1800-hour work-year and
multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead. We also
have updated the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release’s $464/hour figure for a Chief
Financial Officer, which was based on 2011 data, with a revised figure of $500/hour, for a Chief
Financial Officer with five years of experience in New York, that is from http://
www.payscale.com, modified by Commission staff to account for an 1800-hour work-year and
multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead. See http://
www.payscale.com (last visited Apr. 16, 2014). Incorporating these new cost figures, the
updated one-time programming costs based upon our assumptions regarding the number of hours
required in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release would be $15,287 per entity, i.e.,
(Compliance Attorney at $334 per hour for 2 hours) + (Compliance Manager at $283 per hour for
8 hours) + (Programmer Analyst at $220 per hour for 40 hours) + (Senior Internal Auditor at
$209 per hour for 8 hours) + (Chief Financial Officer at $500 per hour for 3 hours) = $14,904,
and the annual ongoing costs would be $16,612 per entity, i.e., ((Senior Internal Auditor at $209
per hour for 16 hours) + Compliance Attorney at $334 per hour for 4 hours) + (Compliance
Manager at $283 per hour for 4 hours) + (Chief Financial Officer at $500 per hour for 4 hours) +
(Programmer Analyst at $220 per hour for 40 hours) = $16,612).
465

Non-U.S. market participants potentially may also assess and seek representations related to
whether their security-based swap activity with a particular counterparty constitutes transactions
conducted through a foreign branch of a U.S. bank (including representations regarding the noninvolvement of U.S. personnel) that is registered as a security-based swap dealer. Based on our
understanding of changes in the way major U.S. dealers engage with non-U.S. counterparties in
the single-name CDS market following the issuance of the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, we
believe that few, if any, U.S. persons currently may participate in this market through their
foreign branches. Also, as noted above, other regulatory provisions may limit the ability of U.S.
banks to conduct security-based swap activity. See note 366, supra. Accordingly, we do not
believe that it is likely that non-U.S. market participants will independently assess, and seek
representations related to, the foreign branch status of their counterparties. Instead, we believe
that it is likely that such non-U.S. persons will focus on assessing the U.S.-person status of the
bank for which the foreign branch is a part.

185

counterparties’ status. Accordingly, in our view, such assessment costs primarily would
encompass one-time costs to review and assess existing information regarding counterparty
domicile, principal place of business, and other factors relevant to potential U.S.-person status, as
well as one-time costs associated with requesting and collecting representations from
counterparties. 466 The Commission believes that such one-time costs would be approximately
$732 thousand per firm. 467
466

We expect that an assessment of whether a particular counterparty is a U.S. person – once
properly made – generally will not vary over time, given that the components of the “U.S.
person” definition generally would not be expected to vary for a particular counterparty absent
changes such as a corporate reorganization, restructuring or merger. With that said, we believe
market participants will likely monitor for the presence of information that may indicate that the
representations they have received in connection with a person’s U.S.-person status are outdated
or otherwise are no longer accurate (e.g., information regarding a counterparty’s reorganization,
restructuring, or merger).
We also believe that such non-U.S. persons will likely obtain the relevant information regarding
the U.S.-person status of their new accounts as part of the account opening process, as a result of
these and other regulatory requirements.

467

In part, this estimate is based on each firm incurring an estimated one-half hour compliance staff
time and one-half hour of legal staff time – per counterparty of the firm – to review and assess
information regarding the counterparty, and potentially to request and obtain representations
regarding the U.S.-person status of their counterparties. These are in addition to the assessment
cost estimates we made in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, and reflect further consideration
of the issue in light of industry experience in connection with the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance.
For these purposes, we conservatively assume that each of those non U.S. firms will have 2400
single-name CDS counterparties (based on data indicating that the 60 non-U.S. persons with total
single-name CDS transactions in 2012 of $2 billion or less all had fewer than 2400 counterparties
in connection with single-name CDS), which produces an estimate of 1200 hours of compliance
staff time and 1200 hours of legal staff time per firm. Based upon data from SIFMA’s
Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013 (modified by the
Commission staff to account for an 1800-hour-work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for
bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead), the staff estimates that the average national
hourly rate for a senior compliance examiner is $217 and that the average national hourly rate for
an in-house attorney is $380; this leads to a cumulative estimate of approximately $716 thousand
per firm for such costs.
Consistent with the Cross-Border Proposing Release, moreover, this estimate is further based on
estimated 40 hours of in-house legal or compliance staff’s time (based on the above rate of $380
per hour for an in-house attorney) to establish a procedure of requesting and collecting
representations from trading counterparties, taking into account that such representation may be
incorporated into standardized trading documentation used by market participants. This leads to
an estimate of $15,200 per firm for such costs.

186

Monitoring of counterparty status – In addition, market participants may be expected to
adapt the systems described above to monitor the status of their counterparties for purposes of
their future security-based swap activities. Such refinements would permit these systems to
maintain records of counterparty status for purposes of conducting the de minimis assessments
(e.g., representations regarding a counterparty’s U.S.-person status, or whether a counterparty’s
transaction through a foreign branch involve U.S. personnel), such as by monitoring for the
presence of existing representations, to obviate the need to request representations on a
transaction-by-transaction basis. 468 Market participants also may need to monitor for the
presence of information that may indicate that the representation they have received are outdated
or otherwise are not valid. 469 We estimate that this would require one-time costs of
approximately $12,436 per firm. 470

468

The exclusion for a non-U.S. person’s dealing transactions conducted through the foreign branch
of a counterparty that is a registered security-based swap dealer is predicated on U.S.-based
personnel of the counterparty not being involved in arranging, negotiating or executing the
transaction at issue. Notwithstanding the potentially transaction-specific nature of that
assessment, we believe that parties may structure their relationships in such a way that the nonU.S. person may rely on general representations by its counterparty, without the need for a
separate representation in conjunction with each individual transaction.

469

It is possible that the need to monitor for information inconsistent with existing representations
would be more significant in the context of representations regarding whether a transaction has
been conducted through a foreign branch of a U.S. bank, than they would be in the context of
representations regarding the U.S.-person status of a counterparty. This is because a
counterparty’s potential status as a U.S. person would not be expected to vary on a transactionby-transaction basis. At the same time, we believe that few, if any, U.S. persons currently may
participate in this market through their foreign branches. See note 465, supra.

470

In part, this is based on an estimate of the time required for a programmer analyst to modify the
software to track whether the counterparty is a U.S. person (including whether it is a foreign
branch of a U.S. bank that is not registered as a security-based swap dealer), and to record and
classify whether a transaction constitutes dealing activity conducted through a foreign branch of a
registered dealer This includes time associated with consultation with internal personnel, and an
estimate of the time such personnel would require to ensure that these modifications conformed to
those aspects of the final rule. Using the estimated hourly costs described above, we estimate the
costs as follows: (Compliance Attorney at $334 per hour for 2 hours) + (Compliance Manager at
$283 per hour for 4 hours) + (Programmer Analyst at $220 per hour for 40 hours) + (Senior

187

Summary of system, analysis and representation costs – In sum, we estimate that the
costs that certain non-U.S. market participants would incur in connection with systems, analysis
of counterparty status and representations in connection with these cross-border rules would be
approximately $759 thousand in one-time costs, 471 and their estimated annual ongoing costs
would be $16,612. The available data provided by the DTCC-TIW, subject to the limitations
associated with the use of data analysis discussed above, suggests that such costs may be
incurred by 71 non-U.S. domiciled entities with total annual activity of at least $2 billion.
Assuming that each of these 71 entities concludes it has a need to monitor the above categories
of information in connection with its security-based swap activities, we estimate that the total
one-time industry-wide costs associated with establishing such systems would amount to
approximately $54 million, and total annual ongoing costs would amount to approximately $1.2
million.
(c) Overall Considerations Related to Assessment Costs
In sum, we believe that the effect of these final cross-border rules would be an increase
over the amounts that otherwise would be incurred by certain non-U.S. market participants, both
in terms of additional categories of legal costs and in terms of the need to develop certain
systems and procedures.
Internal Auditor at $209 per hour for 4 hours) + (Chief Financial Officer at $500 per hour for 2
hours) = $12,436. See note 464, supra (for source of the estimated per-hour costs).
As noted above, we generally would not expect a counterparty’s U.S.-person status to vary over
time absent changes such as reorganization, restructuring or merger. See note 466, supra.
471

Consistent with the above discussion, the estimated one-time costs of $759 thousand represent:
the costs to establish a system to assess the status of their dealing activities under the definitions
and other provisions specific to these cross-border rules ($14,904); the costs related to the
assessment of counterparty status, including costs of assessing existing information and of
requesting and obtaining representations, as well as costs of related procedures ($732 thousand),
and the costs for monitoring the status of their counterparties for purposes of their future securitybased swap activities ($12,436).

188

Requiring certain non-U.S. persons to incur such assessment costs is an unavoidable
adjunct to the implementation of a set of rules that are appropriately tailored to apply the
“security-based swap dealer” definition under Title VII to a global security-based swap market in
a way that yields the important transparency, accountability, and counterparty protection benefits
associated with dealer regulation under Title VII. The alternative – avoiding application of the
Title VII dealer requirements to non-U.S. persons – would be inappropriate because, in our view,
the dealing activity of non-U.S. persons required to count their dealing activity under these final
rules constitutes part of the U.S. financial system. The benefits that arise from Title VII
regulatory requirements, including risk management and transparency benefits associated with
dealer regulation accordingly could be undermined if a significant portion of U.S. dealing
activity by non-U.S. persons were excluded from the Title VII framework. In certain respects,
however, decisions embedded in these final rules are designed to avoid imposing assessment
costs upon market participants. 472
It is important to recognize that our estimates of the assessment costs associated with
these rules in practice may tend to overestimate that costs that market participants actually will
incur as a result of these rules. This is because in practice, the assessment costs associated with
the cross-border scope of the dealer definition (like the potential programmatic effects of that
cross-border scope) may be tempered to the extent that the assessments that market participants
conduct in connection with their security-based swap activities correspond to the assessments
they otherwise would follow due to other regulatory requirements or business practices.
Significantly, we understand that a substantial number of market participants already have
472

For example, the final rules incorporate an express representation provision in the “U.S. person”
definition, to help the parties best positioned to make the U.S.-person determination and convey
the results of that analysis to its counterparty. See section IV.C.4, supra.

189

engaged in assessment activities – including activities to determine whether their counterparties
are U.S. persons – conforming to the requirements applicable to swaps. Given our expectation
that persons that are not “U.S. persons” under the CFTC’s policy (as set forth in its cross-border
guidance) generally also would not be “U.S. persons” under our rules, certain market participants
may reasonably determine that as part of the implementation of the rules we are adopting today
they need not duplicate work already done in connection with implementing the CFTC’s swaps
regulations. In this regard we recognize the significance of commenter views emphasizing the
importance of harmonization with the CFTC to control the costs associated with assessments
under Title VII. 473 We acknowledge that, to the extent our final rules differ from the CFTC’s
approach – especially if they were to require counting of transactions that would not be captured
by the requirements applicable to swaps in the cross-border context, or were to require the
collection and/or consideration of information that is materially different from that collected
under the CFTC’s approach – market participants may face higher costs than if regulations were
identical. 474 As discussed in connection with the specific aspects of these rules, however, we
believe that such differences are justified, as are any associated assessment (or programmatic)
costs.
Finally, we also anticipate that certain market participants that wish to limit the
possibility of being regulated as a dealer under Title VII, including the programmatic and
assessment costs associated with the dealer definition, may choose to structure their business to
473

For example, one commenter urged the Commission to exempt from the definition of U.S. person
collective investment vehicles that are publicly offered only to non-U.S. persons, consistent with
the CFTC’s interpretation, on account of the costs that would be required for collective
investment vehicles that transact in both swaps and security-based swaps to develop separate
compliance systems and operations for swaps and security-based swaps.

474

In this regard we also note that in certain areas the Commission has taken an approach that is
narrower than the CFTC analogue.

190

avoid engaging in dealing transactions with U.S. persons (other than foreign branches of banks
registered with the Commission as dealers).
3. Alternative Approaches
As discussed above, the final rules incorporate a number of provisions designed to focus
Title VII dealer regulation upon those persons that engage in the performance of security-based
swap dealing activity within the United States in excess of the de minimis thresholds, taking into
account the mitigation of risks to U.S. persons and potentially to the U.S. financial markets, as
well as other purposes of Title VII.
In adopting these final rules we have considered alternative approaches suggested by
commenters, including the economic effects of following such alternative approaches. In
considering the economic impact of potential alternatives, we have sought to isolate the
individual alternatives to the extent practicable, while recognizing that many of those alternatives
are not mutually exclusive.
We further have considered such potential alternatives in light of the methodologies
discussed above, by assessing the extent to which following particular alternatives would be
expected to increase or decrease the number of entities that ultimately would be expected to be
regulated as dealers under the final rules, as well as the corresponding economic impact. As
discussed below, however, analysis of the available data standing alone would tend to suggest
that various alternative approaches suggested by commenters would not produce large changes in
the numbers of market participants that may have to be regulated as security-based swap dealers.
These results are subject to the above limitations, however, including limitations regarding the
ability to quantitatively assess how market participants may adjust their future activities in
response to the rules we adopt or for independent reasons. Accordingly, while such analyses

191

provide some context regarding alternatives, their use as tools for illustrating the economic
effects of such alternatives is limited.
(a) Dealing Activity by Foreign Branches of U.S. Banks
The final rules require U.S. banks to count all dealing transactions of their foreign
branches against the de minimis thresholds, even when the counterparty is a non-U.S. person or
another foreign branch of a U.S. person. Certain commenters to the rules addressed in the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release had expressed the view that such transactions by
foreign branches should not have to count their dealing transactions involving non-U.S.
persons. 475 For the reasons discussed above, we believe that it is appropriate for the analysis to
include dealing transactions conducted through foreign branches to the same extent as other
dealing transactions by U.S. persons. 476
Adopting such an alternative approach potentially could provide market participants that
are U.S. persons with incentives to execute higher volumes through their foreign branches. Such
an outcome may be expected in part to reduce the programmatic and assessment costs associated
with dealer regulation under Title VII. Such an outcome also would be expected to reduce the
programmatic benefits associated with dealer regulation, given that those U.S. banks (and
potentially the U.S. financial system) would incur risks via their foreign branches equivalent to
the risk that might arise from transactions of U.S. banks that are not conducted through foreign

475

See note 181, supra, and accompanying text. This issue – regarding whether a foreign branch of a
U.S. bank should count all of its dealing activity against the de minimis thresholds – is distinct
from the issue regarding the extent to which a non-U.S. person should count its dealing activity
involving a foreign branch of a U.S. bank as a counterparty. That latter issue is addressed below.
See section IV.I.3(d), supra.

476

See section IV.B, supra.

192

branches, but without the additional oversight (including risk mitigation requirements such as
capital and margin requirements) that comes from regulation as a dealer.
Using the 2012 data to assess the impact associated with this alternative does not indicate
a change to our conservative estimate that up to 50 entities potentially would register as securitybased swap dealers. 477 This assessment, as well as the other assessments of alternatives
discussed below, is subject to the limitations discussed above, including limitations regarding the
ability to assess how market participants would change their activities in response to the final
rules.
(b) Dealing Activity by Guaranteed Affiliates of U.S. Persons
The final rules require a non-U.S. person to count, against the de minimis thresholds,
dealing transactions for which the non-U.S. person’s performance in connection with the
transaction is subject to a recourse guarantee against a U.S. affiliate of the non-U.S. person.
Although the proposal instead would have treated such guaranteed affiliates like any other nonU.S. persons, we believe that this provision is appropriate for the reasons discussed above,

477

The DTCC-TIW data permits us to separately consider dealing activity involving accounts of
foreign branches of U.S. banks from other accounts of U.S.-domiciled persons. As a result, it is
possible to consider the potential impact of a requirement under which – in contrast to the final
rules – dealing activity conducted through a foreign branch only needs to be counted against the
thresholds when the counterparty is a U.S.-domiciled person. Under such an alternative
approach, the U.S. person would not have to count dealing transactions in which the counterparty
is a non-U.S. person or another foreign branch of a U.S. bank.
As discussed above, current data indicates that there are 27 market participants that have three or
more counterparties that are not recognized as dealers by ISDA, and that have $3 billion or more
in notional single-name CDS transactions over a 12 month period. Screening those entities
against a cross-border test that is identical to the one we are adopting, except that it does not
count foreign branches of U.S. banks as U.S. persons, leads to an estimate of 25 market entities
that have $3 billion or more in activity that must be counted against the thresholds (rather than the
26 estimated in connection with the test we are adopting). That difference does not appear to
warrant a change in the conservative estimate that up to 50 entities may register as security-based
swap dealers.

193

including that such recourse guarantees pose risks to U.S. persons and potentially to the U.S.
financial system via the U.S. guarantor.
This aspect of the final rules reflects a middle ground between commenter views, given
that some commenters opposed any consideration of guarantees as part of the dealer analysis,
while others expressed the view that all affiliates of a U.S. person should be assumed to be the
beneficiary of a de facto guarantee from the U.S. person and, absent a showing otherwise, should
have to count all of their dealing activity against the thresholds. 478 This diversity of commenter
views suggests a range of potential alternatives to the final rules – including one alternative in
which the final rules do not address guarantees at all, as well as alternatives in which (based on
the concept of a de facto guarantee) all affiliates of a U.S. person, or at least all affiliates within a
U.S.-based holding company structure, should have to count their dealing activity against the
thresholds (with a potential exception if they demonstrate to the market that there will be no
guarantee). For the reasons discussed above, we believe that the approach taken by the final
rules is appropriate. 479
Following such alternative approaches could be expected to lead to disparate economic
effects depending on which approach is followed. On the one hand, an approach that does not
require counting against the thresholds of a non-U.S. person’s transactions with non-U.S.
counterparties that are guaranteed by their U.S. affiliates would help provide incentives for
greater use of guarantees by U.S. persons, with an increase of the associated risk flowing to the
United States. 480 On the other hand, an approach that requires the conditional or unconditional

478

See note 310, supra.

479

See section IV.E.1(b), supra.

480

In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, we expressed the preliminary view that dealer regulation
of such persons would not materially increase the programmatic benefits of the dealer registration

194

counting of transactions by all affiliates of U.S. persons could provide incentives for certain nonU.S. holding companies to limit or eliminate relationships with U.S.-based affiliates, even if
these affiliates perform functions unrelated to security-based swap activity. Additionally, a more
limited approach that requires counting by non-U.S. subsidiaries of U.S. holding companies
could reduce liquidity in the security-based swap market even if such a subsidiary’s participation
does not depend on the financial position or backing of its parent.
Data assessment of the first alternative does not indicate a change to our estimate that up
to 50 entities may be expected to register with the Commission as security-based swap
dealers. 481 The available data does not permit us to assess the other approaches, whereby all
affiliates within a U.S.-based holding company, or all affiliates of any U.S. person generally,
should have to count their dealing activity against the thresholds. 482

requirement, and that such an approach would impose programmatic costs without a
corresponding increase in programmatic benefits to the U.S. security-based swap market. See
Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31146-47. For the reasons discussed above, we have
reached a different conclusion in conjunction with these final rules. See section IV.E.1(b), supra.
481

Although the data available to the Commission includes data regarding transactions of non-U.S.
persons that are guaranteed by their U.S. affiliates, the data does not allow us to identify which
individual transactions of those non-U.S. persons are subject to guarantees by their U.S. affiliates,
or to distinguish the guaranteed and non-guaranteed transactions of such non-U.S. persons. As a
result, the assessment of the final rule presumed that all transactions of foreign subsidiaries of
U.S. persons for which we have data available constitute guaranteed transactions.
Screening the 27 market participants that have three or more counterparties that are not
recognized as dealers by ISDA, and that have $3 billion or more in notional single-name CDS
transactions over a 12 month period, with a revised de minimis test that does not include any
transactions with non-U.S. person counterparties entered into by a foreign subsidiary of a U.S.
person produces 26 entities that would have more than $3 billion in notional transactions over 12
months counted against the threshold – a number that is identical to the number associated with
the test we are adopting.

482

The available data does not include information about the single-name security-based swap
transactions of non-U.S. domiciled persons (including non-U.S. affiliates of U.S.-domiciled
persons) for single-name CDS involving a non-U.S. reference entity.

195

(c) Dealing by Conduit Affiliates
The final rules require that conduit affiliates of U.S. persons count all of their dealing
transactions against the de minimis thresholds. The available data does not permit us to identify
which market participants currently engage in security-based swap dealing activity on behalf of
U.S. affiliates, and hence would be deemed to be conduit affiliates. Accordingly, we are limited
in our ability to quantify the economic impact of this anti-evasion provision.
The economic effects of not including these provisions – and instead treating conduit
affiliates the same as other non-U.S. persons – has the potential to be significant, as it would
remove a tool that should help to deter market participants from seeking to evade dealer
regulation through arrangements whereby U.S. persons effectively engage in dealing activity
with non-U.S. persons via back-to-back transactions involving non-U.S. affiliates. 483 Following
that alternative thus may partially impair the effective functioning of the Title VII dealer
requirements, and lead risk and liquidity to concentrate outside of the U.S. market.
Another potential alternative approach to addressing such evasive activity could be to
narrow the inter-affiliate exception to having to count dealing transactions against the de minimis
thresholds, such as by making the exception unavailable when non-U.S. persons transact with
their U.S. affiliates. Such an alternative approach may be expected to reduce the ability of
corporate groups to use central market-facing entities to facilitate the group’s security-based
swap activities, and as such may increase the costs faced by such entities (e.g., by requiring
additional entities to directly face the market and hence negotiate master agreements with dealers
and other counterparties). We believe that the more targeted approach of incorporating the

483

See note 314, supra, and accompanying text.

196

conduit affiliate concept would achieve comparable anti-evasion purposes with less cost and
disruption.
(d) Dealing Activity by Non-U.S. Counterparties with Foreign Branches of U.S.
Banks and Certain Other Counterparties
The final rules require non-U.S. persons to count, against the thresholds, their dealing
transactions involving counterparties that are foreign branches of U.S. banks unless the U.S.
bank is registered as a security-based swap dealer and unless no U.S.-based personnel of the
counterparty are involved in arranging, negotiating and executing the transaction. This reflects a
change from the proposal, which would have excluded all such transactions with a foreign
branch regardless of whether the U.S. bank was registered as a dealer. The change appropriately
takes into consideration the benefits of having relevant Title VII provisions applicable to dealers
apply to the transaction against the liquidity and disparate treatment rationales underlying the
exclusion. 484
This aspect of the final rules reflects a middle ground between commenter views
regarding transactions with foreign branches, given that some commenters expressed the view
that all transactions with foreign branches should be counted against a non-U.S. person’s de
minimis threshold, while another commenter took the view that no such transaction should be
counted. 485 This suggests at least two possible alternatives to the final rule – one in which all
transactions with foreign branches are excluded from being counted against the thresholds, and
one in which all transactions with foreign branches are counted against the thresholds (just like
other transactions with U.S. person counterparties).

484

See note 370, supra, and accompanying text.

485

See notes 359 through 361, supra, and accompanying text.

197

The effect of adopting the first alternative – whereby all transactions with foreign
branches are excluded from being counted – could provide U.S. market participants that are not
registered as dealers with incentives to execute higher volumes of security-based swaps through
their foreign branches, resulting in higher amounts of risk being transmitted to the United States
without the risk-mitigating attributes of having a registered dealer involved in the transaction. 486
Adopting the second alternative – whereby all of a non-U.S. person’s transactions with foreign
branches are counted regardless of the registration status of the U.S. counterparty – would raise
the potential for disparate impacts upon U.S. persons trading with foreign branches, along with
associated concerns about liquidity impacts.
The available data allows for estimates related to both potential alternatives subject to the
limitations discussed above, and neither alternative would be expected to indicate a change to
our assessment that up to 50 entities may be expected to register with the Commission as
security-based swap dealers. 487
The final rules also incorporate definitions of “foreign branch” and “transaction
conducted through a foreign branch” that potentially could be modified to reflect alternative
approaches. While we do not believe that the economic impact of following such alternatives is
readily quantifiable given the available data, we generally believe that any such effects would be
486

In practice, based on our understanding of changes in the way major U.S. dealers engage with
non-U.S. counterparties in the single-name CDS market following the issuance of the CFTC
Cross-Border Guidance, we believe that few, if any, U.S. persons currently may participate in the
single-name CDS market through their foreign branches. Also, as noted above, we recognize that
other regulatory provisions may limit the ability of U.S. banks to conduct security-based swap
activities. See note 366, supra.

487

Screening the 27 market participants that have three or more counterparties that are not
recognized as dealers by ISDA, and that have $3 billion or more in notional single-name CDS
transactions over a 12 month period, with the two revised de minimis tests addressed above
produces 26 entities that would have more than $3 billion in notional transactions over 12 months
counted against the threshold – a number identical to the number associated with the test we are
adopting.

198

limited, particularly in light of our understanding that few, if any, U.S. persons currently may
participate in the single-name CDS market through their foreign branches.
Separately, the final rules do not require non-U.S. persons to count their dealing
transactions with non-U.S. counterparties. Potential alternatives to that approach could be to
require non-U.S. persons to count their dealing transactions with counterparties that are
guaranteed affiliates of U.S. persons (at least with regard to transactions subject to the
guarantees), or their dealing transactions with counterparties that are conduit affiliates. 488 The
alternative approach of requiring non-U.S. persons to count dealing transactions with either or
both of those types of non-U.S. counterparties potentially would increase the programmatic
benefits associated with Title VII dealer regulation, by applying the risk mitigating aspects of
dealer regulation (such as capital and margin requirements) to the dealer counterparties of
persons whose security-based swap activities directly affect the United States, while recognizing
that such risk mitigating benefits would be more attenuated than those that are associated with
the final rules’ approach of directly counting dealing transactions of such guaranteed and conduit
affiliates. On the other hand, requiring non-U.S. persons to count such transactions would be
expected to increase assessment costs by requiring such persons to evaluate and track whether
their non-U.S. counterparties are guaranteed or conduit affiliates. Also, to the extent such an
alternative approach causes non-U.S. dealers to avoid entering into transactions with affiliates of
U.S. persons to avoid the need to conduct such assessments, the approach could reduce the

488

For the reasons discussed above, we do not believe that it is necessary to require non-U.S.
persons to count their dealing transactions with such non-U.S. counterparties. See section IV.E.2,
supra.
Also, as discussed above, we anticipate soliciting additional public comment regarding counting
of dealing transactions between two non-U.S. persons towards the de minimis exception when
activities related to the transaction occur in the United States. See section I.A, supra.

199

liquidity available to corporate groups with U.S. affiliates, and further could provide an incentive
for such corporate groups to move their security-based swap activity entirely outside the United
States (which could impair the transparency goals of Title VII).
As we discussed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, another potential approach
related to the treatment of non-U.S. persons’ dealing activities would be to not require the
registration of non-U.S. persons that engage in dealing activity with U.S. person counterparties
through an affiliated U.S. person intermediary. 489 In our view, such an approach would reduce
the programmatic benefits associated with dealer regulation under Title VII, and would raise
particular concerns related to financial responsibility and counterparty risk, as well as create risk
to U.S. persons and potentially to the U.S. financial system.
(e) “U.S. Person” Definition
The “U.S. person” definition used by the final rules seeks to identify those persons for
whom it is reasonable to infer that a significant portion of their financial and legal relationships
are likely to exist within the United States and for whom it is therefore reasonable to conclude
that risks arising from their security-based swap activities could manifest themselves within the
United States, regardless of location of their counterparties. Because the definition incorporates
decisions regarding a range of issues, the definition potentially is associated with a number of
alternative approaches that could influence the final rules’ economic impact. 490
A particularly significant element of this definition addresses the treatment of investment
vehicles. Under the final rule, a fund is a “U.S. person” if the vehicle is organized, incorporated

489

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31146.

490

The issues regarding the treatment of foreign branches of U.S. banks – as potential dealers or as
counterparties to non-U.S. persons that engage in dealing activity – that are addressed above also
implicate the status of those foreign branches as “U.S. persons.”

200

or established within the United States, or if its principal place of business is in the United States,
which we are interpreting to mean that the primary locus of the investment vehicle’s day-to-day
operations is within the United States. One potential alternative approach to this element would
be to make use of a narrower definition that does not use a principal place of business test for
investment vehicles, and hence does not encompass vehicles that are not established,
incorporated, or organized within the United States, even if the primary locus of their day-to-day
operations is located here. Another potential approach would be to focus the meaning of
“principal place of business” on the location where the operational management activities of the
fund are carried out, without regard to the location of the fund’s managers.
Similarly, another potential alternative approach to the “U.S. person” definition would be
for the definition not to incorporate a principal place of business test for operating companies.
Under such an alternative approach, an operating company would not fall within the “U.S.
person” definition if it is not organized, incorporated or established within the United States,
even if the officers or directors who direct, control and coordinate the operating company’s
overall business activities are located in the United States.
Following an alternative approach whereby the “U.S. person” definition did not
encompass a “principal place of business” test, or whereby the definition followed a narrower
such test with regard to particular types of market participants, may be expected to reduce the
programmatic costs and benefits associated with dealer regulation, in that it may lead certain
non-U.S. persons not to have to register as dealers notwithstanding dealing activities with such
counterparties above the de minimis thresholds. Such an alternative approach also may promote
market participants’ use of such counterparties that are closely linked to the United States but
that are not organized, incorporated or established within the United States, or that do not have

201

operational management activities within the United States, in lieu of entering into securitybased swaps with U.S. persons. While such an approach may be expected to reduce
programmatic costs, it also would reduce the programmatic risk mitigation and other benefits of
dealer regulation under Title VII given that the “principal place of business” test helps to identify
persons for which the risks associated with their security-based swap activities can manifest
themselves within the United States. 491 Such an alternative approach may also be expected to
reduce assessment costs incurred by non-U.S. persons, although such assessment costs in any
event would be reduced by the ability of non-U.S. persons to rely on a counterparty’s
representation that the counterparty is not a U.S. person.
Aside from those issues related to the use of a “principal place of business” test, other
aspects of the “U.S. person” definition also may affect the programmatic costs and benefits and
assessment costs associated with dealer regulation. For example, the final rules do not
encompass funds that are majority-owned by U.S. persons, although two commenters supported
such an approach. 492 Also, the final “U.S. person” definition does not exclude investment
vehicles that are offered publicly only to non-U.S. persons and are not offered to U.S. persons,
although some commenters also supported this type of exclusion. 493
For the reasons detailed above, we believe that including majority-owned funds within
the definition of “U.S. person” would be likely to increase programmatic costs (by causing more
investment funds to be subject to Title VII requirements) as well as assessment costs, while not
significantly increasing programmatic benefits given our view that the composition of a fund’s

Guidance follows such an approach.

202

beneficial owners is not likely to have significant bearing on the degree of risk that the fund’s
security-based swap activity poses to the U.S. financial system. Moreover, for the reasons
discussed above, we also believe that an exclusion for publicly offered funds that are offered
only to non-U.S. persons and not offered to U.S. persons, while likely to reduce programmatic
costs, would also reduce programmatic benefits, by excluding certain funds from the definition
of U.S. person based on factors that we do not believe are directly relevant to the degree of risk a
fund’s security-based swap activities are likely to pose to U.S. persons and potentially to the U.S.
financial system.
Apart from those potential alternatives regarding the treatment of majority-owned funds
and of investment vehicles offered only to non-U.S. persons, an additional alternative approach
would be for the Commission simply to adopt the CFTC’s interpretation of “U.S. person.” We
do not believe that following that alternative approach would be expected to have a significant
effect on programmatic costs and benefits, given the substantive similarities between the CFTC’s
interpretation and our final rule. Adopting such an alternative approach, however, could have an
impact on assessment costs. We particularly are mindful that some commenters requested that
we adopt a consistent definition notwithstanding their views regarding specific features of the
definition, in part because they believed that differences between our definition of “U.S. person”
and the CFTC’s interpretation of that term would significantly increase costs associated with
determining whether they or their counterparties are U.S. persons for purposes of Title VII. We
recognize that differences between the two definitions could lead certain market participants to
incur additional costs that they would not incur in the presence of identical definitions. At the
same time, we are adopting definitions of “U.S. person” and “principal place of business” that
should be relatively simple and straightforward to implement, which should mitigate

203

commenters’ concerns about the costs associated with different approaches to these terms. More
generally, for the reasons discussed above we believe that the definitions we are adopting are the
appropriate definitions for the cross-border implementation of Title VII in the security-based
swap context. 494
In addition, as discussed above, the final “U.S. person” definition does not follow an
approach similar to the one used in Regulation S. 495 Because such an alternative approach would
treat certain foreign branches of U.S. persons as non-U.S. persons, notwithstanding the entitywide nature of the associated risks, following such an approach would be expected to reduce
programmatic benefits by causing Title VII dealer regulation not to apply to certain dealing
activities that occur in the United States and pose direct risks to U.S. persons. Although such an
alternative approach potentially could impact assessment costs, given that certain market
participants may already be familiar with the parameters of such a Regulation S approach, in our
view the “U.S. person” definition we are adopting is more appropriate and simpler than an
approach based on Regulation S.
Another potential alternative approach for addressing the “U.S. person” definition would
be for the definition not to include the exclusion we are adopting with regard to specified
international organizations. The alternative approach of not explicitly excluding such
organizations from the definition could be expected to increase assessment costs – as
counterparties to such organizations would have to consider those organizations’ potential status

494

See section IV.C, supra.

495

See section IV.C.3, supra.

204

as U.S. persons, which would implicate analysis of the privileges and immunities granted such
persons under U.S. law – without likely countervailing programmatic benefits. 496
The available data suggests that an alternative in which offshore funds managed by U.S.
persons are excluded from de minimis calculations by non-U.S. persons would not be expected
to indicate a change to our assessment that up to 50 entities may be expected to register with the
Commission as security-based swap dealers. 497 We do not believe that other alternative
approaches to the “U.S. person” definition are readily susceptible to quantitative analysis that
would illustrate their potential programmatic and assessment effects. 498
(f) Aggregation Requirement
The final rules apply the de minimis exception’s aggregation requirement to cross-border
activities in a way that reflects the same principles that govern when non-U.S. persons must
directly count their dealing activity against the thresholds. The final rules thus have been revised
from the proposal to incorporate other aspects of the way that the final rules require counting of
496

Separately, as discussed above, we do not concur with the view of some commenters that a
person’s dealing activities involving such international organizations as counterparty should be
excluded from having to be counted under the final rules. See section IV.3(e), supra. An
alternative approach that followed those views would reduce the programmatic benefits of dealer
regulation under Title VII, such as by permitting dealers that are U.S. persons to escape dealer
regulation, notwithstanding the risk such U.S. dealers pose to the U.S. market, simply by focusing
their dealing activities toward transactions with such international organizations.

497

Screening the 27 market participants that have three or more counterparties that are not
recognized as dealers by ISDA, and that have $3 billion or more in notional single-name CDS
transactions over a 12 month period, with a revised de minimis test that does not count non-U.S.
persons’ dealing transactions involving offshore funds managed by U.S. persons produces 26
entities that would have more than $3 billion in notional transactions over 12 months counted
against the threshold – a number identical to the number associated with the test we are adopting.

498

We note generally, however, that similarities between the definition of “U.S. person” in the final
rules and the CFTC’s interpretation of that term would help mitigate the assessment costs
associated with the “U.S. person” determination. We do not believe that there are any significant
differences, whereby a person that is a “U.S. person” for purposes of our final rules would
generally not be a “U.S. person” for purposes of the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, that may tend
to increase assessment costs.

205

particular transactions against the thresholds. The final rules further have been modified from
the proposal to remove the proposed “operational independence” condition to the exclusion that
permits a person not to count transactions of its affiliates that are registered as security-based
swap dealers. 499 These rules – like the incorporation of the aggregation requirement as part of
the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release – are intended to avoid evasion of the Title VII
dealer requirements.
The final rules regarding the aggregation provision represent a middle ground between
commenter views. One commenter specifically supported the proposal’s “operational
independence” condition that would limit when a person could exclude the dealing transactions
of affiliates that are registered as dealers. 500 On the other hand, other commenters opposed any
application of the aggregation provisions in the cross-border context (as well as more
generally). 501 This suggests at least two alternatives – one in which the “operational
independence” condition is retained, and one in which the aggregation requirement is further
limited to only require U.S. persons to count dealing activities of affiliated U.S. persons.
The economic impact of retaining the proposed operational independence condition
potentially would reduce efficiencies and deter beneficial group-wide risk management practices.
Conversely, the impact of the alternative approach of further limiting the aggregation
requirement, such that it addresses only affiliated U.S. persons, would facilitate market

499

By removing the proposed “operational independence” condition, the final rule provides that a
person need not count the transactions of its registered dealer affiliate regardless of whether the
person and the registered dealer affiliate are operationally independent.
The final rule also has been revised from the proposal to make the exclusion for registered dealer
affiliates also available when an affiliate is in the process of registering as a dealer.

500

See note 396, supra.

501

See note 391 through 395, supra.

206

participants’ evasion of the dealer regulation requirement by dividing their dealing activity
among multiple non-U.S. entities.
The economic impact of the alternative approach of retaining the “operational
independence” condition is not readily susceptible to quantification, given the lack of data
regarding the extent to which affiliates that engage in security-based swap activities jointly make
use of back office, risk management, sales or trades, or other functions. Analysis of data related
to the alternate approach under which the requirement would be further limited to aggregating
transactions of affiliated U.S. persons would not be expected to indicate a change to our
assessment that up to 50 entities may be expected to register with the Commission as securitybased swap dealers, subject to the limitations discussed above. 502
(g) Exception for Cleared Anonymous Transactions
The final rules include an exception whereby non-U.S. persons need not count, against
the thresholds, transactions that are entered into anonymously and are cleared. This exception
reflects limits on the potential availability of relevant information to non-U.S. persons, as well as
potential impacts on liquidity that may result absent such an exception.
The likely impact of the alternative approach of not including such an exception could be
to deter the development of anonymous trading platforms, or to reduce U.S. persons’ ability to
participate in such platforms. In this regard the alternative can be expected to help reduce the

502

Screening the 27 market participants that have three or more counterparties that are not
recognized as dealers by ISDA, and that have $3 billion or more in notional single-name CDS
transactions over a 12 month period, with a revised de minimis test that limits aggregation to U.S.
affiliates within a corporate group produces 26 entities that would have more than $3 billion in
notional transactions over 12 months counted against the threshold – a number identical to the
number associated with the test we are adopting.

207

programmatic benefits of Title VII. The impact of the alternative approach of not including this
type of exception is not readily susceptible to quantification. 503
V. Cross-Border Application of Major Security-Based Swap Participant Thresholds
A. Overview
The statutory definition of “major security-based swap participant” encompasses persons
that are not dealers but that nonetheless could pose a high degree of risk to the U.S. financial
system. 504 The statutory focus of the “major security-based swap participant” definition differs
from that of the “security-based swap dealer” definition, in that the latter focuses on activity that
may raise the concerns that dealer regulation is intended to address, while the former focuses on
positions that may raise systemic risk concerns within the United States. 505 The definition
focuses on systemic risk issues by targeting persons that maintain “substantial positions” that are
“systemically important,” or whose positions create “substantial counterparty exposure that
could have serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the United States banking system
or financial markets.” 506 The statute further directed us to define the term “substantial position”

503

Based on our understanding of the market, transactions in security-based swaps in general
currently would not be eligible for the exception because transactions currently are not
anonymous.

504

As discussed in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, the major security-based swap
participant definition employs tests incorporating terms – particularly “systemically important,”
“significantly impact the financial system” or “create substantial counterparty exposure” – that
denote a focus on entities that pose a high degree of risk through their security-based swap
activities. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30661 n.761. That
discussion also noted that the link between the major participant definitions and risk was
highlighted during the congressional debate on the statute. See id. (citing 156 Cong. Rec. S5907
(daily ed. July 15, 2010) (citing colloquy between Senators Hagen and Lincoln, discussing how
the goal of the major participant definitions was to “focus on risk factors that contributed to the
recent financial crisis, such as excessive leverage, under-collateralization of swap positions, and a
lack of information about the aggregate size of positions.”)).

505

See section II.B.2(c), supra.

506

See section 3(a)(67) of the Exchange Act. The statute defines a “major security-based swap
participant” as a person that satisfies any one of three alternative statutory tests: a person that

208

at the “threshold that the Commission determines to be prudent for the effective monitoring,
management, and oversight of entities that are systemically important or can significantly impact
the financial system of the United States.” 507
In the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, we, together with the CFTC, adopted
rules defining what constitutes a “substantial position” and “substantial counterparty
exposure.” 508 In doing so, we concentrated on identifying persons whose large security-based
swap positions pose market risks that are significant enough that it is prudent to regulate and
monitor those persons. 509 The definition incorporates a current exposure test and a potential
future exposure test designed to identify such persons. 510
We addressed the application of the major participant definition to cross-border securitybased swaps in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, proposing that a U.S. person consider all
maintains a “substantial position” in swaps or security-based swaps for any of the major swap
categories as determined by the Commission; a person whose outstanding security-based swaps
create substantial counterparty exposure that could have serious adverse effects on the financial
stability of the U.S. banking system or financial markets; or a person that is a “financial entity”
that is “highly leveraged” relative to the amount of capital it holds (and that is not subject to
capital requirements established by an appropriate Federal banking agency) and maintains a
“substantial position” in outstanding security-based swaps in any major category as determined
by the Commission.

510

See id. at 30666 (noting the use of such tests in context of “substantial position” definition); id. at
30682 (noting use of such tests in context of “substantial counterparty exposure” definition). We
also noted that our definition of “substantial position” was intended to address default-related
credit risks, the risk that would be posed by the default of multiple entities close in time, and the
aggregate risks presented by a person’s security-based swap activity, as these considerations
reflect the market risk concerns expressly identified in the statute. We interpreted “substantial
counterparty exposure” in a similar manner, noting the focus of the statutory test on “serious
adverse effects on financial stability or financial markets.” Id. at 30683. Cf. section
3(a)(67)(A)(ii)(II) of the Exchange Act (encompassing as major security-based swap participants
persons “whose outstanding security-based swaps create substantial counterparty exposure that
could have serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the United States banking system
or financial markets”).

209

security-based swap positions entered into by it, and also proposing that a non-U.S. person
consider only its positions with U.S. persons but not its positions with other non-U.S.
counterparties, even if the positions are entered into within the United States or the non-U.S.
counterparties are guaranteed by a U.S. person. 511
In the proposal, we also explained our preliminary view on the application in the crossborder context of the general principles regarding attribution, which were set forth in guidance in
the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release. Specifically, we stated that a person’s securitybased swap positions must be attributed to a parent, affiliate, or guarantor for purposes of the
major security-based swap participant analysis to the extent that the counterparties to those
positions have recourse to that parent, affiliate, or guarantor in connection with the position. 512
This treatment was intended to reflect the risk focus of the major security-based swap participant
definition by providing that entities will be regulated as major security-based swap participants
when the guarantees they provide pose a sufficiently high level of risk to the U.S. financial
system. 513
Commenters raised several issues related to the proposed approach for applying the major
security-based swap participant definition to cross-border security-based swaps. As discussed
below, these include issues regarding: the treatment of a non-U.S. person’s positions with foreign
branches of U.S. banks, the treatment of guarantees, and the treatment of entities with legacy
positions. Commenters also requested that the Commission generally harmonize its rules and
guidance with the CFTC’s Cross-Border Guidance.

security-based swap activities).

513

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31032.

210

After considering commenters’ views, we are adopting final rules that have been
modified from the proposal in certain important respects. As addressed in further detail below,
key changes to the proposal include:
•

A requirement that a conduit affiliate, as defined above, must include in its major
security-based swap participant threshold calculations all of its security-based
swap positions;

•

A requirement that a non-U.S. person other than a conduit affiliate must include
in its major security-based swap participant threshold calculations all of its
security-based swap positions for which its counterparty has rights of recourse
against a U.S. person; and

•

A modification to the proposed requirement that a non-U.S. person must include
in its major security-based swap participant threshold calculations security-based
swap positions with foreign branches of U.S. banks. 514

Our approach to the application of the major security-based swap participant definition in
the cross-border context incorporates certain principles that also apply in the context of the

514

In addition to the changes listed above, the final rules do not include certain provisions that were
included in proposed Exchange Act rule 3a67-10 because those provisions, which defined
“foreign major security-based swap participant,” and addressed the application of business
conduct requirements to registered foreign major security-based swap participants, were relevant
to proposed rules regarding substantive requirements that were included in the Cross-Border
Proposing Release. As this release only addresses various definitional rules and not those
substantive requirements that were proposed, those provisions are not relevant to this release and
are not addressed. Those provisions may, however, be relevant to matters addressed in subsequent
rulemakings.
The final rules applying the major security-based swap participant definition also incorporate a
conforming change by referring to such person’s “positions” rather than “transactions.” This is
consistent with the use of the term “positions” in the statutory definition of major security-based
swap participant and the rules further defining that term.

211

dealer definition and that are set forth in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release. 515 First,
as in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, we interpret the term “person” to refer to a
particular legal person, meaning that we view a trading desk, department, office, branch, or other
discrete business unit that is not a separately organized legal person as a part of the legal person
that enters into security-based swap positions. 516 Thus, a legal person with a branch, agency, or
office that exceeds the major security-based swap participant thresholds is required to register as
a major security-based swap participant as a legal person, even if the legal person’s positions are
limited to such branch, agency, or office. 517 In addition, consistent with rules adopted in the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, cross-border security-based swap positions between
majority-owned affiliates will not be considered for purposes of determining whether the person
as a whole is a major security-based swap participant. 518
B. Application of the Major Security-Based Swap Participant Definition to U.S. Persons
1. Proposed Approach and Commenters’ Views
Under the proposal, a U.S. person would have considered all of its security-based swap
positions for purposes of the major participant analysis. 519 Commenters did not comment on this
aspect of the proposed approach, although, as discussed above, several commenters addressed
the proposed scope of the “U.S. person” definition. 520

2. Final Rule
Consistent with the proposal, the final rules require a U.S. person to consider all of its
security-based swap positions in its major security-based swap participant threshold
calculations. 521 The final rule incorporates the definition of “U.S. person” used in the context of
a security-based swap dealer’s de minimis calculation. 522
As discussed above, in our view, the security-based swap positions of a U.S. person exist
in the United States and raise, at the thresholds set forth in our further definition of major
security-based swap participant, risks to the stability of the U.S. financial system or of U.S.
entities, including those that may be systemically important. 523 As noted above, it is the U.S.
person as a whole and not merely a foreign branch or office that bears the risk of the securitybased swap. Accordingly, it is consistent with our territorial approach to require a U.S. person to
include all of its security-based swap positions in its major security-based swap participant
threshold calculations.
C. Application of the Major Security-Based Swap Participant Definition to Conduit
Affiliates
1. Proposed Approach and Commenters’ Views
The proposal would have treated non-U.S. persons acting as “conduits” for their U.S.
affiliates the same as any other non-U.S. person for purposes of the major participant analysis,
and, as such would have required those persons to include in their major participant threshold

213

calculations only positions with U.S. persons. 524
The proposal solicited comment regarding whether a non-U.S. person’s major participant
analysis should incorporate security-based swaps other than those entered into with U.S.
persons. 525 Also, as discussed above, the proposal requested comment on the use of the conduit
affiliate concept and the treatment of entities that operate a “central booking system.” 526
As discussed above, two commenters opposed applying the “conduit affiliate” definition
to entities that serve as “central booking systems” for a corporate group, noting that the “central
booking systems” are used to manage internal risk. 527 The commenters argued that applying the
conduit affiliate definition in this manner would tie regulatory requirements to firms’ internal
risk management practices, and would hamper the firms’ ability to manage risk across a
multinational enterprise. 528 Another commenter suggested that conduit affiliates are the
recipients of a de facto guarantee from their U.S. affiliates and thus should be treated as U.S.
persons. 529
2. Final Rule
The final rule modifies the proposal to require conduit affiliates to include all of their
security-based swap positions in their major participant threshold calculations. 530 Consistent
with the dealer de minimis rules, a “conduit affiliate” is a non-U.S. affiliate of a U.S. person that

enters into security-based swaps with non-U.S. persons, or with foreign branches of U.S. banks
that are registered security-based swap dealers, on behalf of one or more of its U.S. affiliates
(other than U.S. affiliates that are registered as security-based swap dealers or major securitybased swap participants 531), and enters into offsetting transactions with its U.S. affiliates to
transfer risks and benefits of those security-based swaps. 532
After careful consideration and as discussed in the context of the dealer de minimis
exception, we believe that requiring such conduit affiliates to include their positions in their
major participant threshold calculations is consistent with our statutory anti-evasion authority
and necessary or appropriate to help ensure that non-U.S. persons do not facilitate the evasion of
major participant regulation under the Dodd-Frank Act. Absent a requirement that conduit
affiliates include their positions in the threshold calculations, a U.S. person may be able to evade
registration requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act by participating in arrangements whereby a
non-U.S. person engages in security-based swap activity outside the United States on behalf of a
U.S. affiliate that is not a registered security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap
participant. The U.S. person could enter into offsetting transactions with the non-U.S. affiliate,
thereby assuming the risks and benefits of those positions.533 Requiring conduit affiliates to

531

As noted in the discussion of conduit affiliate in the context of the application of dealer de
minimis exception, the “conduit affiliate” definition does not encompass persons that engage in
such offsetting transactions solely with U.S. persons that are registered with the Commission as
security-based swap dealers or major security-based swap participants because we believe the
registered status of the U.S. person mitigates evasion concerns. See note 313, supra.

532

See section IV.D.2, supra; Exchange Act section 3a67-10(a)(1) (incorporating the “conduit
affiliate” definition used in the dealer de minimis rule).

533

See Exchange Act section 30(c); section II.B.2(d), supra. In noting that this requirement is
consistent with our anti-evasion authority under section 30(c), we are not taking a position as to
whether such activity by a conduit affiliate otherwise constitutes a “business in security-based
swaps without the jurisdiction of the United States.” See note 315, supra.

215

include their positions in their major participant threshold calculations will help guard against
evasion of major participant regulation and the risk that such entities could pose to the U.S.
financial system. 534
In this context, as in the dealer context, we recognize the significance of commenters’
concerns that the “conduit affiliate” concept may impede efficient risk management procedures,
such as the use of central booking entities. 535 As in the context of the de minimis exception to
the dealer analysis, the “conduit affiliate” definition serves as a prophylactic anti-evasion
measure, and we do not believe that any entities currently act as conduit affiliates in the securitybased swap market, particularly given that a framework for the comprehensive regulation of
security-based swaps did not exist prior to the enactment of Title VII, suggesting that market
participants would have had no incentives to use such arrangements for evasive purposes.
Moreover, we believe that commenter concerns may be mitigated by certain features of
the major participant analysis and that, to the extent risk mitigation procedures such as “central
booking systems” are impacted by the final rules on conduit affiliates, such anticipated impact is
appropriate given the purpose of the major participant definition to identify entities that may
pose significant risk to the market. As discussed in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting
We recognize that not all structures involving conduit affiliates may be evasive in purpose. We
believe, however, that the anti-evasion authority of Exchange Act section 30(c) permits us to
prescribe prophylactic rules to conduct without the jurisdiction of the United States, even if those
rules would also apply to a market participant that has been transacting business through a preexisting market structure established for valid business purposes, so long as the rule is designed to
prevent possible evasive conduct. See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 30987; see also
section II.B.2(d) and note 316, supra (discussion of anti-evasion authority).
534

Consistent with the approach we are taking in the dealer context, the rule under the major
participant analysis requires a conduit affiliate to count all of its positions. See section IV.D.2 and
note 312, supra. It is not limited to the conduit affiliate’s positions that are specifically linked to
offsetting positions with its U.S. affiliate because the correspondence between positions and their
offsets may not be one-to-one, such as due to netting.

See note 311, supra (citing SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter and CDEU Letter).

Release, we believe the major participant thresholds are high enough that they will not affect
entities, including centralized hedging facilities, of any but the largest security-based swap
users. 536 We would not expect that centralized hedging facilities would generally hold positions
at the level of the major participant thresholds. 537 Further, the first test in the major securitybased swap participant definition, which calculates whether a person maintains a “substantial
position,” excludes positions held for hedging or mitigating commercial risk. 538 In the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, we explained that the exclusion includes hedging on
behalf of a majority-owned affiliate, such as a centralized hedging facility. 539 We believe this
exclusion in the first test of the major participant definition is likely to lessen the impact that the
conduit affiliate rules will have on centralized hedging facilities. 540
In addition to these features of the major security-based swap participant definition that
we anticipate will mitigate the impact of the conduit affiliate rules on risk mitigation practices,
we believe the focus of the major participant definition on the degree of risk to the U.S. financial
536

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30671-72 and n.914 (explaining that,
for cleared security-based CDS, a person would have to write $200 billion notional of CDS
protection to meet the relevant $2 billion threshold for potential future exposure).

537

We note that of the five non-U.S. domiciled entities that we expect to perceive the need to engage
in the major security-based swap participant calculation threshold analysis (see section V.H.2(a),
infra), none appear to have any U.S.-based affiliates.

538

See Exchange Act rule 3a67-1(a)(2)(i).

539

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30675-76.

540

We also note that the third test of the major participant definition, rule 3a67-1(a)(2)(iii), which
only applies to “highly leveraged financial entities,” excludes centralized hedging facilities acting
on behalf of a non-financial entity from the definition of financial entity. To the extent
commenters expressed concern that the conduit affiliate rules would affect financial entities and
their risk mitigation procedures, this exclusion for centralized hedging facilities is designed to
limit that impact. However, to the extent that an entity is not able to use the exclusion and falls
within the definition of a highly leveraged financial entity, we believe that requiring such
positions to be included is consistent with the focus of the major participant definition. Cf. CDEU
Letter at 1 (stating that financial and non-financial end-users should be subject to the same crossborder requirements); IIB Letter at 22 (noting that many financial institutions that do not enter
into CDS for dealing purposes still enter into them for hedging purposes).

217

system justifies regulation of certain entities that perform this function if they maintain positions
at a level that may pose sufficient risk to trigger the major participant definition, regardless of the
nature of their security-based swap activity.
For the foregoing reasons, we believe that the final rules regarding conduit affiliates are
necessary or appropriate to prevent the evasion of any provision of the amendments made to the
Exchange Act by Title VII and appropriately target potentially evasive scenarios that present the
level of risk that the major security-based swap participant definition is intended to address. 541
D. Application to Other Non-U.S. Persons
The proposed rules would have required a non-U.S. person to include in its major
security-based swap participant analysis all positions with U.S. persons, including foreign
branches of U.S. banks. 542 A non-U.S. person would not have had to include its security-based
swap positions with non-U.S. person counterparties, even if such positions were guaranteed by
another person. 543 A few commenters criticized the proposed requirement that a non-U.S. person
include its positions with foreign branches of U.S. banks in its calculation thresholds. 544
Regarding the treatment of a non-U.S. person whose positions with non-U.S. persons are
guaranteed by a U.S. person, one commenter supported our proposed approach not to require the
541

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31031 (explaining that the “U.S. person”
definition applies to the entire person, including its branches and offices that may be located in a
foreign jurisdiction and, as such, the potential impact in the United States due to a non-U.S.
counterparty’s default would not differ depending on whether the non-U.S. counterparty entered
into the security-based swap transaction with the home office of a U.S. bank or with a foreign
branch of a U.S. bank).

include its positions with foreign branches of U.S. persons in its major participant calculation is
inconsistent with the proposed requirement in the de minimis context and the CFTC guidance).

person whose position is guaranteed to include such guaranteed positions in its calculation, 545
while other commenters requested that such entities be treated as U.S. persons. 546 The final rules
applying the major participant definition to non-U.S. persons are tailored to address the market
impact and risk that we believe a person’s security-based swap positions would pose to the U.S.
financial system.
1. Positions with U.S. Persons Other than Foreign Branches of U.S. Banks
(a) Proposed Approach and Commenters’ Views
As noted above, the proposed rules would have required a non-U.S. person to include in
its major security-based swap participant threshold calculations all positions with U.S. persons,
including foreign branches of U.S. banks. 547 The proposal stated that requiring non-U.S. persons
to include their positions with U.S. persons, as defined in the proposal, would “provide an
appropriate indication of the degree of default risk proposed by such non-U.S. person’s securitybased swap positions to the U.S. financial system,” by accounting for such non-U.S. person’s
outward exposures to U.S. persons. 548 One commenter objected to the proposal’s approach to
look to the U.S.-person status of a clearing agency when a non-U.S. person enters into a securitybased swap that is cleared and novated through a clearing agency. 549 In the proposal, we
explained that we would consider the clearing agency as the non-U.S. person’s counterparty and
because the clearing agency is a U.S. person we would require such novated security-based swap
545

See SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at A-10 to A-11 (stating that a guaranteed non-U.S. person does not
have the necessary “requisite jurisdictional nexus” to be classified as a U.S. person, and thereby
supporting the Commission’s proposal to address the risk of such guarantees through the
attribution process in the major security-based swap participant requirements); note 209, supra.

to be included in the non-U.S. person’s major security-based swap participant calculation
threshold calculations. 550 The commenter objected, arguing that the location of clearing should
be irrelevant for purposes of determining major security-based swap participant status. 551
Although some commenters took issue with the scope of the “U.S. person” definition, as
described above, commenters did not otherwise address this specific requirement within the
application of the major security-based swap participant definition.
(b) Final Rule
The final rule, like the proposal, generally requires that non-U.S. persons (apart from the
conduit affiliates, which are addressed above) 552 include in their major security-based swap
participant threshold calculations their positions with U.S. persons. 553
Generally requiring non-U.S. persons to consider their security-based swap positions with
U.S. persons (except for positions with foreign branches of registered security-based swap
dealers, as discussed below) will help ensure that persons whose positions are likely to pose a
risk to the U.S. financial system at the relevant thresholds are subject to regulation as a major
security-based swap participant. 554 Security-based swap positions involving a U.S.-person
counterparty exist within the United States by virtue of being undertaken with a counterparty that
is a U.S. person. For these reasons, positions entered into with U.S. persons are likely to raise, at

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31030 (explaining that the risk to the U.S.
financial system would be measured by calculating a non-U.S. person’s aggregated outward

220

the thresholds set forth in our further definition of major security-based swap participant, risks to
the stability of the U.S. financial system or of U.S. entities, including those that may be
systemically important. 555
While we considered one commenter’s concern that the location of clearing should not be
relevant for purposes of determining a non-U.S. person’s major security-based swap participant
status, 556 we continue to believe that, as such positions are cleared through a U.S.-person
clearing agency, they exist within the United States and create risk in the United States of the
type the major security-based swap participant definition is intended to address. 557 We note, in
response to commenters’ opinions about the risk-mitigating effects of central clearing, and the
additional level of rigor that clearing agencies may have with regards to the process and
procedures for collecting daily margin, that the final rules further defining “substantial position”
provide that the potential future exposure associated with positions that are subject to central
clearing by a registered or exempt clearing agency is equal to 0.1 times the potential future
exposure that would otherwise be calculated. 558 This treatment reflects our view that clearing
the security-based swap substantially mitigates the risk of such positions but cannot eliminate
such risk. 559 We believe that this previously adopted provision may provide additional incentives
for market participants to clear their positions through registered or exempt clearing agencies,
and that the requirement to include such positions in the major security-based swap participant

threshold calculations should not discourage market participants from clearing positions through
U.S.-based clearing agencies.
2. Positions with Foreign Branches of U.S. Banks
(a) Proposed Approach and Commenters’ Views
As noted above, the proposal would have required non-U.S. persons to include their
positions with U.S. persons in their threshold calculations. This requirement would have
extended to positions with foreign branches of U.S. banks. 560 Two commenters criticized the
proposal’s requirement that a non-U.S. person would need to include positions with foreign
branches of U.S. banks. 561 One of these commenters suggested that the Commission adopt the
CFTC policy, which set forth an exception generally permitting a non-U.S. person that is a nonfinancial entity to exclude from its calculation positions with foreign branches of U.S. banks that
are registered swap dealers. 562 One of the commenters suggested that if the Commission did not
allow all non-U.S. persons to exclude transactions with foreign branches of U.S. banks from their
calculation, the Commission should at least adopt the approach taken by the CFTC in its crossborder guidance of allowing a non-U.S. person that is a financial entity to exclude transactions,
560

See proposed rule 3a67-10(c)(2).

561

See SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at A-19 to A-20 (stating that the proposal would result in disparate
treatment of foreign branches of U.S. banks because non-U.S. persons could exclude such
transactions from their dealer de minimis threshold calculations but not from their major securitybased swap participant threshold calculations, and noting that the proposal differs from the CFTC
Cross-Border Guidance, which takes the approach that non-U.S. person financial entities
generally should exclude swaps with foreign branches of U.S. swap dealers, subject to certain
conditions); IIB Letter at 12 (stating that the same rationale that applies to excluding transactions
with foreign branches of U.S. banks in the dealer context should apply in the major securitybased swap participant context and that the proposed approach is inconsistent with the CFTC
Cross-Border Guidance).

562

See IIB Letter at 12-13 (suggesting that the CFTC’s general policy of not counting non-financial
entities’ swaps with guaranteed affiliates that are swap dealers or foreign branches that are swap
dealers reflects an understanding that non-financial entities present less risk than financial
entities). Cf. CFTC Cross-Border Guidance at 45324-25.

222

subject to certain additional conditions, with foreign branches of U.S. banks that are registered
security-based swap dealers. 563
(b) Final Rule
The final rule has been modified from the proposal to require non-U.S. persons (other
than conduit affiliates, as discussed above) to count, against their major security-based swap
participant threshold calculations, their positions with U.S. persons other than positions with
foreign branches of registered security-based swap dealers. 564 The proposal would have required
non-U.S. persons to all include their positions with U.S. persons in their threshold calculations,
including any positions with foreign branches of U.S. banks. 565
The final rule permits non-U.S. persons not to count certain positions that arise from
transactions conducted through a foreign branch of a counterparty that is a U.S. bank. 566 For this
exclusion to be effective, persons located within the United States cannot be involved in
563

See SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at A-20 (stating that the proposal to include transactions with foreign
branches in a non-U.S. person’s major security-based swap participant threshold calculations may
cause non-U.S. persons that would otherwise be considered major security-based swap
participants to limit or stop trading with foreign branches of U.S. banks); id. at A-20 to A-21
(noting that the approach differs from the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance with respect to counting
such transactions towards the major swap participant threshold); see also IIB Letter at 12-13
(stating that the proposal is inconsistent with the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, whose
exceptions demonstrate an understanding that the risk to the U.S. financial system can be
addressed through different means and noting that the proposal may cause non-U.S.
counterparties to stop transacting with foreign branches of U.S. banks).

564

See Exchange Act rule 3a67-10(b)(3)(i). Exchange Act rule 3a67-10(a)(2) defines “foreign
branch” by referring to Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(2). We note for clarification that the rule
described here uses the defined term “transactions conducted through a foreign branch” (as
defined in Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(3)) to describe the manner in which the U.S.-person must
enter into the position in order for the non-U.S. person counterparty to avail itself of this
exception. The non-U.S. person counterparty that is calculating its major security-based swap
participant calculation thresholds is entering into the position with the foreign branch of the U.S.
person.

arranging, negotiating, or executing the transaction. 567 Moreover, the counterparty bank must be
registered as a security-based swap dealer, 568 unless the transaction occurs prior to 60 days
following the effective date of final rules providing for the registration of security-based swap
dealers. 569 Registration of the counterparty U.S. bank would not be required for the exclusion to
be effective before then, given that the non-U.S. person would not be able to know with certainty
whether the U.S. bank in the future would register with the Commission as a security-based swap
dealer. 570
We believe that the revision to the proposal allowing for an exclusion from counting
positions that arise from transactions conducted through foreign branches of registered securitybased swap dealers appropriately accounts for the risk in the U.S. financial system created by
such positions. In our view, the risk of such positions is lessened when the U.S. bank itself is
registered with the Commission as a security-based swap dealer because the U.S. bank, and its
transactions, will be subject to the relevant Title VII provisions applicable to security-based swap
dealers (for example, margin and reporting requirements). 571 The exception is also consistent
567

See Exchange Act rule 3a67-10(b)(3)(i) (using the term “transaction conducted through a foreign
branch,” which requires that “the security-based swap transaction is arranged, negotiated, and
executed on behalf of the foreign branch solely by persons located outside the United States,” as
defined in Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(3)(i)(B)).

568

See Exchange Act rule 3a67-10(b)(3)(i)(A).
A non-U.S. person would still have to count such positions for purposes of calculating its major
security-based swap participant calculation thresholds if the non-U.S. person’s counterparty (i.e.,
the U.S. bank) has rights of recourse against a U.S. person in the position with the non-U.S.
person. See Exchange Act rule 3a67-10(b)(3)(ii).

569

See Exchange Act rule 3a67-10(b)(3)(i)(B).

570

In other words, this provision will help to avoid requiring non-U.S. persons to speculate whether
their counterparties would register, and to face the consequences of their speculation being
wrong.

571

See section IV.E.2(b) and note 373 (discussing that the risk of such positions is mitigated in part
because the foreign branch of a registered security-based swap dealer will be subject to a number
of Title VII regulatory requirements).

224

with our application of the dealer de minimis exception in our final rule, which requires non-U.S.
persons, other than conduit affiliates, to include in their de minimis threshold calculations
dealing transactions with U.S. persons other than the foreign branch of a registered securitybased swap dealer (or for a temporary period of time prior to 60 days prior to the effectiveness of
the dealer registration rules). 572
The final rule should help mitigate concerns that non-U.S. persons will limit or stop
trading with foreign branches of U.S. banks for fear of too easily triggering major security-based
swap participant registration requirements under Title VII. Moreover, the inclusion of this
exception in our final rule addresses comments expressing concern that non-U.S. persons would
have to include positions with foreign branches of U.S. banks in their major security-based swap
participant threshold calculations. 573 We also note that the exception reduces divergence
between our major participant threshold calculation and that outlined in the CFTC’s guidance, as
requested by commenters. 574
3. Positions of Non-U.S. Persons that are Subject to Recourse Guarantees by a U.S.
Person
(a) Proposed Approach and Commenters’ Views
The proposal would have not required a non-U.S. person to count towards its major
security-based swap participant calculation thresholds, those positions that it entered into with
non-U.S. persons, regardless of whether the counterparty to the position has a right of recourse

572

573

See note 561, supra.

574

See notes 562 and 563, supra. Although our inclusion of this exception brings us closer to the
general policy set forth by the CFTC, our approaches are not entirely identical, as the CFTC
includes certain additional inputs for non-U.S. persons that are financial entities that we have
determined not to incorporate in our final rule. See CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, 78 FR at
45326-27.

225

against a U.S. person under the security-based swap. 575 To address the risk posed by the
existence of a recourse guarantee against a U.S. person, the proposal would have required that all
security-based swaps entered into by a non-U.S. person and guaranteed by a U.S. person be
attributed to such U.S. person guarantor for purposes of determining such U.S. person
guarantor’s major security-based swap participant status. 576
As noted above, one commenter supported the Commission’s proposed approach not to
require a non-U.S. person whose positions with other non-U.S. persons are subject to a recourse
guarantee from a U.S. person, to include such guaranteed positions in its own major participant
threshold calculations, expressing support for using the major security-based swap participant
attribution requirements to address the risk posed to the U.S. markets by such guarantees. 577
Two commenters argued that non-U.S. persons whose positions are guaranteed by U.S. persons
should be treated as U.S. persons for purposes of the major participant threshold calculations,
which would require them to include all their positions in their major participant threshold
calculations. 578 Additionally, although commenters did not refer specifically to the application
of the major security-based swap participant definition, some commenters requested that the
Commission generally harmonize its approach to cross-border activities with that of the

575

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31031 and n.622; see also proposed Exchange Act
rule 3a67-10(c)(2). In the proposal, we stated that the non-U.S. person counterparties of a nonU.S. person would bear the risk of loss if that non-U.S. person was unable to pay what it owes,
and therefore, that the non-U.S. person need not include in its major participant threshold
calculations positions with a non-U.S. counterparty, even if its obligations under the securitybased swap are guaranteed by a U.S. person. See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at
31031.

226

CFTC. 579
(b) Final Rule
We are adopting a final rule that requires a non-U.S. person to include in its major
security-based swap participant threshold calculations those positions for which the non-U.S.
person’s counterparty has rights of recourse against a U.S. person. 580 We believe that when a
U.S. person guarantees a position, the position exists within the United States and poses risk to
the U.S. person guarantor, 581 and the non-U.S. person that enters directly into the position should
be required to include the position in its major security-based swap participant threshold
calculations. The final rule will also help to apply major participant regulation in a consistent
manner to differing organizational structures that serve similar economic purposes, and help
avoid disparities in applying major participant regulation to differing arrangements that pose
similar risks to the United States.
Accordingly, the final rule modifies the proposal by requiring a non-U.S. person to
include in its major security-based swap participant threshold calculations security-based swap
positions for which a counterparty to the security-based swap has legally enforceable rights of
recourse against a U.S. person, even if a non-U.S. person is counterparty to the security-based

579

See note 25, supra.

580

See Exchange Act rule 3a67-10(b)(3)(ii). Cf. note 350, supra (noting that this final rule
encompasses non-U.S. persons who receive a guarantee from an unaffiliated U.S. person,
whereas the final rule under the de minimis exception only encompasses non-U.S. persons who
receive a guarantee from a U.S. affiliate).
We note that we have retained the requirement in the proposal that the U.S. guarantor also
attribute to itself, for purposes of its own major security-based swap participant threshold
calculations, all security-based swaps entered into by a non-U.S. person that are guaranteed by
the U.S. person. See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31032; section V.E.1, infra.

581

See section II.B.2(c), supra.

227

swap. 582 For these purposes, and as addressed in the context of de minimis exception to the
“security-based swap dealer” definition, the counterparty would be deemed to have a right of
recourse against a U.S. person if the counterparty has a conditional or unconditional legally
enforceable right, in whole or in part, to receive payments from, or otherwise collect from, a U.S.
person in connection with the non-U.S. person’s obligations under the security-based swap.
We understand that such rights may arise in a variety of contexts. For example, a
counterparty would have such a right of recourse against the U.S. person if the applicable
arrangement provides the counterparty the legally enforceable right to demand payment from the
U.S. person in connection with the security-based swap, without conditioning that right upon the
non-U.S. person’s non-performance or requiring that the counterparty first make a demand on
the non-U.S. person. A counterparty also would have such a right of recourse if the counterparty
itself could exercise legally enforceable rights of collection against the U.S. person in connection
with the security-based swap, even when such rights are conditioned upon the non-U.S. person’s
insolvency or failure to meet its obligations under the security-based swap, and/or are
conditioned upon the counterparty first being required to take legal action against the non-U.S.
person to enforce its rights of collection.
The terms of the guarantee need not necessarily be included within the security-based
swap documentation or even otherwise reduced to writing (so long as legally enforceable rights
are created under the laws of the relevant jurisdiction); for instance, such rights of recourse
would arise when the counterparty, as a matter of law in the relevant jurisdiction, would have
rights to payment and/or collection that may arise in connection with the non-U.S. person’s
obligations under the security-based swap that are enforceable. We would view the positions of
582

Exchange Act rule 3a67-10(b)(3)(ii).

228

a non-U.S. person as subject to a recourse guarantee if at least one U.S. person (either
individually or jointly and severally with others) bears unlimited responsibility for the non-U.S.
person’s obligations, including the non-U.S. person’s obligations to security-based swap
counterparties. Such arrangements may include those associated with foreign unlimited
companies or unlimited liability companies with at least one U.S.-person member or shareholder,
general partnerships with at least one U.S.-person general partner, or entities formed under
similar arrangements such that at least one U.S. persons bears unlimited responsibility for the
non-U.S. person’s liabilities. In our view, the nature of the legal arrangement between the U.S.
person and the non-U.S. person – which makes the U.S. person responsible for the obligations of
the non-U.S. person – is appropriately characterized as a recourse guarantee, absent
countervailing factors. More generally, a recourse guarantee is present if, in connection with the
security-based swap, the counterparty itself has a legally enforceable right to payment or
collection from the U.S. person, regardless of the form of the arrangement that provides such an
enforceable right to payment or collection. 583
In light of comments received and upon further consideration, we believe that the revised
approach addresses, in a targeted manner, the risk to the U.S. financial system posed by entities
whose counterparties are able to turn to a U.S. person for performance of the non-U.S. person’s
obligations under a security-based swap position. 584 We believe our final approach strikes an
583

Consistent with the rule implementing the dealer de minimis exception, this final rule clarifies
that for these purposes a counterparty would have rights of recourse against the U.S. person “if
the counterparty has a conditional or unconditional legally enforceable right, in whole or in part,
to receive payments from, or otherwise collect from, the U.S. person in connection with the
security-based swap.” See Exchange Act rule 3a67-10(b)(3)(ii).

584

We are not requiring a non-U.S. person whose performance with respect to one or more securitybased swap positions is subject to a recourse guarantee to include all of its positions with nonU.S. persons towards its major security-based swap participant threshold calculations. We
recognize that the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance uses the term “guaranteed affiliate” and states

229

appropriate balance by directly regulating a non-U.S. person that enters into a position with a
counterparty that has a recourse guarantee against a U.S. person, while not treating that non-U.S.
person as a U.S. person. 585
The final rule reflects our conclusion that a non-U.S. person – to the extent it enters into
security-based swap positions subject to a recourse guarantee by a U.S. person – enters into
security-based swap positions that exist within the United States. 586 The economic reality of
such positions is that by virtue of the guarantee the non-U.S. person effectively acts together
with a U.S. person to engage in the security-based swap activity that results in the positions, and
the non-U.S. person’s positions cannot reasonably be isolated from the U.S. person’s
engagement in providing the guarantee. 587 Both the guarantor and guaranteed entity are involved
in the position and may jointly seek to profit by engaging in such security-based swap
positions.588 The final rule echoes our approach, consistent with our approach to regulation of
security-based swap dealers that, to the extent that a single non-U.S. person is responsible for
positions within the United States (whether by entering into positions with U.S.-person
counterparties or for which its non-U.S. person counterparties have recourse against a U.S.
person) that rise above the major participant thresholds, the entity that directly enters into such
the view that such entities should include all of their swap positions in their major swap
participant threshold calculations. See CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, 78 FR at 45319. We
believe that our final rule, which requires a non-U.S. person to include only those positions with
non-U.S. persons where the counterparty has rights of recourse to a U.S. person, appropriately in
the context of the security-based swap markets reflects the risk that such positions may create
within the United States.

positions should be required to register as a major security-based swap participant and should be
subject to direct regulation as a major security-based swap participant.
The final rules regarding positions for which a counterparty to the position has rights of
recourse against a U.S. person aim to apply major participant regulation in similar ways to
differing organizational structures that serve similar economic purposes, such as positions
entered into by a non-U.S. person that are subject to a recourse guarantee by a U.S. person and
security-based swap positions carried out through a foreign branch of a U.S. person. 589 These
two differing organizational structures serve similar economic purposes and thus should be
treated similarly.
As discussed below, we have maintained the proposed approach requiring a U.S. person
to attribute to itself any position of a non-U.S. person for which the non-U.S. person’s
counterparty has rights of recourse against the U.S. person. This attribution requirement further
reflects the focus of the major security-based swap participant definition on positions that may
raise systemic risk concerns within the United States. 590 Such positions exist within the United
States by virtue of the U.S. person’s guarantee, which transmits risk to the U.S. financial system
to the extent obligations are owed under the security-based swap by the guaranteed non-U.S.
person because the non-U.S. person’s counterparty may seek recourse from the U.S. person

589

See section IV.E.1(b) and note 341, supra. For the above reasons, we conclude that this final rule
is not being applied to persons who are “transact[ing] a business in security-based swaps without
the jurisdiction of the United States,” within the meaning of section 30(c). See section II.B.2(a),
supra. We also believe, moreover, that this final rule is necessary or appropriate as a prophylactic
measure to help prevent the evasion of the provisions of the Exchange Act that were added by the
Dodd-Frank Act, and thus help ensure that the relevant purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act are not
undermined. Without this rule, U.S. persons would be able to evade major participant regulation
under Title VII simply by conducting their security-based swap positions via a guaranteed nonU.S. person, while still being subject to risks associated with those positions.

See section II.B.2(c), supra.

guaranteeing the position. 591 Additionally, the economic reality of this position, even though
entered into by a non-U.S. person, is substantially identical, in relevant respects, to a transaction
entered into directly by the U.S. guarantor, because a U.S. person is participating directly in the
transaction. 592 For these reasons the attribution requirement, which is consistent with our
territorial approach and the approach taken in the proposal, reflects the focus of the major
security-based swap participant definition.
We note that, consistent with our proposal, we are not requiring non-U.S. persons to
include in their major security-based swap participant threshold calculations positions for which
they (as opposed to their counterparties) have a guarantee creating a right of recourse against a
U.S. person. As we noted in the proposal, non-U.S. persons with a right of recourse against a
U.S. person pursuant to a security-based swap do not pose a direct risk to the person providing a
guarantee, as that person’s failure generally will not trigger any obligations under the
guarantee. 593
E. Attribution
The Cross-Border Proposing Release stated the preliminary view that a person’s securitybased swap positions in the cross-border context would be attributed to a parent, other affiliate,

591

See section V.E.1(b), infra.

592

See section V.E, infra.

593

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31031 and n.622. We recognize that the CFTC
Cross-Border Guidance does set forth the concept that non-U.S. persons should generally include
in their major swap participant analysis positions with entities that fall within the CFTC’s
description of a “guaranteed affiliate,” subject to certain exceptions. See CFTC Cross-Border
Guidance, 78 FR at 45326-27. We continue to believe, however, consistent with the proposal,
that it is not necessary that such non-U.S. person that has rights of recourse against a U.S. person
include that position in its major participant threshold calculations because the inability of that
non-U.S. person counterparty to pay what it owes pursuant to a security-based swap will
generally not pose risk to the U.S. financial system because it will not trigger the obligation of the
U.S. guarantor. See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31031.

232

or guarantor for purposes of the major participant analysis to the extent that the person’s
counterparties in those positions have recourse to that parent, other affiliate, or guarantor in
connection with the position. Positions would not be attributed in the absence of recourse. 594
The final rules codify the proposed guidance related to attribution of guaranteed positions
to provide clarity to market participants. We continue to believe that a U.S. person should
attribute to itself any positions of a non-U.S. person for which the non-U.S. person’s
counterparty has rights of recourse against the U.S. person, as the position exists within the
United States by virtue of the U.S. person guarantor’s involvement in the position. 595 Similarly,
a non-U.S. person should attribute to itself any positions of a U.S. person for which that U.S.
person’s counterparty has rights of recourse against the non-U.S. person. 596 We also continue to
believe that when a non-U.S. person guarantor has extended a recourse guarantee on the
obligations of a U.S. person, those positions exist within the United States by virtue of the
guaranteed U.S. person’s involvement in the positions as a direct counterparty to the transaction
and therefore the positions should be attributed to the non-U.S. person guarantor that is
participating in that position through providing its guarantee. The final rules requiring attribution
also aim to apply major participant regulation in similar ways to differing organizational
structures that serve similar economic purposes, thus helping to ensure that the relevant purposes
of the Dodd-Frank Act are not undermined.
594

See id. 31032 and n.625 (noting that we were not proposing to alter the approach with respect to
attribution of guarantees that was adopted by the Commission and the CFTC in the Intermediary
Definitions Adopting Release, but rather proposing to apply the same principles in the crossborder context).

595

As discussed above in section V.D.3(b), the economic reality of this position, even though
entered into by a non-U.S. person, is substantially identical, in relevant respects, to a transaction
entered into directly by the U.S. guarantor.

1. Positions Attributed to U.S. Person Guarantors
(a) Proposed Approach and Commenters’ Views
Our preliminary view was that a U.S. person would attribute to itself all security-based
swap positions for which it provides a guarantee for performance on the obligations of a nonU.S. person, other than in limited circumstances. 597 We noted that the proposed approach did
not alter the guidance regarding attribution that was adopted in the Intermediary Definitions
Adopting Release, but proposed an approach in the cross-border context applying the principles
set forth in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release. 598 This attribution standard was
based on our preliminary view that, when a U.S. person acts as a guarantor of a position of a
non-U.S. person, the guarantee creates risks within the United States whether the underlying
security-based swaps that they guarantee are entered into with U.S. persons or with non-U.S.
persons. 599 One commenter argued that attribution is beyond the scope of section 30(c) of the
Exchange Act. 600 One commenter argued that our preliminary view regarding attribution for
entities guaranteed by U.S. persons would result in “double-counting” and that security-based
swap positions should only be attributed to a U.S. guarantor where the direct counterparty to the
security-based swap is not otherwise required to count those positions toward its own

of the Exchange Act”).

234

calculation. 601
(b) Final Rule
We are adopting rules that codify the preliminary views set forth in our proposal: A U.S.
person is required to attribute to itself any security-based swap position of a non-U.S. person for
which the non-U.S. person’s counterparty to the security-based swap has rights of recourse
against that U.S. person. 602 Although we considered commenters’ objections to our proposed
attribution requirement, we continue to believe that this approach is necessary because, as stated
in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, attribution is intended to reflect the risk posed
to the U.S. financial system when a counterparty to a position has recourse against a U.S.
person. 603 The final rule also includes a note to clarify that a U.S. person is still expected to
attribute to itself positions of other U.S. persons for which the counterparty to that U.S. person
has a recourse guarantee against the U.S.-person guarantor, as explained in interpretation in the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release. 604
We believe that attribution of positions to guarantors is consistent with Exchange Act
section 30(c), notwithstanding the argument by one commenter that attribution to a guarantor
“extends beyond the intended limits of [s]ection 30(c) of the Exchange Act.” 605 As we discuss in

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30689 n.1135 (stating that the type of
attribution addressed at that time may also be expected to raise special issues in the context of
guarantees involving security-based swap positions of non-U.S. entities). As noted in the CrossBorder Proposing Release, these risk concerns are the same regardless of whether the underlying
security-based swap positions of the non-U.S. person that the U.S. person guarantees are entered
into with U.S. persons or non-U.S. persons. See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at
31032.

more detail above, the major security-based swap participant definition focuses on positions that
may raise systemic risk concerns within the United States. 606 It is our view that a security-based
swap position exists within the United States when it is held by or with a U.S. person, or when a
counterparty to the security-based swap has recourse against a U.S. person, as the risks
associated with such positions are borne within the United States, and given the involvement of
U.S. persons may, at the thresholds established for the major security-based swap participant
definition, give rise to the types of systemic risk within the United States that major securitybased swap participant regulation is intended to address. 607
As discussed above, the final rules regarding positions for which a counterparty to the
position has rights of recourse against a U.S. person aim to apply major participant regulation to
in similar ways to differing organizational structures that serve similar economic purposes,
including structures such as security-based swap positions entered into by a non-U.S. person that
are subject to a recourse guarantee by a U.S. person and security-based swap positions carried
out through a foreign branch. 608
While we recognize one commenter’s concern that attribution would require “double
counting” certain positions, we do not agree with that commenter’s assertion that the final rule
constitutes double-counting, given that both entities assume the risk of the position by either
606

See section II.B.2(c), supra.

See section V.D.3(b), supra. For the above reasons, we conclude that this final rule is not being

II.B.2(a), supra. We also believe, moreover, that this final rule is necessary or appropriate as a
prophylactic measure to help prevent the evasion of the provisions of the Exchange Act that were
added by the Dodd-Frank Act, and thus help ensure that the relevant purposes of the Dodd-Frank
Act are not undermined. Without this rule, U.S. persons would be able to evade major participant
regulation under Title VII simply by conducting their security-based swap positions via a
guaranteed non-U.S. person, while still being subject to the risks associated with those positions.

entering into it directly or by guaranteeing it. Because both entities are involved in the position
that poses risk to the U.S. financial system, both entities are required to include it in their
respective major participant threshold calculations, at least until the entity whose position is
guaranteed is required to register as a major security-based swap participant. 609
2. Positions Attributed to Non-U.S. Person Guarantors
(a) Proposed Approach and Commenters’ Views
In the proposal, we expressed our preliminary view that a non-U.S. person that provides a
recourse guarantee for performance on the obligations of a U.S. person should attribute to itself
the security-based swap positions of the U.S. person that are subject to guarantees by the nonU.S. person. 610 However, when a non-U.S. person provides a guarantee to another non-U.S.
person, the non-U.S. person providing the guarantee would have been required to attribute to
itself only those positions for which a U.S. person counterparty has rights of recourse against the
non-U.S. person guarantor under the security-based swap. As noted above, one commenter
argued that attribution is beyond the scope of section 30(c) of the Exchange Act. 611
(b) Final Rule
Consistent with our preliminary view, the final rule requires a non-U.S. person to
attribute to itself any security-based swap positions of a U.S. person that are subject to a
guarantee by the non-U.S. person. 612 In other words, the non-U.S. person guarantor will attribute
to itself all security-based swap positions of the U.S. person for which a counterparty of the U.S.

612

Exchange Act rule 3a67-10(c)(1)(ii)(A).

237

person has rights of recourse against the non-U.S. person guaranteeing the position. 613 The rule
reflects our view that the guarantee may enable the U.S. person to enter into significantly more
security-based swap positions with both U.S.-person and non-U.S. person counterparties than it
would be able to absent the guarantee, increasing the risk that such persons could incur,
amplifying the risk of the non-U.S. person’s inability to carry out its obligations under the
guarantee. 614
Under the final rule, if a U.S. person in a transaction with a non-U.S. person counterparty
has rights of recourse against another non-U.S. person under the security-based swap, the nonU.S. person guaranteeing the transaction must attribute the security-based swap to itself for
purposes of its major security-based swap participant threshold calculations. 615 We note that,
consistent with the rule requiring non-U.S. persons to count positions entered into with U.S.
persons, a non-U.S. person that attributes a position of another non-U.S. person to itself does not
need to attribute to itself positions arising from a transaction conducted through a foreign branch
of the U.S.-person counterparty when the counterparty is a registered security-based swap dealer
or positions arising from a transaction conducted through a foreign branch of a U.S.-person
counterparty, when the transaction is entered into prior to 60 days following the earliest date on

613

Exchange Act rule 3a67-10(c)(1)(ii)(A) may be broader than the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance in
this context because the final rule requires the non-U.S. person to attribute to itself all the
positions of the U.S. person that are guaranteed by the non-U.S. person, whereas the CFTC
Cross-Border Guidance states that the non-U.S. person would generally not attribute to itself
positions of the U.S. person that it guarantees where the counterparty is another non-U.S. person
that is not guaranteed by a U.S. person. See CFTC Cross-Border Guidance at 45326 (stating that
a non-U.S. person would generally consider in its own calculation (i.e., attribute to itself) any
swap position (of a U.S. or non-U.S. person) that it guarantees in which the counterparty is a U.S.
person or a guaranteed affiliate).

which registration of security-based swap dealers is first required.

616

As explained above, we believe that attribution of positions to guarantors is consistent
with Exchange Act section 30(c), notwithstanding the argument by one commenter that
attribution to a guarantor “goes beyond the intended limits of section 30(c) of the Exchange
Act.” 617 As we discuss in more detail above, the major security-based swap participant
definition focuses on positions that may raise systemic risk concerns within the United States. 618
It is our view that a security-based swap position exists within the United States when it is held
by or with a U.S. person, or when it is guaranteed by a U.S. person, as the risks associated with
such positions are borne within the United States, and given the involvement of U.S. persons
may give rise, at the thresholds established for the major security-based swap participant
definition, to the types of systemic risk within the United States that major security-based swap
participant regulation is intended to address. 619
The final rules requiring non-U.S. persons to attribute certain positions to themselves for
purposes of calculating their own major security-based swap participant calculation thresholds
aims to apply major participant regulation in similar ways to differing organizational structures
that serve similar economic purposes. For example, when a U.S. person has rights of recourse
against a non-U.S. person, the economic reality of the position is substantially identical, in
relevant respects, to a position entered into directly by the non-U.S. person with the U.S. person.
The relevant attribution requirements reflect that a non-U.S. person would need to include such

3. Limited Circumstances Where Attribution of Guaranteed Security-Based Swap
Positions Does Not Apply
(a) Proposed Approach and Commenters’ Views
The proposal stated our preliminary view that a guarantor would not be required to
attribute to itself the security-based swap positions it guarantees, and, therefore, may exclude
those positions from its threshold calculations, if the person whose positions it guarantees is
already subject to capital regulation by the Commission or the CFTC (for example, by virtue of
being regulated as a swap dealer, security-based swap dealer, major swap participant, major
security-based swap participant, FCMs, brokers, or dealers), is regulated as a bank in the United
States, or is subject to capital standards adopted by its home country supervisor that are
consistent in all respects with the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (“Basel Accord”). 621 This preliminary view applied both to U.S. persons and nonU.S. persons that are subject to registration and regulation in the enumerated categories. 622 Our

620

See section V.D.3(b), supra. For the above reasons, we conclude that this final rule is not being
applied to persons who are “transact[ing] a business in security-based swaps without the
jurisdiction of the United States,” within the meaning of section 30(c). See section II.B.2(a),
supra. We also believe, moreover, that this final rule is necessary or appropriate as a prophylactic
measure to help prevent the evasion of the provisions of the Exchange Act that were added by the
Dodd-Frank Act, and thus help ensure that the relevant purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act are not
undermined. Without this rule, non-U.S. persons would be able to evade major participant
regulation under Title VII simply by conducting their security-based swap positions by
guaranteeing another entity that would then enter into the positions.

621

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31033 (explaining that the non-U.S. person must
be subject to capital standards that are consistent with the capital standards such non-U.S. person
would have been subject to if it was a bank subject to the prudential regulators’ capital regulation,
i.e., the Basel Accord); see also Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR 30689 (stating
that it is not necessary to attribute a person’s positions to a parent or other guarantor if the person
already is subject to capital regulation by the CFTC or SEC or if the person is a U.S. person
regulated as a bank in the United States). Thus, once the person whose position is guaranteed
registers as a major security-based swap participant, attribution would no longer be required.

622

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31033 at n.636.

240

preliminary view was that such consistent foreign regulatory capital requirements would
adequately address the risks arising from such positions, making it unnecessary to separately
address the risks associated with guarantees of those same positions. 623 We noted that this
approach was consistent with the capital standards of the prudential regulators with respect to
foreign banks that are bank holding companies subject to the Federal Reserve Board of
Governors’ supervision. 624
One commenter supported our preliminary view that a non-U.S. person’s guaranteed
positions would not be attributed to the guarantor if the guaranteed non-U.S. person is subject to
capital regulation by the Commission, the CFTC, or capital standards in its home jurisdiction that
are consistent with the Basel Accord. 625 Another commenter sought clarification that a U.S.
guarantor will not be required to attribute transactions of guaranteed entities while the
guaranteed person’s registration as a major security-based swap participant is pending. 626
(b) Final Rules
Although the final rules require, in some circumstances, both the guarantor and the
guaranteed person to include guaranteed positions in their respective major security-based swap
participant threshold calculations, the final rules do not require a guarantor to attribute
guaranteed positions to itself when the guaranteed person is subject to capital regulation by the

Commission or the CFTC (including, but not limited to regulation as a swap dealer, major swap
participant, security-based swap dealer, major security-based swap participant, futures
commission merchant, broker, or dealer). 627 This codifies our preliminary view. 628 The final
rule, moreover, does not require a guarantor to attribute to itself positions that it guarantees when
the guaranteed person is regulated as a bank in the United States, or is subject to capital
standards adopted by its home country supervisor that are consistent in all respects with the
Basel Accord. 629 Consistent with our preliminary view, we believe that consistent foreign
regulatory capital requirements would adequately address the risks arising from such positions,
making it unnecessary to separately address the risks associated with guarantees of those same
positions.630 We continue to view such regulatory treatment as adequate to address the risks that
the attribution requirement is intended to address. We also note that this approach is consistent
with the capital standards of the prudential regulators with respect to foreign banks that are bank
holding companies subject to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors’ supervision.
As noted above, one commenter requested that a U.S. guarantor not be required to
attribute to itself a person’s positions for which it provides a guarantee while that person’s

Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30689. This approach generally is consistent with the
CFTC Cross-Border Guidance. See CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, 78 FR at 45326 (stating that
“where a subsidiary is subject to Basel-compliant capital standards and oversight by a G20
prudential supervisor, the subsidiary’s positions would generally not be attributed to a parental
guarantor in the computation of the parent’s outward exposure under the MSP definition”).

registration as a major security-based swap participant is pending. 631 Upon further
consideration, we believe that it is appropriate to permit a guarantor not to attribute the positions
of such entities to itself. This change will mitigate market disruption that may otherwise result
due to the prospect of a person intermittently exceeding the major participant threshold when a
person that it guarantees is in the process of registering as a major security-based swap
participant. This approach is also consistent with the approach under the application of the de
minimis exception that allows a person not to count the transactions of its affiliates that are in the
process of registering as dealers. 632
F. Other Issues Related to the Application of the Major Security-Based Swap Participant
Definition
1. Threshold for Registration as a Major Security-Based Swap Participant
One commenter commented generally that the threshold for having to register as a majorsecurity-based swap participant is too high. 633 This threshold, however, was adopted in the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release and is not under consideration in this rulemaking. In
addition, the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release provided that the Commission staff will
prepare a report subsequent to the effectiveness of the security-based swap reporting
requirements that will examine a number of aspects of our definitional rules and related
interpretations, including relevant major security-based swap participant thresholds. 634

2. Entities that Maintain Legacy Portfolios
The Cross-Border Proposing Release did not address the treatment of legacy portfolios,
but we stated in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release that “the fact that these entities
no longer engage in new swap or security-based swap transactions does not overcome the fact
that entities that are major participants will have portfolios that are quite large and could pose
systemic risk to the U.S. financial system.” 635 Based on this understanding, the Commissions
jointly determined that such entities should not be excluded from major participant regulation but
explained that the Commissions would pay particular attention to special issues raised by the
application of substantive rules to those legacy portfolios. 636
In the Commission’s proposed capital and margin requirements, we proposed exceptions
from certain account equity requirements, such as collection of margin, for non-bank securitybased swap dealers’ and non-bank major security-based swap participants’ accounts holding
legacy security-based swaps and we requested comment on these proposals. 637 As explained in
the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, we may entertain requests for relief or guidance
on a case-by-case basis. 638 One commenter requested that, at a minimum, the Commission
provide flexibility in any requirements that require a person to register as a major security-based
swap participant solely due to activity related to its legacy portfolios. 639 With respect to the

activities of financial guaranty insurers, one commenter suggested that amendments made to an
existing insured security-based swap or entry into a new security-based swap with the same or a
substituted counterparty in connection with loss mitigation or risk reduction efforts, should
receive the same regulatory treatment given to legacy portfolio security-based swaps because
such security-based swaps do not increase notional exposure. 640
In the context of the cross-border application of the major security-based swap participant
definition, we are maintaining our approach to legacy portfolios as described in the Intermediary
Definitions Adopting Release and are not excluding entities that maintain legacy portfolios from
the major security-based swap participant definition. 641 Given the foregoing, we are not
adopting an exclusion from the cross-border application of the major security-based swap
participant definition for entities that maintain legacy portfolios.
G. Foreign Public Sector Financial Institutions and Government-Related Entities
In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, we did not propose to specifically address the
treatment of entities such as foreign central banks, international financial institutions, multilateral
development banks, and sovereign wealth funds in the context of the major security-based swap
participant definition and instead sought comment regarding the types, levels, and natures of
security-based swap participant threshold within 12 to 14 months of the effective date due to
projected run-off or terminations); AFGI Letter II at 2-5; AFGI letter, dated February 18, 2011

security-based swap activity that such organizations regularly engage in in order to allow us to
better understand the roles of these organizations in the security-based swap markets. 642
The final rule defining “U.S. person” (like the proposed definition of that term)
specifically excludes several foreign public sector financial institutions and their agencies and
pension plans, and more generally excludes any other similar international organization and its
agencies and pension plans. 643 As explained in the context of the de minimis exception, certain
commenters requested that we take further action to address the application of the dealer
definition and its de minimis exception to security-based swap activities involving such
organizations. 644 Additionally, we noted that two commenters stated that they should not be
subject to the possibility of dealer regulation for comity reasons, on the grounds that they were
arms of a foreign government. 645 Commenters did not make arguments specific to the
application of the major security-based swap participant definition but articulated their
arguments in conjunction with their arguments related to the application of the dealer definition.
However, one commenter explained that, though it understands that multilateral development
banks do not currently engage in security-based swap at the level that would trigger major
security-based swap participant registration, even if they did, regulation would violate their

642

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31034-35. See section IV.C.2(e) and Exchange
Act rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(iii) (listing the international organizations that are excluded from the
definition of “U.S. person”).

644

See, e.g., WB/IFC Letter at 2-4, 6-7 (also stating that such organizations should not be required
to register as major participants or to clear security-based swaps, and that affiliates of such
organizations should be excluded from the “U.S. person” definition); SC Letter at 16-24
(contending that the privileged and immunities afforded such organizations would be violated by
their direct regulation as dealers or major participants, or by direct regulation equivalents, and
that affiliates of such organizations also are immune from regulation); IDB Letter at 5. See note

privileges and immunities. 646
As discussed in the context of the de minimis exception, it is our view that such issues are
outside the scope of this release given that the source of any such privileges and immunities is
found outside of the Dodd-Frank Act and the federal securities laws. 647
Similar to the discussion in the context of the de minimis exception, commenters also
stated that non-U.S. persons should not have to count their security-based swap positions
involving these organizations against their major security-based swap participant threshold
calculations on the basis that counting such positions would constitute the impermissible
regulation of such organizations. 648 As discussed in the context of the de minimis exception, we
do not agree with the suggestion that counting a person’s positions with such organizations
against the major participant calculation thresholds – when otherwise provided for by the rules –
involves the regulation of such organizations. 649 Requiring a person to count, against their major
participant calculation thresholds, the person’s positions involving such an international
organization as counterparty simply reflects the application of the federal securities laws to that
person and its positions, and does not constitute the regulation of the international
organization. 650 A person’s security-based swap positions with such an international
organization are considered the same, for purposes of applying the major participant calculation
thresholds and other Title VII requirements, as a position with some other non-U.S. person
counterparty.

H. Economic Analysis of Final Rules Regarding “Major Security-Based Swap
Participants”
These final rules and guidance regarding the cross-border implementation of the
application of the definition of major security-based swap participants will affect the costs and
benefits of major security-based swap participant regulation by determining which positions will
be counted against a market participant’s major security-based swap participant calculation
thresholds. 651 The cross-border rules have the potential to be important in determining the extent
to which the risk mitigation and other benefits of Title VII are achieved, by identifying those
market participants with sufficiently large exposures to raise the types of systemic risk concerns
that the major security-based swap participant definition was intended to address. 652
As discussed in the context of the cost-benefit analysis of the application of the de
minimis exception in the cross-border context, commenters addressed cost-benefit issues from a
variety of perspectives, including arguing that cost-benefit principles warranted greater
harmonization with the approaches taken by the CFTC or foreign regulators. 653 Commenters,
however, did not separately address cost-benefit issues related to the application of the major
security-based swap participant definition.
We have taken economic effects into account in adopting these final cross-border rules
and providing guidance. Because security-based swap contracts are associated with complex
risks and the markets are highly interconnected, we believe that positions that exist within the
United States, which are most likely to expose the U.S. financial system to financial risk, should
651

See section IV.I, supra; see also Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30666
(explaining that in developing the rules further defining “substantial position,” we were mindful
of the costs associated with regulating major participants and considered cost and benefit
principles as part of that analysis).

652

See section III.A, supra.

See section IV.I, supra.

248

generally be included in the major security-based swap participant threshold calculations. At the
same time, we recognize that the cross-border application of Title VII has the potential to reduce
liquidity within the U.S. market to the extent it increases the costs of entering into security-based
swaps or provides incentives for particular market participants to avoid the U.S. market to
operate wholly outside the Title VII framework. 654
As addressed in the analysis of the costs and benefits of our application of the de minimis
rule, the application of the major security-based swap participant definition implicates two types
of costs and benefits: assessment costs and programmatic costs and benefits. 655 First, certain
current and future participants in the security-based swap market will incur assessment costs in
connection with determining whether they fall within the “major security-based swap
participant” definition and thus would have to register with the Commission.
Second, the registration and regulation of some entities as major security-based swap
participants will lead to programmatic costs and benefits arising as a consequence of the Title
VII requirements that apply to registered major security-based swap participants. 656
We discuss these costs and benefits associated with the final rules more fully below. We
also discuss the economic impact of certain potential alternatives to the approach taken in the
final rules.
1. Programmatic Costs and Benefits
(a) Cost-benefit Considerations of the Final Rules
Exchange Act rule 3a67-10 will permit market participants to exclude certain of their
positions from their major security-based swap participant threshold calculations, and thus may
654

See id., supra.

655

See id., supra.

656

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31139.

249

cause particular entities that engage in security-based swap transactions not to be regulated as
major security-based swap participants. The rules accordingly may be expected to affect the
programmatic costs and benefits associated with the regulation of major security-based swap
participants under Title VII, given that those costs and benefits are determined in part by which
persons will be regulated as major security-based swap participants. 657
As discussed in the context of the application of the de minimis exception, this does not
mean that there is a one-to-one relationship between a person not being a “major security-based
swap participant” as a result of these cross-border rules, and the resulting change to
programmatic benefits and costs. 658 In practice, we believe that these rules will focus the
regulation of major security-based swap participants on those market participants whose
security-based swap positions may expose the U.S. financial system to the levels of risk we
identified as warranting regulation as a major security-based swap participant in the Intermediary
Definitions Adopting Release, or on the prevention of evasion. To the extent that a person’s
positions within the United States remain below these thresholds, we believe that regulating it as
a major security-based swap participant under Title VII would be less likely to produce the types
of programmatic benefits that Title VII was intended to address. In other words, these
requirements will direct the application of the major security-based swap participant definition –
which itself is the product of cost-benefit considerations – towards those entities whose securitybased swap positions are most likely to pose the type and level of risk to the U.S. financial
system that Title VII was intended to mitigate.

657

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30727.

658

See section IV.I.1(a) and note 431, supra (discussing various fixed and variable costs).

250

As such, the rules reflect our assessment and evaluation of programmatic costs and
benefits:
• Positions of U.S. persons – Requiring U.S. persons, as defined in the final rules
(including the foreign branches of such persons), to include all of their positions in their
major participant threshold calculations, addresses risks that these positions pose to the
U.S. financial system.
• Positions guaranteed by U.S. persons – Requiring non-U.S. persons to include in
their major security-based swap participant threshold calculations all their positions that are
guaranteed by a U.S. person, where their counterparties have recourse to the guarantor,
reflects both the economic reality of the position – that the position exists within the United
States – and addresses the risks posed to the U.S. financial system by the positions of such
persons that are guaranteed by U.S. persons. 659
• Positions with U.S.-person counterparties – Requiring non-U.S. persons to
include their positions with counterparties that are U.S. persons, unless the positions are
with a foreign branch of a registered security-based swap dealer, addresses risks to the U.S.
financial system arising from positions entered into with U.S. persons. 660
• Attribution of certain positions to guarantors of performance under a securitybased swap – Requiring guarantors of performance under security-based swaps to attribute
to themselves, for purposes of their own major security-based swap participant threshold
calculations, positions that they guarantee, addresses risks that guarantees pose to the U.S.
financial system. To the extent that the guarantee involves a position within the United

660

See Exchange Act rule 3a67-10(b)(3)(i); section V.D.1; see also note 437, supra (discussing
rationale for this limitation in context of de minimis exception).

251

States or brings a position within the United States, our final rules would typically require
attribution to the guarantor. These requirements are intended to help ensure that positions
that pose risks to the U.S. financial system are included in the guarantor’s major participant
threshold calculations. 661
• Positions subject to anti-evasion provisions – Requiring conduit affiliates to
include all of their positions in their major participant threshold calculations addresses, in a
targeted manner, the potential for evasion of the major security-based swap participant
requirements of Title VII. 662 As noted above we are adopting a definition of “conduit
affiliate” that excludes affiliates of registered security-based swap dealers and major
security-based swap participants to avoid imposing costs on registered persons in situations
that would not appear to implicate the types of evasion concerns that the conduit affiliate
definition is intended to address.
In short, these final rules apply the major security-based swap participant definition –
which itself reflects cost-benefit considerations 663 – to cross-border security-based swap
positions in a way that directs the focus of major participant regulation toward those entities
whose security-based swap positions may expose the U.S. financial system to the levels of risk
we identified as warranting regulation as a major security-based swap participant.
(b) Evaluation of Programmatic Impacts
In defining “substantial position” and “substantial counterparty exposure” as part of the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, we sought to capture persons whose security-based

663

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30666 (explaining that in developing
the rules further defining “substantial position,” we were mindful of the costs associated with
regulating major participants and considered cost and benefit principles as part of that analysis).

252

swap positions pose sufficient risk to counterparties and the markets generally that regulation as
a market participant was warranted, without imposing costs of Title VII on those entities for
which regulation currently may not be justified in light of the purposes of the statute. 664 As
discussed above in the context of the dealer analysis, we estimated in the Intermediary
Definitions Adopting Release that, under those rules, approximately 12 entities had outstanding
positions large enough that they would likely carry out threshold calculations and that fewer than
five entities, and potentially zero, would ultimately be required to register as major securitybased swap participants. 665 Those estimates provide a baseline against which the Commission
can analyze the programmatic costs and benefits and assessment costs of the final rules applying
the major security-based swap participant definition to cross-border activities.
We believe the methodology used in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release also
664

See id. at 30724-25.

665

See id. at 30727 and note 1529; section III.A.2.
That methodology determined that an entity that margins its positions would need to have
security-based swap positions approaching $100 billion to reach the levels of potential future
exposure required to meet the substantial position threshold, even before accounting for the
impact of netting, while an entity that clears its security based swaps generally would need to
have positions approaching $200 billion. We believed that it was reasonable to assume that most
entities that will have security-based swap positions large enough to potentially cause them to be
major participants in practice will post variation margin in connection with those positions that
they do not clear, making $100 billion the relevant measure. The available data from 2011
showed that only one entity had aggregate gross notional positions (i.e., aggregate buy and sell
notional positions) in single-name CDS exceeding $100 billion, and three other entities had
aggregate gross notional positions between $50 and $100 billion. We explained, however, that an
entity’s positions reflecting single-name credit protection sold to its counterparties, as opposed to
purchased, may be expected to be a more key determinant of potential future exposure under
those rules. The data showed that zero entities had more than $100 billion in positions arising
from selling single-name credit protection and that only two entities had between $50 and $100
billion arising from such positions. See id. at 30727, 30734 and note 1529.
In the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, we noted that to the extent that an entity’s
security-based swap positions are not cleared or associated with the posting of variation margin,
security-based swap positions of $20 billion may lead to sufficient potential future exposure to
cause the entity to be a major participant, though we believed that few, if any, entities would have
a significant number of such positions. The data indicated that only 32 entities have notional CDS
positions in excess of $10 billion. See id. at note 1529.

253

is appropriate for considering the potential programmatic costs and benefits associated with the
final cross-border rules. This methodology particularly can help provide context as to how rules
regarding the cross-border application of the definition of major security-based swap participant
may change the number of entities that must register as major security-based swap participants,
and thus help provide perspective regarding the corresponding impact on the programmatic costs
and benefits of Title VII. Applying that methodology to 2012 data regarding the single-name
CDS market suggests that under these final rules five or fewer entities may have to register as
major security-based swap participants – a number that is consistent with our estimates in the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release. 666
The factors that are described in more detail in section IV.I.1(b) regarding the application
of the de minimis exception are also relevant to and may impact the programmatic benefits and
costs associated with the implementation of the cross-border application of the major securitybased swap participant definition. Those factors include limitations of the methodology and data
used, the impact of the not yet finalized rules implementing Title VII entity-level and
transaction-level requirements applicable to major security-based swap participants, market
participants’ modifications to their business structure or practices in response to the final rules,
and the impact on market participants of other regulatory requirements that are analogous to the

666

See note 444, supra (noting that the data on which the methodology is based has been updated).
Consistent with the methodology used in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, the
2012 data indicated that two entities had aggregate gross notional positions (i.e., aggregate buy
and sell notional positions) in single-name CDS exceeding $100 billion. Applying the principles
reflected in these final rules regarding the counting of positions against the major security-based
swap participant thresholds suggests that two entities would have aggregate gross notional
positions in single name CDS exceeding $100 billion. No additional entities would be required to
register as a result of aggregation. Based on this data, we believe that it is reasonable to conclude
that five or fewer entities ultimately may register as major security-based swap participants.

254

major security-based swap participant requirements. 667
In general, however, and consistent with our territorial approach, we believe that these
rules are targeted appropriately and do not apply major security-based swap participant
regulation to those entities whose positions have a more limited impact on the U.S. financial
system and hence whose regulation as a major security-based swap participant under Title VII
would be less linked to programmatic benefits (i.e., non-U.S. persons that engage in securitybased swap transactions entirely, or almost entirely, outside the United States with non-U.S.
persons or with certain foreign branches), while applying major participant regulation to those
entities whose positions would be more likely to produce programmatic benefits under Title VII.
The nexus between specific aspects of these requirements and the programmatic costs and
benefits also is addressed below in connection with our consideration of various alternatives to
the approach taken in the final rules.
Finally, as discussed in the context of the de minimis exception, we recognize that the
U.S. market participants and positions regulated under Title VII are a subset of the overall global
security-based swap market and that shocks to risk or liquidity arising from a foreign entity’s
positions outside the United States may spill into the United States. 668 We also have considered
these spillovers in connection with our analysis of the effects of these final cross-border rules on
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. 669
2. Assessment Costs
The analysis of how these cross-border rules will affect the assessment costs associated
with the “major security-based swap participant” definition is related to the assessment cost

255

analysis described in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 670 but must also account
for certain issues specific to these cross-border rules. While in certain regards those assessment
costs can more readily be estimated than the programmatic effects discussed above, the
assessment costs associated with the cross-border application of the Title VII major participant
requirements will be considerably less significant than those programmatic effects.
The Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release addressed how certain market
participants could be expected to incur costs in connection with their determination of whether
they have a “substantial position” in security-based swaps or pose “substantial counterparty
exposure” created by their security-based swaps, which is necessary for determining whether
they are major security-based swap participants. 671 In that release we estimated that as many as
12 entities would likely perceive the need to perform these calculations, given the size of their
security-based swap positions. 672 We preliminarily believed that entities that perceive the need
to perform the threshold calculations as a result of the proposed rules and guidance set forth in
the Cross-Border Proposing Release would incur only relatively minor incremental costs to those
described in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release. 673 Based on the estimate that no
more than 12 entities would perceive the need to engage in the analysis of whether they are a
major security-based swap participant, we estimated that the total legal costs associated with
evaluating the various elements of the definition may approach $360,000. 674

256

As discussed in the context of the de minimis exception, application of these cross-border
rules can be expected to affect the assessment costs that market participants will incur. In part,
certain non-U.S. persons may be expected to incur personnel costs and legal costs – beyond the
legal costs addressed as part of the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release – associated with
analyzing these cross-border rules and developing systems and procedures to assess which
transactions would have to be counted against the major security-based swap participant
calculation thresholds (or with the purpose of avoiding positions that pose risk to the United
States financial system that would be sufficient to meet the applicable thresholds). On the other
hand, while certain market participants also would incur additional legal costs associated with
the major security-based swap participant determination (i.e., the assessment of whether
particular positions should be included in the major participant threshold calculations) addressed
in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, the application of the cross-border rules may
reduce the number of entities that incur such legal costs. 675
In adopting these rules we estimate the assessment costs that market participants may
incur as a result. As discussed below, however, these costs in practice may be mitigated in large
part by steps that market participants already have taken in response to other regulatory
initiatives, including compliance actions taken in connection with the requirements applicable to
swaps.
(a) Legal Costs
The implementation of these cross-border rules in some circumstances has the potential

variation margin, $20 billion in notional CDS positions may be sufficient exposure to cause the
entity to be a major participant and that 32 entities have notional CDS positions exceeding $10
billion).
675

See section IV.I.2, supra.

257

to change the legal costs identified in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, including
by adding new categories of legal costs that non-U.S. persons may incur in connection with
applying the major security-based swap participant definition in the cross-border context.
Legal costs related to the cross-border application of major security-based swap
participant definition – As discussed in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, certain
market participants will incur assessment costs related to the analysis of whether their positions
rise to the levels set by the major security-based swap participant definition. For purposes of that
release, we assumed that entities with aggregate gross notional single-name CDS positions
exceeding $25 billion may identify a need to perform the major participant analysis. 676 Based on
that figure, we estimated that 12 entities would perceive the need to perform the major
participant analysis. 677
Under the final rules described above, available data from 2012 indicates that
approximately nine persons will have relevant positions exceeding $25 billion, and we continue
to believe that firms whose positions exceed this amount will be likely to perform the major
participant threshold analysis. 678 Of those nine, five entities are not domiciled in the United
States. Consistent with our view in the proposing release, we expect that non-U.S. firms in this
set will incur additional costs beyond those described in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting
Release. These additional costs would arise due to information that non-U.S. market participants
676

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at note 1529.

677

Based on data as of December 2011, in that release we found that 1 entity had aggregate gross
notional positions from bought and sold credit protection exceeding $100 billion, 4 entities had
aggregate gross notional single-name CDS positions exceeding $50 million, and 12 entities had
aggregate gross notional CDS positions exceeding $25 billion. See id. at 30734 n. 1529.

678

See section III.A.1, supra. The difference between this and our previous estimate of 12 entities
reflects changes in security-based swap activity since the Intermediary Definitions Adopting
Release and the final rules’ treatment of positions between non-U.S. persons in the absence of
guarantees from U.S. persons.

258

would have to collect and maintain in order to calculate the size of positions that count towards
the major participant thresholds. Consistent with our analysis in the Intermediary Definitions
Adopting Release, we believe that it is reasonable to conclude that at least some entities with
security-based swap positions approaching the major participant thresholds are likely to seek
legal counsel for interpretation of various aspects of the rules pertaining to the major participant
definition. 679 Though the costs associated with obtaining such legal services would vary
depending on the facts and circumstances regarding an entity’s positions, we believe that
$40,000 is a reasonable estimate of the upper end of the range of the costs of obtaining the
services of outside counsel in undertaking the legal analysis of the entity’s status as a major
security-based swap participant. 680
Legal costs related to systems analysis – As noted in the assessment cost analysis related
to the de minimis exception (and in addition to the estimates in the Cross-Border Proposing
Release), we believe that it is reasonable to conclude that those five entities not domiciled in the
United States may have to incur one-time legal expenses related to the development of systems
and analysis expenses – discussed below – to identify which of their security-based swap
positions potentially must be counted for purposes of the major security-based swap participant

679

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30735.

680

The average cost incurred by such entities in connection with outside counsel is based on staff
experience in undertaking legal analysis of status under federal securities laws. The staff believes
that costs associated with obtaining outside legal counsel relating to such determinations range
from $20,000 to $40,000 depending on the complexity of the entity. See id. at 30735-36 n. 1537
(estimating the upper bound of such costs at $30,000). We note that the additional $10,000 added
to the estimate in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release is intended to account for the
additional complexity that non-U.S. persons may face in performing the analysis.
These estimates do not reflect a new category of costs arising from the cross-border rules. They
instead are a revision of a category of previously identified costs that market participants may
incur in obtaining legal services to assist in performing the major participant analysis, using
newer data and reflecting only positions that are counted under the final cross-border rules.

259

analysis, consistent with these cross-border rules. As in the dealer context, this additional cost
estimate reflects the fact that the development of such systems and procedures must address
cross-border rules that require accounting for factors such as whether an entity’s security-based
swaps are subject to guarantees from U.S. persons, whether its counterparties are U.S. persons,
and, specific to the major security-based swap participant analysis, whether the entity must
attribute the position to itself pursuant to the attribution rules. As in the analysis of assessment
costs related to the dealer definition, we estimate that such legal costs would amount to
approximately $30,400 per entity, and that those five entities would incur total costs of
approximately $152,000. 681
(b) Costs Related to New Systems, Analysis, and Representations
Transaction-monitoring systems – The elements introduced by the final cross-border
rules may cause certain non-U.S. persons to implement systems to identify whether their
positions exceed the major security-based swap participant calculation thresholds. Such systems
may reflect the need for non-U.S. persons to: (i) identify whether their counterparties are “U.S.
persons”; (ii) determine whether their positions with U.S. persons arise from transactions
conducted through a foreign branch (which itself requires consideration of whether their
counterparty is a “foreign branch”) and – of those – determine which positions involve a foreign
branch of a U.S. bank that itself is a registered security-based swap dealer; (iii) determine
whether particular positions are subject to a recourse guarantee against a U.S. person; and (iv)
evaluate the applicability of the attribution rules. 682 Our estimates for the required systems are
the same in the major participant analysis as they are in the dealer analysis: one-time
681

See section IV.I.2(a) and note 460 (addressing calculations of costs), supra.

682

We do not believe that a potential major security-based swap participant will need to use any
systems to determine if it is a “conduit affiliate.” See note 462, supra.

260

programming costs of $14,904 and ongoing annual systems costs of $16,612 per entity. 683
Analysis of counterparty status, including representations – As discussed in the context of
the de minimis exception, non-U.S. market participants would be likely to incur costs arising
from the need to assess the potential U.S.-person status of their counterparties, which we would
typically expect to be dealers, and in some cases to obtain and maintain records related to
representations regarding their counterparty’s U.S.-person status. 684 We anticipate that non-U.S.
persons are likely to review existing information about their counterparties to assess whether
those counterparties are U.S. persons. 685 Non-U.S. persons at times may also request and
maintain representations from their dealer and non-dealer counterparties to help determine or
confirm their counterparties’ status. 686 Accordingly, as in the discussion of dealer assessment
costs, in our view, such assessment costs primarily would encompass one-time costs to review
and assess existing information regarding counterparty domicile, principal place of business, and
other factors relevant to potential U.S.-person status, as well as one-time costs associated with
requesting and collecting representations from counterparties. 687 The costs associated with
representations in the context of the major participant analysis would be one-time costs of

participants may seek representations as to whether positions arise from transactions conducted
through a foreign branch of a U.S. bank that is registered as a security-based swap dealer and also
noting our understanding that few, if any, U.S. persons may participant in the single-name CDS
market through their foreign branches).

261

approximately $24,200 per firm. 688
Monitoring of counterparty status – Also as addressed in the context of the de minimis
exception, market participants may be expected to adapt their systems to monitor the status of
their counterparties for purposes of future security-based swap activities, which would allow
market participants to maintain records of counterparty status for purposes of conducting the
major participant assessment. 689 Market participants also may need to monitor for the presence
of information that may indicate that the representations they have received are outdated or
otherwise are not valid. 690 The costs associated with adapting the systems described above to
monitor the status of their counterparties for purposes of their future security-based swaps would

688

See section IV.I.2(b), supra. The cumulative estimate is based on the same methodology and
SIFMA Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013 data that we used to
estimate these one-time costs for dealers. See note 467, supra. With respect to major securitybased swap participants, we conservatively assume that each of the non-U.S. firms will have 30
single-name CDS counterparties (based on data indicating that the five non-U.S. firms persons
with total single-name CDS positions in 2012 exceeding $25 billion all had fewer than 45
counterparties in connection with single-name CDS, which produces an estimate of 15 hours of
compliance staff time and 15 hours of legal staff time per firm. Based upon data from SIFMA’s
Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013 (modified by the
Commission staff to account for an 1800-hour-work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for
bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead), the staff estimates that the average national
hourly rate for a senior compliance examiner is $217 and that the average national hourly rate for
an in-house attorney is $380; this leads to a cumulative estimate of $9,000 per firm for such costs.
Consistent with the Cross-Border Proposing Release, moreover, this estimate is further based on
estimated 40 hours of in-house legal or compliance staff’s time (based on the above rate of $380
per hour for an in-house attorney) to establish a procedure of requesting and collecting
representations from trading counterparties, taking into account that such representation may be
incorporated into standardized trading documentation used by market participants. This leads to
an estimate of $15,200 per firm for such costs. See section IV.I.2(b) and note 467, supra.

689

We also recognize that the final rules requiring attribution may impose certain additional
monitoring costs on market participants whose position in a security-based swap is guaranteed by
another entity and on the entities that provide the guarantee. We anticipate that the guarantors
may receive reports from the market participants whose position is guaranteed in order to allow
the guarantors to monitor the amount of such positions for purposes of determining whether the
positions attributed to the guarantor rise to the level that would require them to register as a major
security-based swap participant.

690

See section IV.I.2(b) and note 469, supra.

262

be the same as the costs in the dealer analysis: one-time costs of approximately $12,436. 691
Summary of systems, analysis, and representation costs – The summary of costs that
certain non-U.S. market participants would incur in connection with systems, analysis of
counterparty status and representations in connection with these cross-border rules would be
approximately $51,500 in one-time costs 692 and $16,612 in estimated annual ongoing costs. 693
Based on our estimate, subject to the limitations associated with the use of data analysis
discussed above, that five non-U.S. domiciled entities will incur these assessment costs, we
estimate that the total one-time industry-wide costs associated with establishing such systems
would amount to approximately $257,500 and total ongoing costs would amount to
approximately $83,100.
(c) Overall Considerations Related to Assessment Costs
In sum, we believe that the effect of these final cross-border rules would be an
increase over the amounts that otherwise would be incurred by certain non-U.S. market
participants, both in terms of additional categories of legal costs and in terms of the need to
develop certain systems and procedures. As discussed in the context of the assessment costs
applicable to the dealer analysis, we believe that requiring certain non-U.S. persons to incur such
assessment costs is an unavoidable adjunct to the implementation of a set of rules that are
691

See section IV.I.2(b) and note 468 (noting that parties may structure their relationships in a way
that will not require a separate representation in conjunction with each individual position) and
470, supra (describing calculations for this estimate).

692

Consistent with the above discussion, the estimated one-time costs of $51,500 represent: the
costs to establish a system to assess the status of their positions under the definitions and other
provisions specific to these cross-border rules ($14,904); the costs related to the assessment of
counterparty status, including costs of assessing existing information and of requesting and
obtaining representations, as well as costs of related procedures ($24,200); and the costs for
monitoring the status of their counterparties for purposes of their future security-based swap
activities ($12,436). See section IV.I.2(b) and note 471, supra.

693

See section IV.I.2(b), supra.

263

appropriately tailored to apply the “major security-based swap participant” definition under Title
VII to a global security-based swap market in a way that yields the relevant benefits associated
with the regulation of major participants and achieves the benefits of Title VII. 694 The benefits
of Title VII’s regulatory requirements applicable to major security-based swap participants could
be undermined if a significant portion of positions held by non-U.S. persons that impose risk on
the U.S. financial system were excluded from the Title VII framework. In certain respects,
however, decisions embedded in these final rules are designed to avoid imposing assessment
costs upon market participants. 695
As explained in the context of the analysis for dealers, we recognize that our estimates of
assessment costs may result in an overestimation as such costs may be tempered to the extent
that market participants’ assessments correspond to the assessments they otherwise would follow
due to other regulatory requirements or business practices, particularly with respect to
assessments they may have made regarding the U.S.-person status of their counterparties. 696
Also as noted in the dealer discussion, we acknowledge that certain aspects of the final
rules may differ from those of the CFTC, which may result in higher costs for market
participants, but we believe that such differences are justified and we discuss those differences in
the substantive discussions of the specific rules. 697 We also recognize other factors that may
impact the assessment costs for potential major security-based swap participants, such as the
possibility that certain market participants will choose to restructure their business to avoid

major security-based swap participant regulation. 698
3. Alternative Approaches
As discussed above, the final rules incorporate a number of provisions designed to focus
Title VII major security-based swap participant regulation upon those persons whose securitybased swap positions may raise the risks within the United States that the major participant
definition was intended to address. 699
In adopting these final rules we have considered alternative approaches suggested by
commenters, including the economic effects of following such alternative approaches. In
considering the economic impact of potential alternatives, we have sought to isolate the
individual alternatives to the extent practicable, while recognizing that many of those alternatives
are not mutually exclusive. 700
We further have considered such potential alternatives in light of the methodologies
discussed above, by assessing the extent to which following particular alternatives would be
expected to increase or decrease the number of entities that ultimately would be expected to be
regulated as major security-based swap participants under the final rules, as well as the
corresponding economic impact. Analysis of the available data would tend to suggest that
various alternative approaches suggested by commenters would not produce any changes in the
numbers of market participants that may have to be regulated as major security-based swap
participants. These results are subject to the above limitations, however, including limitations
regarding the ability to quantitatively assess how market participants may adjust their future
activities in response to the rules we adopt or for independent reasons. Accordingly, while such
698

See section V.A, supra.

700

Cf. section IV.I.3, supra.

265

analyses provide some context regarding alternatives, their use as tools for illustrating the
economic effects of such alternatives is limited.
(a) Security-based Swap Positions Held by Foreign Branches of U.S. Banks
As with the final rules in the context of the de minimis exception, the final rules applying
the major security-based swap participant definition require U.S. banks to count all positions of
their foreign branches against the major participant calculation thresholds, even when the
counterparty is a non-U.S. person or another foreign branch of a U.S. person. The proposed
definition of “U.S. person” plays a central role in the application of Title VII in the cross-border
context, directly affecting which positions a person must include in its major security-based swap
participant threshold calculations and ultimately, the number of entities that will register as major
security-based swap participants. An alternative approach would permit U.S. persons not to
include the positions of their foreign branches in their major security based swap participant
calculation thresholds. As discussed above, we believe our approach to U.S. persons as described
above, is consistent with our overall territorial approach to the application of Title VII
requirements to the cross-border security-based swap market, because it requires that major
security-based swap participant calculation thresholds include the positions of such persons that
are most likely to cause risk to the U.S. financial system at the threshold levels set in the major
security-based swap participant definition. 701 For the reasons discussed above, we believe that it
is appropriate for a U.S. person to include in its calculation thresholds positions conducted
through foreign branches to the same extent as other positions help by U.S. persons. 702
As in the dealer analysis, using the 2012 data to assess the impact associated with this

701

See section II.B.2(c), supra.

702

See section V.B.2, supra.

266

alternative does not indicate a change to our estimate that up to five entities potentially would
register as major security-based swap participants, and the analysis is subject to the limitations
discussed in the context of the dealer analysis. 703 Adopting an alternative approach that does not
require foreign branches to count their positions with non-U.S. persons could incentivize U.S.
persons to execute higher volumes through their branches. 704
(b) Positions of Non-U.S. Persons for which the Counterparty has Rights of
Recourse Against a U.S. Person
The final rules require a non-U.S. person to count, against its major security-based swap
participant calculation thresholds, positions for which the non-U.S. person’s performance in
connection with the transaction is subject to a recourse guarantee against a U.S. person.
Although the proposal instead would have treated such guaranteed affiliates like any other nonU.S. persons, we believe that this provision is appropriate for the reasons discussed above,
including the fact that such recourse guarantees pose risks to the U.S. financial system via the
guarantor. 705
This aspect of the final rules reflects a middle ground between commenter views, as is
discussed above regarding the approach taken in the dealer analysis. 706 The same two
alternatives that are presented in the analysis of alternatives to the approach to the dealer final
rules are relevant to the discussion of the application of the major security-based swap
participant definition – one alternative in which the final rules do not address guarantees at all,
and one in which (based on the concept of a de facto guarantee) all affiliates of a U.S. person

267

should have to count their security-based swap positions against the calculation thresholds, with
a potential exception if they demonstrate to the market that there will be no guarantee. 707 A third
alternative and the approach taken in the proposal would require the non-U.S. person to include
in its threshold calculations only those positions with U.S. persons that are not guaranteed but
would require those positions that are guaranteed to be attributed to the U.S. person guarantor for
purposes of its own threshold calculations.
The analysis of the first two alternatives discussed in the context of the application of the
dealer requirements above also applies in the context of applying the major security-based swap
participant definition. 708 The third alternative, which is the approach taken in the proposal, may
have reduced programmatic benefits by increasing the likelihood that, even when a person
exceeds the thresholds by virtue of its own positions, which exist within the United States by
virtue of the U.S. person guarantor, it will not be subject to direct regulation as a major
participant. 709 Under the proposed approach, only the U.S. person guarantor would have counted
the positions for which the non-U.S. person’s counterparty had rights of recourse against the U.S.
person, meaning that such positions would not be accounted for in the major participant
threshold calculations of the entity that directly enters into the positions. The economic reality of
such positions is that by virtue of the guarantee the non-U.S. person effectively acts together
with a U.S. person to engage in the security-based swap activity that results in the positions, and
the non-U.S. person’s positions cannot reasonably be isolated from the U.S. person’s

See section IV.I.3(b), supra (explaining that not requiring non-U.S. persons to include positions
for which their counterparty has a recourse guarantee against a U.S. person could incentivize U.S.

person to include all of its positions in its major security-based swap participant calculation
thresholds may negatively impact liquidity).

709

See section II.B.2(c), supra.

268

engagement in providing the guarantee. 710 The final rule reflects this economic reality by
requiring the non-U.S. person whose position is guaranteed to include such positions in its major
security-based swap participant threshold calculations. 711
For the foregoing reasons, we believe that the approach taken in the final rules is
appropriate. We note that an assessment of the data regarding the first alternative does not
indicate a change in the number of entities that may be expected to register as major securitybased swap participants. 712 Due to data limitations that prevent us from identifying which
individual transactions of non-U.S. persons are subject to guarantees by U.S. persons and data
limitations preventing us from obtaining information about the single-name security-based swap
transactions of non-U.S. domiciled persons for single-name CDS involving a non-U.S. reference
entity, the available data does not enable us to assess the second and third alternatives. 713
(c) Positions of Conduit Affiliates
The final rules require conduit affiliates to count all of their security-based swap
positions in their major security-based swap participant threshold calculations. The available data
does not permit us to identify which market participants would be deemed conduit affiliates. 714
As explained in the corollary discussion in the dealer analysis, we believe the alternative of not
requiring such entities to count their positions would remove a tool that should help to deter
market participants from seeking to evade regulation.

714

See section IV.I.3(c), supra.

269

As addressed in the dealer analysis another alternative to address such evasive activity
could be to narrow the inter-affiliate exception, such as by making the exception unavailable
when non-U.S. persons enter into positions with their U.S. affiliates. 715 While this alternative
may be expected to reduce costs to such entities, we believe the final rules will achieve
comparable anti-evasion purposes with less cost and disruption. 716
(d) Positions of Non-U.S. Persons with Foreign Branches of U.S. Banks and
Certain Other Counterparties
The final rules require non-U.S. persons to include their positions arising from
transactions conducted through foreign branches of U.S. banks unless the U.S. bank is registered
as a security-based swap dealer. This reflects a change from the proposal, which would have
required non-U.S. persons to include all positions with foreign branches of U.S. banks without
exception. The final approach, as in the context of the dealer analysis, reflects a middle ground
between commenter views, which provided two alternatives: that all positions arising from
transactions conducted through foreign branches be counted or that no such position be counted
against a non-U.S. person’s major security-based swap participant calculation thresholds. 717
Adopting the first alternative requiring non-U.S. persons to include all positions with foreign
branches would raise the potential for disparate impacts upon U.S. persons with foreign
branches, along with associated concerns about liquidity impacts. 718 Adopting the second
alternative excluding all such positions from being counted, could incentivize U.S. market
participants that are not registered as dealers to execute higher volumes of security-based swaps

715

717

718

See id.

270

through their foreign branches, resulting in higher levels of risk being transmitted to the United
States without the risk-mitigating attributes of having a registered dealer involved in the
position. 719
The available data related to these alternatives is subject to the limitations discussed
above and does not indicate a change to our assessment of the number of entities that may be
expected to register as major security-based swap participants. 720
Another alternative approach would require non-U.S. persons to include in their major
security-based swap participant threshold calculations those positions for which they have rights
of recourse against a U.S. person or their positions with counterparties that are conduit
affiliates. 721 We believe that the positions of such non-U.S. persons do not transmit risk to the
United States in the same way as if the potential major security-based swap participant is the
entity whose performance is guaranteed by a U.S. person because the default of the non-U.S.
person who holds the right of recourse against the U.S. person guarantor will not impact the
outward exposure of the U.S. person or the non-U.S. person whose position is guaranteed. While
these alternatives may potentially increase programmatic benefits associated with Title VII major
participant regulation, they would also likely increase assessment costs by requiring such nonU.S. persons to evaluate and track whether they have a right of recourse against a U.S. person,
potentially reducing liquidity available to U.S. corporate groups that provide guarantees to nonU.S. persons. 722 We note that, under the final rules regarding guaranteed positions, the entity

719

720

721

See note 576 (describing CFTC approach) and note 189 (describing comments suggesting to treat
guaranteed entities as U.S. persons), supra.

722

See section IV.I.3(d).

271

involved in the position with the closest connection to the United States, the non-U.S. person
whose position is guaranteed, as well as the U.S. guarantor itself, will already be including the
position in each of their calculations. Thus we believe such benefits would be more attenuated
than those associated with the final rules’ approach of directly counting the positions of such
guaranteed non-U.S. persons. Accordingly, we do not believe these alternatives would generate
significant additional programmatic benefits.
(e) Attribution
i.

Attribution to U.S. Persons

Our final attribution approach requires U.S. persons to include, for purposes of their
major security-based swap participant calculation thresholds, those positions for which a nonU.S. person’s counterparty has rights of recourse against the U.S. person.
An alternative approach would not require a U.S. person to include such positions in its
threshold calculations. This alternative potentially reduces the programmatic costs and benefits
of major participant regulation because it would reduce the number of positions that U.S.
guarantors would include in their calculations. By reducing the costs associated with providing
guarantees, such an alternative could reduce the barriers to participation in the security-based
swap market faced by participants who might benefit from risk sharing afforded by securitybased swap positions but cannot credibly provide sufficient information for their counterparties
to assess creditworthiness. We further believe that such an approach would only reduce the
assessment costs associated with major participant regulation to the extent that U.S. guarantors
do not have private incentives in place to collect information about positions they guarantee.
As noted in section V.D.3, however, we believe it is important to account for the risk to
the U.S. financial system transmitted by such guaranteed positions. Ensuring that a U.S. person
counts positions of potentially several entities whose counterparties have rights of recourse
272

against it, where each of those entities may be individually below the major participant threshold,
will generate the types of benefits that Title VII was intended to produce. The benefits of
including these positions are significant because, through the U.S. guarantor, these positions
expose the U.S. financial system to the type of risk that the definition of major security-based
swap participant is intended to address.
ii.

Attribution to Non-U.S. Persons

Under the final rules a non-U.S. person must include security-based swap positions of a
U.S. person for which that person’s counterparty has rights of recourse against the non-U.S.
person, and security-based swap positions of another non-U.S. person that are with a U.S.-person
counterparty who has rights of recourse against the non-U.S. person that is the potential major
security-based swap participant.
An alternative approach to these requirements would be to not require non-U.S. persons
to include such positions, even when those positions are entered into by U.S. persons or when a
U.S. person has a right of recourse against them under those positions. Not requiring these
positions to be attributed to the non-U.S. person could reduce assessment costs for non-U.S.
persons and potentially result in fewer non-U.S. persons ultimately registering as major securitybased swap participants. This alternative potentially improves risk sharing by U.S. persons who
must rely on guarantees in order to participate in the security-based swap market by reducing the
costs incurred by non-U.S. person guarantors. It likely would, however, also reduce
programmatic benefits to the extent that non-U.S. persons that guarantee positions within the
United States of multiple entities, each of which is below the major participant threshold, are not
required to include such positions in their own calculations.
Such non-U.S. persons who provide guarantees ultimately bear the risk of positions they
guarantee, and the aggregate risk exposure of the U.S. financial system to a non-U.S. person
273

guarantor varies more directly with the notional amount of positions involving U.S. persons that
are guaranteed than with the number of entities to which it provides guarantees. As a result, the
Commission believes it is appropriate to apply attribution requirements that treat non-U.S.
person guarantors of positions to which U.S. persons are counterparties as if they were direct
counterparties. With respect to guarantees provided by non-U.S. persons to U.S. persons, the
Commission believes it is appropriate to attribute guaranteed positions because U.S. persons bear
the risk that non-U.S. person guarantors will be unable to fulfill obligations under the guarantees
they provide.
(f) Positions Cleared Through a Clearing Agency in the United States
The final approach requires non-U.S. persons to include in their major participant
threshold calculations those positions that are entered into with U.S. persons, including positions
that are cleared through a registered clearing agency in the United States. An alternative raised
by a commenter suggested that the location of clearing not be relevant for purposes of
determining whether a non-U.S. person is a major security-based swap participant. 723 This
alternative would ignore the risk that is posed to the U.S. financial system by positions cleared
through a U.S.-person clearing agency, and would be inconsistent with the general approach that
all positions with U.S. counterparties should be counted towards the major security-based swap
participant threshold calculation. For this reason, we believe the alternative would ignore
important programmatic benefits that are incorporated in the final approach.
(g) Foreign Government-Related Entities
Several commenters suggested that foreign government-related entities, such as sovereign
wealth funds and MDBs, should be excluded from the U.S. person, security-based swap dealer,
723

See section V.B.2 and note 549, supra. See also section VIII.A, infra.

274

and major security-based swap participant definitions. 724 By potentially capturing fewer major
security-based swap participants, this alternative approach would correspondingly decrease the
programmatic costs and benefits associated with Title VII regulation of major security-based
swap participants. We believe that security-based swap transactions entered into by these types
of foreign government-related entities with U.S. persons pose the same risks to the U.S. securitybased swap markets as transactions entered into by entities that are not foreign-government
related. Moreover, as noted above, 725 we understand that foreign government-related entities
rarely enter into security-based swap transactions (as opposed to other types of swap
transactions) in amounts that would trigger the obligation to register as a major security-based
swap participant. To the extent that such entities do enter into security-based swaps with U.S.
persons, however, we believe such requiring such entities to include those positions in their
major participant threshold calculations will generate programmatic benefits, as such positions
introduce risk into the United States of the type title VII intended to address.
VI. Substituted Compliance Procedural Rule
A. Proposed Approach and Commenters’ Views
The Cross-Border Proposing Release addressed a range of substantive issues regarding
the potential availability of substituted compliance, whereby a market participant could satisfy
certain Title VII obligations by complying with comparable foreign requirements. These
included issues regarding which requirements might be satisfied via substituted compliance, and
regarding the showings necessary to obtain a substituted compliance order from the Commission.

The release also proposed to amend the Commission’s Rules of General Application to
establish procedures for considering substituted compliance requests, similar to the procedures
that the Commission uses to consider exemptive order applications under section 36 of the
Exchange Act. 726 Among other aspects, proposed Exchange Act rule 0-13 would require that
substituted compliance applications be in writing and include any supporting documentation
necessary to make the application complete – “including information regarding applicable
requirements established by the foreign financial regulatory authority or authorities, as well as
the methods used by the foreign financial regulatory authority or authorities to monitor
compliance with such rules” – and that applications cite applicable precedent. 727 The proposed
rule also stated that the Commission may choose to publish requests in the Federal Register, and
stated that requestors may seek confidential treatment. 728 We preliminarily concluded that those

727

See proposed Exchange Act rule 0-13(a), (e). Proposed Exchange Act rule 0-13 further would
provide that applications must comply with Commission rule 0-3 (regarding the filing of
materials with the Commission). Under the proposal, all applications would be submitted to the
Commission’s Office of the Secretary electronically or in paper format, and in the English
language. If an application is incomplete, the Commission may request that the application be
withdrawn unless the applicant can justify why supporting materials have not been submitted and
undertakes to submit promptly the omitted materials. The Commission would not consider
hypothetical or anonymous requests for a substituted compliance order. The proposed rule
further addressed issues regarding contact information, amendments to the application, the review
process, and potential hearings regarding the application. See proposed Exchange Act rule 0-13;
see also Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31087-88.

728

See proposed Exchange Act rule 0-13(a), (h). The proposal stated that requests for confidential
treatment would be permitted to the extent provided under 17 CFR 200.81. See proposed
Exchange Act rule 0-13(a); Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31087-88. Under 17 CFR
200.81, persons submitting exemptions and related relief may also request that it be accorded
confidential treatment for a specified period of time not exceeding 120 days. If the Commission
staff determines that the request is reasonable and appropriate it will be granted and the letter or
other communication will not be made available for public inspection or copying until the
expiration of the specified period. If the staff determines that the request for confidential
treatment should be denied, the staff shall advise the person making the request and the person
may withdraw the letter or other communication within 30 days.

276

proposed procedures would provide sufficient guidance regarding the submission process. 729 We
also solicited comment regarding the sufficiency of the guidance provided by the proposed rule,
and regarding whether foreign regulatory authorities should be able to submit substituted
compliance requests. 730
One commenter raised concerns that the proposed availability of confidential treatment
“would foreclose any public comment, debate or analysis of the applicant’s claims about the
foreign regulatory regime, leading to an industry-led process.” That commenter urged us to
disallow confidential treatment of applications, and to invite public comment as foreign
jurisdictions are considered for comparability.” 731
Commenters also asked for greater clarity regarding the information to be provided in
connection with substituted compliance requests. 732 Commenters also asked that the Commission
coordinate with the CFTC and foreign regulators in making substituted compliance
determinations. 733
Other commenters addressed a related issue regarding whether foreign regulators could

See FOA Letter at 4 (stating that the proposed requirement that an application include supporting
documentation that the applicant believes necessary for the Commission to make the
determination “puts the burden of interpretation wholly on the applicant”; requesting additional
guidance regarding the information needed to accompany requests, and greater specificity to
ensure “that the applications it receives address a similar range of compliance issues and contain
a similar amount of supporting detail”); SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at A-38 (urging the Commission
“to provide a more granular and detailed framework regarding the considerations relevant to
evaluating substituted compliance requests”).

733

See, e.g., FOA Letter at 8 (requesting that the Commission and the CFTC coordinate in making
substituted compliance determinations and that the Commissions consider whether to accept joint
submissions from foreign regulators or foreign market participants); CEDU Letter at 2 (stating
that the Commission should work closely with the CFTC “when determining whether substituted
compliance is applicable with respect to a particular jurisdiction”).

277

submit substituted compliance requests. Proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-5, regarding
substituted compliance for foreign security-based swap dealers, specified that such requests may
be filed by a foreign security-based swap dealer or group of dealers. A number of commenters
took the contrasting position that foreign regulators should be able to submit substituted
compliance requests. 734 Some commenters further stated that such requests solely should be
submitted by foreign regulators. 735 Two commenters particularly emphasized the importance of
the Commission’s substituted compliance assessments taking into account foreign enforcement
and supervisory practices. 736
B. Final Rule
In large part, we expect to address issues regarding the availability of substituted
compliance as part of future rulemakings, in conjunction with considering the cross-border
application of the relevant substantive rules. As discussed above, we believe that it is
appropriate to address issues regarding the cross-border application of the substantive
requirements under Title VII in conjunction with considering the final rules to implement those
substantive requirements, as substituted compliance potentially will constitute an integral part of
the final approach toward cross-border application.
734

See, e.g., SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at A-36 (“Foreign regulators are often best placed to describe
their rules and provide information for the purposes of a comparability analysis. Such an
approach would also allow for a more efficient use of resources.”).

735

See EC Letter at 3 (suggesting that “the review of a foreign regime should be conducted in
cooperation solely with the relevant foreign regulators or legislators, as opposed to firms” to
avoid duplication or confusion); ESMA Letter at 3.

736

See AFR Letter I at 12 (supporting ability to reject or withdraw substituted compliance
determinations based on the failure of a foreign regime to exercise supervisory or enforcement
authority); BM Letter at 30-31 (criticizing Cross-Border Proposing Release for including “only
passing reference to foreign supervision and enforcement as discretionary factors the SEC may
consider in making a substituted compliance determination,” and stating that any substituted
compliance determinations be predicated on evaluation of “a host of factors regarding the foreign
regulatory system, including staff expertise, agency funding, agency independence, technological
capacity, supervision in fact, and enforcement in fact”).

278

At this time, however, we believe that it is appropriate to adopt a final rule to address the
procedures for submitting substituted compliance requests. Using the same general procedural
requirements would facilitate the efficient consideration of substituted compliance requests.
Proposed Exchange Act rule 0-13, moreover, is sufficiently flexible to accommodate requests
related to a range of regulatory requirements, even when the requirements necessitate different
approaches toward substituted compliance.
Accordingly, we are adopting Exchange Act rule 0-13 largely as proposed. In response
to commenter input, however, the final rule has been modified from the proposal to provide that
a request for a substituted compliance order may be submitted either by a party that potentially
would comply with requirements under the Exchange Act pursuant to a substituted compliance
order, or by a relevant foreign financial regulatory authority or authorities. 737 We are persuaded
that allowing foreign regulators to submit such requests would promote the completeness of
requests and promote efficiency in the process for considering such requests, in light of foreign
regulators’ expertise regarding their domestic regulatory system, including the effectiveness of
their compliance and enforcement mechanisms, and to allow for a single point of contact to
facilitate the consideration of substituted compliance requests associated with the jurisdiction.
We are not, however, foreclosing the ability of a market participant itself to submit a request that
it be able to comply with Exchange Act requirements pursuant to a substituted compliance
order. 738

737

The decision to permit foreign regulators to submit substituted compliance requests may impact
our future consideration of proposed rule 3a71-5(c), which specified that applications for
substituted compliance determinations in connection with security-based swap dealer
requirements may be made by foreign dealers or by groups of foreign dealers.

738

To the extent we receive multiple requests in connection with a particular jurisdiction, we may
consider such requests together.

279

The final rule further revises the proposal to provide that applications should include
supporting documentation regarding the methods that foreign financial regulatory authorities use
to enforce compliance with the applicable rules. 739 This type of information – which we expect
would be best provided by the relevant foreign regulator – is consistent with the fact that our
substituted compliance assessments will not be limited to a comparison of applicable rules and
their underlying goals, but also will take into account the capability of a foreign financial
regulatory authority to monitor compliance with its rules and take appropriate enforcement
action in response to violations of such rules. 740
Finally, the final rule revises the proposal by removing a provision that would have stated
that requestors may seek confidential treatment of their application to the extent provided by
739

See Exchange Act rule 0-13(e). The final rule addresses the need for applications to provide
information regarding how foreign regulatory authorities “monitor and enforce” compliance with
the applicable rules. The relevant language of the proposal simply referred to “monitor.”
In addition, the final rule revises the proposed language regarding the Commission’s ability to
request applications to be withdrawn, by omitting the proposed reference to the Commission
acting “through its staff.” See Exchange Act rule 0-13(a).
The final rule further revises the proposed language regarding the process for considering
applications, by providing that an appropriate response will be issued following “a vote by” the
Commission. See Exchange Act rule 0-13(g).

740

We note that assessments of analogous factors occur in other contexts. For example, assessments
conducted by the Federal Reserve in connection with applications by foreign banks to establish a
branch, agency or commercial lending company in the United States consider – and the Federal
Reserve requires applications to provide information regarding – the following factors regarding
the role played by the foreign bank’s home country supervisor: (a) the scope and frequency of
on-site examinations by the home-country supervisor; (b) off-site monitoring by the homecountry supervisor; (c) the role of external auditors; (d) regulation and monitoring of affiliate
transactions; (e) other applicable prudential requirements (including capital adequacy, asset
classification and provisioning, single or aggregate credit and foreign currency exposure limits,
and liquidity) and associated supervisor monitoring; (f) remedial authority of the home-country
supervisor to enforce compliance with prudential controls and other supervisory or regulatory
requirements; and (g) prior approval requirements (related to investments in other companies or
the establishment of overseas offices). See Federal Reserve Board, “International Applications
and Prior Notifications under Subpart B of Regulation K,”
(http://www.federalreserve.gov/reportforms/forms/FR_K-220110331_f.pdf). In noting this
analogous requirement, we are not predicting the extent to which such factors may or may not be
considered as part of the Commission’s substituted compliance assessments.

280

Exchange Act rule 200.81. This change reflects the fact that under the final rules substituted
compliance applications may be submitted by foreign financial regulatory authorities, and
recognizes the importance of having the assessment consider potentially sensitive information
regarding a foreign regime’s compliance and enforcement capabilities and practices.
Accordingly, requests for confidential treatment may be submitted pursuant to any applicable
provisions governing confidentiality under the Exchange Act. 741 We expect confidential
treatment requests will seek protection for privileged information obtained from foreign
regulators. 742 Recognizing the significance of commenter concerns regarding the need for public
comment, debate and analysis of substituted compliance requests, moreover, rule 0-13 provides
that the Commission shall provide public notice of requests and solicit public comment when a

741

For example, Exchange Act rule 24b-2 addresses the potential availability of confidential
treatment in connection with any registration statement, report, application, correspondence or
other document filed pursuant to the Exchange Act. The rule provides that the person filing the
information must make written objection to its public disclosure at the time of the filing. See 17
CFR 240.24b-2.
Separately, Commission Rule 200.83 is a procedural rule that addresses how persons submitting
information to the Commission may request that the information not be disclosed pursuant to a
request under the Freedom of Information Act for reasons permitted by Federal law. The rule
does not apply when any other statute or Commission rule provides procedures for confidential
treatment regarding particular categories of information, or where the Commission has specified
that an alternative procedure be utilized in connection with a particular study, report,
investigation or other matter. Under this rule, a person submitting information to the Commission
must request confidential treatment at the time of the submission. See 17 CFR 200.83.

742

Exchange Act Section 24(d) provides that the Commission generally shall not be compelled to
disclose records obtained from a foreign securities authority if: (1) the foreign authority in good
faith determines and represents that public disclosure of the records would violate the laws
applicable to that foreign securities authority; and (2) the Commission obtains the records
pursuant to procedures authorized for use in connection with the administration or enforcement of
the securities laws, or a memorandum of understanding.
Exchange Act Section 24(f)(2) further provides that the Commission shall not be compelled to
disclose privileged information obtain from any foreign securities authority or law enforcement
authority if the foreign authority in good faith has determined and represented that the
information is privileged.

281

complete application has been submitted. 743 We recognize that public comment regarding
substituted compliance requests may be helpful to our consideration of particular requests. 744
In adopting rule 0-13, we recognize that the requirement that an application “include any
supporting documents necessary to make the application complete” implicates commenter
concerns regarding the need for further guidance regarding what information must be submitted
as part of substituted compliance requests. We expect to address such issues regarding
supporting documentation in the future, as we consider the potential availability of substituted
compliance in connection with particular Title VII requirements.
C. Economic Analysis
The availability of substituted compliance has the potential to impact the interplay
between programmatic costs and benefits associated with the Title VII regulation of securitybased swap dealers and major security-based swap participants, as well as those associated with
other Title VII requirements. For example, substituted compliance potentially may permit the
risk management and other programmatic benefits of dealer regulation to be achieved while
avoiding costs that market participants otherwise may incur. At the same time, the process of
making substituted compliance requests may cause certain market participants to incur extra
costs, although that possibility may be obviated in part by the provision that permits foreign
financial authorities to make such requests.

743

The text of the final rule has been revised from the proposal to eliminate a reference to the
Commission having “sole discretion” to choose to publish a notice, and to provide that
publication would occur following submission of a “complete” application. See Exchange Act
rule 0-13(h).

744

The final rule also makes technical change to the proposal by replacing references to the
Commission’s Division of Trading and Markets with general references to the “staff,” consistent
with the broad range of issues that will likely arise in connection with evaluating substituted
compliance requests. See Exchange Act rule 0-13(a), (g).

282

As discussed throughout this release, the security-based swap market is a global market
that is subject to regulatory requirements that may vary by jurisdiction. As a result, market
participants that operate globally potentially could be subject to overlapping or conflicting
regulations. If Title VII requirements for non-U.S. market participants conflict with regulations
in local jurisdictions, Title VII could act as a barrier to entry to the U.S. security-based swap
market. In such cases, allowing market participants to comply with Title VII via substituted
compliance could act as a mechanism to preserve access for non-U.S. persons to the U.S.
security-based swap market, reducing the likelihood that non-U.S. persons exit the U.S. market
entirely. Therefore, we expect that substituted compliance – so long as it is conditioned on a
foreign regime’s comparability to the relevant requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act, and on
the foreign regime having adequate compliance and enforcement capabilities – would help
preserve access and competition in the U.S. market, and thus benefit non-dealer participants in
the security-based swap market. 745
Although the costs associated with the process of making substituted compliance request
may be uncertain at this time, the decision to request substituted compliance is purely voluntary.
To the extent such requests are made by market participants, moreover, such participants would
request substituted compliance only if, in their own assessment, compliance with applicable
requirements under a foreign regulatory system was less costly than compliance with both the
foreign regulatory regime and the relevant Title VII requirement. Even after a substituted
compliance determination is made, market participants would only choose substituted
compliance if the private benefits they expect to receive from participating in the U.S. market
exceeds the private costs they expect to bear, including any conditions the Commission may
745

Cf. Institute of International Finance (“IIF”) Letter (making a similar point).

283

attach to the substituted compliance determination. Where substituted compliance increases the
number of dealers or other participants in the U.S. security-based swap market, or prevents
existing participants from leaving the U.S. market, this may help mitigate the programmatic costs
associated with the applicable Title VII requirements, while helping to ensure that the associated
programmatic benefits are achieved.
The costs particularly associated with making substituted compliance requests, as well as
the general costs and benefits associated with allowing substituted compliance, may be expected
to vary between the various categories of Title VII requirements. Relevant considerations may
include: whether (and to what extent) substituted compliance is permitted in connection with a
requirement; the relevant information required to demonstrate consistency between the foreign
regulatory requirements and the Commission’s analogous dealer requirements; the relevant
information required to demonstrate the adequacy of the foreign regime’s compliance and
enforcement mechanisms; and whether substituted compliance requests are made by market
participants or by foreign regulatory authorities. These factors limit our ability to further predict
the economic consequences of this procedural rule.
We recognize that commenters have asked that the Commission coordinate with the
CFTC and foreign regulators in making substituted compliance determinations. As discussed
above, the Commission is subject to obligations to consult and coordinate with the CFTC and
foreign regulators in connection with Title VII. 746 Our revision of the final rule to permit foreign
regulators to submit substituted compliance requests also helps address goals of increased
coordination. Moreover, our substituted compliance assessments regarding particular
requirements applicable to security-based swap dealers also as appropriate may take into account
746

See section II.B, supra.

284

the way that other regulators address similar issues, subject to the need for any allowance of
substituted compliance to be predicated on the extent to which compliance with another
regulatory regime will help achieve the goals of Title VII.
VII. Antifraud Authority
A. Final Rule
The provisions of the rules and guidance, discussed above, do not limit the cross-border
reach of the antifraud provisions or other provisions of the federal securities laws that are not
specifically addressed by this release.
In section 929P(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress added provisions to the federal
securities laws confirming the Commission’s broad cross-border antifraud authority. 747
Congress enacted section 929P(b) in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision in Morrison v.
National Australia Bank, 748 which created uncertainty about the Commission’s cross-border
enforcement authority under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Before
Morrison, the federal courts of appeals for nearly four decades had construed the antifraud
provisions to reach cross-border securities frauds when the fraud either involved significant
conduct within the United States causing injury to overseas investors, or had substantial
foreseeable effects on investors or markets within the United States. 749 With respect to the
Commission’s enforcement authority, section 929P(b) codified the courts of appeals’ prior
747

The antifraud provisions of the securities laws include section 17(a) of the Securities Act, 15
U.S.C. 77q(a); sections 9, 10(b), 14(e), and 15(c)(1)-(2) & (7) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.
78i, 78j, 78n, 78o(c)(1)-(2); section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. 80b6; and any rule or regulation of the Commission promulgated under these statutory authorities.

748

See 130 S. Ct. 2869, 2888 (2010) (holding in a section 10(b) class action that “it is … only
transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges, and domestic transactions in other
securities, to which §10(b) applies”).

749

See, e.g., Schoenbaum v. Firstbrook, 405 F.2d 200, 206 (2d Cir. 1968), modified on other
grounds, 405 F.2d 215 (1968) (en banc).

285

interpretation of the scope of the antifraud provisions’ cross-border reach. Section 929P(b) also
made clear that the scope of subject-matter jurisdiction was coextensive with the cross-border
reach of the antifraud provisions. 750
Specifically, the Commission’s antifraud enforcement authority under section 17(a) of
the Securities Act and the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act—including sections 9(j) and
10(b)—extends to “(1) conduct within the United States that constitutes significant steps in
furtherance of [the antifraud violation], even if the securities transaction occurs outside the
United States and involves only foreign investors,” and “(2) conduct occurring outside the
United States that has a foreseeable substantial effect within the United States.” 751 Similarly, the
Commission’s enforcement authority under section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act applies
broadly to reach “(1) conduct within the United States that constitutes significant steps in
furtherance of the violation, even if the violation is committed by a foreign adviser and involves

750

See 156 Cong. Rec. H5237 (daily ed. June 30, 2010) (statement of Rep. Kanjorski, author of
section 929P(b)) (“In the case of Morrison v. National Australia Bank, the Supreme Court last
week held that section 10(b) of the Exchange Act applies only to transactions in securities listed
on United States exchanges and transactions in other securities that occur in the United States. In
this case, the Court also said that it was applying a presumption against extraterritoriality. This
bill’s provisions concerning extraterritoriality, however, are intended to rebut that presumption by
clearly indicating that Congress intends extraterritorial application in cases brought by the SEC or
the Justice Department. Thus, the purpose of the language of section 929P(b) of the bill is to
make clear that in actions and proceedings brought by the SEC or the Justice Department, the
specified provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Investment Advisers Act
may have extraterritorial application, and that extraterritorial application is appropriate,
irrespective of whether the securities are traded on a domestic exchange or the transactions occur
in the United States, when the conduct within the United States is significant or when conduct
outside the United States has a foreseeable substantial effect within the United States.”). See also

only foreign investors,” and “(2) conduct occurring outside the United States that has a
foreseeable substantial effect within the United States.” 752
Although no commenters challenged the Commission’s interpretation of its cross-border
antifraud authority, we are aware that a federal district court recently expressed the view that the
statutory language may be unclear. 753 We therefore have determined to adopt a rule that clearly
sets forth our interpretation of the Commission’s cross-border antifraud authority. 754 We believe
that our interpretation is not only the better reading of the antifraud authorities and the statutory
text added by section 929P(b), but that our reading is consistent with section 929P(b)’s
legislative history and purpose. 755

extraterritorial jurisdiction under the conduct or effect test for proceedings brought by the SEC.”).

754

See rule 250.1.

755

The Morrison decision does not preclude the Commission’s interpretation. When the Supreme
Court construed section 10(b) in Morrison to determine its territorial scope, it acknowledged that
the language of section 10(b) neither required nor precluded extraterritorial application.
Morrison, 130 S.Ct. at 2881-82. It was merely silent. The Court also looked to other provisions
of the Exchange Act for evidence of extraterritorial intent, but found none. The Court thus
applied a default “presumption” against extraterritoriality to find that section 10(b) lacked
extraterritorial effect, while making clear that this presumption was not “a limit upon Congress’s
power to legislate” and only applied “unless a contrary intent appears.” Id. at 2877. Section
929P(b) now provides that contrary intent—–in the words of Morrison, it supplies the “indication

287

Further, we believe that our interpretation of the cross-border antifraud enforcement
authority best advances the strong interest of the United States in applying the antifraud
provisions to cross-border frauds that implicate U.S. territory, U.S. markets, U.S. investors, other
U.S. market participants, or other U.S. interests. 756 We believe that our interpretation of the
cross-border antifraud authority is necessary to ensure honest securities markets and high ethical
standards in the U.S. securities industry, and thereby to promote confidence in our securities
markets among both domestic and foreign investors. Our interpretation of the cross-border
antifraud authority will also allow us to better protect U.S. investors from securities frauds
executed outside of the United States where those frauds may involve non-domestic securities
transactions but nonetheless threaten to produce, foreseeably do produce, or were otherwise
intended to produce effects upon U.S. markets, U.S. investors, other U.S. market participants, or
other U.S. interests.
B. Economic Analysis
This rule is designed to ensure the antifraud provisions of the securities laws are provided
broad cross-border reach. Effective cross-border enforcement of the antifraud provisions should
help detect and deter or stop transnational securities frauds the final rule may mitigate
inefficiencies in allocation of capital. For example, by directly diverting financial resources
from more productive projects to less productive projects, serious transnational securities frauds
can generate welfare losses.
of an extraterritorial application” that had been missing. Our interpretation is thus, at a minimum,
a reasonable reading of the antifraud provisions in light of section 929P(b)’s enactment.
756

See generally RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF FOREIGN RELATIONS LAW OF THE UNITED STATES §
402 (1987) (stating that “the United States has authority to prescribe law with respect to …
conduct that, wholly or in substantial part, takes place within its territory; the status of persons, or
interests in things, present within its territory” and “conduct outside its territory that has or is
intended to have substantial effect within its territory”).

288

Further, in the absence of the cross-border application of the antifraud provisions, the
perceived risk of fraud may indirectly result in less efficient capital allocation if it reduces
investors’ trust in the securities market. 757 Additionally, given the global nature of the securities
market, ensuring that antifraud provisions of the securities laws have cross-border reach will
reduce the likelihood of a fragmented market. As a result of reduced ambiguity over the degree
to which they are protected from fraud, U.S. market participants will have fewer incentives to
avoid cross-border activity because, as explained above, they will have increased confidence in
the integrity of the market. Through this channel, the final rules support a market that provides
greater opportunities for U.S. market participants to share risks with market participants in other
jurisdictions.
VIII. Impacts on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation
In developing our approach to the cross-border application of the Title VII security-based
swap dealer and major participant definitions, we have focused on meeting the goals of Title VII,
including the promotion of the financial stability of the United States, by the improvement of
accountability and transparency in the U.S. financial system and the protection of counterparties
to security-based swaps. We also have considered the effects of our policy choices on
competition, efficiency, and capital formation as mandated under section 3(f) of the Exchange
Act. That section requires us, whenever we engage in rulemaking pursuant to the Exchange Act
and are required to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the
public interest, to consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action will

Vol. 63, No. 6: 2557 2600 (2008); see also David Easley and Maureen O’Hara, Microstructure
and Ambiguity, 65 J. Fin. 1817 (2010).

289

promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. 758 In addition, section 23(a)(2) of the
Exchange Act requires us, when making rules under the Exchange Act, to consider the impact
such rules would have on competition. Section 23(a)(2) also prohibits the Commission from
adopting any rule that would impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in
furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. 759
In this section, we focus particularly on these effects. In adopting these final rules, we
recognize that the most significant impact of the cross-border implementation of the dealer and
major participant definitions will derive from the role of the definitions in determining which
market entities are subject to security-based swap dealer and major security-based swap
participant regulation under Title VII and which entities are not. That is, the scope of the final
definitions will affect the ultimate regulatory costs and benefits that will accompany the full
implementation of Title VII rules aimed at increasing transparency, accountability, and financial
stability. Furthermore, the final cross-border rules may create incentives for market participants,
including dealers as well as non-dealers and other non-registered entities who transact with
dealers, to structure their businesses to operate wholly outside of the Title VII framework. This
incentive may be particularly strong for entities at the boundaries of the definitions – for
example, entities with relatively limited contact with U.S. persons – for whom the benefits of
operating outside of Title VII may exceed the costs of restructuring or forgoing trading
opportunities with U.S. counterparties.

A. Competition
As noted above, a key goal of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act is to promote the financial
stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial
system. To that end, Title VII imposes new regulatory requirements on market participants who
register as security-based swap dealers or major participants. The final cross-border
implementation of the dealer and major participant definitions discussed in this release, including
the cross-border implementation of the de minimis exception, will likely affect competition in
the U.S. security-based swap market and potentially change the set of available counterparties
that would compete for business and provide liquidity to U.S. market participants. Though these
substantive Title VII requirements have not been finalized, application of Title VII to registered
dealers and major participants may directly affect the competitive landscape of the securitybased swap market.
As detailed above, the security-based swap market is a global, interconnected market.
Within this global market, foreign and domestic dealers compete for business from
counterparties, while non-dealers (including major participants) that participate in the market use
security-based swaps for purposes that can include speculation and hedging. Because the market
for security-based swaps is a global market and some participants may not engage in relevant
security-based swap activity within the United States, the rules we adopt pursuant to Title VII
will not reach all participants or all transactions in the global market. We are aware that
application of rules to a subset of participants in the worldwide security-based swap market
would change the costs and benefits of market participation for one group (those that engage in
relevant security-based swap activity within the United States) relative to another (those that do
not) and therefore create competitive effects.

291

More specifically, in addition to requiring U.S. dealers to register, our final rules
implementing the cross-border approach to the security-based swap dealer definition would
generally apply dealer registration and other Title VII requirements to non-U.S. entities that
conduct dealing activity (as defined in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release) in excess
of the de minimis threshold, but where calculation of the threshold depends on various features
of the person’s transactions (e.g., whether the person’s counterparty is a U.S. or non-U.S. person,
whether the transaction is guaranteed by a U.S. person, whether the counterparty is a registered
or non-registered foreign branch of a U.S. person, and whether the person is a conduit affiliate of
a U.S. person). Similarly, our final rules implementing cross-border application of the major
security-based swap participant definition would apply major participant registration and other
Title VII requirements to entities that have exposures to U.S. persons that exceed the major
participant thresholds (as defined in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release). Given the
approach we are adopting with respect to application of the dealer de minimis and major
participant threshold calculation requirements, U.S. persons should have no incentive to favor a
non-U.S. person counterparty over a U.S.-person counterparty.
However, we recognize that the final rule treats U.S. persons and different types of nonU.S. persons differently. Unless their dealing activity is guaranteed by a U.S. person, non-U.S.
persons may exclude from their de minimis calculations dealing activity with other non-U.S.
persons. Similarly, unless their security-based swap activity is guaranteed by a U.S. person, nonU.S. persons may exclude from their major participant threshold calculations their positions with
non-U.S. persons. U.S. persons, non-U.S. persons whose security-based swap transactions are
guaranteed by a U.S. person, and conduit affiliates cannot exclude such transactions or positions
from their own calculations. This differential treatment makes it more likely that non-U.S.

292

persons will not be subject to the regulatory requirements associated with dealer and major
participant registration. Furthermore, because transactions with U.S. persons in excess of the de
minimis and major participant thresholds trigger registration requirements, non-U.S. dealers and
other market participants may be reluctant to trade with U.S. counterparties or clear securitybased swap transactions through U.S. person clearing agencies because of the potential
application of Title VII regulation. For example, our final rules may produce competitive
frictions insofar as market participants prefer to clear transactions using non-U.S. person clearing
agencies who may have U.S. person members instead of U.S. person clearing agencies, because
only positions held against the latter would count against their major participant thresholds. 760
Indeed, some entities may determine that the compliance costs arising from the requirements of
Title VII warrant exiting the security-based swap market in the United States entirely. Non-U.S.
persons may find this option more attractive than U.S. persons because they may find it easier to
structure their foreign business so as to prevent it from falling within the scope of Title VII.
However, U.S. entities may also have an incentive to establish separately-capitalized foreign
subsidiaries to conduct their security-based swap operations, since such subsidiaries would
qualify as non-U.S. persons. 761 In this case, the cross-border application of Title VII rules may
affect participants depending on their size, as larger participants could be better-equipped to set
up offshore vehicles enabling them to transact as non-U.S. persons.
To the extent that entities engaged in dealing activity exit the U.S. security-based swap
market, the end result could be a U.S. market where fewer intermediaries compete less
760

See section V.D.1(b).

761

The rules we are adopting regarding conduit affiliates should mitigate this risk to some degree, as
the foreign affiliate’s non-U.S. person counterparties would not generally be able to engage in
security-based swap dealing activity on behalf of its U.S.-person affiliate without itself being
required to include those transactions in its own de minimis calculations.

293

intensively for business. These exits could result in higher spreads and reduced liquidity, and
could affect the ability and willingness of non-dealers within the United States to engage in
security-based swaps. The concentrated nature of dealing activity suggests that there are high
barriers to entry in connection with security-based swap dealing activity, which could preclude
the ability of new dealers to enter the security-based swap market and compete away spreads.
Notwithstanding the potential that our final rule may reduce competition, the
Commission believes it appropriate to require U.S. persons to count all dealing transactions
towards the de minimis threshold and all positions toward the major security-based swap
participant thresholds, given the potential for these transactions to create risk to U.S. persons and
in the U.S. financial system. We also note that it is uncertain that such requirements will reduce
competition. In fact, the final rule may enhance competition among dealers, as the Title VII
regulatory requirements and the ability to meet the standards set by Title VII may allow
registered dealers to credibly signal high quality, better risk management, and better counterparty
protection relative to foreign unregistered dealers that compete for the same order flow. In this
scenario, non-dealers in the U.S. market may be willing to pay higher prices for higher-quality
services in regulated markets, and registration requirements may separate high-quality
intermediaries that are willing and able to register from low-quality firms that are not. 762

Furthermore, while dealers and speculative traders may prefer to transact in opaque markets,
transparency requirements that apply to U.S. dealers and transactions that occur within the scope
of Title VII may be attractive to hedgers and other market participants who do not benefit from
opacity. Therefore, Title VII requirements may promote liquidity in the U.S.; liquid markets
should attract additional participants, thereby enhancing risk sharing and making markets more
competitive. These regulatory benefits could mitigate the competitive burdens imposed by the
proposed and anticipated final cross-border rules and substantive Title VII requirements
applicable to registered security-based swap dealers by, for example, reducing incentives for
firms to exit the market.
Similarly, the cross-border application of the de minimis exception could reduce the
number of entities likely to exit the U.S. market entirely because it would enable an established
foreign entity to transact a de minimis amount of security-based swap dealing activity in the U.S.
market before it determines whether to expand its U.S. business and become a registered
security-based swap dealer. 763 However, since the ability of smaller entities to access the U.S.
security-based swap market without registration would be limited to conducting dealing activity
below the de minimis threshold, these entities would have an incentive to curtail their securitybased swap dealing activity with U.S. persons as they approach the de minimis threshold to
avoid dealer registration requirements.

rights”). While economic theory supports the assertion that registration can separate high-quality
dealers from low-quality dealers, with corresponding differences in pricing, we received no
comments either agreeing or disagreeing with the assertion that some market participants may be
willing to pay higher prices to trade with a high-quality intermediary.
763

See IIF Letter (noting that, “…the rule proposal if adopted would make it much easier for foreign
market participants to offer services in the US, providing greater choice and competition, and
making it easier for instance for corporates to hedge their risks).”

295

Finally, incentives to restructure ultimately depend on future regulatory developments,
both with respect to final Title VII rules and foreign regulatory frameworks; the differences in
regulatory requirements across jurisdictions; and strategic interactions with non-dealer
participants. For example, although pre-and post-trade transparency requirements provide a
number of benefits both to financial markets and the real economy, dealers benefit from
operating in opaque markets. To the extent that foreign jurisdictions require only regulatory
reporting, without public dissemination requirements, dealers may wish to operate in
jurisdictions where they can continue to benefit from opaque markets.
Other market participants, however, may prefer transparency, and the availability of
transparent trading venues that result from Title VII pre- and post-trade transparency
requirements could shift market power away from dealers. If non-dealer market participants are
able to demand transparent trade execution, the incentives to restructure may be tempered,
particularly if transparent venues attract liquidity away from opaque markets. Ultimately, the
effects of transparency requirements on dealers’ incentives to restructure depend on differences
across jurisdictions, as well as whether non-dealer participants prefer transparency. These
preferences may, in turn, depend on motives for trading among non-dealers. Hedgers and
participants that need liquidity may prefer transparent venues while participants who believe they
have private information about asset values may prefer opaque markets that allow them to trade
more profitably on their information.
The potential restructurings and exits described above may impact competition in the
U.S. market in different ways. On one hand, the ability to restructure one’s business rather than
exit the U.S. market entirely to avoid application of Title VII to a person’s non-U.S. operations
may reduce the number of entities that exit the market, thus mitigating the negative effects on

296

competition described above. On the other hand, U.S. non-dealers may find that the only foreign
security-based swap dealers that are willing to deal with them are those whose security-based
swap business is sufficiently large to afford the costs of restructuring as well as registration and
the ensuing compliance costs associated with applicable Title VII requirements. To the extent
that smaller dealers continue to have an incentive to exit the market, the overall level of
competition in the market may decline.
Moreover, regardless of the response of dealers to our approach, we cannot preclude the
possibility that large non-dealer financial entities and other non-dealer market participants in the
United States, such as investment funds, who have the resources to restructure their business also
may pursue restructuring and move part of their business offshore in order to transact with
dealers outside the reach of Title VII, either because liquidity has moved offshore or because
these participants want to avoid Title VII requirements (such as transparency requirements) that
may reveal information about trading strategies. This may reduce liquidity within the U.S.
market and provide additional incentives for U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons to shift a higher
proportion of their security-based swap business offshore, further reducing the level of
competition within the United States. In this scenario, the competitive frictions caused by the
application, in the cross-border context, of a de minimis threshold for dealing activity may affect
the ability of small market participants of security-based swaps to access the security-based swap
market more than large ones, as smaller participants are less likely to have the resources that
would enable or justify a restructuring of their business.
In addition to the global nature of the security-based swap market and the implications
for the reach of Title VII dealer and major participant registration requirements, we also noted
above the current opacity of the over-the-counter derivatives market and the informational

297

advantage that dealers currently have over non-dealers. By having greater private order flow
information, dealers are in a position to make more-informed assessments of market values and
can use that information to extract rents from less-informed counterparties. While this issue will
be the focus of future Commission rulemaking covering pre- and post-trade transparency, we
note that the final rule to exclude cleared, anonymous transactions from the de minimis threshold
for non-U.S. persons has implications for competition in the security-based swap market.
Because cleared, anonymous transactions will not trigger registration requirements, the exclusion
strengthens incentives for trading in transparent venues, reducing market power and the
competitive advantage currently enjoyed by dealers over non-dealer market participants.
Furthermore, while Title VII rules governing clearing, trade execution, and trade reporting have
not been finalized, providing stronger incentives to trade on transparent venues and through
CCPs increases the likelihood that the benefits of Title VII, including increased transparency and
reduced potential for risk spillovers, will be realized. 764
The overall effects of the final approach described in this release on competition among
dealing entities in the U.S. security-based swap market will depend on the way market
participants ultimately respond to different elements of Title VII. Application of the dealer and
major participant registration requirements may create incentives for dealers and market
participants to favor non-U.S. counterparties; incentives to restructure due to inconsistent
regulatory requirements may increase concentration among security-based swap dealers
providing services to U.S. non-dealers. However, registration and compliance with Title VII

764

The exclusion for cleared, anonymous transactions does not require participants to use a
registered clearing agency. Therefore, this benefit may be limited if final Title VII rules for
registered clearing agencies create incentives for market participants to trade through CCPs that
are not registered and regulated under Title VII.

298

may signal high quality and mitigate the incentive to restructure and exit U.S. markets for
intermediaries with the ability to meet the standards set by Title VII. Furthermore, if hedgers
and other market participants who do not benefit from opacity demand transparency and
counterparty protections that come from trading with a registered dealer, dealers may prefer to
register if serving this market is profitable. Finally, while fewer dealing entities could lead to
decreased competition and wider spreads in the security-based swap market, exclusion of
cleared, anonymous trades from the de minimis threshold strengthen incentives to trade in
transparent venues, reducing the ability of dealing entities to post wider spreads and reducing the
competitive advantage over access to information enjoyed by dealers.
B. Efficiency
As noted above, in adopting the rules and guidance discussed in this release, we are
required to consider whether these actions would promote efficiency. In significant part, the
effect of these rules on efficiency is linked to the effect of these rules on competition.
Definitional rules that promote, or do not unduly restrict, competition can be accompanied by
regulatory benefits that minimize the risk of liquidity crises, aggregate capital shortfalls, and
other manifestations of contagion. Furthermore, by reducing the costs that individual market
participants impose on others through their trades – that is, by imposing registration requirements
and substantive regulations on dealers and major participants who, by virtue of the volume of
their transactions, their number of counterparties, and their aggregate positions and exposures,
are most likely to contribute to risk spillovers – the rules promote efficiency within the market.
Generally, rules and interpretations that promote competitive capital markets can be expected to
promote the efficient allocation of risk, capital, and other resources by facilitating price

299

discovery and reducing costs associated with dislocations in the market for security-based
swaps. 765
As discussed several times throughout this release, the global nature of the security-based
swap market suggests that the regulatory framework adopted under Title VII may not reach all
participants or all transactions. Additionally, differing regulatory timelines and differences in
regulatory scope may moderate the benefits flowing from Title VII. In particular, if other
regulatory regimes offer more opacity in transactions, those who are most harmed by
transparency (including dealers who currently benefit from privately observing order flow) have
incentives to restructure their business to operate abroad or otherwise take advantage of
regulatory gaps. Restructuring itself, while potentially optimal for an individual participant,
represents a form of inefficiency for the overall market in that firms expend resources simply to
circumvent regulation and not for any productive purpose.
More importantly, altering business models to take advantage of looser regulatory
regimes undermines other efficiency benefits to Title VII. For example, U.S. dealers may have
an incentive to restructure their businesses by setting up separately capitalized entities in nonU.S. jurisdictions, through which they would continue their dealing operations in order to take
advantage of the rules applicable to non-U.S. persons. As discussed above, if some market
participants choose to operate wholly outside of the Title VII regulatory framework, risk and
liquidity may concentrate in less regulated, opaque corners of the market, undermining the
benefits of Title VII. Moreover, insofar as the types of restructuring contemplated above purely
constitute attempts at arbitraging regulations, including regulations applied to registered dealers,
765

Definitional rules do not promote efficiency by themselves; rather, the effect is through the
number of entities required to register as dealers and major participants, and the corresponding
effect on the programmatic costs and benefits associated with registration requirements.

300

such as capital and reporting regulations, they represent a use of resources that could potentially
be put to more productive uses. Ultimately, the incentive to restructure, and the corresponding
loss of benefits, depends on the extent to which other jurisdictions implement comprehensive
OTC derivatives regulations. If foreign jurisdictions subject security-based swap transactions to
regulatory oversight consistent with Title VII, the ability to arbitrage regulations will be
limited. 766
Nevertheless, two features of our rules adopted today may mitigate the incentive for
market participants to undermine the benefits of Title VII through inefficient restructuring or
evasion. First, the requirement that conduit affiliates count all dealing activity towards the de
minimis threshold closes one potential path for evasion. We have tailored the application of
these requirements in connection with affiliates of registered security-based swap dealers and
major security-based swap participants, as we do not believe that transactions involving these
types of registered entities and their foreign affiliates raise the types of evasion concerns that the
conduit affiliate concept is designed to address. 767 Second, the exclusion of cleared, anonymous
transactions from the de minimis threshold for non-U.S. persons strengthens incentives for
trading in transparent venues, reducing the incentive to trade in opaque corners of the market in
order to avoid the reach of Title VII. Strengthening incentives for non-U.S. persons to trade in
transparent venues reduces the likelihood that liquidity will fragment to opaque corners of the
market and increases the likelihood that risks that non-U.S. persons present to the U.S. financial
system will be covered by the Title VII regulatory framework. Furthermore, shifting trades to

766

See Section III.B, supra (discussing global regulatory efforts).

767

See note 320, supra.

301

transparent venues produces benefits associated with pre- and post-trade price transparency,
including more efficient valuations of financial assets. 768
Finally, we received several comments from outside commenters urging us to harmonize
our final rules with interpretations set forth in the CFTC’s guidance. 769 While our final rules
track the CFTC’s guidance in many respects – for example, in the treatment of conduit affiliates,
the treatment of transactions with foreign branches, and the exclusion for cleared, anonymous
transactions from non-U.S. persons’ de minimis calculations – we are not adopting rules
identical to the policies and interpretations in the guidance. For example, our treatment of
investment funds with respect to the U.S. person definition differs from the CFTC’s, which, in
addition to looking to the location of incorporation and principal place of business, considers
majority-ownership. While we acknowledge the benefits of harmonization, we believe our rules
meet the goals of Title VII while appropriately minimizing the costs to security-based swap
market participants. More specifically, our rules are designed to capture transactions and entities
that pose risk to U.S. persons and potentially to the U.S. financial system, while excluding those
transactions and entities that do not warrant regulation under Title VII. In the case of investment
funds, we have decided not to look to majority-ownership for determining U.S.-person status,
notwithstanding that the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance articulates such an approach. Our belief
is that, by adopting an approach that generally focuses on the location of economic decisions
made on behalf of a fund, we are more accurately measuring whether a fund poses risks to U.S.

768

As discussed above, this benefit may be limited if final Title VII rules for registered clearing
agencies create incentives for market participants to trade through CCPs that are not registered
and regulated under Title VII.

769

See note 193, supra.

302

persons and to the U.S. financial system of the type that Title VII was intended to address. 770
Nevertheless, we acknowledge that different regulations for swaps and security-based swaps may
create inefficiencies for market participants due to conflicting or overlapping requirements,
particularly for those participants who deal in both swaps and security-based swaps.
C. Capital Formation
We believe that many aspects of the final cross-border approach to the dealer and major
participant definitions are likely to promote capital formation, by focusing dealer and major
participant regulation on activity and entities that are most likely to serve as conduits of risk to
U.S. persons and potentially to the U.S. financial system. We also believe that applying the full
range of Title VII requirements to this group of entities will increase the likelihood that the
benefits of Title VII, including increased transparency, accountability, and financial stability,
will be realized. To the extent that these requirements reduce asymmetric information about
market valuations, we expect that a security-based swap market with enhanced transparency and
enhanced regulatory oversight may facilitate entry by a wide range of market participants
seeking to engage in a broad range of hedging and trading activities.
Additionally, strengthening incentives for non-U.S. persons to trade in transparent venues
encourages market participants to express their true valuations for security-based swaps;
information revealed through transparent trades allows market participants to derive moreinformed assessments with respect to asset valuations, leading to more efficient capital
allocation. This should be true for the underlying assets as well. That is, information learned

770

For instance, as discussed above, LTCM demonstrated that an investment vehicle could have a
negative impact on U.S. financial institutions and on the stability of the U.S. financial system
more generally when the vehicle is directed, controlled, or coordinated from within the United
States. See note 271, supra.

303

from security-based swap trading provides signals not only about security-based swap valuation,
but also about the value of the reference assets underlying the swap. 771 Similarly, we expect
transparency to benefit the real economy as well. Transparent prices provide better signals about
the quality of a business investment, promoting capital formation in the real economy by helping
managers to make more-informed decisions and making it easier for firms to obtain new
financing for new business opportunities. 772
However, the Commission recognizes that, to the extent that the cross-border
implementation of the dealer and major participant definitions encourages inefficient
restructuring or results in market fragmentation, the final rules may impair capital formation and
result in a redistribution of capital across jurisdictional boundaries. We note that, unlike in the
proposed rules, we are requiring non-U.S. persons with U.S. guarantees to include all
transactions that benefit from a U.S. guarantee in their de minimis calculations. Similarly, we
are requiring conduit affiliates to include all transactions in their de minimis calculations,
whether with a U.S. person or not. Inclusion of these transactions will limit the risk these
participants pose to U.S. persons and to the U.S. financial system. More generally, the definition
of “U.S. person” mitigates the risk of contagion affecting U.S. markets as a result of cross-border
swap activity. To the extent that future substantive regulation under Title VII is conditioned on
entities’ registration status, this definition may also improve transparency and provide increased
customer protection for U.S. persons who participate in the security-based swap market.

percent).

304

Nevertheless, expanding the scope of transactions that must be included in these calculations
may also increase the scope of potential market fragmentation, to the extent that it raises the
costs that market participants will incur if they engage in security-based swap activity through
guaranteed non-U.S. persons or conduit affiliates.
IX. Paperwork Reduction Act
A. Introduction
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”) 773 imposes certain requirements on
Federal agencies in connection with their conducting or sponsoring any “collection of
information.” 774 An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond
to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid control number. In addition, 44
U.S.C. 3507(a)(1)(D) provides that before adopting (or revising) a collection of information
requirement, an agency must, among other things, publish a notice in the Federal Register stating
that the agency has submitted the proposed collection of information to the Office of
Management and Budget (“OMB”) and setting forth certain required information, including: (1)
a title for the collection of information; (2) a summary of the collection of information; (3) a
brief description of the need for the information and the proposed use of the information; (4) a
description of the likely respondents and proposed frequency of response to the collection of
information; (5) an estimate of the paperwork burden that shall result from the collection of
information; and (6) notice that comments may be submitted to the agency and director of
OMB. 775

305

In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, we identified a number of proposed rules that
contained “collection of information requirements” within the meaning of the PRA. 776 The
majority of those proposed rules and forms are outside of the scope of the dealer and major
participant definitions at issue in this release. 777 In two areas, however, Exchange Act rule 3a713 which we are adopting today contains collections of information requirements. First, the rule’s
definition of “transaction conducted through a foreign branch,” which we are adopting largely as
proposed, contains a representation provision that constitutes a collection of information.
Moreover, the rule’s final definition of “U.S. person” incorporates, as an addition to the
proposal, a representation provision that constitutes a collection of information. 778 Commenters
did not address Paperwork Reduction Act issues in connection with the proposal.
The Commission previously submitted proposed rule 3a71-3, as well as certain other
rules proposed as part of the Cross-Border Proposing Release, to OMB for review in accordance
with 44 U.S.C. 3507 and 5 CFR 1320.11. The title of the collection related to proposed rule

776

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 77 FR at 31103.

777

In particular, the present release does not address the following proposed rules and forms that
implicated collections of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act: proposed Rule 3Ch-2;
reproposed Forms SBSE, SBSE-A and SBSE-BD; proposed Rule 18a-4, and reproposed Rules
242.900 through 242.911 of Regulation SBSR. We expect to address those Paperwork Reduction
Act issues in connection with our consideration of those proposed rules and forms.
In addition, the representation provision of the proposed definition of “transaction conducted
within the United States” contained a collection of information. These final rules do not
encompass that collection of information requirement, however, because we are not adopting the
“transaction conducted within the United States” element of the proposed rule in this release. See
section I.A, supra.

778

We also note that Exchange Act rule 0-13, which we are adopting today, determines the
procedures for market participants and foreign regulatory authorities to submit substituted
compliance requests. The rule, however, does not provide any substituted compliance rights, and
its applicability will be determined solely by the substituted compliance provisions of the
substantive rulemakings. Accordingly, collection of information arising from substituted
compliance requests, including associated control numbers, will be addressed in connection with
any applicable substantive rulemakings that provide for substituted compliance.

306

3a71-3 is “Reliance on Counterparty Representations Regarding Activity Within the United
States.” OMB has not yet assigned Control Numbers in connection with rule 3a71-3 or the other
rules submitted in connection with the proposal.
B. Reliance on Counterparty Representations Regarding Transactions Conducted
Through a Foreign Branch
1. Summary of Collection of Information
When determining whether a security-based swap transaction constitutes a “transaction
conducted through a foreign branch,” a person may rely on its counterparty’s representation that
the transaction “was arranged, negotiated, and executed on behalf of the foreign branch solely by
persons located outside the United States, unless such person knows or has reason to know that
the representation is not accurate.” 779
2. Proposed Use of Information
Under the final rules, a non-U.S. person need not count, against the applicable thresholds
of the dealer exception and the major security-based swap participant definition, dealing
transactions with foreign branches of U.S. banks that are registered as security-based swap
dealers. For these purposes, the foreign branch must be the counterparty to the security-based
swap transaction, and the transaction must be arranged, negotiated, and executed on behalf of the
foreign branch solely by persons located outside the United States. 780
As discussed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the Commission acknowledges
that verifying whether a security-based swap transaction falls within the definition of
“transaction conducted through a foreign branch” could require significant due diligence. The
definition’s representation provision would mitigate the operational difficulties and costs that
779

otherwise could arise in connection with investigating the activities of a counterparty to ensure
compliance with the corresponding rules. 781
These representations would be provided voluntarily by the counterparties to certain
security-based swap transactions to other counterparties; therefore, the Commission would not
typically receive confidential information as a result of this collection of information. However,
to the extent that the Commission receives confidential information described in this
representation provision through our examination and oversight program, an investigation, or
some other means, such information would be kept confidential, subject to the provisions of
applicable law. 782
3. Respondents
Based on our understanding of the OTC derivatives markets, including the size of the
market, the number of counterparties that are active in the market, and how market participants
currently structure security-based swap transactions, the Commission estimates that up to 15
entities that are registered as security-based swap dealers may include a representation that a
security-based swap is a ‘‘transaction conducted through a foreign branch’’ in their trading
relationship documentation (e.g., the schedule to a master agreement). 783
781

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31107.

782

See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 552 (Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act provides an exemption
for “trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged
or confidential.” 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4). Exemption 8 of the Freedom of Information Act provides an
exemption for matters that are “contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition
reports prepare by, or on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or
supervision of financial institutions.” 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(8)).

783

We have estimated that up to 50 entities may register with the Commission as security-based
swap dealers, based on an analysis of 2012 data indicating that 27 entities had $3 billion or more
in notional transactions that would be counted against the thresholds under the final rules, and
further accounting for new entrants into the market. See note 444, supra, and accompanying text.
Because six of those 27 entities are domiciled in the United States, we conservatively estimate
that it is possible that new entrants may lead up to 15 registered dealers to be U.S. banks.

308

4. Total Initial and Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burdens
The estimates in this section reflect the Commission’s experience with burden estimates
for similar requirements and discussions by our staff with market participants. The Commission
believes that, in most cases, the representations associated with the definition of “transaction
conducted through a foreign branch” would be made through amendments to the parties’ existing
trading documentation (e.g., the schedule to a master agreement). 784 Because these
representations relate to new regulatory requirements, the Commission anticipates that
counterparties may elect to develop and incorporate these representations in trading
documentation soon after the effective date of the Commission’s security-based swap
regulations, rather than incorporating specific language on a transactional basis. The
Commission believes that parties would be able to adopt, where appropriate, standardized
language across all of their security-based swap trading relationships. This language may be

Although not all U.S. banks engaged in security-based swap dealing activity currently operate
foreign branches, we also conservatively estimate that all such dealers that are U.S. banks would
do so.
In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, we preliminarily estimated that 50 entities may include a
representation that a transaction constitutes a “transaction conducted through a foreign branch.”
See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR at 31108. This revised estimate reflects the fact that
under the final rules such a representation would be relevant only if provided by a person that is
registered with the Commission as a security-based swap dealer. In practice, however, based on
our understanding of changes in the way major U.S. dealers engage with non-U.S. counterparties
in the single-name CDS market following the issuance of the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, we
believe that few, if any, U.S. persons currently may participate in the single-name CDS market
through their foreign branches. Also, as noted above, moreover, we recognize that other
regulatory provisions may limit the ability of U.S. banks to conduct security-based swap activity.
See note 366, supra.
784

The Commission believes that because trading relationship documentation is established between
two counterparties, the question of whether one of those counterparties, that is registered with the
Commission as a security-based swap dealer, is able to represent that it is entering into a
“transaction conducted through a foreign branch” would not change on a transaction-bytransaction basis and, therefore, such representations would generally be made in the schedule to
a master agreement, rather than in individual confirmations.

309

developed by individual firms or through a combination of trade associations and industry
working groups.
The Commission estimates the maximum total paperwork burden associated with
developing new representations would be, for each U.S. bank registered as a security-based swap
dealer that may make such representations, no more than five hours, and up to $2,000 for the
services of outside professionals, for an estimate of approximately 75 hours and $30,000 across
all security-based swap counterparties that may make such representations. This estimate
assumes little or no reliance on standardized disclosure language.
The Commission expects that the majority of the burden associated with the new
disclosure requirements will be experienced during the first year as language is developed and
trading documentation is amended. After the new representations are developed and incorporated
into trading documentation, the Commission believes that the annual paperwork burden
associated with this requirement would be no more than approximately 10 hours per counterparty
for verifying representations with existing counterparties and onboarding new counterparties, for
a maximum of approximately 150 hours across all applicable security-based swap
counterparties. 785
C. Reliance on Counterparty Representations Regarding Non-U.S. Person Status
1. Summary of Collection of Information
When determining whether its counterparty is a U.S. person for purposes of the
application of the dealer and major participant analyses, a person may rely on its counterparty’s

785

The Commission staff estimates that this burden would consist of 10 hours of in-house counsel
time for each security-based swap market participant that may make such representations.

310

representation that the counterparty does not meet the applicable criteria to be a U.S. person,
unless the person knows or has reason to know that the representation is not accurate. 786
2. Proposed Use of Information
Under the final rules, a non-U.S. person’s dealer and major participant analysis require it
to determine whether its security-based swap counterparties are U.S. persons because certain
security-based swaps in which the counterparty is not a U.S. person will not have to be counted
against the applicable thresholds.
The Commission recognizes that the “U.S. person” definition encompasses a number of
distinct components, and that in some circumstances verifying whether a security-based swap
counterparty is a “U.S. person” could require significant due diligence. As a result, the final
rules have added a representation provision to that definition, to help mitigate the operational
difficulties and costs that could arise in connection with investigating the status of a
counterparty.
As with the representations associated with the “transaction conducted through a foreign
branch” definition, these representations would be provided voluntarily by the counterparties to
certain security-based swap transactions to other counterparties. The Commission would not
typically receive confidential information as a result of this collection of information. However,
to the extent that the Commission receives confidential information described in this
representation provision through our examination and oversight program, an investigation, or
some other means, such information would be kept confidential, subject to the provisions of
applicable law. 787

311

3. Respondents
Based on our understanding of the OTC derivatives markets, including the domiciles of
counterparties that are active in the market, the Commission estimates that up to 2400 entities
may provide representations that they do not meet the criteria necessary to be U.S. persons. 788
4. Total Initial and Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burdens
The estimates in this section reflect the Commission’s experience with burden estimates
for similar requirements and discussions by our staff with market participants. Consistent with
the discussion above related to the representation provision of the “transaction conducted
through a foreign branch” definition, the Commission believes that in most cases the
representations associated with the “U.S. person” definition would be made through amendments
to the parties’ existing trading documentation (e.g., the schedule to a master agreement). 789 Here
too, because these representations relate to new regulatory requirements, the Commission
anticipates that counterparties may elect to develop and incorporate these representations in
trading documentation soon after the effective date of the Commission’s security-based swap
regulations, rather than incorporating specific language on a transactional basis. The
Commission believes that parties would be able to adopt, where appropriate, standardized
language across all of their security-based swap trading relationships. This language may be

788

Data regarding activity from 2012 indicates that a total of 4452 accounts had positions in singlename CDS, with those activities conducted by a total 1030 transacting agents such as investment
advisers. Of those 4452 accounts, 1199 are domiciled outside of the United States. Accounting
for potential growth in the number of market participants domiciled outside of the United States –
particularly in light of information suggesting there has been some shifting of derivatives
activities to non-U.S. entities – leads to our estimate that such representations may be made on
behalf of 2400 accounts. To the extent that one transacting agent such as an investment adviser
conducts derivatives activities on behalf of multiple accounts, it is possible that a single
representation by a transacting agent would address the U.S.-person status of multiple accounts.

See section IV.E.2, supra.

312

developed by individual firms or through a combination of trade associations and industry
working groups.
As above, the Commission estimates the maximum total paperwork burden associated
with developing new representations would be, for each counterparty that may make such
representations, no more than five hours and up to $2,000 for the services of outside
professionals, for a maximum of approximately 12,000 hours and $4.8 million across all
security-based swap counterparties that may make such representations. This estimate assumes
little or no reliance on standardized disclosure language.
The Commission expects that the majority of the burden associated with the new
disclosure requirements will be experienced during the first year as language is developed and
trading documentation is amended. After the new representations are developed and incorporated
into trading documentation, the Commission believes that the annual paperwork burden
associated with this requirement would be no more than approximately 10 hours per counterparty
for verifying representations with existing counterparties and onboarding new counterparties, for
a maximum of approximately 24,000 hours across all applicable security-based swap
counterparties. 790
X. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”) 791 requires Federal agencies, in promulgating
rules, to consider the impact of those rules on small entities. Section 603(a) of the
Administrative Procedure Act, 792 as amended by the RFA, generally requires the Commission to

313

undertake a regulatory flexibility analysis of all proposed rules, or proposed rule amendments, to
determine the impact of such rulemaking on “small entities.” 793 Section 605(b) of the RFA 794
provides that this requirement shall not apply to any proposed rule or proposed rule amendment
which, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities.
For purposes of Commission rulemaking in connection with the RFA, a small entity
includes: (1) when used with reference to an “issuer” or a “person,” other than an investment
company, an “issuer” or “person” that, on the last day of its most recent fiscal year, had total
assets of $5 million or less; 795 or (2) a broker-dealer with total capital (net worth plus
subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the date in the prior fiscal year as of which its
audited financial statements were prepared pursuant to Rule 17a-5(d) under the Exchange Act, 796
or, if not required to file such statements, a broker-dealer with total capital (net worth plus
subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the last day of the preceding fiscal year (or in
the time that it has been in business, if shorter); and is not affiliated with any person (other than a
natural person) that is not a small business or small organization. 797 Under the standards adopted
by the Small Business Administration, small entities in the finance and insurance industry
include the following: (i) for entities engaged in credit intermediation and related activities,
793

Although section 601(b) of the RFA defines the term “small entity,” the statute permits agencies
to formulate their own definitions. The Commission has adopted definitions for the term “small
entity” for the purposes of Commission rulemaking in accordance with the RFA. Those
definitions, as relevant to this proposed rulemaking, are set forth in Rule 0-10 under the Exchange
Act, 17 CFR 240.0-10. See Exchange Act Release No. 18451 (Jan, 28, 1982), 47 FR 5215 (Feb,
4, 1982) (File No. AS-305).

entities with $175 million or less in assets; 798 (ii) for entities engaged in non-depository credit
intermediation and certain other activities, entities with $7 million or less in annual receipts; 799
(iii) for entities engaged in financial investments and related activities, entities with $7 million or
less in annual receipts; 800 (iv) for insurance carriers and entities engaged in related activities,
entities with $7 million or less in annual receipts; 801 and (v) for funds, trusts, and other financial
vehicles, entities with $7 million or less in annual receipts. 802
The Cross-Border Proposal stated that, based on feedback from industry participants and
our own information about the security-based swap markets, we preliminarily believed that nonU.S. entities that would be required to register and be regulated as security-based swap dealers
and major security-based swap participants exceed the thresholds defining “small entities” set
out above. Thus, we noted that we preliminarily believed it is unlikely that the proposed rules
regarding registration of security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap market
participants would have a significant economic impact any small entity. As a result, we certified
that the proposed rules would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities for purposes of the RFA and requested written comments regarding this
certification. 803
While we received comment letters that addressed cost issues in connection with the
proposed rules, we did not receive any comments that specifically addressed whether the rules

315

applying the definitions of “security-based swap dealer” or “major security-based swap
participant” to the cross-border context would have a significant economic impact on small
entities.
We continue to believe that the types of entities that would engage in more than a de
minimis amount of dealing activity involving security-based swaps—which generally would be
major banks—would not be “small entities” for purposes of the RFA. Similarly, we believe that
only the largest financial companies would be likely to develop security-based swap exposures
of the size that would be required to cross the major security-based swap participant definition
thresholds. Accordingly, the SEC certifies that the final rules applying the definitions of
“security-based swap dealer” or “major security-based swap participant” to the cross-border
context will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities for
purposes of the RFA.
XI. Effective Date and Implementation
These final rules will be effective September 8, 2014.
If any provision of these rules, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is
held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or application of such
provisions to other persons or circumstances that can be given effect without the invalid
provision or application.
Because Exchange Act rules 3a67-10 and 3a71-3 through 3a71-5 address the application
of the dealer and major participant definitions to cross-border security-based swap activities,
those rules will not immediately impose requirements upon market participants even after the
rules become effective. In the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, we noted that because
the Commission has not yet promulgated final rules implementing the substantive requirements
imposed on dealers and major participants by Title VII, persons determined to be dealers or
316

major participants under the regulations adopted in that release need not register as such until the
dates provided in the Commission’s final rules regarding security-based swap dealer and major
security-based swap participant registration requirements, and will not be subject to the
requirements applicable to those dealers and major participants until the dates provided in the
applicable final rules. 804 Those principles apply here too.
Although Exchange Act rule 0-13 – regarding the procedures for the submission of
substituted compliance requests – also will become effective at that time, we would not expect to
receive any such requests until relevant substantive rulemakings have been completed. Those
rulemakings are necessary to determine when substituted compliance may be available, and to
promulgate the requirements against which we may assess comparability for purposes of making
substituted compliance determinations.

Statutory Authority and Text of Final Rules
Pursuant to the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq., and particularly, sections 3(b),
23(a)(1), and 30(c) thereof, sections 761(b), and 929P(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC is
adopting rules 0-13, 3a67-10, 3a71-3, 3a71-4, and 3a71-5 under the Exchange Act, and the SEC

Add § 240.0-13 to read as follows:

§ 240.0-13 Commission procedures for filing applications to request a substituted
compliance order under the Exchange Act.
(a) The application shall be in writing in the form of a letter, must include any supporting
documents necessary to make the application complete, and otherwise must comply with §

318

240.0-3. All applications must be submitted to the Office of the Secretary of the Commission, by
a party that potentially would comply with requirements under the Exchange Act pursuant to a
substituted compliance order, or by the relevant foreign financial regulatory authority or
authorities. If an application is incomplete, the Commission may request that the application be
withdrawn unless the applicant can justify, based on all the facts and circumstances, why
supporting materials have not been submitted and undertakes to submit the omitted materials
promptly.
(b) An applicant may submit a request electronically. The electronic mailbox to use for
these applications is described on the Commission's website at www.sec.gov in the "Exchange
Act Substituted Compliance Applications" section. In the event electronic mailboxes are revised
in the future, applicants can find the appropriate mailbox by accessing the “Electronic Mailboxes
at the Commission” section.
(c) All filings and submissions filed pursuant to this rule must be in the English language.
If a filing or submission filed pursuant to this rule requires the inclusion of a document that is in
a foreign language, a party must submit instead a fair and accurate English translation of the
entire foreign language document. A party may submit a copy of the unabridged foreign
language document when including an English translation of a foreign language document in a
filing or submission filed pursuant to this rule. A party must provide a copy of any foreign
language document upon the request of Commission staff.
(d) An applicant also may submit a request in paper format. Five copies of every paper
application and every amendment to such an application must be submitted to the Office of the
Secretary at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549-1090. Applications must be on white
paper no larger than 8½ by 11 inches in size. The left margin of applications must be at least 1½

319

inches wide, and if the application is bound, it must be bound on the left side. All typewritten or
printed material must be set forth in black ink so as to permit photocopying.
(e) Every application (electronic or paper) must contain the name, address, telephone
number, and email address of each applicant and the name, address, telephone number, and email
address of a person to whom any questions regarding the application should be directed. The
Commission will not consider hypothetical or anonymous requests for a substituted compliance
order. Each applicant shall provide the Commission with any supporting documentation it
believes necessary for the Commission to make such determination, including information
regarding applicable requirements established by the foreign financial regulatory authority or
authorities, as well as the methods used by the foreign financial regulatory authority or
authorities to monitor and enforce compliance with such rules. Applicants should also cite to and
discuss applicable precedent.
(f) Amendments to the application should be prepared and submitted as set forth in these
procedures and should be marked to show what changes have been made.
(g) After the filing is complete, the staff will review the application. Once all questions
and issues have been answered to the satisfaction of the staff, the staff will make an appropriate
recommendation to the Commission. After consideration of the recommendation and a vote by
the Commission, the Commission’s Office of the Secretary will issue an appropriate response
and will notify the applicant.
(h) The Commission shall publish in the Federal Register a notice that a complete
application has been submitted. The notice will provide that any person may, within the period
specified therein, submit to the Commission any information that relates to the Commission
action requested in the application. The notice also will indicate the earliest date on which the

320

Commission would take final action on the application, but in no event would such action be
taken earlier than 25 days following publication of the notice in the Federal Register.
(i) The Commission may, in its sole discretion, schedule a hearing on the matter
addressed by the application.
3.

Add § 240-3a67-10 to read as follows:

§ 240.3a67-10 Foreign major security-based swap participants.
(a) Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
(1) Conduit affiliate has the meaning set forth in § 240.3a71-3(a)(1).
(2) Foreign branch has the meaning set forth in § 240.3a71-3(a)(2).
(3) Transaction conducted through a foreign branch has the meaning set forth in §
240.3a71-3(a)(3).
(4) U.S. person has the meaning set forth in § 240.3a71-3(a)(4).
(b) Application of major security-based swap participant tests in the cross-border
context. For purposes of calculating a person’s status as a major security-based swap participant
as defined in section 3(a)(67) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(67)), and the rules and regulations
thereunder, a person shall include the following security-based swap positions:
(1) If such person is a U.S. person, all security-based swap positions that are entered into
by the person, including positions entered into through a foreign branch;
(2) If such person is a conduit affiliate, all security-based swap positions that are entered
into by the person; and
(3) If such person is a non-U.S. person other than a conduit affiliate, all of the following
types of security-based swap positions that are entered into by the person:

321

(i) Security-based swap positions that are entered into with a U.S. person; provided,
however, that this paragraph (i) shall not apply to:
(A) Positions with a U.S. person counterparty that arise from transactions conducted
through a foreign branch of the counterparty, when the counterparty is a registered securitybased swap dealer; and
(B) Positions with a U.S. person counterparty that arise from transactions conducted
through a foreign branch of the counterparty, when the transaction is entered into prior to 60
days following the earliest date on which the registration of security-based swap dealers is first
required pursuant to the applicable final rules and regulations; and
(ii) Security-based swap positions for which the non-U.S. person’s counterparty to the
security-based swap has rights of recourse against a U.S. person; for these purposes a
counterparty has rights of recourse against the U.S. person if the counterparty has a conditional
or unconditional legally enforceable right, in whole or in part, to receive payments from, or
otherwise collect from, the U.S. person in connection with the security-based swap.
(c) Attributed positions.
(1) In general. For purposes of calculating a person’s status as a major security-based
swap participant as defined in section 3(a)(67) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(67)), and the rules
and regulations thereunder, a person also shall include the following security-based swap
positions:
(i) If such person is a U.S. person, any security-based swap position of a non-U.S. person
for which the non-U.S. person’s counterparty to the security-based swap has rights of recourse
against that U.S. person.

322

Note to paragraph (c)(1)(i). This paragraph describes attribution requirements for a U.S.
person solely with respect to the guarantee of the obligations of a non-U.S. person under a
security-based swap. The Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
previously provided an interpretation about attribution to a U.S. parent, other affiliate, or
guarantor to the extent that the counterparties to those positions have recourse against that
parent, other affiliate, or guarantor in connection with the position. See Intermediary Definitions
Adopting Release, http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-08-13/pdf/2012-18003.pdf. The
Commission explained that it intended to issue separate releases addressing the application of the
major participant definition, and Title VII generally, to non-U.S. persons. See id. at note 1041.
(ii) If such person is a non-U.S. person:
(A) Any security-based swap position of a U.S. person for which that person’s
counterparty has rights of recourse against the non-U.S. person; and
(B) Any security-based swap position of another non-U.S. person entered into with a U.S.
person counterparty who has rights of recourse against the first non-U.S. person, provided,
however, that this paragraph (B) shall not apply to positions described in § 240.3a6710(b)(3)(i)(A) and (B).
(2) Exceptions. Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a person shall not
include such security-based swap positions if the person whose performance is guaranteed in
connection with the security-based swap is:
(i) Subject to capital regulation by the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (including, but not limited to regulation as a swap dealer, major swap participant,
security-based swap dealer, major security-based swap participant, futures commission
merchant, broker, or dealer);

323

(ii) Regulated as a bank in the United States;
(iii) Subject to capital standards, adopted by the person’s home country supervisor, that
are consistent in all respects with the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision; or
(iv) Deemed not to be a major security-based swap participant pursuant to § 240.3a678(a).

swaps or other arrangements with such U.S. persons to transfer risks and benefits of those

(a)(1)(i)(A) of this section is satisfied if one or more persons described in § 240.3a713(a)(4)(i)(B) directly or indirectly own a majority interest in the non-U.S. person, where
“majority interest” is the right to vote or direct the vote of a majority of a class of voting
securities of an entity, the power to sell or direct the sale of a majority of a class of voting

to be a U.S. person if such person receives a representation from the counterparty that the
counterparty does not satisfy the criteria set forth in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, unless
such person knows or has reason to know that the representation is not accurate; for the purposes
of this final rule a person would have reason to know the representation is not accurate if a

accurate.
(5) United States means the United States of America, its territories and possessions, any
State of the United States, and the District of Columbia.
(b) Application of de minimis exception to cross-border dealing activity. For purposes of

(B) Security-based swap transactions connected with the dealing activity in which such
person engages for which the counterparty to the security-based swap has rights of recourse
against a U.S. person that is controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the nonU.S. person; for these purposes a counterparty has rights of recourse against the U.S. person if
the counterparty has a conditional or unconditional legally enforceable right, in whole or in part,
to receive payments from, or otherwise collect from, the U.S. person in connection with the
security-based swap; and
