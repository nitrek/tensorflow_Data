Mark Shaw,
Respondents.
On January 14, 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) issued
an Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings Pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions against BNY
Mellon Securities LLC (“Mellon Securities”) (Exchange Act Rel. No. 63724 (Jan. 14, 2011))
(“Mellon Securities Order”). On the same day, the Commission issued a Corrected Order
Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the
Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order against Mark
Shaw (“Shaw”) (Securities Act Rel. No. 9174 (Jan. 14, 2011)) (“Shaw Order”). The Mellon
Securities Order, among other things, required Mellon Securities to pay $19,297,016
disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest thereon of $3,748,431, and a civil penalty of
$1,000,000, and created a Fair Fund, pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of

2002, to compensate investors for losses attributable to certain cross trades conducted on their
behalf by Mellon Securities (“Fair Fund”). The Shaw Order required Shaw to pay $195,300
disgorgement, plus prejudgment interest thereon of $23,291, and a civil penalty of $150,000, and
provided that the monies paid by Shaw may be distributed by the Fair Fund established in the
Mellon Securities Order. Both Mellon Securities and Shaw paid the sums the Commission
ordered to be paid, creating a $24,414,038 Fair Fund, which is currently on deposit with the
United States Treasury.
On January 31, 2013, pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and
Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1103, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Plan of
Distribution and Opportunity for Comment (“Notice”) for the distribution of monies placed into
the Fair Fund to affected investors (Exchange Act Rel. No. 68796 (Jan. 31, 2013)). The Notice
provided all interested parties thirty (30) days to submit a comment on the proposed Plan of
Distribution (“Plan”). Where sufficient data is available (“in-sample period”), the Plan would
compensate affected investors based on the difference between the prices that could have been
expected had the cross trades at issue received best execution and the prices actually received
due to the conduct described in the Mellon Securities and Shaw Orders. Where sufficient data is
not available, the Plan would compensate affected investors based on an algorithm (developed
utilizing data from the in-sample period, publicly available data, and regression analysis)
designed to determine the impact on affected investors due to the conduct described in the
Mellon Securities and Shaw Orders. No comments were received on the Plan.
The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) now seeks approval of the Plan with a
modification to require the fund administrator to obtain a bond in the amount of $24,414,038
pursuant to Rule 1105(c), 17 C.F.R. § 201.1105(c). The Plan, at the time of the Notice,

2

contemplated waiver of the bond. The Division believes requiring a bond is advisable because it
provides protections to investors for errors resulting from negligence rather than the “gross
negligence” standard of most insurance, and it provides the most direct recovery for the Fair
Fund. In addition, the amount of the bond will cost approximately $80,000 per annum and, as
compared to the coverage afforded, is a reasonable cost associated with the distribution. The
cost of the bond will be paid from the Fair Fund, first from the interest earned, and if the interest
is insufficient, then from its corpus.
As proposed in the Plan, the Division further seeks appointment of Boston Financial Data
Services (“BFDS”) as the fund administrator pursuant to Rule 1105(a), 17 C.F.R. § 201.1105(a).
BFDS’s fees and expenses will be paid by Mellon Securities.
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:
A.

Pursuant to Rule 1104, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1104, the Plan is modified as described

above, and approved with such modification;
B.

BFDS is appointed as Fund Administrator for the Fair Fund pursuant to Rule

1105(a), 17 C.F.R. § 201.1105(a); and
C.

The Fund Administrator, BFDS, shall obtain a bond in the manner prescribed in

Rule 1105(c), 17 C.F.R. § 201.1105(c), in the approved amount of $24,414,038.
By the Commission.

Secretary
