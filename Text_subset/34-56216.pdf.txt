Respondents.

On July 19, 2006, the Commission published a notice of the Plan of Distribution (“Plan”)
proposed by the Division of Enforcement in connection with this proceeding (Securities
Exchange Act Release No. 54175). The Commission received comments and on April 6, 2007
the Plan was approved.
The Plan of Distribution provides that a Fair Fund consisting of $140,000,000 in
disgorgement and civil penalties, plus any accrued interest, be transferred to Deutsche Bank to
be distributed by the Plan Administrator to injured investors according to the methodology set
forth in the Plan. The Plan provides that the Commission will arrange for distribution of the Fair
Fund when a Payment File listing the payees with the identification information required to
make the distribution has been received and accepted. The Payment File for the second
distribution has been received and accepted. 1
Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the Commission staff shall transfer $19,148,806.83 of
the Fair Fund to Deutsche Bank and the Plan Administrator shall distribute such monies to
investors, as provided for in the Plan of Distribution.
