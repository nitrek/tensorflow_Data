APPEARANCES:
David Henry Disraeli, pro se and for Lifeplan Associates, Inc.
Marshall Gandy, for the Division of Enforcement.
Appeal filed: March 29, 2007
Last brief received: July 2, 2007
I.
David Henry Disraeli ("Disraeli") and Lifeplan Associates, Inc. ("Lifeplan") appeal the
initial decision of an administrative law judge. The law judge found that Disraeli and Lifeplan
willfully violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and that Disraeli violated Section 206 of
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-4(a)(1), by making material
misstatements and omissions in the offer and sale of securities. 1/ The law judge also found that
Disraeli willfully violated Advisers Act Sections 203A and 207 by registering with the
Commission as an investment adviser when he did not qualify for Commission registration and
by making material misstatements and omissions in his registration applications. 2/ The law
judge found further that Disraeli violated Advisers Act Section 204 and Advisers Act Rules 204­
2(a)(1), 204-2(a)(2), and 204-2(a)(6) by failing to maintain accurate books and records. 3/ The
law judge revoked Disraeli's investment adviser registration, barred Disraeli from association
with a broker, dealer, or investment adviser, imposed a $120,000 civil money penalty on Disraeli,
ordered that Disraeli disgorge $84,300 plus prejudgment interest, and imposed cease-and-desist
orders on Disraeli and Lifeplan. We base our findings on an independent review of the record
except with respect to those findings not challenged on appeal. 4/

Division did not appeal the law judge's determination.

Disraeli has filed a motion "for Abatement and Settlement Discussions" requesting "that

II.
Respondents
David Henry Disraeli is registered with the Commission as an investment adviser under
the name "David Henry Disraeli DBA Lifeplan Associates." Disraeli provides discretionary
investment advisory services to twenty-five clients, twenty-four of whom reside in Texas, and
has received more than $500 in fees more than six months in advance. Pursuant to written
advisory agreements with his clients, Disraeli receives a fee equal to 1.5% of the assets under
management for advice about his clients' investments.
Disraeli incorporated Lifeplan in Texas around September 30, 2003. He holds eighty
percent of Lifeplan's outstanding stock; approximately eleven of his advisory clients hold the
remaining twenty percent. Disraeli is Lifeplan's sole officer, director, and employee. Lifeplan
shares Disraeli's home address.
III.
The Lifeplan Offering
From September 2003 to December 2003, and also in December 2004 and March 2005,
Disraeli offered and sold shares of Lifeplan common stock. A "Confidential Limited Offering
Memorandum," dated October 21, 2003 (the "October Memorandum"), offered 200,000 Lifeplan
shares pursuant to Rule 504 of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933. 5/ It stated that the
shares would "be sold at $.50 each to capitalized [sic] the company with $100,000" and listed a
minimum offering amount of $50,000. According to the October Memorandum, Lifeplan
planned to "form two limited partnerships, one a market neutral hedge fund and the other a fund
to purchase charged off consumer debt." The October Memorandum also stated that Disraeli
"will not draw a salary but will distribute all profits annually pro rata based on stock ownership."
The October Memorandum represented that the proceeds of the offering would "be used for
working capital, legal fees administrative fees and other expenses." 6/
The October Memorandum stated that Lifeplan "was granted registration as an
Investment Advisor with the Securities and Exchange Commission," and represented that
Lifeplan was "the successor entity to Disraeli and Associates in all respects." Disraeli &
Associates was a sole proprietorship that Disraeli had registered with the Commission as an
investment adviser in 1993.

5/	

17 C.F.R. § 230.504. The October Memorandum consisted of two double-sided pages.

6/	

Although the October Memorandum is dated October 21, 2003, the record indicates that
Disraeli sold Lifeplan shares as early as September 30, 2003.

4
The October Memorandum stated that Lifeplan would "attempt to consummate
management agreements with Disraeli and Associates' former clients" and that Lifeplan would
"charge 1.5% of assets under management." Disraeli's clients were friends and family with
whom Disraeli had had a business relationship of between ten and twenty years' duration. In his
investigative testimony, Disraeli testified that these individuals executed new advisory
agreements after Disraeli formed Lifeplan. Disraeli stated that his clients "got a new agreement
with a new fee schedule." The record indicates that, after Disraeli formed Lifeplan, Disraeli
began charging his investment advisory clients fees around November 2003.
Disraeli offered and sold the Lifeplan shares to his investment advisory clients. Disraeli
testified that he conducted the offering by calling his clients and sending them the October
Memorandum. He stated that the October Memorandum constituted "the nuts and bolts of what
[he] was telling people." He added that he told them they would get "20 percent of their original
investment in cash per year." According to Disraeli, his clients had the opportunity to ask
questions, and he met with at least two clients personally. Disraeli told his clients that he
"needed to raise some money." He testified that he did not "remember having any substantive
discussion about the specific use of the proceeds" and "thought it was understood that [he]
needed the money to operate." Disraeli testified further that, regarding his use of the funds for
personal expenses, he "didn't tell [his clients] anything." 7/ The one subscription agreement in
the record states that the investor "received no representations or warranties (other than any
contained in the Offering Memorandum) from the Company or its employees or agents, or any
other person and [sic], in making [his] investment decision." A document entitled "Lifeplan
Corporate Books" indicates that, between September 2003 and December 2004, nine clients
purchased 200,000 Lifeplan shares for a total of $95,000. 8/
On October 9, 2003, after raising only $30,000 of the $50,000 minimum offering amount,
Disraeli transferred $12,000 from Lifeplan's bank account to his personal bank account to cover
the purchase of a $9,300 cashier's check payable to the IRS to release a lien on all property and
rights to property belonging to Disraeli for failing to pay personal income taxes. 9/

7/

Disraeli provided this testimony in response to a question from his counsel asking him if
it was correct that he did not inform his clients that the proceeds would be used for
personal expenses. Disraeli's counsel objected that Disraeli's answer was non-responsive
and asked the question a second time. Disraeli then stated that he "did have
conversations about that" but did not describe the conversations.

8/

According to the document, one investor paid $5,000 for his 20,000 shares rather than the
$10,000 that would be expected at $.50 per share. At some point, two clients purchased a
total of an additional 20,000 Lifeplan shares at $.50 per share to increase the total
proceeds of the offering to $105,000.

9/

Although the IRS filed the lien after Disraeli failed to pay $39,384.92 in taxes, it released
the lien in a negotiated compromise after Disraeli paid $9,364.

5

Disraeli continued using the proceeds raised by the sale of Lifeplan shares. He states that,
of the $85,000 that had been raised by early December 2003, he "loaned himself" $84,300 "to
pay for both personal and business expenses." Disraeli's and Lifeplan's bank statements confirm
that, between October 9, 2003 and December 23, 2003, Disraeli transferred $83,500 from
Lifeplan's checking account directly into his personal bank account. 10/ These statements
establish that, after Disraeli transferred the funds into his personal account, he made payments for
personal expenses such as credit cards, groceries, pets, restaurants, and shopping. These
statements also establish that Disraeli paid personal expenses with Lifeplan funds directly out of
Lifeplan's account. Disraeli himself created a document listing "personal expenses that [he] felt
were not legitimate business expenses paid out of the corporate account." These payments
included payments for coffee, ice cream, groceries, restaurants, and videos. When asked during
investigative testimony why he used the Lifeplan account to pay personal expenses, Disraeli
answered that he did not "have a good reason." Although Disraeli contends that some of the
proceeds raised in the offering and expended from Lifeplan's account were used for business
purposes, he concedes that he "did pay personal expenses out of Lifeplan checking accounts." 11/
Although Disraeli "thought [he] made adequate disclosures" in the October
Memorandum, he provided investors with a second "Confidential Limited Offering
Memorandum," dated December 9, 2003 (the "December Memorandum"), after he consulted a
law firm and became "concerned about the possibility that a third-party regulator might take th[e]
position" that his clients had not been fully informed about the use of the proceeds. The law firm
prepared the December Memorandum as well as a rescission offer. 12/
Notwithstanding that Disraeli had started spending the proceeds of the offering after
raising only $30,000, the December Memorandum represented that Lifeplan would hold and
segregate the offering proceeds, for return to investors, until reaching the $50,000 minimum
offering amount. It reiterated that Lifeplan would apply the offering proceeds to the operation of
the advisory business, to the creation of a partnership that would purchase distressed consumer

10/	

Disraeli provided Commission staff with a document acknowledging these transfers and
indicating that he also transferred an additional $800 from the Lifeplan account into his
personal bank account for a total of $84,300.

11/	

Lifeplan's bank statements indicate payments from the account for expenses that could be
used for business purposes, such as Federal Express, Comp USA, and OfficeMax.

12/	

Disraeli testified that "almost all" of the proceeds of the offering had been raised by the
date of the December Memorandum.

debt, and to administrative and start-up expenses and working capital. 13/ It added that, due to
"the number and variability of factors that determine the Company's use of the net proceeds of
the Offering, the Company cannot assure [investors] that such uses will not vary from the
Company's current intentions or that shareholders will agree with the uses it has chosen."
Neither offering memorandum disclosed either the transfer of $84,300 from Lifeplan's
account into Disraeli's personal bank account or the use of proceeds from the offering for
Disraeli's personal expenses. The offering memoranda also did not disclose either the existence
of Disraeli's federal tax lien or the use of the proceeds of the offering to release that lien.
Disraeli testified that, at the time of the December Memorandum, he did not feel it was necessary
to inform his investors that he had spent almost the totality of the money that they invested in
Lifeplan. No investor funds were used for the purchase and collection of distressed consumer
debt, and Lifeplan never launched any of the ventures contemplated in the offering memoranda.
In January 2005, Commission staff from the Division of Enforcement and the Office of
Compliance, Inspections, and Examinations conducted a cause examination of Disraeli during
which it noted the expenditure of $84,300 from the offering proceeds. In response, Disraeli
produced an undated promissory note stating that he agreed to pay Lifeplan $84,300 plus interest
from November 10, 2003. Disraeli testified that he "could have" executed the note around that
November date. The law judge found, however, that the "evidence strongly suggest[ed] that
Disraeli created the promissory note much later than November 10, 2003." With respect to his
entire testimony, Disraeli's "many inconsistent and contradictory positions and [her] observation
of his demeanor cause[d] [her] to conclude that Disraeli's testimony was not credible."
After the staff's examination, Disraeli wrote an undated letter to his "fellow shareholders"
disclosing that he had "placed a large portion of the offering proceeds into [his] personal bank
account" because "[b]y the time Lifeplan Associates, Inc. was operational [he] had personally
absorbed approximately $25,000 in cash expenses attributable to the formation of the business."
According to Disraeli, he "felt the need to create this [letter] when [he] heard the types of
questions that [the Division of Enforcement] was asking [his] shareholders."
Two Lifeplan shareholders testified at the hearing. One shareholder, Nicholas Mallouf,
testified that Disraeli's $84,300 loan from the proceeds of the Lifeplan offering did not disturb
him because "there was no doubt in [Mallouf's] mind [Disraeli] was going to use [the Lifeplan
offering] for personal operating expenses." Mallouf also signed an affidavit stating that it "was
not material that a portion of the proceeds was used to satisfy a tax obligation, or any other

13/	

The memorandum included a table "set[ting] forth the anticipated initial uses of the funds
to develop the business." It assumed that $100,000 would be raised and included $18,000
for "personnel," $10,000 for "legal, other professional expenses," $2,000 for "capital
expenditures," $12,000 for "management fee credits," and $58,000 for "working capital."

personal obligation." He signed further a "Shareholder Ratification and Release" "ratif[ying] any
and all management decisions by David Disraeli regarding the use of offering proceeds." 14/
Ron Marek, another Lifeplan investor, testified at the hearing that he was not aware at the
time of the offering that Disraeli was loaning the proceeds of the offering to himself, that it
would have been important to him to know that fact before making his investment, and that he
would not have chosen to invest in Lifeplan had he known this information. Marek's wife Lenese
signed a declaration which mirrored her husband's testimony. 15/ Marek now does not want
Disraeli involved in his financial affairs in any respect.
Antifraud Violations
A.
Securities Act Section 17(a), Exchange Act Section 10(b), and Exchange Act
Rule 10b-5 forbid material misstatements or omissions in connection with the offer or sale of a
security. 16/ "A statement is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable
investor would consider it important in deciding whether or not to invest his money in a
particular security." 17/ "Violations of Section 17(a)(1), Section 10(b), and Rule 10b-5 require
scienter." 18/ "Scienter is not an element of a Section 17(a)(2) or Section 17(a)(3) cause of
action, however." 19/ "Scienter may be established by recklessness, defined as . . . an extreme
departure from the standards of ordinary care, and which presents a danger of misleading buyers
or sellers that is either known to the [actor] or is so obvious that the actor must have been aware
of it." 20/
We find that Disraeli and Lifeplan made material misstatements and omissions regarding
the use of the offering proceeds. "The disposition of the proceeds of a securities offering is

material information, and issuers must adhere strictly to the uses for the proceeds described in [a
private placement memorandum]." 21/ Disraeli did not devote the proceeds of the offering to the
ventures contemplated in the offering memoranda or to the administrative and start-up expenses
described therein. 22/ Instead, Disraeli lent himself proceeds of the offering to pay for the
release of a personal tax lien against him and for other personal expenses.
Both offering memoranda represented that the minimum offering amount was $50,000.
The December Memorandum further represented that Lifeplan would hold and segregate the
offering proceeds until reaching the minimum offering amount. At the time the December
Memorandum was written, however, Disraeli had already transferred $12,000 of the first $30,000
raised in the offering into his personal bank account. The misrepresentation of the size of the
offering and segregation and use of the offering proceeds and the failure to disclose the actual use
of the proceeds constituted material misstatements and omissions. 23/
"[K]nowledge . . . is sufficient to satisfy [the scienter] requirement. 24/ Disraeli prepared
and distributed the October Memorandum, and distributed the December Memorandum, which
falsely described the use and disposition of the offering proceeds. Although the offering
memoranda stated that the proceeds would be used for business expenses such as "working
capital, legal fees[,] administrative fees[,] and other expenses" in connection with acquiring
distressed consumer debt and starting a market neutral hedge fund, Disraeli transferred $84,300

from Lifeplan's checking account into his personal account and "admitted that he loaned himself
$85,000 to pay for both personal and [unspecified] business expenses." Disraeli did not disclose
his actual use of the funds to his investors. The offering memoranda also stated that the
minimum offering amount was $50,000 and that Lifeplan would hold and segregate the offering
proceeds until reaching the $50,000 minimum, but Disraeli used the proceeds of the offering to
cover a personal tax lien after raising only $30,000. Disraeli, therefore, knew that he informed
investors that the proceeds would be used for business expenses, that he did not use the proceeds
in this manner, and that his investors did not know about his actual use of the funds. It is
indisputable that Disraeli knew the falsity of the statements in the offering memoranda. We
therefore find that Disraeli, and thus Lifeplan, 25/ acted with scienter. 26/
Although Disraeli admits that "the Lifeplan offering could have been handled differently"
and that he "did pay personal expenses out of Lifeplan checking accounts and also paid business
expenses out of his personal account," he contends that this accounting arrangement "is not
fraud." Disraeli argues that he was entitled to borrow funds from the Lifeplan offering as
reimbursement for expenses incurred by him and associated with forming Lifeplan. Neither
offering memorandum, however, disclosed that he had advanced funds or that the proceeds from
the offering would be used for this purpose. The October Memorandum states that "[t]he
proceeds will be used for working capital, legal fees administrative fees and other expenses."
The December Memorandum lists, under "Uses of Funds," personnel, legal and other
professional expenses, capital expenditures, management fee credits, and working capital.
Disraeli claims that he was "entitled to borrow or simply take up to $70,000 from the offering
proceeds as specified in the offering documents for working capital and personnel expenses,
especially since the registered entity was then a sole proprietorship," but the offering memoranda
stated that Lifeplan was a corporation and that Lifeplan would use the proceeds of the offering as
described in the memoranda.
Although Disraeli also maintains that he "produce[d] evidence that all personal expenses
paid from Lifeplan funds were added to the salary calculation to which he was/is entitled,"
Disraeli does not identify this purported evidence, and both offering memoranda, as well as
Disraeli's employment agreement, stated that Disraeli would not receive a salary. Even if the

proceeds were actually used to reimburse Disraeli for expenses, the failure to disclose this use
would be a material omission. 27/
Disraeli also contends that he did not commit securities fraud because his investors "do
not consider the alleged misstatements or omissions to be material." 28/ However, "[t]he
question of materiality, it is universally agreed, is an objective one, involving the significance of
an omitted or misrepresented fact to a reasonable investor." 29/ "[T]he reaction of individual
investors is not determinative of materiality, since the standard is objective, not subjective." 30/
"[M]ateriality depends on the significance the reasonable investor would place on the withheld or
misrepresented information." 31/

materiality is to be resolved as a matter of law when the information is 'so

Although Disraeli also contends that investors signed releases "ratif[ying] any and all
management decisions by David Disraeli regarding the use of offering proceeds received
by Lifeplan Associates, Inc.," investor ratifications do not absolve Disraeli from
fraudulently departing from the stated use of the proceeds. See Lowry, 55 S.E.C. at 1140

ratified [respondent's] purported 'loan' several months after he used the funds does not

We find that a reasonable investor would want to know that Disraeli was diverting the proceeds
of the offering to his own use, particularly when Disraeli claimed he was going to vastly increase
assets under management and pay dividends. 33/
Disraeli also argues that "each Lifeplan shareholder invested based on their confidence in
Disraeli, not what was contained in the offering documents," and that "there is no causal
relationship between any alleged violations and investor harm." However, "the Commission is
not required to prove that any investor actually relied on the misrepresentations or that the
misrepresentations caused any investor to lose money." 34/ Although Disraeli contends further
that "each investor[']s contribution was insignificant in light of their net worth,"
misrepresentations "cannot be excused because the amount of money involved is small and the

salesman believes the customer can afford the risk." 35/ Disraeli further asserts that his investors
are sophisticated, but the sophistication of investors does not justify misleading them. 36/
Disraeli also cannot rely on the statement in the December Memorandum that due to "the
number and variability of factors that determine the Company's use of the net proceeds of the
Offering, the Company cannot assure [investors] that such uses will not vary from the Company's
current intentions or that shareholders will agree with the uses it has chosen." "[I]n offering
documents, specific statements control more general language such as that an allocation plan is
'flexible.'" 37/ A statement that the use of proceeds may vary from a company's current
intentions cannot cure the diversion of offering proceeds from specific business expenses
identified in offering memoranda to the personal use of the company's officers. 38/ Here,
Disraeli provided the December Memorandum after having diverted proceeds of the offering to
his personal use. The statement that the use of the proceeds could vary was itself misleading
because he had already deviated from the use of the proceeds described in the memorandum. 39/

Although Disraeli does not advance a reliance on counsel defense before us, he testified
that a law firm prepared the December Memorandum, and he stated in his post-hearing
brief that he "secured the services of reputable counsel to prepare an offering to cure
deficiencies in the earlier documents." On the record here a reliance on counsel defense
is not available. A claim of reliance on the advice of counsel requires a showing that the
party claiming it "made complete disclosure to counsel, sought advice as to the legality of
his conduct, received advice that his conduct was legal, and relied on that advice in good
faith." Markowski v. SEC, 34 F.3d 99, 104-05 (2d Cir. 1994) (citing SEC v. Savoy
Indus., Inc., 665 F.2d 1310, 1314 n.28 (D.C. Cir. 1981)). The record contains no
evidence that Disraeli made complete disclosures to counsel regarding his use of the
offering proceeds, that he received advice that his conduct was legal, and that he relied on
any advice in good faith despite knowing that he did not intend to use the proceeds of the
offering as described in either the October Memorandum or the December Memorandum.
Disraeli fraudulently diverted the majority of the proceeds of the offering to his personal
use, moreover, before consulting counsel.

13

Disraeli also testified that he was "under the impression that under a Reg D offering or a
limited offering in Texas, there's no disclosure requirements, period." However, "Regulation D
transactions are exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, not the antifraud
provisions." 40/ "Though Regulation D offerings are subject to fewer requirements, affirmative
misleading statements are not permitted." 41/ Disraeli decided to issue material statements in the
offering memorandums. These statements, whether or not Regulation D required such
disclosures, could not be false or misleading.
Accordingly, we find that Disraeli and Lifeplan willfully violated Securities Act Section
17(a), Exchange Act Section 10(b), and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5. 42/
B.
"Advisers Act Section 206(1) provides that it is unlawful for an investment
adviser 'to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud any client or prospective client.'" 43/
Section 206(2) "prohibits any investment adviser from 'engag[ing] in any transaction, practice,
or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or prospective
client.'" 44/ The Advisers Act "reflects a congressional recognition 'of the delicate fiduciary
nature of an investment advisory relationship' as well as a congressional intent to eliminate, or at
least to expose, all conflicts of interest which might incline an investment adviser -- consciously
or unconsciously -- to render advice which was not disinterested." 45/ An investment adviser
thus has "'an affirmative duty of 'utmost good faith, and full and fair disclosure of all material
facts,' as well as an affirmative obligation 'to employ reasonable care to avoid misleading' his
clients." 46/

Advisers Act Section 206 therefore "prohibits failures to disclose material information,
not just affirmative frauds." 47/ Scienter is required for a Section 206(1) violation but need not
be found for a violation of Section 206(2). 48/ "Facts showing a violation of [Securities Act]
Section 17(a) or [Exchange Act Section] 10(b) by an investment advisor will also support a
showing of a Section 206 violation." 49/ As discussed above, Disraeli made material
misstatements and omissions with scienter by misrepresenting the use of the proceeds of the
offering to his advisory clients and failing to disclose to them that he planned to use the proceeds
of the offering to pay personal expenses.
Although Disraeli states in his brief that he "was not a registered investment advisor
during the initial offering of Lifeplan stock," Section 206 is not limited to registered investment
advisers, 50/ and Disraeli concedes that he "has always been viewed as an investment advisor
while he has been properly registered and while he wasn't."
Disraeli, moreover, stipulated that he is an investment adviser, and the record confirms
that he acted as an investment adviser at the time of his misconduct. Advisers Act Section
202(a)(11) defines an investment adviser as "any person who, for compensation, engages in the
business of advising others, either directly or through publications or writings, as to the value of
securities or as to the advisability of investing in, purchasing, or selling securities." Disraeli's
clients executed new advisory agreements after Disraeli formed Lifeplan. Disraeli stated that his
clients "got a new agreement with a new fee schedule." The October Memorandum stated that
Lifeplan would "charge 1.5% of assets under management." Although Disraeli was not charging
his clients fees at the time he began the Lifeplan offering, he resumed charging fees during the
offering period. Disraeli, therefore, provided investment advice to his clients for compensation
during the Lifeplan offering. He solicited investments in Lifeplan securities from those
investment advisory clients. Disraeli thus acted as an investment adviser and willfully violated
Advisers Act Sections 206(1) and (2). 51/

C.
Advisers Act Section 206(4) prohibits an investment adviser from engaging in
"'any act, practice, or course of business which is fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative' and
provides that the [Commission] shall promulgate rules thereunder." 52/ Scienter is not required
for violation of a rule promulgated under Section 206(4). 53/ Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-4(a)(1)
provides that it is a fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative act, practice, or course of business to
fail to disclose to any client or prospective client all material facts with respect to the adviser's
financial condition that are reasonably likely to impair the ability of the adviser to meet
contractual commitments to clients, if the adviser has discretionary authority or custody over
such client's funds or securities, or requires prepayment of advisory fees of more than $500 from
such client, six months or more in advance. 54/
Disraeli had discretionary authority over his client's funds and stipulated that he received
more than $500 in fees more than six months in advance. He failed to disclose to his clients that
the IRS had placed a lien on all property and rights to property belonging to him, that he planned
to borrow investor funds for personal expenses, and that he would not devote all the proceeds of
the offering to the operation of the advisory business as described in the offering memoranda.
His IRS lien, his indebtedness to Lifeplan, and his diversion of Lifeplan funds to his personal use
all were material facts that impacted his financial condition and his ability to meet his contractual
commitments to his clients. Thus, Disraeli willfully violated Advisers Act Section 206(4) and
Rule 206(4)-4(a)(1).
IV.
Commission Registration as an Investment Adviser
As noted, Disraeli was registered with the Commission as an investment adviser, as a sole
proprietorship under the name Disraeli & Associates, from November 1993 until June 1997,
when he withdrew his registration voluntarily after the National Securities Market Improvement
Act of 1996 added Section 203A to the Advisers Act. That section generally prohibits an

his 'fully hedged arbitrage program.' Stein received the requisite compensation for his
services when he subsequently diverted certain of these funds for his personal use.").

investment adviser from registering with the Commission unless it has more than $25 million of
assets under management or is an adviser to a registered investment company. 55/
In July 1997, Disraeli registered David Henry Disraeli DBA Disraeli and Associates as an
investment adviser with the Texas State Securities Board (the "TSSB"). Disraeli's TSSB
registration lapsed on December 31, 2000. 56/ He continued, however, to conduct an advisory
business. He also continued to collect fees until the autumn of 2002; he did not resume
collecting fees for almost a year. Between the time his registration lapsed and the time he
stopped collecting fees, Disraeli collected between $80,000-$90,000.
Disraeli stopped collecting fees at around the time that he became the subject of a TSSB
disciplinary proceeding. On November 6, 2002, the TSSB issued an emergency cease-and-desist
order against Disraeli and converted it to a cease-and-desist order on April 2, 2003. Disraeli
consented to the April 2, 2003 order without admitting or denying wrongdoing. The TSSB's
order required that Disraeli cease and desist from offering in Texas the securities of a proposed
retirement community until the securities were registered or an exemption was available; from
offering those securities in Texas through the use of fraud or an offer containing a statement that
was materially misleading or otherwise likely to deceive the public; and from rendering services
as an investment adviser in Texas until Disraeli registered with the state.
After Disraeli consented to the TSSB cease-and-desist order, "it was imperative that [he]
find a way to get back in business" because, Disraeli asserted, he was not able to charge fees
without registration. Disraeli therefore "filed a U-4 to become a registered principal with 1st
Discount Brokers" on or about August 13, 2003. The TSSB opposed Disraeli's application to
register with it as a registered representative of 1st Discount Brokerage, Inc. 57/
On October 8, 2003, after incorporating Lifeplan in September 2003, Disraeli filed a
Form ADV registering Lifeplan with the Commission as an investment adviser. Disraeli had
about twenty clients and $3.5 to $4 million in assets under management at this time. In
Lifeplan's Form ADV, however, Disraeli claimed that Lifeplan satisfied Advisers Act Rule
203A-2(d), which allows a newly-formed investment adviser to register if it reasonably expects
to qualify for Commission registration within 120 days. Disraeli represented that Lifeplan was a

Disraeli states that he failed to renew his TSSB registration because he was "in the middle
of a family crisis" and acknowledges that this failure "was a highly irresponsible act."

57/	

Disraeli reapplied in September 2005 but the TSSB again opposed his application.
Nonetheless, Disraeli's Central Registration Depository report indicates that he was
registered with NASD as a registered representative of 1st Discount Brokerage, Inc. from
August 2003 to April 2004 and from September 2005 to June 2006.

17

"newly formed adviser" and had a "reasonable expectation" that it would "be eligible to register
with the SEC within 120 days after the date [its] registration with the SEC [became] effective."
As Disraeli had registered Lifeplan with the Commission identifying himself as Lifeplan's
advisory representative (as opposed to the adviser), Texas law required Disraeli to register with
the TSSB because Lifeplan had advisory clients in Texas. Around October 21, 2003, Disraeli
submitted his advisory representative application to the TSSB. The TSSB notified Disraeli
around November 12, 2003, that it opposed this application.
However, Texas law permits an individual that is registered with the Commission as an
adviser to operate in Texas without registering with the state as an advisory representative.
Accordingly, on November 13, 2003, Disraeli filed an amendment to the Form ADV that
changed the name of the registered investment adviser to David Henry Disraeli DBA Lifeplan
Associates and changed the organizational structure of the investment adviser from a corporation
to a sole proprietorship. Disraeli again claimed the Rule 203A-2(d) exemption for a newlyformed adviser. According to Disraeli, the "effective consequence was to allow [him] to operate
in the State of Texas without hindrance from the [TSSB]."
Disraeli acknowledged that, in order to be remain registered with the Commission and
therefore remain exempt from Texas registration requirements, he had to notify the Commission
that he either had $25 million under management or satisfied one of the exemptions for
registration by the conclusion of the 120-day period for satisfying Rule 203A-2(d), or February 5,
2004. However, Disraeli did not have $25 million under management by that date.
Accordingly, on February 13, 2004, Disraeli filed an amendment to the Form ADV
stating that David Henry Disraeli DBA Lifeplan Associates was "a multi-state adviser" within the
meaning of Advisers Act Rule 203A-2(e). Rule 203A-2(e) permits an adviser to register with the
Commission if the adviser is required by the laws of thirty or more states to register as an adviser
in those states. According to Disraeli, he satisfied this rule because he planned to "us[e] the
Internet as an advertising medium" to solicit new clients. Although Disraeli admitted that state
securities authorities told him that an adviser did not generally have to register with the state until
the adviser had six clients in the state, 58/ Disraeli asserted that it was the "most cautious
approach" "to assume . . . if you're soliciting, talking to residents of a state, you should be
registered in that state." Disraeli concluded that, because he was "actively soliciting their
residents," he "would be required to register in" at least thirty states.

58/	

Advisers Act Section 222(d) prohibits a state from requiring the registration of an
investment adviser if the adviser does not have a place of business in the state and has
had fewer than six clients who are residents of the state during the preceding twelve­
month period. 15 U.S.C. § 80b-18a; see also infra notes 67-69 and accompanying text.

18

Disraeli filed additional amendments to the Form ADV claiming the multi-state adviser
exemption on July 1, 2004, March 31, 2005, and November 9, 2005. 59/ At the time of all these
filings, Disraeli's only office and all but one client were located in Texas.
Registration Violations
Section 203A of the Advisers Act prohibits an investment adviser from registering with
the Commission unless it has more than $25 million of assets under management or otherwise
qualifies for registration. 60/ However, Rule 203A-2(d) exempts an adviser from this prohibition
if, at the time of registration, the adviser is not registered or required to be registered with the
Commission or any state but has a reasonable expectation that it would be eligible for
Commission registration within 120 days after the date its registration becomes effective. 61/
The Commission has stated that this rule "is designed to ensure that the exemption is available
only to start-up advisers." 62/ Although various circumstances could support a reasonable
expectation of Commission eligibility, the Commission anticipated that the rule "would be used
primarily by persons who start their own advisory firms after having been employed by or
affiliated with other advisers, and that have received an indication from clients with substantial
assets that they will transfer those assets to the management of the newly formed adviser." 63/

59/	

Advisers Act Rule 204-1(a) requires an adviser to amend its Form ADV at least annually
within ninety days of the end of the adviser's fiscal year. 17 C.F.R. § 275.204-1(a). The
July 1, 2004 and March 31, 2005 amendments were annual amendments; the record does
not indicate the purpose of the November 9, 2005 amendment.

19
David Henry Disraeli DBA Lifeplan Associates, Disraeli's sole proprietorship, did not
qualify as a newly-formed adviser because it was the successor to his previous sole
proprietorship, Disraeli & Associates. We take official notice of Lifeplan's website which states
that "Lifeplan Associates is the successor entity for Disraeli and Associates." 64/ Disraeli also
stated in his investigative testimony that, "for the most part," David Henry Disraeli DBA Lifeplan
Associates continued to serve as the investment adviser for the same people for whom Disraeli
had been an investment adviser in 2000 before his registration lapsed. Disraeli stated at the
hearing that he registered with the Commission as an investment adviser because, after the TSSB
imposed the cease-and-desist order on him, "it was imperative that [he] find a way to get back in
business." We reject Disraeli's contention that he "could not have continued the business of
another adviser as none existed" because he was not "receiving any management fees from
November of 2002 until November of 2003." The fact that Disraeli did not collect management
fees for one year did not render David Henry Disraeli DBA Lifeplan Associates a newly-formed
adviser. We agree with the law judge that "[t]he evidence compels the conclusion that Disraeli
created Lifeplan and registered it with the Commission so that he could continue to do business
as an investment adviser without approval from the TSSB."
Disraeli, moreover, lacked a reasonable expectation that he would qualify for
Commission registration within 120 days. He acknowledged that, absent an exemption, an
investment adviser needed $25 million under management in order to qualify for registration
with the Commission and that the maximum amount of assets under his management at any point
in his career was $11 million. In his investigative testimony, Disraeli stated that, at the time he
filed his Form ADV, he had had no discussions with potential clients that would increase his
assets under management to $25 million. Disraeli acknowledged further that he "abandoned the
hope of having 25 million probably within a month or two after the initial ADV filing."
Disraeli, however, claims that he qualified as a "multi-state" adviser. Rule 203A-2(e),
which exempts investment advisers from the prohibition on Commission registration if the
adviser is obligated to register in thirty or more states, 65/ permits a newly formed investment
adviser to register with the Commission if it reasonably expects that it would satisfy this

reasonable dispute in that it is . . . capable of accurate and ready determination by resort
to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned"); O'Toole v. Northrop

requirement within 120 days after the date its registration became effective. 66/ Advisers Act
Section 222(d) provides that a state may not require an adviser to register with its state securities
authority unless the adviser has a place of business in the state and has had, during the preceding
twelve-month period, at least six clients who are residents of that state. 67/ We have stated that,
"[i]n determining the number of states in which an adviser is required to register, the investment
advisor would be required to exclude those states in which it is not obligated to register because
of . . . section 222(d) of the Advisers Act (15 U.S.C. 80b-18a)." 68/
When Disraeli filed his Form ADV and subsequent amendments to that form, Disraeli's
sole office and all but one client were in Texas. Thus, pursuant to Advisers Act Section 222(d),
no state other than Texas could require Disraeli's registration during the relevant period. 69/
Disraeli concedes that state securities authorities advised him that he was not required to register
until he had at least six clients in the state. Disraeli therefore lacked a reasonable expectation
that he would satisfy the multi-state exemption when he filed his original Form ADV under Rule
203A-2(d), and did not satisfy the exemption when he filed the subsequent amendments to the
form claiming the exemption under Rule 203A-2(e).
Disraeli notes that Rule 203A-2(f) exempts advisers from the prohibition on Commission
registration if the adviser provides investment advice to its clients exclusively through an
interactive website. 70/ As he observes, the Commission recognized that "[b]ecause an Internet

Disraeli criticizes the law judge's decision for failing to provide "any discussion about the
rules of any single individual state" and argues that "[t]he fact that NSMIA created a
national de minimis standard is not dispositive on whether any state can find a way to
require registration by a legislative work-around." However, Advisers Act Section 222(d)
provides specifically that state investment adviser statutes are "inapplicable to advisers
that do not have a place of business in the state and have fewer than six clients who are
residents of that state." Advisers Act Rel. No. 1794 (Mar. 25, 1999), 69 SEC Docket

applications provide investment advice to clients based on personal information each
client supplies through the website." 17 C.F.R. § 275.203A-2(f)(2); see also 79 SEC
Docket at 435.

Investment Adviser uses an interactive website to provide investment advice, the adviser's clients
can come from any state, at any time, without the adviser's prior knowledge. . . . Consequently,
these advisers would be required, absent an exemption, to register in every state." 71/
Although Disraeli admits that he did not satisfy Rule 203A-2(f) because he did not
employ an interactive website, he contends that he, like Internet investment advisers, could
obtain clients from any state, at any time, because he "us[es] the Internet as an advertising
medium" to solicit clients. Disraeli argues that, as a result, he is entitled to the multi-state
adviser exemption because he would not "know if and when [he would] reach the sixth client,
which would require state registration."
This claim is not persuasive. The multi-state exemption is not available "until the adviser
obtain[s] the requisite number of clients in thirty states to trigger its registration obligations in
those states." 72/ State securities authorities informed Disraeli that he did not have to register in
a state until he obtained six clients in that state, and Disraeli was never near having six clients in
each of thirty states. Individuals responding to Disraeli's Internet solicitations could not become
his clients without his knowledge. In adopting the Internet investment adviser exemption, we
stated that it is "not available to advisers that merely use websites as marketing tools," and that
"expansion of the rule to include such activities . . . could undermine NSMIA's allocation of
regulatory responsibility over smaller advisers to state securities authorities." 73/ It would be
similarly inappropriate to expand the application of the multi-state adviser exemption based on
the solicitation of clients in several states through the Internet.
Accordingly, we find that Disraeli willfully violated Advisers Act Section 203A.
Advisers Act Section 207 prohibits "willfully making false statements of material fact, or
material omissions, in applications or reports to the Commission, such as a Form ADV." 74/

70/

(...continued)
Rule 203A-2(f) includes an exception that would permit an adviser relying on the rule to
advise clients through means other than its interactive website, so long as the adviser had
fewer than fifteen of these non-Internet clients during the preceding twelve months.

many "real clients" to satisfy this exception.

Scienter need not be found to support a Section 207 violation. 75/ As discussed, Disraeli made
material misstatements in his Forms ADV by misrepresenting that he satisfied the requirements
for Commission registration and thus also willfully violated Advisers Act Section 207. 76/
V.
Disraeli's Books and Records
Commission staff conducted an examination of Disraeli from January 10-14, 2005. The
staff called Disraeli one week before the examination and provided him with a list of documents
that Disraeli should have available for inspection. This list included those books and records that
Advisers Act Section 204 and the rules thereunder require an investment adviser to keep. 77/
Advisers Act Rules 204-2(a)(1), (2), and (6) require, respectively, that investment advisers make
and keep true, accurate, and current (1) journals, including cash receipts and disbursements,
records, and any other records of original entry forming the basis of entries in any ledger;
(2) general and auxiliary ledgers (or other comparable records) reflecting asset, liability, reserve,
capital income and expense accounts; and (3) trial balances, financial statements, and internal
audit working papers relating to the business of such investment adviser. 78/
Disraeli did not produce all the requested records during the staff's examination. He was
unable to produce the financial records required to be kept by Advisers Act Rule 204-2(a)(1) for
2004. Although he did provide financial records required to be kept by that rule for the 2003
fiscal year, the evidence indicates that those records were not true and accurate and were not kept
up to date. Testimony at the hearing confirmed that Disraeli was "missing a lot of entries that he
supposedly made with personal money," that entries "consisted of bills paid out of the corporate
account that were personal bills," and that Disraeli had an entry for goodwill but "it was
impossible to have an entry of goodwill" because Disraeli had not bought a company. Also,
Disraeli apparently only updated his books once a year. The records that Disraeli provided that
were required to be kept by Advisers Act Rule 204-2(a)(2) contained "many erroneous postings."
Disraeli provided the staff records required to be kept under Advisers Act Rule 204-2(a)(6) for
2003 but was unable to produce any financial records or trial balances for 2004.

The law judge did not "give[] any weight to the Division's claim that Disraeli violated

finding. Thus, that issue is not before us. George J. Kolar, 55 S.E.C. 1009, 1011 (2002).

Moreover, the books and records that Disraeli produced were not accurate. Disraeli did
not have adequate back-up documentation for the figures in the firm's books and records.
Disraeli intermingled his business and personal accounts, paid personal bills out of the business
account and business bills out of the personal account, and failed to make journal entries to
reflect those transactions.
Books and Records Violations
Section 204 of the Advisers Act requires that investment advisers make and keep records
and furnish copies of such records as prescribed by the Commission. 79/ The undisputed record
evidence establishes that for 2003 and 2004 Disraeli failed to make, keep, and furnish all the
records required by Advisers Act Rules 204-2(a)(1), (2), and (6), promulgated pursuant to
Section 204.
Disraeli contends on appeal that he "provided 2004 records after his exam which became
Stipulated Exhibit 28." This exhibit is an undated one-page document entitled Lifeplan "Profit
and Loss 1/1/04 to 12/31/04." Although this document might be considered part of the financial
statements required to be kept pursuant to Rule 204-2(a)(6), Disraeli did not provide it to the
staff at the time of the exam. Nor does it satisfy the requirements that Disraeli also keep journals
and ledgers. Assuming, moreover, that the profit and loss statement was complete and accurate,
financial statements generally include, among other things, a balance sheet. We therefore reject
the contention that the one-page profit and loss statement alone fulfilled the requirements of
Advisers Act Section 204 for the year 2004.
"The requirement that records be kept embodies the requirement that those records be
true and accurate." 80/ Disraeli does not dispute the record evidence demonstrating the
deficiencies in the books and records described above. Respondents' counsel admitted at the
hearing that "there were some books-and-records sloppiness," Respondents admitted in their
post-hearing brief that "some of the required information was not 'readily-accessible,'" and
Respondents admitted in their brief before the Commission that Disraeli "did not keep all the
books and records that were required." Accordingly, we find that Disraeli willfully violated
Advisers Act Section 204 and Advisers Act Rules 204-2(a)(1), 204-2(a)(2), and 204-2(a)(6). 81/

VI.
Revocation of Registration and Bar from Association
Advisers Act Section 203 provides that the Commission may revoke the registration of
registered advisers or bar association with advisers as penalties for making false material
statements. 82/ Exchange Act Section 15(b)(6)(A) provides that the Commission may bar a
person associated or seeking association with a broker or dealer from association with a broker or
dealer if the person willfully violated the federal securities laws and such sanction is in the public
interest. 83/ As noted, during the time of his misconduct, Disraeli was associated or seeking
association as a registered representative of 1st Discount Brokerage, Inc.
We consider "the egregiousness of the defendant's actions, the isolated or recurrent nature
of the infraction, the degree of scienter involved, the sincerity of the defendant's assurances
against future violations, the defendant's recognition of the wrongful nature of his conduct, and
the likelihood that the defendant's occupation will present opportunities for future
violations." 84/ "[T]he Commission's inquiry into the appropriate sanction to protect the public
interest is a flexible one, and no one factor is dispositive." 85/
We find that it is in the public interest to bar Disraeli from association with an investment
adviser, a broker, and a dealer. Disraeli acted egregiously and with a high degree of scienter. As
noted above, Disraeli prepared and distributed offering memoranda to his advisory clients stating
that the proceeds of the offering would be used for business purposes. Instead, Disraeli lent
himself the proceeds from the offering and diverted proceeds for his own personal use without
disclosing this information to his investors. Disraeli, moreover, committed repeated violations.
He made material misrepresentations and omissions regarding the use of the proceeds of the
offering in the October Memorandum and, after realizing that the October Memorandum was
inadequate, continued to make these misrepresentations and omissions in the December
Memorandum. He also filed several forms that misrepresented that he qualified for Commission

registration. Throughout this period, Disraeli failed to maintain books and records in compliance
with Commission rules. Disraeli's misappropriation of the offering proceeds obtained from his
clients, his repeated attempts to register with the Commission despite his failure to qualify, and
his failure to maintain accurate books and records suggest that he poses a threat to the investing
public if allowed to remain in the securities industry. 86/
The TSSB's cease-and-desist order further demonstrates the necessity of a severe sanction
to prevent Disraeli from committing future violations. The TSSB order was specifically directed
at the failure to properly register as an adviser and the use of fraud in the offer of securities.
Disraeli committed the antifraud and registration violations while subject to that order. Disraeli's
misconduct in the face of the cease-and-desist order demonstrates the likelihood of future
violations and the necessity of imposing a bar.
The law judge noted that "Disraeli gave no persuasive assurances against future violations
or any indication that he recognizes that he committed serious violations." Disraeli admits that
the law judge "is correct in that Disraeli showed no signs of remorse." According to Disraeli, his
"defense is that there were no fraud violations, therefore remorse would be inconsistent with this
defense." We have found, however, that Disraeli committed serious violations of the antifraud,
registration, and books and records provisions of the securities laws. Accordingly, Disraeli
demonstrates either a misunderstanding or a lack of recognition of his obligation to provide full
and fair disclosure of all material facts and his affirmative duties as an investment adviser. 87/
These specific factors provide compelling reasons for a bar. 88/ We reject Disraeli's
contention that "a bar from association with a registered entity is far too harsh and provides no
protection for future investors in Respondents' business projects." A bar provides necessary
protection for future investors. "Absent a bar, there would be no obstacle to [Disraeli's]
associating with another investment adviser or broker-dealer that would neither restrict his
conduct nor his access to funds." 89/
Disraeli also asserts that "Lifeplan shareholders have not been harmed, they will only be
harmed if the sanctions that the [law judge] ordered are affirmed." Disraeli’s clients, however,
remain free to find another investment adviser. The Commission has an obligation to protect the

investing public. 90/ Lifeplan investors, moreover, suffered harm. Marek testified that he did
not receive his $10,000 investment back, and Disraeli acknowledged that no investors received
checks from him returning their investment. Although Disraeli also asserts, without verifying
documentation, that he "paid back a portion of the loan early," no evidence suggests that he
repaid the entire loan, plus interest, as required by the terms of the undated promissory note. In
any event, Disraeli's repayment of funds after the fact would not excuse his misconduct. 91/
Conduct that violates the antifraud provisions "is especially serious and subject to the
severest of sanctions." 92/ As described above, we agree with the law judge that there is a "high
probability that, if allowed to remain in the securities industry, Disraeli will commit future
violations." Thus, we find it in the public interest to bar Disraeli from association with a broker,
dealer, and investment adviser and to revoke Disraeli's investment adviser registration. 93/

See Lowry, 55 S.E.C. at 1145. Disraeli notes that several clients "signed affidavits
swearing that they are aware of the [Division of Enforcement's] issues and refuse to
rescind their investment." Although we have considered this evidence, we believe that
the conduct established in the record demonstrates the need to protect the public by
barring Disraeli. Id. at 1145 n.26 (noting that "several former or current [investment
advisory] clients expressed their satisfaction with Lowry's investment advisory services

93/	

Respondents argue that they "can not find any Commission actions which resulted in
sanctions as harsh as the instant case outside of parallel civil or criminal actions." We
have, however, previously sanctioned violations of the antifraud provisions by revoking
the registration of the investment adviser and imposing a bar from association with any
investment adviser, broker, and dealer. See, e.g., John J. Kenny, 56 S.E.C. 448 (2003),
aff'd, 87 Fed. Appx. 608 (8th Cir. 2004). In any case, "[t]he employment of a sanction
within the authority of an administrative agency is not rendered invalid in a particular
case because it is more severe than sanctions imposed in other cases." Rooms v. SEC,
444 F.3d 1208, 1215 (10th Cir. 2006) (alteration in original) (citing Butz v. Glover
Livestock Comm'n Co., 411 U.S. 182, 187 (1973)).

27

violated or caused violations of the federal securities laws or rules thereunder." 94/ We impose
cease-and-desist orders only where there is some risk of future violations. 95/ We also consider,
in addition to the factors mentioned above, the remedial function to be served by a cease-and­
desist order in the context of other sanctions sought in the proceeding. 96/
We believe, as stated above, that there is a high probability of future violations here. "In
view of Respondents' failure to appreciate their obligation to deal honestly with public investors
and to understand important regulatory requirements, there is a risk that they will transgress in
the future." 97/ The cease-and-desist order is the only sanction sought against Lifeplan and is
therefore necessary to protect the public. As for Disraeli, although we have ordered that his
investment adviser registration be revoked and that he be barred from association with a broker,
dealer, and investment adviser, the issuance of a cease-and-desist order should serve the remedial
purpose of encouraging him to take his responsibilities more seriously in the future should he
ever be allowed to reenter the industry. 98/ Disraeli himself notes, moreover, that "[o]ne need
not be an investment adviser to misappropriate corporate funds." The antifraud provisions of
Securities Act Section 17(a), Exchange Act Section 10(b), and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 "apply
to securities transactions by 'any person.'" 99/ A cease-and-desist order is therefore necessary to
protect the public against future violations that Disraeli could commit without being an
investment adviser or associated person of a broker-dealer. Accordingly, we find it is in the
public interest to order that Disraeli and Lifeplan cease and desist from committing or causing
any violations or future violations of Securities Act Section 17(a), Exchange Act Section 10(b),
and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and that Disraeli cease and desist from committing or causing any

Disgorgement
Securities Act Section 8A, Exchange Act Section 21C, and Advisers Act Section 203(k)
authorize the Commission to require disgorgement, including reasonable interest, in a cease-and­
desist proceeding. 100/ "Disgorgement is an equitable remedy designed to deprive a wrongdoer
of his unjust enrichment and to deter others from violating the securities laws." 101/ "[T]he
amount of disgorgement should include 'all gains flowing from the illegal activities.'" 102/
"[D]isgorgement need only be a reasonable approximation of profits causally connected to the
violation." 103/ "Once the [Division] shows that the disgorgement is a reasonable
approximation, the burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate that the amount of
disgorgement is not a reasonable approximation." 104/ "The risk of uncertainty in calculating
disgorgement should fall on the wrongdoer whose illegal conduct created that uncertainty." 105/
The Division requests that we order Disraeli to disgorge $84,300, or "all ill-gotten
offering proceeds that he applied to personal expenses, plus prejudgment interest." This figure
reasonably approximates Disraeli's unjust enrichment. Disraeli acknowledges that he borrowed
$84,300 of the offering proceeds, and the record documents personal expenses paid with Lifeplan
funds. As the law judge noted, Disraeli does not "offer a specific alternative to the Division's
disgorgement amount." Disraeli claimed in July 2005, and at the hearing in August 2006, that he
had repaid approximately $20,000. In his financial statements submitted to the Commission in
connection with this appeal, he claims that he has repaid approximately $32,000. Disraeli,
however, does not provide documentation verifying these assertions, and, as noted, he carries the
burden of doing so. We thus order Disraeli to disgorge $84,300, plus prejudgment interest. 106/

such payments will offset his disgorgement obligation under the present judgment").

29

Disraeli contends that "[d]isgorgement is clearly inappropriate where the alleged victims
are opposed to receiving disgorged funds." However, "[t]he primary purpose of disgorgement is
not to refund others for losses suffered but rather 'to deprive the wrongdoer of his ill-gotten
gain.'" 107/ Disgorgement ensures "that wrongdoers will not profit from their wrongdoing." 108/
Civil Money Penalty
Exchange Act Section 21B and Advisers Act Section 203(i) authorize the Commission to
impose a first-tier civil money penalty if a respondent has willfully violated any provision of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Advisers Act, or the rules and regulations thereunder, and
such penalty is in the public interest. 109/ We may impose a second-tier penalty if the violation
"involved fraud, deceit, manipulation, or deliberate or reckless disregard of a regulatory
requirement." 110/ A third-tier penalty is authorized if the violation also "directly or indirectly
resulted in substantial losses or created a significant risk of substantial losses to other persons or
resulted in substantial pecuniary gain to the person who committed" the violation. 111/
In considering whether a penalty is in the public interest, we consider whether the act or
omission involved fraud, deceit, manipulation, or deliberate or reckless disregard of a regulatory
requirement; the harm to other persons resulting either directly or indirectly from such act or
omission; the extent to which any person was unjustly enriched, taking into account any
restitution made to persons injured by such behavior; whether such person previously has been
found by the Commission, another appropriate regulatory agency, or a self-regulatory
organization to have violated the federal securities laws, state securities laws, or the rules of a
self-regulatory organization, or has been enjoined from or convicted of committing such
violations by a court; the need to deter such persons and other persons from committing such acts
or omissions; and such other matters as justice may require. 112/

We believe that Disraeli's misconduct warrants a third-tier civil money penalty of
$85,000, approximately the amount of Disraeli's unjust enrichment. 113/ Disraeli's misconduct
involved fraud, deceit, and a deliberate or reckless disregard of numerous regulatory
requirements because he knowingly used the proceeds of the Lifeplan offering for his own
personal use after representing that he would use the proceeds for Lifeplan business expenses.
The failure to use the proceeds for the business purposes described in the offering memoranda
created a significant risk of substantial losses for investors who had invested their money in
Lifeplan. Disraeli's personal use of the proceeds of the Lifeplan offering also resulted in
substantial pecuniary gain to himself because he used the funds to pay for the release of a
personal tax lien against him and other personal expenses. Disraeli obtained approximately
$85,000 of Lifeplan's funds through his fraudulent conduct. He committed the misconduct here,
which involved violations of federal antifraud and registration provisions, after he had been
ordered by the TSSB to cease and desist from rendering services as an investment adviser
without registration and from offering securities in a manner that the TSSB found fraudulent.
We therefore impose one third-tier penalty of $85,000. 114/
Inability to Pay
On appeal to the Commission, Disraeli contends that "Respondents cannot repay the
disgorgement and penalty amounts." Disraeli submits a sworn financial statement pursuant to
Commission Rule of Practice 630(b). Rule 630(b) provides that a "respondent who asserts an
inability to pay disgorgement, interest or penalties may be required to file a sworn financial
disclosure statement and to keep the statement current." 115/ Disraeli's sworn financial
statement consists of a balance sheet listing his assets, liabilities, and net worth as of May 25,
2007, and a list of all income and expenses from October 1, 2003 through May 17, 2007. 116/

114/	 Although Disraeli does not address the civil money penalty in his brief to the
Commission, he contended in his post-hearing brief that civil money penalties "are
warranted when flagrant misconduct has occurred" and that "his conduct was neither
flagrant nor of such a degree to warrant such a severe penalty." To the contrary, as
required by the statutory criteria, Disraeli's misconduct involved a deliberate or reckless
disregard of numerous regulatory requirements and substantial pecuniary gain to himself.

116/	 Rule of Practice 410(c) provides that any person who files a petition for review of an
initial decision that asserts an inability to pay disgorgement, interest, or a penalty shall
file with the opening brief a sworn financial disclosure statement containing the
information specified in Rule 630(b). 17 C.F.R. § 201.410(c).

Disraeli's balance sheet indicates that his net worth is slightly less than the combined
disgorgement and civil penalty amount. 117/
Disraeli has waived his right to assert the defense of an inability to pay because he did not
raise the issue before the law judge below. Rule 630(b) contemplates that the respondent will
have raised the issue of an inability to pay before the law judge. 118/ We have held previously
that "an argument regarding a respondent's inability to pay may be waived if not raised before the
law judge." 119/ We have also stated that where "a respondent raises the issue of inability to pay
but fails to adduce at the earliest available opportunity material evidence of his then-current
financial position, Rule of Practice 452 would appear to govern the terms under which additional
evidence on the same issue may be considered by the Commission." 120/ Rule 452 requires that
the additional evidence "is material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce
such evidence previously." 121/ Disraeli does not suggest any reasonable grounds for his failure
to adduce financial information before the law judge. 122/
In any event, Disraeli provides no supporting documentation, such as tax returns, to
corroborate his asserted financial information, as required by 17 C.F.R. § 209.1. The valuation
of Disraeli's assets and liabilities on his balance sheet cannot be verified. The balance sheet,
moreover, contains only vague descriptions of his assets and liabilities, such as assets consisting
of "personal effects" and liabilities consisting of "law firms." Disraeli's list of income and

expenses contains similarly vague descriptions of the amounts received and expended. For
example, Disraeli describes an expense of $52,057 as "miscellaneous" and an expense of $19,928
as "payment." Disraeli also does not break down his income and expenses by year but includes
one statement for a three-and-a-half year period. The vague and unsubstantiated nature of
Disraeli's disclosures renders them neither adequate nor credible as a basis for reducing the
disgorgement or penalty amounts. 123/
Moreover, "[e]ven when a respondent demonstrates an inability to pay, we have
discretion not to waive the penalty, particularly when the misconduct is sufficiently
egregious." 124/ Disraeli's misconduct is sufficiently egregious, as discussed above with respect
to the imposition of the bar and revocation of registration, that it outweighs any financial
information submitted by Disraeli at this late date. Ordering disgorgement and a civil penalty is
necessary to deter others from misappropriating offering proceeds and from registering with the
Commission without satisfying the standards for Commission registration. 125/
