the Registration Statement of

c/o Corporation Service Company

ORDER FIXING TIME AND PLACE
OF PUBLIC HEARING AND
INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS
PURSUANT TO SECTION 8(d) OF
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933

HO-11603

I.
The Commission’s public official files disclose that:
A.
On February 4, 2011, China Century Dragon Media, Inc. (“Respondent”) filed an
amended Form S-1 registration statement with the Commission that became effective on
February 7, 2011, concurrently registering for sale up to 1,610,000 shares that Respondent
offered to the public and registering for resale up to 1,034,403 shares owned by selling
shareholders (the “Registration Statement”).
II.
The Division of Enforcement alleges, as set forth in the Statement of Matters of the
Division of Enforcement attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference, that the
Registration Statement includes an untrue statement of a material fact because the registration
statement purports to contain audited financial statements and the report of an independent
registered public accounting firm thereon when in fact the auditor has withdrawn its audit report
for the reasons described in the Statement of Matters; and that the Registration Statement omits
to state material facts, including that the company’s auditor has resigned and withdrawn its audit
1

report and the reasons for the auditor’s resignation, and that the financial statements included in
the registration statement cannot be relied upon.
III.
The Commission, having considered the aforesaid, deems it appropriate and in the public
interest that public proceedings pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Securities Act be instituted with
respect to the Registration Statement to determine whether the allegations of the Division of
Enforcement, as set forth in the Statement of Matters attached hereto and incorporated herein by
reference, are true; to afford the Respondent with an opportunity to establish any defenses to
these allegations; and to determine whether a stop order should issue suspending the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement referred to herein.
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that public proceedings be and hereby are instituted under
Section 8(d) of the Securities Act, such hearing to be commenced at 11:00 a.m. on June 24,
2011, at the Commission's offices at 100 F Street N.E., Washington, DC 20549, and to continue
thereafter at such time and place as the hearing officer may determine.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that these proceedings shall be presided over by an
Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order, who is authorized to perform all the
duties of an Administrative Law Judge as set forth in the Commission's Rules of Practice or as
otherwise provided by law.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Respondent shall file an Answer to the allegations
contained in this Order within ten (10) days after service of this Order, pursuant to Rule 220 of
the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.220. If the Respondent fails to file the
directed answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after being duly notified, the Respondent may be
deemed in default and the proceedings may be determined against the Respondent upon
consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true as provided by
Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f) and 310 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. §§
201.155(a), 201.220(f), 221(f) and 201.310. This Order shall be served forthwith upon the
Respondent personally.

2

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an initial
decision no later than 60 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2)
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice. In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or
employee of the Commission engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting
functions in this or any factually related proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in
the decision of this matter, except as witness or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice.
Since this proceeding is not “rule making” within the meaning of Section 551 of the
Administrative Procedure Act, it is not deemed subject to the provisions of Section 553 delaying
the effective date of any final Commission action.
By the Commission.

Administrative Proceeding File No. 3-14421
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Before the
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
June 13, 2011

In the Matter of
the Registration Statement of
China Century Dragon Media, Inc.
c/o Corporation Service Company
2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400
Wilmington, DE 19808,

Statement of Matters of the
Division of Enforcement to be
Considered at a Public Hearing
Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the
Securities Act of 1933

HO-11603

I.
A.
On February 4, 2011, China Century Dragon Media, Inc. (“Respondent”) filed an
amended Form S-1 registration statement with the Commission concurrently registering for sale
up to 1,610,000 shares that Respondent offered to the public and registering for resale up to
1,034,403 shares that were owned by selling stockholders (the “Registration Statement”). The
Registration Statement became effective on February 7, 2011. The Division of Enforcement
alleges that the Registration Statement includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading.
B.
The following are the matters to be considered at a hearing to commence on June
24, 2011 at 11:00 a.m. at the Commission’s offices at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549,
pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Securities Act of 1933 to determine whether a stop order should
be issued suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement.
II.
A.
On March 22, 2011, Respondent’s independent auditor resigned and withdrew its
audit reports for its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, which
were included in the Registration Statement filed by the Respondent.
B.

On March 28, 2011, Respondent filed a Form 8-K which disclosed:

5

[Respondent’s auditor] informed the Company in its resignation letter that due to
discrepancies noted on customer confirmations and the auditor’s inability to directly
verify the Company’s bank records, they believe these irregularities may be an indication
that the accounting records have been falsified, which would constitute an illegal act.
[Respondent’s auditor] stated in its letter that the Company’s management has not
provided a satisfactory explanation of the discrepancies noted on the customer
confirmations and was unwilling to provide authorization to the bank so that the auditor
could obtain official bank records directly from the bank’s record keeping
system. Furthermore, [Respondent’s auditor’s] letter notes that the discrepancies could
indicate a material error in previously issued financial statements. As a result,
[Respondent’s auditor] states that it is unable to rely on management’s representations as
they relate to previously issued financial statements and it can no longer support its
opinions related to the financial statements as of December 31, 2009, and 2008.

C.
The Registration Statement is materially misleading and deficient. The
Registration Statement includes an untrue statement of a material fact because the registration
statement purports to contain audited financial statements and the report of an independent
registered public accounting firm thereon when in fact the auditor has withdrawn its audit report
for the reasons described herein. The Registration Statement also omits to state material facts,
including that the company’s auditor has resigned and withdrawn its audit reports and the
reasons for the auditor’s resignation, and that the financial statements included in the registration
statement cannot be relied upon. In addition, a Form S-1 must include audited financial
statements. See Form S-1, Part 1–Information Required in Prospectus, Item 11(e) (requiring the
inclusion of audited financial statements meeting the requirements of Regulation S-X).
D.
Accordingly, the Division of Enforcement believes that a stop order should be
issued suspending the effectiveness of the Respondent’s Registration Statement, until the
registration statement has been amended in accordance with such stop order.

Date: June 13, 2011
