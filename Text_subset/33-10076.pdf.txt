ALEXANDRE S. CLUG,

ORDER DENYING PETITION TO REJECT
DIVISION’S CROSS-PETITION FOR
REVIEW AS UNTIMELY, GRANTING
THE DIVISION’S CROSS-PETITION, AND
SETTING A BRIEFING SCHEDULE

Alexandre S. Clug (“Clug”) petitioned for review of a law judge’s initial decision finding
that he violated certain provisions of the securities laws and imposing sanctions on him. The
Division of Enforcement subsequently filed a cross-petition seeking review of certain aspects of
the initial decision with respect to Clug and other respondents, which Clug requests we reject as
untimely. We find that the Division’s cross-petition is timely under Rule 410(b) of our Rules of
Practice.1 We also grant the cross-petition and set a briefing schedule that addresses both Clug’s
and the Division’s petitions.
I.

Background

On February 8, 2016, a law judge issued an initial decision finding that Clug, Michael W.
Crow (“Crow”), Aurum Mining, LLC, PanAm Terra, Inc., and The Corsair Group, Inc., violated
certain provisions of the securities laws in connection with investments in South America and
elsewhere, and imposing sanctions on Clug and Crow.2 The initial decision provided that “a
party may file a petition for review of this initial decision within twenty-one days after service of
the initial decision.”3 It also informed that “[a] party may also file a motion to correct a manifest

error of fact within ten days of the initial decision,”4 and explained that if a motion to correct “is
filed by a party, then a party shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date
of the [law judge’s] order resolving such motion to correct a manifest error of fact.”5
On February 18, 2016, the Division requested that the law judge correct a factual
statement in the initial decision that the Division contended understated the amount of certain
deposits to bank accounts associated with Crow. Crow opposed the Division’s motion and
requested that the law judge correct other aspects of the initial decision.
On March 1, 2016, Clug timely filed a petition for review of the initial decision seeking
review of several aspects of the law judge’s liability and sanctions findings. On March 22, 2016,
the Commission granted Clug’s petition and set a briefing schedule.6
On March 15, 2016, the law judge issued an order granting the Division’s motion to
correct manifest error and denying Crow’s motion to correct.7 On April 4, 2016, the Division
filed a Cross-Petition for Review of Initial Decision, which sought review of certain liability and
sanctions issues with respect to Crow and the other respondents. The following day, Clug filed a
“Petition for Rejecting Division’s Cross Petition” in which he requested that the Commission
dismiss the Division’s cross-petition, asserting that the Division’s cross-petition was untimely
because it was filed more than 21 days after the initial decision and more than ten days after Clug
filed his petition for review.8 The Division opposes Clug’s request.

Analysis

Although Clug titled his request as a “petition,” we entertain his request as a motion to
dismiss the Division’s cross-petition on the ground that it is untimely.9 The Division opposes
Clug’s request and argues that it timely filed its cross-petition within 21 days of the date that the
law judge granted its motion to correct manifest error.10
Clug argues that the date of the law judge’s resolution of the motions to correct is
irrelevant to the Division’s filing deadline because the motions “had nothing to do with [his]
case” in that the Division and Crow did not request corrections of the initial decision with respect
to Clug. Clug argues that, for this reason, the Division’s petition must be timely under the
following portion of Rule 410(b): “In the event a petition for review is filed, any other party to
the proceeding may file a cross-petition for review within the original time allowed for seeking
review or within ten days from the date that the petition for review was filed, whichever is
later.”11 Clug contends that because the Division filed its petition on April 4, 2016—56 days
after the initial decision and 34 days after his petition for review—it is untimely.
We reject Clug’s argument and find that the Division’s cross-petition is timely. Our
Rules of Practice do not consider the content of a motion to correct manifest error or the parties
affected by the relief sought in the motion when determining the deadline for filing a petition for
review. Rather, under Rule 410(b), “the time to file a petition for review is stayed until 21 days
after resolution of any motion to correct an initial decision filed before the hearing officer.”12
“While a motion to correct is pending, a party need not file a petition for review to preserve its
appeal rights.”13 Because the Division “filed a motion to correct an initial decision with the
hearing officer,” it had “21 days from the date of the hearing officer’s order resolving the motion

Oppositions to petitions for review are not authorized under our Rules of Practice, see

No. 48832 (Nov. 23, 2003), 68 Fed. Reg. 68186, 68191 (Dec. 5, 2003), but a motion to dismiss a
petition as untimely is distinct from an opposition based on the merits of the petition. Cf. Jacob
