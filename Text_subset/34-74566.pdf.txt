ORDER DIRECTING
DISBURSEMENT OF
FAIR FUND

On September 30, 2013, pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and
Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1103, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Plan of
Distribution and Opportunity for Comment (Exchange Act Rel. No. 70573 (Sept. 30, 2013)). The
Notice provided all interested parties thirty (30) days to submit a comment on the Proposed Plan of
Distribution (“Proposed Plan”). The Notice advised interested parties that they could obtain a copy
of the Proposed Plan from the Commission’s public website or by submitting a written request to
Nancy Chase Burton, Esq., United States Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street,
NE, Washington, DC 20549-5631. All persons who desired to comment on the Proposed Plan
could submit their comments, in writing, no later than thirty (30) days from the date of the
Notice. Two comments were submitted. On June 18, 2014, the Commission issued a Notice of
Amended Proposed Plan of Distribution and Opportunity for Comment and the Amended Plan of
Distribution (“Amended Plan”) was simultaneously posted on the Commission’s website. The

Amended Plan responded to the comments received and included two additional eligible Fair
Fund recipients (Exchange Act Rel. No. 72429 (June 18, 2014)). No additional comments were
submitted. On July 24, 2014, the Commission issued an Order Approving Amended Plan of
Distribution (Exchange Act Rel. No. 72667 (July 24, 2014)).
The Amended Plan provides for the distribution of the Fair Fund through the U.S.
Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service when the Fund Administrator submits a payment file
with payee information in a Commission-approved format. The Fund Administrator has
submitted a payment file with payee information for the disbursement of $189,042.04.
Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the Commission staff shall direct the payment of
$189,042.04 from the Fair Fund as provided for in the Amended Plan.
Additionally, it is ORDERED that the Secretary of the Commission is authorized, upon
receipt of a payment file from the Fund Administrator, to issue an order directing disbursement if
additional funds are received, for an amount not to exceed the remainder of Gina M.
Hornbogen’s payments, in a second tranche from the Fair Fund for distribution to Eligible
Clients.
By the Commission.

Brent J. Fields
Secretary
