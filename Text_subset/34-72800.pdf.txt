EXTENSION ORDER

The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has requested a second extension of time
until December 8, 2014 for entry of an order approving or disapproving the Proposed Plan of
Distribution that was noticed for public comment on May 9, 2014.
On December 18, 2013, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative
and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 9(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, Making
Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”) against
G-Trade Services LLC (“G-Trade”), ConvergEx Global Markets Limited (“CGM”), and
ConvergEx Execution Solutions LLC (“CES”) 1 (collectively, “Respondents”). The Order
required Respondents to pay a total of $107,424,429 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest,
and civil money penalties into an escrow account and created a Fair Fund pursuant to Section
308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended. In two related proceedings, the
Commission ordered that the disgorgement and prejudgment interest paid in those

proceedings, totaling $1,228,592, may be combined with the funds paid in this matter for
distribution to harmed customers. 2 Payment was made into the escrow as required by the
Order on December 17, 2013.
On May 9, 2014, pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and
Disgorgement Plans, 3 the Commission published a Notice of Proposed Plan of Distribution
and Opportunity for Comment (“Notice”) for the distribution of monies placed into the Fair
Fund. 4 The Notice provided all interested parties thirty (30) days from the date of the Notice
to submit a comment on the Proposed Plan of Distribution. The Commission received
comments on the Proposed Plan of Distribution. On June 27, 2014, the Commission issued an
order granting an extension until August 8, 2014 for entry of an order approving or
disapproving the Proposed Plan of Distribution. 5
In its request for a second extension of time, the Division states that additional time is
needed to evaluate and respond to the four comments received.
Accordingly, for good cause shown, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Division’s
request for an extension of time until December 8, 2014 for entry of an order approving or
disapproving the Proposed Plan of Distribution is granted.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Deputy Secretary
