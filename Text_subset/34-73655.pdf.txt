In the Matter of

EXTENSION ORDER

The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has requested an extension of time until
April 30, 2015 to submit a proposed Plan of Distribution under Rule 1101(a) of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 CFR 201.1101(a).
On September 13, 2013, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative
and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, Sections 203(e), 203(f) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and
Section 9(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing
Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”) against Sarkauskas and
Associates, Inc. (the “Adviser”) and James M. Sarkauskas (“Sarkauskas”) (collectively,
“Respondents”).1 The Order required Respondents to pay a total of $449,837.20 in
disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties to the Commission within one
year of the date of entry of the Order and created a Fair Fund pursuant to Section 308(a) of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended.

Exchange Act Release No. 70388 (Sep. 13, 2013).

In its request for an extension of time, the Division states that it requires additional
time because a fund administrator needs to be appointed, which includes development of a
proposal to solicit potential fund administrators, evaluation of the proposals received from the
potential fund administrators, and the selection of a fund administrator, and the fund
administrator’s bond amount set. Once a fund administrator is appointed, a proposed plan of
distribution must be developed in conjunction with the selected fund administrator.
Accordingly, for good cause shown, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Division’s
request for an extension of time until April 30, 2015 to submit a proposed Plan of Distribution
is granted.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Brent J. Fields
Secretary
