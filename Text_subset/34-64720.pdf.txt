C.

FACTS
Overview

10.
Morgan Asset, through Kelsoe, as Portfolio Manager, managed the Helios Select
Fund, Inc., the Helios High Income Fund, Inc., the Helios Multi-Sector High Income Fund, Inc.,
the Helios Strategic Income Fund, Inc., and the Helios Advantage Income Fund, Inc. (collectively,
the “Funds”) from at least November 2004 through July 29, 2008.
11.
Respondent Morgan Keegan, a registered broker-dealer and registered investment
adviser, was the principal underwriter and distributor of shares of the open-ended Funds. Each of
the Funds’ Boards of Directors was responsible for pricing the Funds’ securities in accordance with
the Funds’ valuation policies and procedures (“valuation procedures”). Although the Funds’
prospectuses stated that Morgan Asset would price the securities, each Fund’s Board of Directors
delegated the pricing responsibility to Morgan Keegan. Morgan Keegan priced each Fund’s
securities and calculated the Fund’s daily net asset value 2 (“NAV”) through its Fund Accounting
Department (“Fund Accounting”). Weller was an officer and treasurer of the Funds. Weller,
Morgan Keegan’s Controller, along with other Morgan Keegan personnel, staffed a “Valuation
Committee” that oversaw Fund Accounting’s processes and evaluated the prices assigned to
securities. Morgan Keegan and Weller failed to adequately fulfill Morgan Keegan’s
responsibilities, as delegated to it by the Funds’ Boards of Directors, to price the Funds’ securities
in accordance with their valuation policies and procedures regarding valuation. For example, at
various times from January 2007 through July 2007, Fund Accounting accepted unsubstantiated
“price adjustments,” submitted by Kelsoe, that inaccurately inflated the prices of certain securities,
contrary to the Funds’ valuation procedures. Fund Accounting failed to document justifications for
such pricing adjustments.
12.
The Funds’ valuation policies and procedures required the comparison of fair
values to prices provided by other sources. Pursuant to that requirement, Fund Accounting
periodically obtained broker-dealer price confirmations for certain fair valued securities.
Unbeknownst to Fund Accounting and the Funds’ independent auditor (“Independent Auditor”),
the Portfolio Manager, Kelsoe, actively screened and influenced a broker-dealer to change the
price confirmations that Fund Accounting and the Independent Auditor obtained from the brokerdealer. Kelsoe also failed to advise Fund Accounting or the Funds’ Boards of Directors when he
received information indicating that the Funds’ prices for certain securities should be reduced.

2

The “net asset value” or “NAV” of an investment company is the company’s total assets
minus its total liabilities. An investment company calculates the NAV of a single share (or the
“per share NAV”) by dividing its NAV by the number of shares that are outstanding.
4

13.
Each of the Funds held, in varying amounts, securities backed by subprime
mortgages, and the market for such securities deteriorated in the first half of 2007. Morgan
Keegan utilized practices which were not reasonably designed to determine that the Funds’ NAVs
were accurate. Morgan Asset, through Kelsoe, engaged in actions that forestalled declines in the
NAVs of the Funds that would have occurred as a result of the deteriorating market, absent his
intervention.
14.
Many of the securities that were held by the Funds and backed by subprime
mortgages lacked readily available market quotations and, as a result, were required by the
Investment Company Act to be priced by the Funds’ Boards of Directors, using “fair value”
methods. Under Section 2(a)(41)(B) of the Investment Company Act, the Funds were required to
use market values for portfolio securities with readily available market quotations and use fair
value for all other portfolio assets, as determined in good faith by the board of directors. The fair
value of securities for which market quotations are not readily available is the price the Funds
would reasonably expect to receive on a current sale of the securities. 3
15.
The Funds adopted valuation procedures for pricing the Funds’ portfolio securities
and assigned the task of following those procedures to Morgan Keegan. The Funds’ valuation
procedures for fair-valued securities mandated that such securities should be valued in “good faith”
by the Valuation Committee, considering a series of general and specific factors including, among
others, “fundamental analytical data relating to the investment,” “an evaluation of the forces which
influence the market in which the securities are purchased or sold” and “events affecting the
security.” The procedures required the Valuation Committee to maintain a written report
“documenting the manner in which the fair value of a security was determined and the accuracy of
the valuation made based on the next reliable public price quotation for that security.” The
procedures also required that values assigned to securities be periodically validated through,
among other means, broker-dealer price confirmations. Fund Accounting also used broker-dealer
price confirmations to set current values. The procedures specified that prices obtained from a
broker-dealer could only be overridden when there was “a reasonable basis to believe that the price
provided [did] not accurately reflect the fair value of the portfolio security.” Whenever a price was
overridden, the procedures mandated the basis for overriding the price to be “documented and
provided to the Valuation Committee for its review.”
16.
In filings with the Commission, the Funds stated that the fair value of securities
would be determined by Morgan Asset’s Valuation Committee using procedures adopted by the
Funds’ board of directors. In fact, the responsibility was delegated to Morgan Keegan, which
primarily staffed the Valuation Committee. Morgan Keegan and the Valuation Committee did not

which incorporates Accounting Series Release No. 118 (“ASR 118”). The Commission has
provided interpretative guidance related to financial reporting in the Accounting Series Releases,
which is included in the Codification of Financial Reporting Policies. Thus, conformity with the
ASR 118 is required by Commission rules and complies with Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (“GAAP”). See also Articles 1-01(a) and 6.03 of Regulation S-X.
5

reasonably satisfy their responsibilities under the Funds’ procedures in several ways. Among other
things: (i) the Valuation Committee left pricing decisions to lower level employees in Fund
Accounting who did not have the training or qualifications to make fair value pricing
determinations; (ii) Fund Accounting personnel relied on Kelsoe’s “price adjustments” to
determine the prices assigned to portfolio assets, without obtaining a reasonable basis for or
documentation supporting the price adjustments or applying the factors set forth in the procedures;
(iii) Fund Accounting personnel gave Kelsoe discretion beyond the parameters of the valuation
procedures in validating the prices of portfolio securities by allowing him to determine which
dealer price confirmations to use and which to ignore, without obtaining documentation to support
his adjustments; and (iv) the Valuation Committee and Fund Accounting did not ensure that the
fair value prices assigned to many of the portfolio securities were periodically re-evaluated,
allowing them to be carried at stale values for months at a time.
17.
Morgan Asset adopted its own procedures to determine the actual fair value to
assign to portfolio securities and to “validate” those values “periodically.” Among other things,
those procedures provided that “[q]uarterly reports listing all securities held by the Funds that
were fair valued during the quarter under review, along with explanatory notes for the fair values
assigned to the securities, shall be presented to the Board for its review.” Morgan Asset failed to
fully implement this provision of its pricing policy.
18.
At various times between January 2007 and July 2007, Kelsoe had his assistant
send “price adjustments” to Fund Accounting. The adjustments were communications by Kelsoe
to Fund Accounting concerning the values of specific portfolio securities. In many instances, these
adjustments were arbitrary and did not reflect fair value. The price adjustments were routinely
entered upon receipt by the staff accountant into a spreadsheet used to calculate the NAVs of the
Funds.
19.
Fund Accounting did not generally request, and Kelsoe did not generally supply,
supporting documentation for his price adjustments. Fund Accounting and the Funds did not
record which securities had been assigned values by Kelsoe.
20.
As part of the Funds’ valuation procedures, Fund Accounting sometimes requested
third party broker-dealer price confirmations as a means to validate the values it had assigned to
the Funds’ fair valued securities. The Funds’ Independent Auditor used similar requests for third
party broker-dealer price confirmations as part of its annual year-end audits of the Funds. Fund
Accounting or the Independent Auditor would periodically send such requests to broker-dealers
asking them to provide price confirmations for various portfolio securities.
21.
During the period from January through July 2007, when month-end dealer price
confirmations were received by Fund Accounting, an employee of Fund Accounting performed a
review to estimate whether they contained any securities prices that varied from current portfolio
values by more than five percent. If so, then Kelsoe determined whether the current values should
be maintained or a new value—which may or may not have been the price given by the brokerdealer—should be assigned to the security. Thus, Fund Accounting generally allowed Kelsoe to
6

determine whether broker-dealer price confirmations were used or ignored. In some instances,
when price confirmations were received that were substantially lower than current portfolio values,
Fund Accounting personnel, acting at the direction of Kelsoe, lowered values of bonds over a
period of days, in a series of pre-planned reductions to values at or closer to, but still above, the
price confirmations. As a result, during the interim days, Fund Accounting did not price those
bonds at their current fair value.
22.
During the period from January through July 2007, Fund Accounting failed to
record which bond values were not adjusted in response to dealer price confirmations at Kelsoe’s
direction.
23.
The head of Fund Accounting reported to Weller, and Weller was a member of the
Valuation Committee. He knew, or was reckless in not knowing, of the deficiencies in the
implementation of the valuation procedures set forth above, and failed to remedy them or
otherwise make sure fair-valued securities were accurately priced and the Funds’ NAVs were
accurately calculated. During the period from January through July 2007, Weller was aware that:
(i) the Valuation Committee did not adequately supervise Fund Accounting’s application of the
valuation factors; (ii) Kelsoe was supplying fair value price adjustments for specific securities to
Fund Accounting but the members of the Valuation Committee did not generally know which
securities Kelsoe supplied fair values for or what those fair values were, and did not generally
receive supporting documentation for those values; and (iii) the only other pricing test regularly
applied by the Valuation Committee was a “look back” test, which compared the sales price of
any security sold by a Fund to the valuation of that security used in the NAV calculation for the
five business days preceding the sale. The test only covered securities after they were sold; thus, at
any given time, the Valuation Committee never knew how many securities’ prices could ultimately
be validated by it. Weller nevertheless signed the Funds’ annual and semi-annual financial reports
on Forms N-CSR, filed with the Commission, including certifications pursuant to Sections 302 and
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
24.
During the period from January 2007 through July 2007, Morgan Keegan, acting
through Weller and Fund Accounting, failed to employ reasonable procedures to price the Funds’
portfolio securities and, as a result of that failure, did not calculate current NAVs for the Funds.
Despite these failures, Morgan Keegan published daily NAVs of the Funds which it could not
know were accurate and, as distributor of the open-end portfolios, sold and redeemed shares to
investors based on those NAVs.
25.
On various dates from January 2007 through July 2007, Morgan Asset, through
Kelsoe, screened and influenced the price confirmations obtained from at least one broker-dealer
(“the Submitting Firm”). Among other things, the Submitting Firm was induced to provide interim
price confirmations that were lower than the values at which the Funds were valuing certain bonds,
but higher than the initial confirmations that the Submitting Firm had intended to provide. The
interim price confirmations enabled the Funds to avoid marking down the value of securities to
reflect current fair value. Kelsoe was aware that use of the interim price confirmations was
inconsistent with the valuation procedures and did not reflect fair value, that the Submitting Firm
7

would be providing lower price confirmations in response to future pricing validation requests, and
that the Funds would be required to further mark down the value of the securities to reflect their
already diminished value, but that information was not disclosed to Fund Accounting, the Funds’
Boards of Directors or the Independent Auditor. In some instances, even after causing the
Submitting Firm to increase its price confirmations, Kelsoe subsequently provided price
adjustments to Fund Accounting that were higher than even the Submitting Firm’s increased price
confirmations. These adjustments were not consistent with the Funds’ procedures. In other
instances, the Submitting Firm was induced to not provide price confirmations to Fund Accounting
(or, depending on the period, to the Independent Auditor), where those price confirmations would
have been significantly lower than the Funds’ current valuations of the relevant bonds. Fund
Accounting and the Funds’ Boards were not advised that the Submitting Firm had proposed price
confirmations which were lower than the current valuations recorded by the Funds, and that the
Submitting Firm had refrained from submitting price confirmations to Fund Accounting or had
submitted price confirmations at higher prices than it had originally planned.
26.
In each of the Funds’ annual and semi-annual reports filed with the Commission on
Forms N-CSR during the relevant period (including, among others, the Annual Report for the
Morgan Keegan Select Fund, Inc. for the year-ended June 30, 2007 filed with the Commission on
October 4, 2007), Kelsoe included a signed letter to investors reporting on the Funds’ performance
“based on net asset value.” In fact, the performance reported was materially misstated. Untrue
statements of material fact concerning the Funds’ performance were made in the Funds’ annual
and semi-annual reports filed with the Commission on Forms N-CSR. Morgan Asset, through
Kelsoe, also provided a quarterly valuation packet reflecting inflated prices for certain securities to
the Funds’ Boards, failed to disclose to the Funds’ Boards information indicating that the Funds’
NAVs were inflated and that broker-dealer price confirmations were being screened and caused to
be altered, and provided Fund Accounting with unsubstantiated price adjustments. In addition, the
prospectuses incorrectly described Morgan Asset as responsible for fair valuation of the Funds’
portfolios.
D.

VIOLATIONS

27.
Investment advisers owe their clients, including investment company clients, a
fiduciary duty. Transamerica Mortgage Advisers, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U.S.11, 17 (1979); SEC v.
Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc. 375 U.S. 180, 195-97 (1963). Misstatements or omissions of
fact by an investment adviser, such as those made to the Funds’ boards, violate an adviser’s
fiduciary duty and constitute fraud when they are material. Similarly, the failure to disclose to the
Funds’ boards that Morgan Asset and Morgan Keegan were not complying with stated valuation
procedures constitutes fraud. In addition, the knowing or reckless failure to value securities, for
which market quotations are not readily available, consistent with fair value requirements under the
Investment Company Act and that materially affects a fund’s NAV constitutes fraud. See, In re
Piper Capital Management, Inc., Exch. Act. Rel.48409 (August 26, 2003). Section 206(1) of the
Advisers Act makes it unlawful for an investment adviser to employ any device, scheme or artifice
to defraud any client or prospective client. Section 206(2) makes it unlawful for an investment
adviser to engage in any transaction, practice or course of business that operates as a fraud or
deceit upon any client or prospective client. As a result of the conduct described above,
8

Respondent Morgan Asset willfully violated, and Kelsoe willfully aided and abetted and caused
violations of, Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act.
28.
Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act prohibits fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative
practices or courses of business by an investment adviser. Rule 206(4)-7 requires investment
advisers to “[a]dopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent
violation” of the Advisers Act and the rules thereunder by their supervised persons. An adviser’s
failure “to have adequate compliance policies and procedures in place will constitute a violation of
our rules independent of any other securities law violation.” Compliance Programs of Investment
Companies and Investment Advisers, Advisers Act Release No. 2204, 68 F.R. 74714, 74715 (Dec.
24, 2003) (“Compliance Programs Release”). As a result of the conduct described above,
Respondent Morgan Asset willfully violated, and Respondent Kelsoe willfully aided and abetted
and caused violations of, Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder.
29.
Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act prohibits untrue statements of
material fact or omissions to state facts necessary in order to make the statements made, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in any registration
statement, report or other document filed pursuant to the Investment Company Act or the
keeping of which is required pursuant to Section 31(a) of the Investment Company Act. Any
person who makes a material misrepresentation concerning a Fund’s performance in the Fund’s
annual and semi-annual reports filed with the Commission, or in the records required to be
maintained by the Fund, or submits inflated prices to be included in the Fund’s NAV calculations
and the records forming the basis for the Fund’s financial statements, violates Section 34(b). As
a result of the conduct described above, Respondents Morgan Asset and Kelsoe willfully
violated, and Respondent Morgan Keegan willfully aided, abetted, and caused violations of,
Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act.
30.
Rule 22c-1 under the Investment Company Act prohibits the sale or redemption of
shares in a registered investment company “except at a price based on the current net asset value of
such security which is next computed after receipt of a tender of such security for redemption or of
an order to purchase or sell such security.” For an NAV to be deemed current, Section 2(a)(41) of
the Investment Company Act and Rule 2a-4 thereunder require portfolio securities for which
market quotations are not readily available to be valued at fair value. As a result of the conduct
described above, Respondent Morgan Keegan willfully violated, 4 and Respondents Morgan Asset,
Kelsoe and Weller willfully aided and abetted and caused violations of, Rule 22c-1 promulgated
under the Investment Company Act.
31.
Rule 38a-1 under the Investment Company Act requires that a registered
investment company adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
prevent violation of the federal securities laws by the fund and to provide for oversight of
compliance by the fund’s investment adviser. Failure of a fund to have adequate compliance
4

A willful violation of the securities laws means merely “‘that the person charged with the duty
knows what he is doing.’” Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting
Hughes v. SEC, 174 F.2d 969, 977 (D.C. Cir. 1949)).
9

policies and procedures in place and/or to implement them will constitute a violation of Rule 38a-1
independent of any other securities law violations. Compliance Programs Release. Morgan
Keegan and Morgan Asset knowingly and substantially assisted the Funds’ failure to implement
fair valuation procedures, which resulted in prices that did not reflect current NAVs. Morgan
Keegan, Morgan Asset, Kelsoe and Weller thereby willfully aided and abetted and caused the
Funds’ violations of Rule 38a-1.

32.

Respondent Morgan Keegan undertakes as follows:

A.
Morgan Keegan shall not, for a period of three years from the date of the Order, be
involved in, or responsible for, recommending to, or determining on behalf of, a registered
investment company’s board of directors or trustees or such company’s valuation committee, the
value of any portfolio security for which market quotations are not readily available.
B.
If, after three years but within six years from the date of the Order, Morgan Keegan
becomes involved in, or responsible for, determining or recommending determinations to a
registered investment company’s board of directors or trustees or valuation committee of the value
of any portfolio security for which market quotations are not readily available and which are held
by or on behalf of such registered investment company, Morgan Keegan shall promptly notify
Commission counsel identified below or his successor and within 30 days of beginning such
valuation activity, shall hire, at its expense, an Independent Consultant (“Consultant”) not
unacceptable to the Commission’s staff, to review the valuations provided by Morgan Keegan to
any registered investment company for the next two quarters following the beginning of such
valuation activity, and make an Initial Report with recommendations thereafter on Morgan
Keegan’s policies, procedures and practices with regard to such valuations. The Initial Report
shall describe the review performed and the conclusions reached, and will include any
recommendations deemed necessary to make the policies, procedures, and practices adequate and
consistent with GAAP and the Investment Company Act. Morgan Keegan shall cooperate fully
with the Consultant and shall provide the Consultant with access to its files, books, records, and
personnel as reasonably requested for the review. Morgan Keegan shall cause the review to begin
no later than 60 days after beginning such valuation activity.
C.
At the end of that review, and in no event more than 200 days from after
beginning such valuation activity, to require the Consultant to submit the report and
recommendations to Morgan Keegan and to William P. Hicks of the Commission’s Atlanta
Regional Office or his successor.
D.
Within 30 days of receipt of the Initial Report, Morgan Keegan shall in
writing respond to the Initial Report. In such response, Morgan Keegan shall advise the Consultant
and the Commission’s staff of the recommendations from the Initial Report that it has determined
to accept and the recommendations that it considers to be unduly burdensome. With respect to any

10

recommendation that Morgan Keegan deems unduly burdensome, Morgan Keegan may propose an
alternative policy, procedure or system designed to achieve the same objective or purpose.
E.
Morgan Keegan shall attempt in good faith to reach agreement with the
Consultant within 60 days of the date of the receipt of the Initial Report with respect to any
recommendation that Morgan Keegan deems unduly burdensome. If the Consultant and Morgan
Keegan are unable to agree on an alternative proposal, Morgan Keegan shall abide by the
recommendation of the Consultant.
F.
Within 90 days of the date of the receipt of the Initial Report, Morgan Keegan
shall, in writing, advise the Consultant and the Commission's staff of the recommendations and
proposals that it is adopting.
G.
No later than one year after the date of the Consultant’s Initial Report, Morgan
Keegan shall cause the Consultant to conduct a follow-up review of Morgan Keegan’s efforts to
implement the recommendations contained in the Initial Report, and Morgan Keegan shall cause
the Consultant to submit a Final Report to the Commission’s staff. The Final Report shall set forth
the details of Morgan Keegan’s efforts to implement the recommendations contained in the Initial
Report, and shall state whether Morgan Keegan has fully complied with the recommendations in
the Initial Report.
H.
Morgan Keegan shall cause the Consultant to complete the aforementioned
review and submit a written Final Report to Morgan Keegan and to the Commission’s staff
within 400 days of the date of the Initial Report. The Final Report shall recite the efforts the
Consultant undertook to review Morgan Keegan’s policies, procedures, and practices; set forth
the Consultant’s conclusions and recommendations; and describe how Morgan Keegan is
implementing those recommendations.
I.
Morgan Keegan shall take all necessary and appropriate steps to adopt and
implement all recommendations contained in the Consultant’s Final Report.
J.
To ensure the independence of the Consultant, Morgan Keegan: (a) shall not have
the authority to terminate the Consultant without the prior written approval of the Commission’s
staff; (b) shall compensate the Consultant, and persons engaged to assist the Consultant, for
services rendered pursuant to this Order at their reasonable and customary rates; (c) shall not be in
and shall not have an attorney-client relationship with the Consultant and shall not seek to invoke
the attorney-client or any other privilege or doctrine to prevent the Consultant from transmitting
any information, reports, or documents to the Commission staff; and (d) during the period of
engagement and for a period of two years after the engagement, shall not enter into any
employment, customer, consultant, attorney-client, auditing, or other professional relationship with
the Consultant.
K.
Morgan Keegan shall cause the Consultant to enter into an agreement that provides
that for the period of engagement and for a period of two years from completion of the
engagement, the Consultant shall not enter into any employment, consultant, attorney-client,
11

auditing or other professional relationship with Morgan Keegan, or any of its present or former

17

1.
a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or review,

application must satisfy the Commission that Respondent Weller’s work in his practice before the

(b)
Respondent Weller, or the registered public accounting firm with

(c)
Respondent Weller has resolved all disciplinary issues with the

standards.
The Commission will consider an application by Respondent Weller to resume appearing
or practicing before the Commission provided that his state CPA license is current and he has
resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of accountancy. However, if
state licensure is dependent on reinstatement by the Commission, the Commission will consider an

integrity, professional conduct, or qualifications to appear or practice before the Commission.

M.
Respondent Weller shall pay a civil penalty of $50,000 to the Securities and
Exchange Commission, within ten (10) days of this Order.
N. All payments pursuant to paragraphs IV. K, L and M, above, shall be made by
certified check, bank cashier's check, or United States postal money order payable to the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The payment shall be delivered or mailed to the Office of
Financial Management, Accounts Receivable, Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F
Street, NE, Stop 6042, Washington DC 20549, and shall be accompanied by a letter identifying
Respondent as a respondent in these proceedings; setting forth the file number of these
proceedings; and specifying that payment is made pursuant to this Order, a copy of which cover
letter and money order or check shall be sent to William P. Hicks, Associate Regional
Administrator, Securities and Exchange Commission, 3475 Lenox Rd., N.E., Suite 500, Atlanta,
GA 30326-1232. If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to 31
U.S.C. § 3717 and/or SEC Rule of Practice 600.
Pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, a Fair Fund is
created for the disgorgement, interest, and penalties described in Paragraphs IV. K, L and M and
any funds paid in connection with related actions pursuant to Paragraph III. 36, above. Regardless
of whether any such distribution is made from such Fair Fund, amounts ordered to be paid as civil
money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be treated as penalties paid to the government for all
purposes, including all tax purposes. To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty,
Respondents agree that in any Related Investor Action, they shall not argue that they are entitled
to, nor shall they benefit by, offset or reduction of any award of compensatory damages by the
amount of any part of Respondent’s payment of a civil penalty in this action ("Penalty Offset"). If
the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a Penalty Offset, Respondents agree that any
Respondent receiving such offset shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting the
Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount of the Penalty
Offset to the United States Treasury or to a Fair Fund, as the Commission directs. Such a payment
shall not be deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of
the civil penalty imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a "Related Investor
Action" means a private damages action brought against any of the Respondents by or on behalf of
one or more investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the
Commission in this proceeding.
O.
The disgorgement, interest, civil penalties, and any other funds which may be
paid to the Fair Fund through or as the result of related actions, shall be aggregated in the Fair
Fund, which shall be maintained in an interest-bearing account, and shall be distributed pursuant
to a distribution plan (the "Plan") to be administered in accordance with the Commission Rules
on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans. A Fund Administrator (the “Administrator”) shall be
appointed by the Commission. The Administrator shall identify the investors in the Funds who
suffered losses as a result of the violations determined herein, evaluate investor claims and
propose and effectuate a plan to distribute the Fair Fund resulting from this order. The Fair Fund
shall be used to compensate injured customers for their loss. Under no circumstances shall any
part of the Fair Fund be returned to Morgan Keegan, Morgan Asset, Kelsoe or Weller.
19

Respondent Morgan Keegan shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses of such distribution
within thirty (30) days after receipt of an invoice for such services.
P.

Morgan Keegan shall comply with the undertakings specified in Paragraph 32

Q.

Morgan Asset shall comply with the undertakings specified in Paragraph 34 above.

above.
