Respondent.

On December 10, 2009, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
(“Commission”) published a proposed plan of distribution (“Distribution Plan”) and issued a
Notice of Proposed Plan of Distribution and Opportunity for Comment (Exchange Act Rel. No.
61142) pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Funds and Disgorgement
Plans, 17 C.F.R. §201.1103. The Notice advised parties that they could obtain a copy of the
Distribution Plan at www.sec.gov. The Notice also advised that all persons desiring to comment
on the Distribution Plan could submit their comments, in writing, no later than 30 days from the
date of the Notice. No comments were received by the Commission in response to the Notice.
On February 23, 2010, the Commission issued an Order Approving Plan, Appointing a Fund
Administrator, and Waiving Bond (Exchange Act Rel. No. 61568).
The Distribution Plan provides that a Fair Fund consisting of $125,000,000 in
disgorgement and civil penalties, plus any accrued interest, be transferred to US Bank to be
distributed by the Fund Administrator to Recipient Funds according to the methodology set forth
in the Plan. The Plan provides that the Commission will arrange for distribution of the Fair Fund
when a validated Payee List from the Independent Distribution Consultant certifying the payees
and the payment amounts has been received and accepted. The validated Payee List for the
second distribution in the amount of $45,850,882.68 has been received and accepted.

Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the Commission staff shall transfer $45,850,882.68 of
the Fair Fund to US Bank and the Fund Administrator shall distribute such money to Recipient
Funds, as provided for in the Distribution Plan.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.
