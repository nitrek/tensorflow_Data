OPINION OF THE COMMISSION
BROKER-DEALER PROCEEDING
CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDING
Grounds for Remedial Action
Antifraud violations
Former registered representative of broker-dealer made material misrepresentations about
variable annuity sales to obtain broker-dealer’s approval of those sales in violation of
antifraud provisions of the securities laws. Representative also caused and aided and
abetted broker-dealer’s books-and-records violations. Held, it is in the public interest to
bar representative from the securities industry, impose a cease-and-desist order, and order
him to pay disgorgement, with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.
APPEARANCES
Moshe Marc Cohen, pro se.
Dean M. Conway and Britt Biles for the Division of Enforcement.
Appeal filed: March 2, 2015
Last brief received: October 9, 2015

2
Moshe Marc Cohen, formerly a registered representative of Woodbury Financial
Services, Inc. (“Woodbury”), a registered broker-dealer, appeals from an initial decision finding
that he violated antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and caused and aided and
abetted Woodbury’s violation of recordkeeping provisions.1 The Division of Enforcement
appeals the law judge’s decision not to bar Cohen from the securities industry or impose civil
penalties on the ground that the statute of limitations in 28 U.S.C. § 2462 prohibited those
remedies.
Cohen does not dispute most of the pertinent facts. Rather, he argues that the antifraud
provisions at issue do not apply to his conduct. He also claims that the law judge was biased
against him, that he was denied due process, and that Section 2462 barred the proceeding.
Following a de novo review, we find that the antifraud provisions apply to Cohen’s
conduct and that he violated those provisions by knowingly making false and misleading
representations to Woodbury to obtain its approval for sales of variable annuity products. We
find further that, by submitting false documentation to Woodbury in connection with these
transactions, Cohen caused and aided and abetted Woodbury’s violation of recordkeeping
requirements. We also find that Cohen’s claims of bias and due process violations are
unsupported and that Section 2462 is inapplicable because Cohen entered into voluntary tolling
agreements and, in any event, does not limit our authority to take remedial action.

A.

Facts

Michael Horowitz, a Morgan Stanley registered representative, devised a
strategy to allow investors to profit from variable annuities in the short term.

Variable annuities are securities issued and sold by insurance companies. They allow
purchasers to allocate investment funds among sub-accounts that track the performance of
different investments, such as the S&P 500 and other indices. Although variable annuities are
typically intended as long-term investments, Michael Horowitz, a Morgan Stanley registered
representative, devised a strategy to allow investors to profit in the short term.2
Many variable annuities have a “bonus” feature that provides the purchaser with a credit
of generally between four and seven percent of the initial investment. Thus, a purchaser of a
$100,000 variable annuity with a 5% bonus feature would have $105,000 to allocate to
subaccounts. Normally, funds may be withdrawn during an annuity’s “surrender period”—
typically the seven to ten years following purchase—only by paying a fee called a “surrender
charge,” but surrender charges are typically waived when the annuitant dies.

Horowitz entered into a settlement with the Commission in which he agreed to be barred
from the securities industry and pay disgorgement with prejudgment interest and civil penalties.

3
The objective of Horowitz’s strategy was to allow investors to quickly recoup the amount
originally invested plus the additional amount generated by the bonus feature without being
subject to a surrender charge. The strategy depended on the annuitants being close to death. To
execute this strategy, nominees of the investors purchased variable annuities with a bonus feature
and designated a terminally ill stranger as the annuitant.3
In the fall of 2007, Horowitz began working with two hedge funds, Platinum Partners
Credit Opportunities LLC and Centurion (collectively, the “Funds”), as well as a corporation the
Funds established, BDL Group LLC (“BDL”), to handle their variable annuity investments.
BDL, which was managed by Howard Feder, purchased the annuities through eight individual
nominees because many insurance companies refused to sell to corporate entities. The nominees
were friends or relatives of the Funds’ principals and received flat fees of $20,000 each for their
involvement. Like Horowitz, Cohen, and the investors, none of the nominees knew the
annuitants. They testified that they had only a limited understanding of their role in the strategy
and, for the most part, their involvement was only to sign forms.
Pursuant to agreements nominees signed, BDL provided them with the funds to purchase
the annuities, had full control of the funds and the resulting investments, and was “entitled to all
earnings, proceeds, or other profits earned” from them. BDL directed the nominees to establish
trusts with which to purchase and hold the annuities. When an annuitant died, the nominees
returned the proceeds to BDL, which transferred them to the hedge funds.
B.

Cohen agreed to sell variable annuities using Horowitz’s strategy.

In late 2007, Morgan Stanley prohibited Horowitz from engaging in further variable
annuity sales. Cohen, who was introduced to Horowitz by a mutual acquaintance, knew about
this prohibition. Nonetheless, Cohen agreed with Horowitz in January 2008 to effect variable
annuity transactions on behalf of the Funds following Horowitz’s strategy.
Although the parties dispute the extent of Cohen’s involvement in devising the strategy,
he admittedly understood it and took various steps to implement it. Cohen knew that that the
annuitants “were not in good health,” that using “hospice patients” as the annuitants offered a
“much higher probability of an accelerated payout to the investor,” and that the strategy “was
using annuities for the short-term death benefit.” Indeed, Cohen acknowledged in his prehearing brief that the strategy gave the Funds “short-term gains with little risk” in light of the
“sign-on bonus” and the “waiving of [the] surrender charge” in the event of the annuitant’s
death.
3

The record does not contain information about how the annuitants were identified. Nor is
there evidence that Cohen had any involvement in this process. The annuities at issue generally
did not require that the annuitant be related to the purchaser of the annuity, and the annuitants
were not related to Horowitz, Cohen, or the investors. The annuitants’ families were in many
instances unaware that an annuity had been taken out on their relative’s life. Neither the
annuitants nor their families received proceeds from the annuities

4
Cohen also admitted that he “reviewed each of the Insurance Company’s” materials and
researched different variable annuity products “to better understand all the features” and thus
“assure himself that this strategy” would work. As part of these efforts, Cohen created a
spreadsheet of the products’ characteristics, including the surrender period, the bonus percentage,
whether the annuities were owner-driven or annuitant-driven, and whether the sales commissions
to be paid to him would be clawed back by the insurer if the annuitant died too soon after the
annuity’s issuance.4 One of the columns was titled “$1 million investment and Death in 60
Days” and detailed the potential returns under various market conditions if the annuitant died 60
days after the sale of the annuity. Another column, titled “max amount,” represented the
“maximum amount that could be invested without triggering additional due diligence”—for
example, a medical examination of the annuitant—by the insurer. Based on his research, Cohen
encouraged the Funds to use trusts (instead of the nominees) as the “legal owners” so that the
annuities would “automatically be designated as Annuitant-Driven and would pay at the demise”
of the annuitants.
C.

Woodbury had to approve Cohen’s sales of variable annuities.

As a registered representative associated with Woodbury, Cohen could not sell variable
annuities without Woodbury’s approval. His variable annuity sales were subject to Woodbury’s
supervisory review procedures. And insurance companies would not execute the requisite
annuity contracts unless a broker-dealer had indicated that the sale had passed its review.
Woodbury’s procedures manual required registered representatives to provide “complete,
pertinent, and accurate information” about prospective customers to Woodbury so that it could
“effectively perform . . . suitability functions.” For every sale of an annuity, Woodbury’s
procedures required that Cohen provide: a new account form, a “point-of-sale” form, and the
insurance company’s annuity application. These application materials became part of
Woodbury’s books and records after Cohen submitted them. The point-of-sale forms required
Cohen to specify the type of transaction and investment product, the age and investment
experience of the customer, and the customer’s risk tolerance, investment objectives, and time
horizon. Woodbury relied on the responses contained in these forms (as well as in other
communications with the registered representative) in conducting its review of the transactions.
Timothy Stone, a compliance specialist at Woodbury, testified that Woodbury could not
“make an accurate assessment of the suitability of the sale” if it did not “know the true or correct
facts” or if it did not “know all of the facts.” Stone added that Woodbury would not have
approved a variable annuity sale to a customer who intended to use it as a short-term investment
4

Cohen disputes the authorship and authenticity of the exhibit introduced at the hearing,
which was a spreadsheet attached to an email that Horowitz sent to Feder on January 12, 2008.
But during his investigative testimony, Cohen reviewed the same spreadsheet and admitted that
he personally prepared a “pretty similar” one. Cohen could not confirm that any “specific cell”
was the same, but he agreed that the “format,” the “various columns,” and the annuity products
and “companies that are identified” all were familiar to and created by him.

5
strategy (even if the customer was fully aware of the risks of such a strategy). Nor would
Woodbury have approved a sale if the point-of-sale form stated that Cohen did not know the
customer or that the Funds were the ultimate investor.
D.

Cohen sold variable annuities in January and February 2008 by providing
false and misleading information to Woodbury.

During early 2008, Cohen sold 28 variable annuities to BDL nominees, generating total
sales of approximately $40 million and commissions to Cohen of $776,958. Each of the
annuities had a surrender period of at least seven years and a bonus feature. And, in every case,
a terminally ill hospice or nursing home patient was designated as the annuitant.
Cohen dealt exclusively with BDL in effecting these transactions and had no contact with
any of the nominees or annuitants. Feder provided Cohen with blank point-of-sale forms that
had been signed by the nominees; basic biographical information about the nominees, including
their dates of birth, addresses, and net worth; and scanned copies of the nominees’ driver’s
licenses and trust agreements. Cohen completed the point-of-sale forms by providing nearly
identical—and false and misleading—responses to questions about the purchasers’ anticipated
time-frame for accessing annuity funds, investment objectives, and source-of-funds.
For example, Cohen represented in one point-of-sale form that the purchaser anticipated
“begin[ning] to access” the annuity in “11-15 years”; that the annuity was being purchased for
the “[t]ax deferred treatment of earnings”; and that he was “familiar with” the purchaser. Cohen
did not respond to the form’s question about whether the purchaser anticipated accessing the
annuity during the 8-year surrender charge period. He made substantively identical
representations regarding the other 27 annuities.5 In approving each annuity sale, Woodbury
relied on Cohen’s misrepresentations in the corresponding point-of-sale form. Woodbury
approved all 28 sales and forwarded the relevant paperwork to the insurance companies.
E.

Woodbury discovered Cohen’s misconduct after an insurance company
requested that it investigate Cohen’s variable annuity sales.

In January 2008, Cohen contacted Penn Mutual Insurance Company about its
underwriting process for variable annuities, including what might raise “red flags” when a
variable annuity application was reviewed. Penn Mutual found Cohen’s inquiries unusual and
disturbing. Although Penn Mutual took no further action at that time, it subsequently declined to
approve two variable annuity applications (each for $4.9 million) that Cohen submitted based on
what it considered suspicious circumstances. These circumstances included that the owner’s and
annuitant’s signatures were missing; that the purported owners were recently created Florida
trusts and the annuitants lived in Illinois but the money was wired from New York banks; and
that the applications claimed that gifts and inheritances were being used to purchase the annuities
yet there was no apparent relationship between the owners and the annuitants. Following its
5

6
decision to deny the applications, Penn Mutual relayed its concerns to Woodbury and requested
that it conduct an investigation of Cohen’s annuity sales.
Woodbury reviewed the annuity applications that Cohen had submitted over the
preceding month. It discovered that the annuitants were terminally ill and appeared to be
unrelated to the nominee purchasers. As a result, Woodbury suspended processing the additional
annuity applications that Cohen had submitted and placed Cohen’s commissions on hold.
On February 13, Steven Lee Smallidge, Woodbury’s national sales director for
independent marketing organizations, questioned Cohen about the sales. Cohen told him that the
annuities were purchased for “estate planning,” “tax deferral,” and “wealth preservation.” He
also said that the purchasers had been referred to him by their “advisors (a CPA and an
attorney)” but refused to disclose the advisors’ names or provide the relevant trust documents
because they purportedly involved “private family matters.” Smallidge nevertheless insisted that
Cohen identify the advisors and provide the trust documents by the end of the week. Cohen
refused to do so, and Woodbury terminated him later that month.

Analysis

Cohen committed antifraud violations by making material misstatements in
the point-of-sale forms that he submitted to Woodbury.

Securities Act Section 17(a)(1) prohibits, in the offer or sale of any security,
“employ[ing] any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud.” Section 17(a)(2) prohibits, in the offer
or sale of any security, “obtain[ing] money or property by means of any untrue statement of a
material fact or any [material] omission.”6 Scienter is required to violate Section 17(a)(1); a
showing of negligence suffices for a violation of Section 17(a)(2).7
Exchange Act Section 10(b) makes it unlawful “to use or employ, in connection with the
purchase or sale of any security . . . any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in
contravention of” Commission rules.8 Rule 10b-5 implements Section 10(b).9 Subsection (a)
prohibits “employ[ing] any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud.”10 Subsection (b) prohibits
“mak[ing] any untrue statement of a material fact or [omitting] to state a material fact necessary
in order to make the statements made . . . not misleading.”11 And subsection (c) prohibits

“engag[ing] in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud
or deceit upon any person.”12 A violation of all three subsections requires scienter.13
Cohen contends that he cannot be held liable under Securities Act Section 17(a)(1) and
Exchange Act Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) because those provisions contain a “separate and distinct”
requirement that the respondent “engage in a scheme” to defraud involving conduct
“independent of the actual words spoken.”14 According to Cohen, claims based upon only
misstatements are not actionable under Section 17(a)(1) or Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) and instead
must be brought under Rule 10b-5(b) and Section 17(a)(2).15 Cohen is mistaken.16

Cohen cites Lentell v. Merrill Lynch & Co., 396 F.3d 161, 177 (2d Cir. 2005), for the
proposition that “[w]here the sole basis for such claims is alleged misrepresentations or
omissions, plaintiffs have not made out a . . . claim under Rule 10b-5(a) and (c).” But Lentell
held only that “plaintiffs have not made out a market manipulation claim under Rule 10b-5(a)
and (c)” where “the sole basis for such claims is alleged misrepresentations or omissions.” Id. at
177. Lentell did not hold that misstatements may never form the basis for liability under Rule
10b-5 (a) and (c). We recognize that two circuits have held that liability under Rule 10b-5(a) and
(c) requires conduct beyond a misstatement. Pub. Pension Fund Grp. v. KV Pharm. Co., 679
F.3d 972, 987 (8th Cir. 2012); WPP Luxembourg Gamma Three Sarl v. Spot Runner, Inc., 655
F.3d 1039, 1057-58 (9th Cir. 2011). We have explained previously that we disagree with those
courts in light of the language of the rule. See Dennis J. Malouf, Exchange Act Release No.
10115, 2016 WL 4035575, at *8-10 (July 27, 2016). We adhere to that view here.
15

Cohen invokes the principle that effect should be given “to every word of a statute
wherever possible.” But there is no surplusage in Section 17(a). Section 17(a)(1) reaches
scienter-based fraud (including material misstatements) and Section 17(a)(2) reaches negligent
misstatements that result in the receipt of money or property. In any case, the Supreme Court
has held with respect to Section 17(a) that Congress included “both a general proscription against
fraudulent and deceptive practices [Section 17(a)(1)] and, out of an abundance of caution, a
specific proscription against nondisclosure [Section 17(a)(2)].” SEC v. Capital Gains Research
Bureau, Inc., 375 U.S. 180, 197-98 (1963). Because “the drafters of Rule 10b-5 modeled the
rule on Section 17(a),” SEC v. Tambone, 597 F.3d 436, 444 (1st Cir. 2010) (en banc), the same
rationale applies to the construction of Rule 10b-5.
16

Cohen does not dispute that variable annuities are “securities” within the meaning of the
securities laws, see, e.g., SEC v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co. of Am., 359 U.S. 65, 67-73
(1959); Lander v. Hartford Life & Annuity Ins. Co., 251 F.3d 101, 109 (2d Cir. 2001), or that his
emails and telephone calls with Feder and Woodbury personnel establish the requisite nexus to
interstate commerce, see, e.g., United States v. Lewis, 554 F.3d 208, 214-16 (1st Cir. 2009);
Loveridge v. Dreagoux, 678 F2d 870, 874 (10th Cir. 1982).

8
Rule 10b-5(a) proscribes deceptive “device[s],” “scheme[s], and “artifice[s] to defraud.”
Rule 10b-5(c) proscribes, among other things, deceptive “act[s].” It would be arbitrary—and
inconsistent with their plain meaning—to read those terms as excluding making a misstatement.
And the Supreme Court has recently indicated that it would reject such a narrow reading of Rule
10b-5(a) and (c).17
Similarly, Section 17(a)(1) prohibits making a material misstatement with scienter
because such conduct constitutes “employ[ing] a device, scheme, or artifice to defraud.” The
reach of Section 17(a)(1) is not limited because Section 17(a)(2) prohibits certain negligent
misstatements. A misstatement of material fact is undoubtedly a “device” or “artifice” to
defraud.
Accordingly, a respondent violates these provisions (and Rule 10b-5(b)) when, with
scienter, he makes material misstatements in the offer or sale (Section 17(a)) or in connection
with the purchase or sale (Section 10(b)) of securities.18 A violation of Section 17(a)(2) does not
require scienter but does require that the respondent “obtain money or property by means of” the
misstatements. We find that Cohen violated each of these provisions.
1.

Cohen made material misstatements on the point-of-sale forms.

We find that Cohen’s responses to the questions on the point-of-sale forms were false and
misleading. Cohen represented that the purchaser anticipated “begin[ning] to access” the annuity
in “11-15 years,” that the annuities were purchased for the “[t]ax deferred treatment of earnings,”
and that he was “familiar” with the nominee purchasers. These representations were false. The
annuities were, in fact, intended to be short-term investments that would be accessed and
liquidated as soon as the terminally ill annuitants died—presumably before the “11-15 years”
that Cohen indicated. As Feder testified, the strategy was to “roll the money over quickly” and
depended on the annuitants being “short-lived” and “dying.”19 Similarly, the annuities were

Chadbourne & Parke LLP v. Troice, 134 S. Ct. 1058, 1063 (2014) (stating that Rule 10b5 “forbids the use of any ‘device, scheme, or artifice to defraud’ (including the making of ‘any
untrue statement of a material fact’ or any similar ‘omi[ssion]’) ‘in connection with the purchase
or sale of any security’” (alterations in original; emphasis added)).
18

See Malouf, 2016 WL 4035575, at *6-12; Mohammed Riad, Exchange Act Release No.
78049A, 2016 WL 3627183, at *17 (July 7, 2016) (“All the provisions prohibit at least the
making of fraudulent misstatements of material fact.”). There is no dispute that Cohen was the
“maker” of the misstatements; he filled out the point-of-sale forms and therefore had ultimate
authority over them. See Janus Cap. Grp. v. First Derivative Traders, 564 U.S. 135, 142 (2011).
19

Cohen asserts that he understood the investment access question as referring only
to whether the purchaser had a “liquidity need” that might force an early “actual
withdrawal,” and “not to the payout or death benefit maturity of the annuity.” A plain
reading of the question does not include this qualification. The question states: “I
anticipate that I will begin to access this investment: __________.”

9
purchased with the expectation of generating immediate, bonus-enhanced payouts upon the death
of the annuitants, and not for any tax reasons.20 And Cohen had no interaction at all with the
nominees, who uniformly testified that they did not know Cohen or communicate with him in
any way. Indeed, Cohen admitted that he never met any of the nominees before they appeared as
witnesses at the hearing.
We also find that these misstatements were material. A misstatement is material if there
is a “substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact” would have “significantly
altered the ‘total mix’ of information” available in making an investment decision.21 The false
information need only be “important” to the recipient’s deliberations; proof that “disclosure of
the omitted fact would have caused” the recipient to actually change his or her behavior is not
necessary.22
Cohen’s misstatements were material to Woodbury in deciding whether to approve his
annuity sales.23 Indeed, Stone testified that if Cohen had “at any point in time answered these
questions correctly, none of these transactions would have been processed.” Stone testified that
Woodbury could not “make an accurate assessment of the suitability of the sale” if it did not
“know the true or correct facts” or if it did not “know all of the facts.” He added that a sale
would fail suitability review if the “product was used in a way that it wasn’t intended to be
used.” For example, Stone testified that Woodbury would not have approved a variable annuity
sale to a customer who intended to use it as a short-term investment strategy (even if the
customer was fully aware of the risks of such a strategy). Woodbury also “definitely would have
rejected” a sale if Cohen had disclosed that the investor’s purpose was to access the investment
20

Cohen asserts that tax-deferred growth is an intrinsic characteristic of a variable annuity,
and independent of the actual purchaser’s time horizon. But the point-of-sale question asked for
the reasons why “I [i.e., that specific purchaser]” was purchasing the annuity.

upon the death of the terminally ill annuitants. Nor would Woodbury have approved a sale if the
point-of-sale form stated that Cohen did not know the customer or that the Funds were the
ultimate investor. Accordingly, the facts that Cohen misrepresented would have been significant
to Woodbury in determining whether to approve the variable annuity sales.
Cohen claims that his misstatements were not material because, as unsolicited sales, these
transactions were not subject to Woodbury’s suitability review. But Stone testified that
Woodbury did not allow unsolicited annuity sales. And Cohen admitted that he submitted the
forms for the purpose of enabling Woodbury to do “their due diligence” and “suitability review.”
Cohen also argues that FINRA’s “Notices and Rules” did not require a suitability review.
Regardless of the procedures FINRA mandated, the record is clear that Woodbury required all of
the variable annuity sales at issue to undergo its suitability review process.
2.

Cohen acted with scienter

Scienter is the “intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.”24 It may be established “by
showing that the defendants knew their statements were false, or by showing that defendants
were reckless as to the truth or falsity of their statements.”25 We find that Cohen knew his
statements were false when he submitted the 28 point-of-sale forms to Woodbury.
Cohen understood that he was selling variable annuities to hedge funds that were using
nominees in order to buy the annuities for short-term investment purposes. He admitted that the
purpose of the strategy was “using annuities for the short-term death benefit” paid when the
terminally ill annuitants died. Cohen also knew that the strategy depended on taking advantage
of the bonus feature combined with a waiver of surrender charges. He also personally reviewed
and researched variable annuity products to “better understand” them and “assure himself” that
the strategy would function, including by compiling a spreadsheet that calculated the potential
returns for a notional “$1 million investment” in the event of the annuitant’s “Death in 60 Days.”
Thus, Cohen knew that his statements that the purchasers anticipated “begin[ning] to access” the
annuity in “11-15 years,” that the annuities were purchased for the “[t]ax deferred treatment of
earnings,” and that he was “familiar” with the purchasers were false when he made them.26
Cohen also took steps to minimize suspicion and reduce the risk that the truth would be
discovered. He asked issuers what might raise “red flags” when a variable annuity application
was reviewed and prepared a spreadsheet that tabulated the maximum amounts that could be

the speaker believes his statement to be false.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).

11
invested in each product without triggering due diligence by the insurer. These actions, and
Cohen’s repeated and knowing falsehoods, constitute overwhelming proof of his scienter.
3.

Cohen made his misstatements in the offer or sale, and in connection with
the purchase or sale, of securities.

Cohen made his misstatements in the “offer and sale,” and in connection with the
purchase or sale, of securities. In United States v. Naftalin, the Supreme Court held that “in the
“offer or sale” is “expansive enough to encompass the entire selling process.”27 The fraud need
not “occur in any particular phase of the selling transaction.”28 Naftalin held that material
misstatements made to a broker in order to induce the completion of a securities transaction
occur “in” the “offer” and “sale” of securities, and so are within the scope of Section 17(a)(1).29
Cohen made his misstatements for this exact reason.
Similarly, Section 10(b)’s “in connection with” requirement is satisfied when the fraud
and the sale “coincide.”30 A “misrepresentation about who [is] buying” a security made to
induce acceptance of the transaction satisfies the “in connection with” requirement.31 Because
Cohen made the misstatements to induce Woodbury to approve the variable annuity sales,
Section 10(b)’s “in connection with” requirement is satisfied.
Cohen argues that his conduct cannot violate Section 17(a) because that section is
“limited to fraud against . . . purchasers” and does not reach frauds “where no direct investor
harm” occurred.32 But in Naftalin, the Court held that “the statutory language does not require
that the victim of the fraud be an investor—only that the frauds occur ‘in’ an offer or sale of

securities.”33 In so concluding, the Court considered it significant that although Section 17(a)(3)
is limited to fraud or deceit “upon the purchaser,” Section 17(a)(1) is not so limited.34 Although
Naftalin addressed only Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act, its holding and reasoning apply
equally to Section 17(a)(2), which also does not contain an “upon the purchaser” limitation.
Cohen also contends that Rule 10b-5 is limited to fraud against investors. No subsection
of Rule 10b-5 is limited by a “fraud upon the purchaser” requirement. Relying on Naftalin and
the fact that “in connection with” is no narrower than “in,” the D.C. Circuit has held that Rule
10b-5 “cover[s] fraud against brokers.”35
Cohen contends further that we have limited Section 17(a) to frauds on investors because
in John P. Flannery we said that “there would need to be a showing that investors were or could
have been defrauded” for liability under Section 17(a).36 But we made that statement in the
context of explaining that liability under Section 17(a) does not require conduct that is
manipulative or deceptive but does require conduct that defrauds, and Flannery involved an
alleged fraud on investors. Flannery did not involve a fraud on a broker, and we adhere to the
Supreme Court’s view that fraud on a broker is within the purview of Section 17(a)(1) and (a)(2).

We find that, by virtue of the material misstatements Cohen made with scienter, he
violated Securities Act Section 17(a)(1), Exchange Act Section 10(b), and Exchange Act Rule
10b-5(a), (b), and (c). Because Cohen also obtained money or property by means of the
misstatements, we also find that he violated Securities Act Section 17(a)(2). The requirement
that a defendant obtain money or property “by means of” the misstatements suggests the need for
a causal link between the misrepresentation and the acquisition of money or property.37 As we

have explained, Cohen’s statements were decisive in obtaining Woodbury’s approval of the
variable annuities sales. And Cohen was directly compensated for those sales in the form of
approximately $700,000 in commissions. This is more than sufficient to satisfy the requirement
that he “obtain[ed] money . . . by means of” his misstatements.38
B.

Cohen aided and abetted and caused Woodbury’s recordkeeping violations.

Exchange Act Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3(a)(6) thereunder require broker-dealers to
make and keep current certain books and records relating to its operations.39 “That requirement
includes the requirement that the records be accurate, which applies regardless of whether the
information itself is mandated.”40 Scienter is not required for a primary violation of Exchange
Act Section 17(a)(1) or the rules thereunder.41
“To establish that a respondent aided and abetted a books and records violation, we must
find that (1) a violation of the books and records provisions occurred; (2) the respondent
substantially assisted the violation; and (3) the respondent provided that assistance with the
requisite scienter.”42 Liability for causing a violation requires: (1) a primary violation; (2) that
the respondent knew, or should have known, that his or her conduct would contribute to the
violation; and (3) that the respondent engaged in an act or omission that contributed to the
violation.43 The primary violator need not be charged in order to find liability.44
Woodbury violated Exchange Act Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3(a)(6) because the
false and misleading point-of-sale forms rendered the requisite books and records that
Woodbury’s back office maintained to document each annuity sale inaccurate. Cohen
substantially assisted and contributed to the violation because he was the one who submitted the

false and misleading forms to Woodbury. And Cohen acted with the requisite scienter because
he knew the forms were false and misleading when he submitted them. Accordingly, we find
that Cohen aided and abetted and caused Woodbury’s recordkeeping violations.
C.

The record does not support Cohen’s claim that the law judge was biased.

Cohen claims that the law judge conducted the hearing in a “lopsided, unbalanced, and
biased” fashion. As an initial matter, we note that law judges are presumed to be unbiased.45 To
overcome this presumption, there must be a “showing of conflict of interest or some other
specific reason for disqualification,”46 such as where the law judge’s behavior, “in the context of
the whole case, was ‘so extreme as to display clear inability to render fair judgment.’”47 Cohen
fails to meet this demanding standard.
Cohen supports his claim of bias by citing a number of the law judge’s decisions,
including her questioning of certain witnesses, reminding Cohen that he needed to comply with
the rules, and urging Cohen to wrap up his cross-examination. This amounts to a recitation of
the rulings that Cohen disagrees with, and disagreement is not evidence of bias. “[J]udicial
rulings alone” almost “never constitute a valid basis for a bias [claim].”48
Moreover, based on our independent de novo review of the record, we are satisfied that
the law judge acted appropriately. It is settled that a “judge may question a witness in order to
clarify testimony and to elicit necessary facts.”49 And we expect all “[p]arties, including those
appearing pro se, . . . to familiarize themselves with the Rules of Practice” and to comply with
procedural requirements.50 Finally, our review of the record shows that the law judge gave
Cohen broad latitude in cross-examination. Often, his “cross-examination was substantially

15
more extensive than the Division’s examination of these witnesses.”51 In addition, Cohen “fails
to explain how a longer cross-examination would have strengthened [his] defense.”52
In his petition for review, Cohen advanced two other grounds in support of his claim of
bias. He asserted that the law judge gave “implicit blessing” to the Division’s supposedly
“deceptive” plan to deny him the opportunity to call two witnesses in his defense. He also
asserted that the law judge had a substantive, 5-minute ex parte conversation with one of the
Division’s witnesses while he was outside the hearing room. Although Cohen did not pursue
these claims in his brief, we issued an order directing Cohen to submit a brief regarding his
claims.53 Cohen never filed a brief in response to our order, and this failure by itself would
justify our ruling against him on these issues.54 Nonetheless, we have reviewed the record and
find Cohen’s claims unsubstantiated.
Cohen’s opportunity to call witnesses: On the morning of Wednesday, August 27, 2014,
after two days of presenting evidence, the Division closed its case. That afternoon, Cohen
testified on his own behalf and called one witness.55 The law judge concluded the hearing over
Cohen’s objection after Cohen had no other witnesses available to testify. Cohen asserts that he
was planning on calling two witnesses, Baruch Gottesman and Michael Horowitz, who were
flying in from California but had not yet arrived because Cohen did not expect his rebuttal case
to begin until the next Monday. Cohen claims that the law judge “stated during a pre-hearing
conference that the hearing would last for 10 days” and that the Division represented that it
would present its case for five days and Cohen would be given the following five days to present
rebuttal. But the hearing transcript contains no such statements and Cohen acknowledged at the
hearing that the law judge never “told anyone that this case was going for two weeks.” Because
neither the law judge nor the Division misled Cohen regarding the anticipated length of the
hearing, we find no error in the law judge's decision to end the hearing when she did.

Rule of Practice 180(c), 17 C.F.R. § 201.180(c).

Cohen attempted to call another witness, Judah Pearlstein. The ALJ sustained the
Division’s objection to her testimony on the ground that she did not serve as a nominee for any
of the variable annuity sales that are at issue. Cohen does not challenge this ruling.

16
The law judge’s alleged ex parte conversation: Cohen claims that the law judge had an
ex parte conversation with Timothy Stone during a recess after the Division’s direct examination
of that witness. According to Cohen, the hearing transcript shows that the ex parte conversation
occurred because after the law judge indicated that the proceedings were to go “off the record”
the reporter defied the law judge’s instruction and instead “deliberately record[ed] and
transcrib[ed] the conversations” that occurred outside Cohen’s presence. The transcript of the
hearing does not support Cohen’s claim. Instead, it shows that every time the law judge
indicated that the proceedings would go off the record, the court reporter followed that statement
with an indication on the transcript “(Discussion held off the record).” Transcription of the
proceedings then began again without any specific indication that the proceedings were back “on
the record.” Thus, the transcript indicates that the conversation that the court reporter transcribed
was not an ex parte conversation that took place during the break but rather a colloquy that took
place on the record in Cohen’s presence after the proceedings resumed.
III.

Sanctions

The Division seeks a bar from the securities industry, a cease-and-desist order,
disgorgement, and a civil money penalty. Cohen argues that these sanctions are unwarranted and
that the statute of limitations in 28 U.S.C. § 2462 precludes imposing a bar or civil penalty. We
find that 28 U.S.C. § 2462 does not bar any of the requested relief because Cohen entered into
voluntary tolling agreements, and that the relief requested is in the public interest.
A.

Section 2462 is a non-jurisdictional statute of limitations subject to tolling.

Section 2462 provides that an “action, suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any civil
fine, penalty, or forfeiture, pecuniary or otherwise, shall not be entertained unless commenced
within five years from the date when the claim first accrued . . . .” Although Cohen’s fraud
ended in February 2008 and the Commission did not institute proceedings until March 2014,56
Cohen (through counsel) agreed to toll the statute of limitations until May 2014.57 Nonetheless,
Cohen argues that the five-year time limit is “jurisdictional” and cannot be tolled.

56

Michael A. Horowitz, Exchange Act Release No. 71715, 2014 WL 977335 (Mar. 13,

2014).
57

We grant the Division’s request to adduce the tolling agreements as additional evidence.
See Rule of Practice 452, 17 C.F.R. § 201.452. The agreements are “material” to the
applicability of the statute of limitations, and “reasonable grounds” exist for the Division not to
have introduced that evidence previously. The law judge denied all of Cohen’s affirmative
defenses at a July 2014 pre-hearing conference. The Division thus would not have known of the
need to introduce evidence showing that the statute of limitations had not run until the law judge
issued her decision holding that 28 U.S.C. § 2462 precluded the imposition of a bar and civil
penalties.

17
We disagree. “Statutes of limitations and other filings deadlines ‘ordinarily are not
jurisdictional.’”58 As a result, there is a “high bar to establish that a statute of limitations is
jurisdictional.”59 The Supreme Court “treat[s] a time bar as jurisdictional only if Congress has
‘clearly stated’ that it is.”60 Congress has not done so in Section 2462.
“To determine whether Congress has made the necessary clear statement,” the Court
“examine[s] the ‘text, context, and relevant historical treatment’ of the provision at issue.”61 The
text suggests that Congress did not mean Section 2462 to be jurisdictional. Section 2462 “does
not expressly refer to . . . jurisdiction or speak in jurisdictional terms” and therefore does not
“provide a ‘clear indication that Congress wanted [it] to be treated as having jurisdictional
attributes.’”62
Context also indicates that Section 2462 does not impose a jurisdictional limit. Section
2462 is “located in a provision ‘separate’ from those granting . . . subject-matter jurisdiction.”63
It is located in the “Particular Proceedings” Part of Title 28 of the U.S. Code and is not found in
the “Jurisdiction and Venue” Part of Title 28.64 Section 2462 is also not among the provisions of
the federal securities laws that provide subject-matter jurisdiction over Commission actions.65
This context “supports the conclusion that [Section 2462] is not jurisdictional.”66
So does the relevant historical treatment of Section 2462. The “law typically treats a
limitations defense as an affirmative defense that the defendant must raise . . . and that is subject
to rules of forfeiture and waiver.”67 Section 2462 is no different. Numerous courts of appeals
have held that Section 2462 provides an affirmative “statute of limitations defense” that can be

“waived.”68 This “history of treating the operative language in [Section 2462] as providing a
nonjurisdictional defense” indicates that Section 2462 is subject to tolling.
Cohen argues that Section 2462 is jurisdictional because the Supreme Court in Gabelli v.
SEC held that the discovery rule—which delays accrual of a claim until the plaintiff has
discovered the facts giving rise to the cause of action—does not apply to civil penalty
enforcement actions.69 But nowhere did the Court suggest that Section 2462 was jurisdictional
in nature and it did not address tolling. Instead, the Court stated explicitly that the applicability
of “doctrines that toll the running of an applicable limitations period” was not before it.70
Cohen also asserts that Section 2462’s use of the word “shall” denotes “absoluteness and
jurisdictionality [sic].” But most “time prescriptions, however emphatic, are not properly typed
‘jurisdictional.’”71 The Supreme Court has “consistently found it of no consequence” that a time
limitation uses language that is “mandatory—‘shall’ be barred”—or “emphatic—‘forever’
barred.”72 “‘However emphatic[ally]’ expressed” a time limit may be, “Congress must do
something special, beyond setting an exception-free deadline, to tag a statute of limitations as
jurisdictional.”73 As we have explained, the language, context, and application of Section 2462
demonstrates it is not jurisdictional.74
Because Section 2462 is not jurisdictional, it does not bar relief in this case because
Cohen agreed to extend the statute of limitations until after the Commission instituted these
proceedings.75

Even had the statute of limitations not been tolled, Section 2462 would not prevent us
from imposing equitable remedial sanctions, such as a bar, cease-and-desist order, or
disgorgement. See, e.g., Timbervest, LLC, Advisers Act Release No. 4197, 2015 WL 5472520,

equitable remedies not subject to Section 2462).

19
B.

We find that a bar, a cease-and-desist order, disgorgement, and a civil money
penalty are in the public interest.
1.

Bar

Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act authorizes us to bar Cohen from association with a
broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, and transfer agent if we find that
his violations were willful and that such a sanction is in the public interest.76 Section 9(b) of the
Investment Company Act provides similar authority to prohibit Cohen from “serving or acting as
an employee, officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser or depositor of,
or principal underwriter for, a registered investment company or affiliated person of such
investment adviser, depositor, or principal underwriter.”77 Because a violator acts willfully by
“intentionally committing the act which constitutes the violation,”78 we find that Cohen’s
violations were willful. We also find a bar to be in the public interest.
In determining whether to impose a bar, we consider the egregiousness of the
respondent’s actions, the isolated or recurrent nature of the infraction, the degree of scienter
involved, the respondent’s recognition of the wrongful nature of his or her conduct, the sincerity
of the respondent’s assurances against future violations, and the likelihood that the respondent’s
occupation will present opportunities for future violations.79 We do not look solely at “past
misconduct.”80 Rather, because a bar is intended to “protect[] the trading public from further
harm,” not to punish the respondent,81 the “degree of risk [that the respondent] poses to the
public” and the extent of the respondent’s “unfitness to serve the investing public” are the
touchstones of our analysis.82 Our inquiry is flexible, and no single factor is dispositive.83

association with a municipal advisor or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, we

Act. See Koch v. SEC, 793 F.3d 147, 158 (D.C. Cir. 2015).

Cohen’s misconduct was egregious and undertaken with a high degree of scienter.
Cohen undoubtedly appreciated that his representations on the point-of-sale forms were false,
and he made them to induce Woodbury to approve the annuity sales. Cohen’s misconduct was
also recurrent and cannot be viewed as a one-time lapse in judgment. He made misstatements in
over two dozen point-of-sale forms over a two-month period. Finally, Cohen’s attempt to blame
others for his misconduct by asserting that he acted on the “advice of counsel”—a contention
that lacks any support in the record—undermines the sincerity of his assurances against future
violations.84
Cohen asserts that a bar is unnecessary because he “no longer poses a threat to the
securities industry.” We disagree. Cohen’s willingness to knowingly and repeatedly make
material misrepresentations in connection with securities transactions indicates that he poses a
serious and continuing threat to the investing public.
We find that the imposition of a bar in all the capacities indicated above is in the public
interest. “[C]onduct that violates the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws is
especially serious and subject to the severest of sanctions under the securities laws.”85 Cohen’s
fraudulent activities establish him as a threat to the investing public and unfit to serve that public
and preclude his continued association as a securities professional.

Cease-and-desist order

Section 8A(a) of the Securities Act and Section 21C of the Exchange Act authorize us to
issue a cease-and-desist order as to any person who “is violating, has violated, or is about to
violate” any provision of these statutes or any rule or regulation thereunder.86 Such orders must
be in the public interest, and in making that determination we consider essentially the same
factors discussed above.87 The risk of future violations needed to support a cease-and-desist
order “need not be very great”88 and even a “single egregious violation can be sufficient to

indicate some risk of future violation.”89 Indeed, “[i]n the ordinary case, and absent evidence to
the contrary, a finding of past violation raises a risk of future violation sufficient to support our
ordering a respondent to cease and desist.”90 Cohen does not challenge the appropriateness of a
cease-and-desist order. For the same reasons that we find that a bar is appropriate, we conclude
that there is a sufficient risk of future violations to justify this sanction.
3.

Disgorgement

Sections 21C(e) of the Exchange Act authorizes us to order disgorgement of ill-gotten
gains.91 “[D]isgorgement’s underlying purpose is to make lawbreaking unprofitable for the lawbreaker[.]”92 It is an “equitable remedy” that deprives the wrongdoer of ill-gotten gains.93 The
amount disgorged must “be a reasonable approximation of the profits causally connected to the
violation.”94 This includes “all gains flowing from the illegal activities.”95
We find that Cohen should disgorge $766,958, which are the sales commissions he
received from Woodbury as a result of his fraud. Cohen admitted in his testimony that he never
returned these funds. Although Cohen asserts that he “does not currently have the funds” to pay
disgorgement,96 that is irrelevant. That Cohen might have already spent his ill-gotten gains does
not eliminate his disgorgement obligation.97 Nor does a respondent’s “claim of financial
hardship” provide a “defense to a motion for an order of disgorgement.”98

Civil money penalties

Section 21B of the Exchange Act authorizes us to assess a civil money penalty when the
respondent has willfully violated the securities laws and such a penalty is in the public interest.99
A three-tier system establishes the maximum such penalty that may be imposed for each
violation found. For each act or omission involving fraud or deceit that additionally resulted in
(or created a significant risk) of substantial losses to other persons or that resulted in substantial
gains to the wrongdoer, a third-tier penalty may be warranted.100
Third-tier civil penalties are warranted against Cohen because his fraud resulted in
substantial gains. Cohen made four separate misrepresentations in 28 different point-of-sale
forms and earned, as a result, $766,958 in commissions; if Woodbury had not discovered his
misconduct, it would have (according to Cohen) paid him another $1.3 million in commissions.
Considering the nature of Cohen’s fraudulent misconduct, the unjust gains that Cohen received,
and the need to deter others from engaging in similar conduct, we have determined to impose a
third-tier civil penalty of $75,000 for each of the 28 variable annuity sales, for a total civil
penalty of $2,100,000.101
An appropriate order will issue.102

PIWOWAR, concurring separately).

Commissioner PIWOWAR, concurring:
Commissioner Piwowar concurs with the opinion, which concludes, among other things,
that Moshe Marc Cohen violated Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Exchange Act Rules
10b-5(a) and (c).
Several courts have found that misstatements alone are not sufficient to give rise to
scheme liability.1 In this case, however, there is no need to determine whether the holdings of
those cases apply. Although not specifically described in the majority opinion as a basis for
liability, Cohen engaged in manipulative and deceptive activities beyond the misstatements. As
discussed in the initial decision, Cohen’s deceptive conduct included calling issuers to learn what
characteristics of a variable annuity application might generate so-called “red flags” for
additional due diligence by the insurer, and then taking actions to avoid such scrutiny. Cohen
also, among other things, instructed others on how to deal with annuitant families, and thus
assisted in preventing nominees from making statements that might reveal the nature of the
investment strategy.
Because Cohen acted deceptively, employed deceptive devices and artifices to defraud,
and engaged in deceptive acts, practices, and a course of business that operated as a fraud beyond
his misstatements, there is no need to address whether those misstatements alone are sufficient to
find violations of Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5(a) and
(c).
