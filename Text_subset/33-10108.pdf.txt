Company Act of 1940 (“Investment Company Act”) against Jan E. Helen (“Respondent”).

II.
After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement alleges that:
Summary
1.
This matter involves Respondent’s misappropriation of investor funds from two
pooled investment vehicles that he managed, Janco Energy Partners II, LLC (“JEP II”) and Janco
Energy Partners III, LLC (“JEP III”). From approximately November 2012 through the present,
Respondent has been the sole owner and control person of Janco Properties, LLC (“Janco
Properties”), which is the manager and investment adviser to JEP II and JEP III. Pursuant to their
offering documents, JEP II and JEP III were formed to invest in working interests in oil and gas
exploration. However, from approximately March 2013 through June 2014, Respondent
misappropriated investor funds by taking at least $165,200 in unauthorized and undisclosed
personal loans. Specifically, between November 2012 and July 2014, JEP II received
approximately $711,000 in investor proceeds and from March 2013 to November 2013 Respondent
misappropriated approximately $80,200 of those funds. Similarly, between April 2014 and May
2015, JEP III received approximately $470,000 in investor proceeds and in April 2014 – less than a
week after JEP III received its first investor contribution – Respondent began misappropriating
investor funds from JEP III, in a course of conduct that continued through June 2014 and resulted in
Respondent misappropriating approximately $85,000 from JEP III. Due to Respondent’s
misappropriation, investor funds were not available for their stated purpose of funding oil and gas
drilling operations. Respondent’s scheme was uncovered during the summer of 2014, during a
regulatory review of Respondent’s then-broker-dealer, Janco Partners, Inc. (“Janco Partners”). By
virtue of this conduct, Respondent willfully violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section
10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder with respect to JEP III, and, in the
alternative, willfully aided and abetted and caused JEP III’s violations of Section 10(b) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5(b) thereunder, and Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule
206(4)-8 thereunder with respect to JEP II and JEP III.
Respondent
2.
Jan E. Helen, age 69, resides in Denver, Colorado. Respondent is the sole owner
and managing member of Janco Properties, the manager and investment adviser to JEP II and JEP
III. Through Janco Properties, Respondent was entitled to specific compensation from JEP II and
JEP III to provide advice concerning their respective oil and gas investments. Respondent was also
the founder, chairman, chief executive officer and chief compliance officer of Janco Partners, as
well as a registered representative associated with Janco Partners from February 1996 through
October 2014. From May 1979 through December 1995, Respondent was a registered
representative associated with various broker-dealers registered with the Commission.
Other Relevant Parties
3.
“Janco Partners” is a Colorado corporation headquartered in Greenwood Village,
Colorado that was a broker-dealer registered with the Commission from approximately February
1996 until October 2014, when the Form BDW withdrawal of its registration became effective. It
2

filed its request for withdrawal via Form BDW in August 2014. Janco Partners served as the
exclusive selling agent in connection with the offer and sale of membership interests in JEP II and
JEP III.
4.
“Janco Properties” is a Colorado limited liability company with its principal place
of business in Greenwood Village, Colorado that served as the manager and investment adviser to
JEP II and JEP III. Janco Properties also functioned as a commercial property management
company that owned an office building and leased space to Janco Partners and other tenants. Janco
Properties has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.
5.
“JEP II” is a Colorado limited liability company and pooled investment vehicle
formed in 2012 for the purpose of raising funds and investing the proceeds into working interests in
oil and gas securities offered by a third party oil and gas exploration and production company. JEP
II has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.
6.
“JEP III” is a Colorado limited liability company and pooled investment vehicle
formed in 2014 for the purpose of raising funds and investing the proceeds into working interests in
oil and gas securities offered by a third party oil and gas exploration and production company. JEP
III has never been registered with the Commission in any capacity.
Allegations
A.

Respondent and Janco Properties were Investment Advisers to JEP II and JEP III

7.
The JEP II Private Placement Memorandum (“JEP II PPM”) provided in relevant
part that “Janco Properties, LLC will be the Manager of the Company” and that “[t]he Manager is
wholly-owned by Jan Helen, who will be responsible for management of the Company.” Pursuant
to the terms of the JEP II PPM, Janco Properties and Helen advised JEP II as to certain
investments, particularly its investments in working interests in oil and gas projects offered by a
third party. The JEP II PPM further provided that in exchange for its management services, “[a]t
such time as Members have received cash distributions in an amount equal to 95% of the purchase
price paid for their Units, profits and losses will generally be allocated 80% to Members on a pro
rata basis and 20% to the Manager with respect to its Carried Interest.”
8.
The JEP III Private Placement Memorandum (“JEP III PPM”) likewise provided in
relevant part that “Janco Properties, LLC will be the Manager of the Company” and that “[t]he
Manager is wholly-owned by Jan Helen, who will be responsible for management of the
Company.” Pursuant to the terms of the JEP III PPM, Janco Properties and Helen advised JEP III
as to certain investments, particularly its investments in working interests in oil and gas projects
offered by a third party. The JEP III PPM further provided that in exchange for its management
services, “[a]t such time as Members have received cash distributions in an amount equal to 95% of
the purchase price paid for their Units, profits and losses will generally be allocated 80% to
Members on a pro rata basis and 20% to the Manager with respect to its Carried Interest.”
9.
Respondent, for compensation, engaged in the business of providing investment
advice about securities to JEP II and JEP III.
3

B.

Respondent Misappropriated Investor Funds from JEP II

10.
In November 2012, JEP II commenced a private offering of membership interests,
seeking to raise $1.2 million from accredited investors. The JEP II PPM provided that “[n]et
proceeds for this offering will be invested in a partnership, joint venture, working interest or
similar investment arrangement with [JEP II’s oil and gas exploration operator] to develop multiple
oil and gas exploration opportunities.” The JEP II Operating Agreement, which was provided to
investors along with the PPM, further states that the “purpose of [JEP II] is to acquire working
interests in one more oil and gas leases or make other investments in the oil and gas exploration,
drilling and production operations of [JEP II’s oil and gas exploration operator].”
11.
Fifteen investors committed to contribute at least $780,000 in capital to JEP II.
From approximately November 2012 through July 2014, those fifteen investors contributed
$711,000 through initial investment and capital calls. Respondent notified investors when capital
calls were required. All or substantially all of the funds in JEP II’s bank accounts were raised from
investors through JEP II’s offer and sale of membership interests.
12.
According to the JEP II PPM, Janco Partners was entitled to receive a $60,000 flat
fee for its role in selling the membership units, as well as the reimbursement of costs and expenses
that it incurred on behalf of JEP II.
13.
As contemplated in the JEP II PPM, Janco Partners received its $60,000 fee and
the reimbursement of $24,000 in costs and expenses in connection with the JEP II private
placement.
14.
In addition to these amounts, from at least March 2013 through November 2013,
at Respondent’s direction, JEP II provided Janco Partners with $80,200 beyond its earned
compensation in at least seven transfers. JEP II’s books and records characterized these
transactions primarily in two ways: (i) as a reduction of Respondent’s “Partner Capital” account
(thereby falsely implying that JEP II was returning capital that Respondent had previously
invested); or (ii) as an increase to a “Contributions Receivable” account from Respondent,
indicating that JEP II expected to receive this cash back.
15.
Although JEP II transferred funds to Janco Partners, in all instances, Respondent
then withdrew the funds from Janco Partners and caused the amounts to be recorded on Janco
Partners’ general ledger as “Loans to Employees – Jan Helen.” Therefore, Respondent knew that
he had taken personal loans from JEP II.
16.
JEP II did not maintain a general ledger during 2013. However, in 2014, when JEP
II needed financial statements to prepare 2013 tax documents for investors, a general ledger was
created by an independent contractor of Janco Partners.
17.
At Respondent’s direction, Respondent’s personal loans from JEP II were
characterized as “Partners Capital – Jan Helen” or “Contributions Receivable” in the general
ledgers of JEP II.

4

18.
Respondent’s use of investor funds for personal loans meant that such funds were
not available for their stated purpose – to fund oil and gas investments. Specifically, from at least
March 2013 through the end of the year, JEP II failed to pay its oil and gas exploration operator
approximately $89,000 that it owed for its pro rata share of drilling expenses.
19.
Respondent should have known that loans from JEP II to himself or Janco Partners
were not authorized.
20.

Respondent did not disclose his $80,200 in personal loans to JEP II investors.

21.
Respondent’s misrepresentations and omissions as to the uses of investor funds
were material. Based on JEP II’s offering documents and communications with Respondent,
investors believed their funds would be used to fund oil and gas investments and, in fact, some
investors would not have invested in JEP II had they known that their funds may have been used to
make personal loans to Respondent.
22.
Respondent did not execute a promissory note or otherwise document his obligation
to repay his personal loans to JEP II. Respondent repaid his personal loans to JEP II, without
interest, by making a $35,000 payment on or about August 6, 2013 and a $45,200 payment on or
about December 31, 2013.
23.

withdrawals from and repayments to, JEP II.

Respondent Misappropriated Investor Funds from JEP III

24.
In February 2014, JEP III began a private offering of membership interests, seeking
to raise $5 million from accredited investors. The JEP III PPM provided that the “[n]et proceeds
for this offering will be invested in a partnership, joint venture, working interest or similar
investment arrangement . . . to develop multiple oil and gas exploration opportunities.” The JEP
III Operating Agreement, which was provided to investors along with the PPM, further states that
the “purpose of [JEP III] is to acquire working interests in one more oil and gas leases or make
other investments in the oil and gas exploration, drilling and production operations of [JEP III’s oil
and gas exploration operator].”
25.
The cover page of the JEP III PPM attributes the PPM to “Janco Energy Partners,
III, LLC c/o Jan E. Helen.” The JEP III PPM Summary provides, in part, “The Manager of [JEP
III] is Janco Properties, LLC. Janco Properties, LLC is owned and controlled by Jan E. Helen and
is an affiliate of Janco Partners, Inc.”
26.
Thirteen investors committed to contribute $870,000 in capital to JEP III. From
approximately April 2014 through May 2015, eleven of those investors contributed $470,000
through initial investment and capital calls. Respondent notified investors when capital calls were
required. All or substantially all of the funds in JEP III’s bank accounts were raised from investors
through JEP III’s offer and sale of membership interests.
6

27.
According to the JEP III Private Placement Memorandum (“JEP III PPM”), Janco
Partners was entitled to receive a $20,000 fee for preparing the offering documents, as well as a
5% commission on the sale of JEP III membership units.
28.
Respondent, as the manager of JEP III, controlled JEP III, directed the preparation
of the JEP III PPM, reviewed its content, and directed its dissemination.
29.
Less than a week after the first JEP III investor contribution was received,
Respondent began to misappropriate investor funds. As set forth below, from April 2014
through June 2014, at Respondent’s direction, JEP III paid Janco Partners a total of $148,500.
At most, $63,500 of this amount was authorized in JEP III’s offering documents. Specifically,
the $20,000 offering documents preparation fee and $43,500 in commissions, which represented
5% of the $870,000 in committed capital. JEP III’s books and records characterized this $63,500
as “Due from Janco Partners.”
30.
During that same period, at Respondent’s direction, JEP III paid Janco Partners
$85,000 beyond the $63,500 in earned compensation in at least five fund transfers. JEP III’s
books and records characterized each of the individual transactions totaling $85,000 as a “Loan
to Jan E. Helen.” Because Respondent withdrew these funds from Janco Partners, its general
ledger generally reflected these withdrawals as “Loans to Employees – Jan Helen.” Therefore,
Respondent knew that he had taken personal loans from JEP III.
31.
Respondent knew, or was extremely reckless in not knowing, and should have
known that the loans from JEP III to himself or Janco Partners were not authorized.
32.
Neither JEP III nor Respondent disclosed Respondent’s $85,000 in personal loans
prior to Respondent obtaining the funds. Respondent’s use of investor funds for personal loans
meant that such funds were not available for their stated purpose – to fund oil and gas investments.
33.
Respondent’s misrepresentations and omissions as to the uses of investor funds
were material. Based on JEP III’s offering documents and communications with Respondent,
investors believed their funds would be used to fund oil and gas investments and, in fact, some
investors would not have invested in JEP III had they known that their funds may have been used
to make personal loans to Respondent.
D.

Respondent’s Unauthorized Loans from JEP III Were Uncovered By Regulators During a
Review of Janco Partners

34.
During a review of Janco Partners’ June 2014 Financial and Operational
Combined Uniform Report and supporting records, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
(“FINRA”) staff observed certain transactions on Janco Partners’ bank statements that were not
recorded on Janco Partners’ general ledger. On August 6, 2014, FINRA staff sent Janco Partners
an email inquiring as to the discrepancies.

7

35.
On August 9, 2014, Janco Partners filed an Exchange Act Rule 17a-11
notification reporting a net capital deficiency of $87,497 for the period July 15, 2014 through
August 8, 2014. The filing noted that “the deficiency was caused by an advance becoming a
loan” and that “additional shareholder capital contribution of $90,000” was expected “not later
than 8/15/2014.”
36.
On Monday, August 11, 2014, Janco Partners filed a Form BDW. The Financial
Liabilities section of the Form BDW reported that the firm owed $90,000 to one “customer” and
that “the individual involved has arranged to repay the company by 8/15/2014.”
37.
On August 12, 2014, FINRA staff made an unannounced visit to Janco Partners’
offices to collect documentation in connection with the $90,000 identified in the Form BDW
filing. That same day, FINRA issued a request seeking, among other documents, “the loan
documents for the monies borrowed from JEP III.”
38.
On August 13, 2014, Respondent executed a promissory note with JEP III “as of
April 8, 2014” for $26,500 “plus additional advances, if any.” That same day, counsel for
Respondent and Janco Partners provided documents in response to FINRA’s August 12 request
and notified FINRA that “of the money sent by JEP III to Janco [P]artners, $63,500 represented
commissions and other fees earned by [Janco Partners], with the remainder constituting loans to
Mr. Helen.”
39.
On August 15, 2014, FINRA staff issued a request to obtain additional documents
from Janco Partners and for an on-the-record interview (“OTR”) of Respondent on August 22,
2014. The day before Respondent was scheduled to appear, counsel informed FINRA that
Respondent would not appear for the OTR, and that Janco Partners would provide no further
information to FINRA.
40.
Following Respondent’s refusal to appear for the OTR, he executed a Letter of
Acceptance, Waiver and Consent with FINRA on August 28, 2014 barring him from association
with any FINRA member firm.
41.
Notwithstanding representations in both the Exchange Act Rule 17a-11
notification and the Form BDW, Respondent failed to repay Janco Partners’ customer, JEP III,
on or before August 14, 2014. Respondent belatedly repaid his $85,000 personal loan from JEP
III, along with $3,500 in interest, by making payments of $72,450 in February 2015 and $15,900 in
November 2015.
42.

withdrawals from and repayments to, JEP III.
