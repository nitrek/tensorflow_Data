SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission has requested comment on a release
proposing revisions to the property disclosure requirements for mining registrants and related
guidance, currently set forth in Item 102 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933 and

2

the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and in Industry Guide 7. The proposed revisions would
modernize the Commission’s disclosure requirements and policies for mining properties
by more closely aligning them with current industry and global regulatory practices and
standards. In addition, the proposed revisions would rescind Industry Guide 7, amend section
102 of Regulation S-K, add new exhibit (96) to Item 601 of Regulation S-K, add new subpart
1300 of Regulation S-K, amend Form 1-A and amend Form 20-F.
The Commission originally requested that comments on the release be received by
August 26, 2016. The Commission has received requests for an extension of time for public
comment on the proposal to, among other things, allow for a more complete assessment of the
numerous provisions of the proposed rules, including a fuller consideration of their implications,
and to improve the quality of responses. 1 The Commission believes that providing the public
additional time to consider thoroughly the matters addressed by the release and to submit
comprehensive responses to the release would benefit the Commission in its consideration of
final rules. Therefore, the Commission is extending the comment period for Release Nos. 3310098 and 34-78086, “Modernization of Property Disclosures for Mining Registrants,” until
September 26, 2016.
By the Commission.
Dated: August 23, 2016

Brent J. Fields
Secretary.
