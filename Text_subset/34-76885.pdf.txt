ENTRY OF INJUNCTION

2.
On December 22, 2015, an order of injunction was entered by default
against RAHFCO, permanently enjoining it from future violations of Section 17(a) of the
Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Exchange Act, Rule 10b-5 thereunder,
Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, in the civil
action entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Randal Kent Hansen, et al., Civil Action
Number 13-cv-1403-VSB, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York.
3.
The Commission’s complaint alleged that, from at least April 2007 through
May 2011, RAHFCO, as the general partner of the RAHFCO Hedge Funds, engaged in a scheme
to defraud investors, the primary function of which was to convince investors to invest in
fraudulent pooled investments that purportedly traded in options and futures on the S&P 500 Index
and in equities, and then siphon off the invested funds for the defendants’ own purposes. In
furtherance of the scheme, RAHFCO manipulated an accounting firm into ostensibly verifying
false account statements and tax documents to investors, made Ponzi payments to evade detection,
and made numerous false and misleading statements. In connection with the scheme, RAHFCO
and others convinced approximately 100 individuals nationwide to invest over $23 million in the
RAHFCO Hedge Funds.
III.
In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission deems it
necessary and appropriate in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be instituted
to determine:
A.
Whether the allegations set forth in Section II hereof are true and, in connection
therewith, to afford Respondent an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations;
B.
What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against Respondent
pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act;
C.
What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against Respondent
pursuant to Section 203(e) of the Advisers Act; and
IV.
IT IS ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on the questions
set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a time and place to be fixed, and before an
Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 of the
Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.110.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent shall file an Answer to the allegations
contained in this Order within twenty (20) days after service of this Order, as provided by Rule 220
of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.220.
If Respondent fails to file the directed answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after being duly
notified, the Respondent may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be determined against
him upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true as
provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f) and 310 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R.
§§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f) and 201.310.
This Order shall be served forthwith upon Respondent as provided for in the Commission’s
Rules of Practice.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an initial
decision no later than 210 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2) of
the Commission’s Rules of Practice.
In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission engaged
in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually related
proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, except as witness
or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice. Since this proceeding is not “rule making” within
the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not deemed subject to the
provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of any final Commission action.

For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Secretary
