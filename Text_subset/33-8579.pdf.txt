SUMMARY

This matter involves financial reporting fraud in connection with Huntington’s financial
statements included in the annual reports the Bank filed with the Commission for fiscal years 2001
and 2002 in violation of Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act.3 In both years,
Huntington reported inflated earnings in its financial statements, enabling the Bank to meet or exceed
Wall Street analyst earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations and to meet internal EPS targets (“Target
EPS”) that determined the bonuses of senior management. Using improper accounting that was
qualitatively material, Huntington overstated 2001 operating earnings by $8.5 million ($.04 per share)
and 2002 operating earnings by $17.1 million ($.08 per share). Without the misstatements,
Huntington’s earnings would have fallen short of analyst operating earnings expectations in both years
and in 2002 bonuses for Hoaglin and McMennamin, the Bank’s CEO and CFO, respectively, would
have been eliminated and the bonus for Van Fleet, the Bank’s controller, would have been reduced. In
2001 and 2002, Huntington offered and sold securities pursuant to Forms S-3 and S-8 registration
statements filed with the Commission under the Securities Act. The registration statements
incorporated by reference materially misleading reports filed under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 13a-1 thereunder containing the above-described overstatements of earnings.
Beginning in August 2002 and continuing through January 15, 2003, Huntington conducted
seven due diligence meetings for the purpose of addressing financial reporting and accounting issues
relevant to the certification of financial statements by Hoaglin and McMennamin, as required by the
Commission under its order dated June 27, 2002 and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Act”), 15
U.S.C. §§ 7201 et seq. The Act required Hoaglin and McMennamin, the Bank’s signing officers, to
each certify that he had reviewed the financial reports at issue and that the statements of material fact
contained therein were true, that no statement of material fact had been omitted, and that, based on
such officer’s knowledge, the financial statements and other financial information included in the
report fairly presented in all material respects the financial condition and results of operations of
Huntington. Van Fleet, in consultation with outside counsel, initiated this due diligence process.
On or about March 20, 2003, following the due diligence meetings, Hoaglin and
McMennamin signed and certified Huntington’s 2002 Annual Report on Form 10-K under the
provisions of the Act. At that time, Hoaglin and McMennamin signed and certified the 2002
Form 10-K, which contained untrue statements of material fact and omitted to state material facts
necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
were made, not misleading.
In connection with the 2001 and 2002 annual reports filed with the Commission and
disseminated to the public, Huntington engaged in improper accounting practices, enabling it to
meet or exceed analysts’ expectations and to pay incentive based bonuses. Those practices included
up front recognition of loan and lease origination fees that were required by accounting rules to be
deferred and amortized over the term of the loan or lease; improper capitalization of commission
expenses and deferral of pension costs which were required to be recognized in the period incurred;
misstated reserves; improper deferral of income; and misclassification of non-operating income as
operating income. As a result of its accounting misstatements, Huntington overstated 2001

operating earnings of $293.5 million by $8.5 million ($.04 per share) and 2002 operating earnings of
$328.5 by $17.1 million ($.08 per share). Had it not been for the accounting misstatements,
Huntington’s reported operating EPS for 2001 and 2002 would have been $1.13 and $1.27,
respectively, short of Wall Street analyst expectations and senior management’s EPS bonus targets,
instead of the $1.17 operating EPS it actually reported for 2001 and the $1.35 operating EPS reported
for 2002.
As a consequence of these actions, Huntington violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of
the Securities Act and Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules
12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder. With respect to fiscal year 2002, Hoaglin, as Chief Executive
Officer, caused Huntington’s violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Sections
13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder and
directly violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-14. McMennamin and Van Fleet violated Sections
17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2­
1 thereunder, and caused Huntington’s violations of Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of
the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder, and McMennamin directly violated
Exchange Act Rule 13a-14.

FACTS
1.

Overview of Accounting Principles

The SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99 (“SAB 99”), issued in August 1999, states
that qualitative factors may cause a misstatement of an item in a financial statement of a
quantitatively small amount to be material, including, particularly relevant to Huntington,
whether the misstatement hides a failure to meet analysts’ consensus expectations and whether
the misstatement has the effect of increasing management’s compensation by satisfying
requirements for the award of bonuses or other forms of incentive compensation.
During 2001 and 2002, Huntington failed to account for fees received in connection with
the origination of automobile lease financing and loans, in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”), as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 91, Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs Associated with Originating or Acquiring
Loans and Initial Direct Costs of Leases (“FAS 91”). FAS 91 requires that “[l]oan origination
fees shall be deferred and recognized over the life of the loan as an adjustment of yield (interest
income)” unless the difference between this method and an alternative accounting treatment is
not material. Contrary to this requirement, beginning in 1997, with the concurrence of its outside
auditors, Huntington recognized all such fees as income in the period received.
During 2001 and 2002, Huntington also improperly deferred, rather than expensed, sales
commissions paid to Bank employees for obtaining certain new deposit accounts. Under GAAP,
as stated in ¶ 86b of Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 5, Recognition and
Measurement in Financial Statements of Business Enterprises, “[m]any expenses, such as selling
and administrative salaries, are recognized during the period in which cash is spent or liabilities
are incurred for goods and services that are used up either simultaneously with acquisition or
soon after.” Huntington began this practice in 1997, with the concurrence of its outside auditors.

- 4 -


In 2002, Huntington changed its method of accounting for pension settlement costs from
immediately expensing the cost in the period incurred to deferring the cost and amortizing it over
approximately eight years. This accounting change was not disclosed in the Bank’s financial
statements. Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 20, states:
The Board concludes that in the preparation of financial statements
there is a presumption that an accounting principle once adopted
should not be changed in accounting for events and transactions of
a similar type. Consistent use of accounting principles from one
accounting period to another enhances the utility of financial
statements to users by facilitating analysis and understanding of
comparative accounting data ... the presumption that an entity
should not change an accounting principle may be overcome only
if the enterprise justifies the use of an alternative acceptable
accounting principle on the basis that it is preferable ... the nature
of and justification for a change in accounting principle and its
effect on income should be disclosed in the financial statements of
the period in which the change is made. The justification for the
change should explain clearly why the newly adopted accounting
principle is preferable.
Huntington did not justify or explain why its newly adopted accounting method for pension
settlement costs was preferable in its 2002 financial statements.
Huntington historically maintained a “leakage reserve” in its financial statements to cover
uninsured losses incurred when the decline in value of leased automobiles at lease expiration
exceeded expectations. For the first time, at year-end 2002, the Bank discounted the reserve
under a present value concept, in violation of GAAP. FAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies,
contains the relevant standards for accruing probable losses, such as Huntington’s leakage
reserve. FAS 5 requires that, “[a]n estimated loss from a loss contingency … shall be accrued by
a charge to income” if it is probable that a liability had been incurred and the amount of loss can
be reasonably estimated. FAS 5 does not permit present value techniques to be used to estimate
the range of loss.
2.

The Management Incentive Plan

Huntington’s compensation of its senior management personnel included a bonus
component calculated in accordance with its Management Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). Prior to 2001,
Huntington’s senior officer bonuses were determined by corporate performance as measured by return
on shareholder equity. In 2001, the Compensation Committee, based on Hoaglin’s
recommendation, changed the Plan for Group 1 participants to a single benchmark: EPS. In 2001,
under the Plan, bonuses were triggered if specific EPS targets were met: EPS of $1.15 for the
minimum bonus, $1.18 for the target bonus, and $1.25 or above for the maximum bonus (with
differing amounts due at each cent of differential earnings within those ranges). Although
Hoaglin was a Group 1 participant in 2001, under his employment contract he was guaranteed a
minimum bonus of $420,000 for that year. In 2001, while other performance based factors also
affected the bonuses of McMennamin and Van Fleet, 75% of McMennamin’s bonus and 25% of
Van Fleet’s bonus were based on the EPS targets.
- 5 -


In 2002, Group 1 bonuses were based entirely on meeting EPS targets: EPS of $1.32
for the minimum bonus, $1.35 for the target bonus, and $1.40 or above for the maximum bonus
(again, with differing amounts due at each cent of differential earnings within those ranges).
That year, bonuses for Hoaglin and McMennamin were based entirely on the EPS targets and
40% of Van Fleet’s bonus was based on the EPS targets.
Under the Plan, Huntington’s Compensation Committee could reduce or eliminate an
award in light of “extraordinary events,” including asset write-downs; litigation or claim
judgments or settlements; the effect of changes in the law, accounting principles or other
provisions affecting reported results; accruals for reorganization and restructuring programs;
capital gains and losses; special charges in connection with mergers and acquisitions; and any
extraordinary, non-recurring items as described in APB No. 30. In 2001, the Compensation
Committee based the EPS component of management bonuses on Huntington’s operating EPS,
excluding approximately $115 million of restructuring and special charges and $14 million in
losses from the sale of the Bank’s Florida operations from the bonus computations. In 2002,
according to a memorandum from Hoaglin dated March 29, 2002 summarizing the plan for
beneficiaries, “any special charges or significant accounting rule changes that occur in 2002, will
neither benefit nor negatively effect the [EPS] calculation under this plan….” In 2002, the
Compensation Committee again based the EPS aspect of management bonuses strictly on the
Bank’s operating EPS, excluding approximately $73 million in gains (realized from the sale of
Florida operations and Huntington’s merchant services business) and approximately $38 million
in losses (recorded for restructuring and special charges) from the bonus computations.
3.

Huntington’s Earnings Guidance to the Public

In both 2001 and 2002, Huntington released predictions to analysts and the public for
expected “operating earnings” for the year. The guidance was reviewed and revised in quarterly
earnings announcements and analyst calls. Based in part on these predictions, Wall Street
analysts estimated what they believed would be Huntington’s operating EPS. The average of the
estimates of the analysts was commonly referred to as the “consensus estimate.” In July 2001,
after Hoaglin became CEO, Huntington estimated operating EPS of $1.15 to $1.17 for the 2001
year. The analyst consensus operating EPS estimate for 2001 was $1.17 per share. In a January
2002 press release, Huntington announced it anticipated 2002 EPS of $1.32 to $1.36 per share. In
April 2002 and again in July 2002, Hoaglin told the public that he was comfortable with the
previous guidance. On October 17, 2002, in discussing Huntington’s quarterly numbers on a
conference call, Hoaglin said that Huntington expected EPS of $.34 to $.35 for the fourth
quarter. The analyst consensus estimate for the fourth quarter was $.35 per share and $1.33 for
the full year 2002.

Huntington's 2001 Form 10-K

Pursuant to FAS 91, the Bank was required to recognize loan and lease origination fees
and costs over the life of the loan or lease unless the difference between this method and an
alternative method was not material. Despite the materiality of the difference in method, the
Bank recognized the fees as income in the period received and deferred the associated costs. In

- 6 -


1997, before Hoaglin and McMennamin joined the Bank and before Van Fleet became controller
at the Bank, Huntington changed its historical practice, which complied with FAS 91, and began
recognizing origination fees as income entirely in the period received while deferring the related
costs paid to automobile dealers for placing leases with Huntington. Huntington continued its
improper non-GAAP accounting for loan and lease origination fees and costs in 2001 and 2002.
Huntington’s disclosure of its accounting policy for origination costs and fees in its 2001
Form 10-K at Note 1 to the financial statements stated “[n]et direct loan origination costs/fees,
when material, are deferred and amortized over the term of the loan as a yield adjustment.”
However, until August 2002, Huntington failed to determine whether the difference between its
changed accounting treatment of loan and lease origination fees and the treatment required under
FAS 91 was material, and deferred no loan origination fees at all in 2002.
Beginning about 1997, Huntington also changed its historical practice of expensing
sales commissions paid to employees for originating deposit accounts in the year paid, and began
amortizing them over the expected life of the accounts. Although not specifically addressed in
the accounting pronouncements, it is a generally accepted accounting practice to expense sales
commissions in the period paid. Huntington continued this improper non-GAAP practice in
2001 and 2002.
Huntington learned in the fourth quarter of 2001 that it had a gain resulting from an
increase in the cash surrender value of certain bank owned insurance life insurance (“BOLI”) on
the lives of key bank officers, of which the Bank was beneficiary. In November 2001,
McMennamin recommended to Hoaglin that, rather than recognizing the gain in that period,
Huntington “save it” for 2002, because Huntington would meet the street earnings consensus
EPS estimates in 2001 without the gain. Accordingly, Huntington improperly postponed
recognition of the 2001 gain to 2002. This accounting item was never discussed or reviewed at
any of the 2002 due diligence meetings.
5.

Impact of 2001 Accounting Misstatements on Operating Earnings and EPS

Huntington’s 2001 accounting misstatements increased its operating earnings in 2001 and
enabled it to meet analyst consensus estimates of $1.17 per share. The extent of the
misstatements on earnings and EPS is set forth in the table below:

The 2002 Earnings Initiative

McMennamin prepared Full Year Forecasts (“FYF”) to track operating earnings and EPS.
The FYF prepared for January 2002 revealed that earnings were anticipated to be materially less
than the guidance Hoaglin and McMennamin had given analysts. McMennamin prepared a
memorandum dated March 17, 2002, entitled “2002 Earnings Initiative,” summarizing the
earnings to date and the projections for the rest of 2002. The memorandum made clear that first
quarter EPS of $.28, was short of the $.31 EPS guidance previously given to analysts and that
substantial additional initiatives would be needed in order to meet analyst earnings expectations
for the year. McMennamin recommended to Hoaglin that the Bank revise its earnings guidance
to disclose the lower than projected earnings. Thereafter, the Bank made a series of accounting
adjustments, eliminating the forecast of earnings shortfall and allowing Huntington to report to
investors and analysts that first quarter operating EPS were $.31 as projected.
7.

The 2002 CEO/CFO Certification Due Diligence Meetings

On July 26, 2002, Huntington’s outside counsel sent a memorandum to Hoaglin,
McMennamin, Van Fleet, and other Huntington executives, addressing the certification
requirements ordered by the SEC in June 2002. The memorandum lays out the materiality
requirements specified by SAB 99 and states that to determine materiality of an accounting
misstatement or omission required the Bank to consider qualitative factors, including whether the
impact of the accounting misstatements or omissions affected executive compensation or hid a
failure to meet analyst consensus expectations.
On August 4, 2002, senior executives from Huntington began a series of “due diligence”
meetings in anticipation of the signing and filing of the certifications by Hoaglin and
McMennamin, as the Bank’s CEO and CFO, respectively. McMennamin, Van Fleet, and senior
members of Huntington’s legal department attended the August 4, 2002 meeting as did the
Bank’s outside audit senior manager and Huntington’s outside counsel. The senior executives in
attendance were cognizant of the qualitative as well as quantitative standards for determining
materiality, as described in the memorandum from outside counsel dated July 26, 2002. The
consensus was that the only possibly relevant SAB 99 qualitative materiality factor was whether
the item under consideration concerned a segment or other portion of business that had been
identified as playing a significant role in the Bank’s operations or profitability as it related to the
potential impact of FAS 91 on the accounting treatment of loan and lease acquisition fees.
An additional due diligence meeting was held on August 8, 2002 to follow up on the FAS
91 issues. The senior managers, executives and others in attendance, including the Bank’s
outside audit engagement partner, decided that the FAS 91 issues, including the issue related to
deposit commissions, were not material either individually or in the aggregate. Additional due
diligence meetings were held on August 12, and then in October 2002, November 2002, and
- 8 -


January 2003. Each of the aforementioned accounting misstatements made by Huntington that
had the effect of overstating operating earnings, other than its failure to properly recognize the
gain on the increase in the value of BOLI in 2001 rather than 2002, was discussed at the due
diligence meetings. In the final due diligence meeting held on January 15, 2003, which Hoaglin,
McMennamin, Van Fleet, senior members of Huntington’s legal department, and the Bank’s
outside auditor all attended, the group reviewed each of the accounting misstatements (other than
BOLI) and decided that none of the items was material. However, the senior executives of the
Bank failed to follow the procedures for determining materiality under SAB 99 provided by
Huntington’s outside counsel. At the time of their participation in the due diligence meetings,
Hoaglin, McMennamin, and Van Fleet all knew or should have known the impact the accounting
misstatements had on bonuses and the Bank’s ability to meet analyst expectations.
8.

Huntington’s 2002 Form 10-K

In 2002, the Bank continued the non-GAAP accounting practice of recording as income
in the period received the entire amount of loan and lease origination fees and deferring the costs
associated with those fees. In 2002, Huntington continued its non-GAAP accounting practice of
capitalizing and amortizing the costs of deposit commissions rather than expensing the costs in
the period paid. Huntington also improperly recognized as income in 2002 the gain resulting
from the increase in the cash surrender value of BOLI that the Bank had realized in 2001.
In October 2002, Huntingon’s pension actuary advised Van Fleet that there would be a
pension settlement loss of $3.4 million. After conferring with the Bank’s outside auditors, who
concluded that the change was not inappropriate and was not sufficiently material to require
disclosure, McMennamin and Van Fleet changed the Bank’s accounting method from expensing
the loss in the period incurred to deferring the loss and amortizing it against income over eight
years, thereby increasing Huntington’s 2002 reported after-tax earnings by $2.2 million, or one
cent per share. Even though qualitatively material, the accounting change was not disclosed in
Huntington’s 2002 financial statements as required by GAAP. Huntington failed to apply its
accounting policy for pension settlement costs consistently from year to year and failed to
disclose in its financial statements, as required by APB No. 20, the nature of and justification for
its change in accounting principle, and the effect on income.
Just before Huntington’s books were closed on January 4, 2003, they reflected operating
EPS of $1.338, short of Huntington’s internal operating EPS target of $1.35. That same day,
Van Fleet directed the Assistant Controller to release $2.2 million from a previously analyzed
restructuring reserve ($1.4 million on an after tax basis), thereby increasing earnings per share by
$.008 and boosting full year operating earnings per share to $1.346. That number was rounded
up to $1.35, precisely the target operating EPS. Although the amount of the reduction in the
reserve may have been appropriate, Huntington improperly reported the $2.2 million reserve
reversal as operating income in its financial statements even though the reserves established in
2001 and 2002 had been recorded as non-operating special charges. The misclassification
allowed Huntington to meet its target EPS of $1.35 per share and materially affected senior
management bonuses.

- 9 -


Each quarter, Huntington and its risk management group estimated a “leakage reserve” to
cover uninsured losses incurred when the decline in value of leased automobiles at lease
expiration exceeded the insured value. Historically, the reserve was set within the range
estimated by the Bank’s risk management group. On January 6, 2003, Huntington’s risk
management group completed its analysis of the reserve, estimating it to range from $22.9 to
$33.26 million. Setting the reserve at $22.9 million, the low end of that range, would have
required Huntington to record an expense of $2.7 million (the difference between the $22.9
million and the then balance on the books of $20.2 million), which would have reduced
Huntington’s operating earnings on an after tax basis by $1.8 million, or one cent per share. Van
Fleet was advised that on a present value basis the low end of the range for the reserve would be
approximately $21.2 million. Van Fleet used this information to prepare a schedule given to the
January 15 due diligence participants, which showed that using a 5% discount rate, the present
value of the estimated range for the leakage reserve ranged from $21.2 million to $30.8 million.
The Bank had never before discounted the reserve in this manner. The book balance of $20.2
million, which was still $1 million less than the amount calculated improperly using the present
value analysis remained unchanged. By failing to adjust its books and records and financial
statements to properly reflect the calculated reserve, Huntington violated GAAP. Hoaglin, who
received a copy of the January 11 meeting minutes and attended the January 15 meeting at which
the issue was discussed, and McMennamin and Van Fleet, who attended both meetings, all knew
about the misstatement before the 2002 Form 10-K was filed. By failing to make the adjustment,
Huntington overstated its 2002 operating earnings by $1.8 million, or one cent per share.

Impact of 2002 Accounting Misstatements on Operating Earnings and EPS

In 2002, the accounting misstatements enabled Huntington to report operating earnings
per share of $1.35, beating consensus analyst estimates for 2002 by $.02 and precisely meeting
Target EPS bonus levels. The impact of the misstatements on earnings and earnings per share is

The November 14, 2003 Restatement

On July 17, 2003, Huntington issued a press release announcing a series of voluntary
steps in reaction to the Commission’s investigation, including a decision to restate its earnings to
address certain accounting issues. On November 14, 2003 Huntington filed an amended Form
10-K with the Commission which restated its 2001 and 2002 earnings. The restatement
corrected the improper accounting for loan and lease origination fees and costs, commission
expenses, pension settlement costs, and officer’s life insurance gain.

Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 231-32 (1988). Establishing violations of Sections 17(a)(2)
and 17(a)(3) does not require a showing of scienter. Aaron v. SEC, 446 U.S. 680, 697 (1980).
Under SAB 99, misstatements in financial statements of even a small magnitude may be material
depending on the surrounding facts and circumstances. See Ganino v. Citizens Utilities Co., 228
F.3d 154, 162-64 (2d Cir. 2000) (rejecting holding that 1.7% overstatement of revenues was
immaterial as a matter of law). And SAB 99 notes that materiality is defined in qualitative as
well as quantitative terms and states that accounting adjustments that affect executive
compensation or hide a failure to meet analyst consensus expectations may be material.
Moreover, materiality of misstatements in financial statements can be established by subsequent
corrective accounting action (such as a restatement). See In re Peritus Software Services, Inc.
Securities Litigation, 52 F. Supp.2d 211, 223 (D. Mass. 1999). Form 10-K requires included
financial statements to contain the information required by Regulation S-X, which in turn
provides that financial statements in Commission filings that do not comply with GAAP are
presumed misleading. See Regulation S-X, 17 C.F.R. Section 210.4-01(a)(1).
Huntington, McMennamin, and Van Fleet violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of
the Securities Act in 2001 and 2002. Hoaglin caused Huntington’s 2002 violation of Section
17(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Huntington’s November 14, 2003 amended Form 10-K restated
its financial condition at December 31, 2002 and 2001 and its results of operations for each of
the three years ended December 31, 2002 to (1) apply on a retroactive basis, deferral accounting
for loan and lease origination fees and costs as required under FAS 91; (2) correct for the errors
in deferring fees paid to originate deposits; (3) recognize the gain on BOLI in 2001 rather than

- 11 -


2002; and (4) recognize the $2.2 million pension settlement cost in 2002. Huntington’s
restatements are admissions of material errors in violation of GAAP, which requires restatement
only for material financial misstatements. In addition to the four restated items, Huntington
misstated a special non-operating reserve for restructuring its Florida banking and insurance
operations, and its auto residual value or “leakage reserve,” enabling the Company to meet
analysts’ expectations and triggering executive bonuses. All of Huntington’s accounting
adjustments were qualitatively material misstatements. All of the accounting adjustments
directly or indirectly increased reported income during a period by causing improper recording
of revenue or deferring of expenses. Huntington’s decisions to improperly recognize revenue
and defer expenses, fail to disclose changes in accounting methods, and misclassify earnings
enabled the Bank to meet or exceed analysts’ expectations and increase management bonuses.
Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13a-1 thereunder require all issuers with
securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file annual reports. Exchange Act
Rule 12b-20 further requires that, in addition to the information expressly required to be included
in such reports, the issuer must include such additional material information as may be necessary
to make the required statements, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The obligation to file these periodic reports includes the obligation that they be
complete and accurate in all material respects. See, e.g., SEC v. Savoy Indus., Inc., 587 F.2d
1149, 1165 (D.C. Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 913 (1979); United States v. Bilzerian, 926
F.2d 1285, 1298 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 813 (1991). No showing of scienter is
necessary to establish a violation of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 12b­
20. See Savoy Indus., Inc., 587 F.2d at 1167; SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250, 1268 (D.D.C.
1978). Rule 13a-1 requires the filing of annual reports that comply with the Commission’s
Regulation S-X, which requires that financial statements be presented in conformity with GAAP.
Huntington violated Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20
and 13a-1 by incorporating materially false and misleading financial statements in its annual
reports for 2001 and 2002. The financial statements were false and misleading because they
were not presented in conformity with GAAP. The financial statements improperly recognized
loan and lease origination fees as income, improperly capitalized commission expenses,
improperly deferred pension costs, misstated reserves, improperly deferred income, and
misclassified non-operating income, enabling the Company to meet analysts’ expectations and
triggering management bonuses for Hoaglin, McMennamin, Van Fleet, and others. By engaging
in the conduct described above, McMennamin and Van Fleet caused Huntington’s 2001 and
2002 violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder
and Hoaglin caused Huntington’s 2002 violations of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and
Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder.
Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to “make and keep books,
records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the issuer.” Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act requires
issuers to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain the accountability of assets. No
showing of scienter is necessary to establish a violation of Section 13(b)(2)(A) or 13(b)(2)(B).

See SEC v. World-Wide Coin Investments, Ltd., 567 F. Supp. 724, 749-51 (N.D. Ga. 1983).
Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act prohibits any person from knowingly circumventing or
knowingly failing to implement a system of internal accounting controls or knowingly falsifying
any book, record, or account required to be made and kept by Section 13(b)(2) of the Exchange
Act. Rule 13b2-1 prohibits any person from directly or indirectly falsifying or causing to be
falsified any book, record, or account subject to Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act.
Huntington violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) in 2001 and 2002 by failing to maintain
sufficient internal accounting controls. In 2001 and 2002, McMennamin and Van Fleet violated
Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder and caused Huntington’s
violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act. Hoaglin caused Huntington’s
violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act in 2002.
Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act requires an issuer’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer to certify the financial information contained in the issuer’s quarterly and
annual reports. Huntington’s CEO and CFO, Hoaglin and McMennamin, violated Exchange Act
Rule 13a-14 by certifying to the Commission that Huntington’s Form 10-K for 2002: (1) was
complete and accurate; (2) fairly presented the financial condition of Huntington; and (3) did not
contain any untrue statements. The certifications were inaccurate because, as discussed above,
the report contained material misstatements and omissions, the financial statements did not fairly
present Huntington’s true financial condition, and the procedures utilized by Huntington in
support of the certifications were deficient.
Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that: (i) Huntington violated Section
17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act and Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the
Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder; (ii) Hoaglin caused Huntington’s
violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of
the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder; (iii) McMennamin and Van Fleet
violated Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange
Act, and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder and caused Huntington’s violations of Sections 13(a) and
13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder; (iv) Hoaglin
and McMennamin violated Exchange Act Rule 13a-14; and (v) Van Fleet willfully4 violated
Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act, Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, and
Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.
E.

UNDERTAKING

McMennamin undertakes and agrees that for a period of five years from the date of the
issuance of the Order that he will not act as an officer or director of any issuer that has a class of
securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78(l)] or that is
required to file reports pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78o(d)]. In

4

“Willfully” as used in this Order means intentionally committing the act that constitutes the violation. See
Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Tager v. SEC, 344 F.2d 5, 8 (2d Cir. 1965). There is no
requirement that the actor also be aware that he or she is violating one of the Rules or Acts.

undertaking.

I.
It is also Ordered, pursuant to Rule 102(e)(1) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice that
Respondent Van Fleet is denied the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission
as an accountant.
J.
After two years from the date of this order, Respondent Van Fleet may request that the
Commission consider his reinstatement by submitting an application (attention: Office of the
Chief Accountant) to resume appearing or practicing before the Commission as:
1.
a preparer or reviewer, or a person responsible for the preparation or
review, of any public company’s financial statements that are filed with the Commission. Such
an application must satisfy the Commission that Respondent’s work in his practice before the
Commission will be reviewed either by the independent audit committee of the public company

- 15 -


for which he works or in some other acceptable manner, as long as he practices before the
Commission in this capacity; and/or
2.
Commission that:

an independent accountant. Such an application must satisfy the

(a)
Respondent Van Fleet, or the public accounting firm with which he
is associated, is registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“Board”) in
accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and such registration continues to be effective;
(b)
Respondent Van Fleet, or the registered public accounting firm
with which he is associated, has been inspected by the Board and that inspection did not identify
any criticisms of or potential defects in the respondent’s or the firm’s quality control system that
would indicate that the respondent will not receive appropriate supervision or, if the Board has
not conducted an inspection, has received an unqualified report relating to his, or the firm’s, most
recent peer review conducted in accordance with the guidelines adopted by the former SEC
Practice Section of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Division for CPA
Firms or an organization providing equivalent oversight and quality control functions;
(c)
Respondent Van Fleet has resolved all disciplinary issues with the
Board, and has complied with all terms and conditions of any sanctions imposed by the Board
(other than reinstatement by the Commission); and
(d)
Respondent Van Fleet acknowledges his responsibility, as long as
Respondent appears or practices before the Commission as an independent accountant, to
comply with all requirements of the Commission and the Board, including, but not limited to, all
requirements relating to registration, inspections, concurring partner reviews and quality control
standards.
K.
The Commission will consider an application by Respondent Van Fleet to resume
appearing or practicing before the Commission provided that his state CPA license is current and
he has resolved all other disciplinary issues with the applicable state boards of accountancy.
However, if state licensure is dependant on reinstatement by the Commission, the Commission
will consider an application on its other merits. The Commission’s review may include
consideration of, in addition to the matters referenced above, any other matters relating to
Respondent Van Fleet’s character, integrity, professional conduct, or qualifications to appear or
practice before the Commission.
L.
There shall be, pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, a Fair
Fund established for the funds described in Section IV.
By the Commission.
