Exemptions to Facilitate Intrastate and Regional Securities Offerings
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Final rules.
SUMMARY: We are adopting amendments to modernize Rule 147 under the Securities Act of
1933, which provides a safe harbor for compliance with the Section 3(a)(11) exemption from
registration for intrastate securities offerings. We are also establishing a new intrastate offering
exemption under the Securities Act, designated Rule 147A, which will be similar to amended
Rule 147, but will have no restriction on offers and will allow issuers to be incorporated or
organized outside of the state in which the intrastate offering is conducted provided certain
conditions are met. The amendments to Rule 147 and new Rule 147A are designed to facilitate
capital formation, including through offerings relying upon intrastate crowdfunding provisions
under state securities laws, while maintaining appropriate investor protections and providing
state securities regulators with the flexibility to add additional investor protections they deem
appropriate for offerings within their state.
We also are adopting amendments to Rule 504 of Regulation D under the Securities Act
to facilitate issuers’ capital raising efforts and provide additional investor protections. The
amendments to Rule 504 will increase the aggregate amount of securities that may be offered
and sold in any twelve-month period from $1 million to $5 million and disqualify certain bad

1

actors from participation in Rule 504 offerings. In light of these amendments to Rule 504, we
are also repealing Rule 505.
DATES: Amended Rule 147 and new Rule 147A will be effective on [INSERT DAY 150
DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER]. Amended Rule
504 will be effective on [INSERT DAY 60 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE
FEDERAL REGISTER]. The repeal of Rule 505 will be effective on [INSERT DAY 180
DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER]. Comments
regarding the collection of information requirements within the meaning of the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1995 should be received on or before [INSERT DAY 60 DAYS AFTER
DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER].
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: With regard to the final rules, Anthony G.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
On October 30, 2015, we proposed amendments to Rule 147 and Rule 504 under the

Securities Act to assist smaller companies with capital formation consistent with other public
policy goals, including investor protection. 6 In developing final rules, we considered
recommendations by the Advisory Committee on Small and Emerging Companies (“ACSEC”) 7
and the most recent SEC Government-Business Forum on Small Business Capital Formation
(“Small Business Forum”) 8 and comment letters received on the Proposing Release. 9 Today we
are amending Rule 147 and establishing a new Securities Act exemption, designated Rule 147A.
We are also amending Rule 504 of Regulation D. We believe the final rules will facilitate capital
formation by smaller companies by increasing the utility of the current Securities Act exemptive

to Modernize Rule 147 under the Securities Act of 1933 (Sept. 23, 2015) (“2015 ACSEC
Recommendation”), available at http://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/acsec/acsec-recommendationmodernize-rule-147.pdf. The Commission established the ACSEC in 2011 with the objective of providing
the Commission with advice on its rules, regulations and policies with regard to its mission of protecting
investors, maintaining fair, orderly and efficient markets and facilitating capital formation, as they relate to:
(1) capital raising by emerging privately-held small businesses (emerging companies) and publicly traded
companies with less than $250 million in public market capitalization (smaller public companies) through
securities offerings, including private and limited offerings and initial and other public offerings; (2)
trading in the securities of emerging companies and smaller public companies; and (3) public reporting and
corporate governance requirements of emerging companies and smaller public companies. Advisory
Committee on Small and Emerging Companies, SEC Rel. No. 33-9258 (Sept. 12, 2011) [76 FR 57769

See Final Report of the 2015 SEC Government Business Forum on Small Business Capital Formation
(April 2016) (“2015 Small Business Forum Recommendations”), available at
http://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/gbfor34.pdf. The Small Business Investment Incentive Act of 1980
directed the Commission to conduct an annual government-business forum to undertake an ongoing review
of the financing problems of small businesses. 15 U.S.C. 80c-1. The Small Business Forum has met
annually since 1982 to provide a platform to highlight perceived unnecessary impediments to small
business capital formation and address whether they can be eliminated or reduced. Each forum seeks to
develop recommendations for government and private action to improve the environment for small
business capital formation, consistent with other public policy goals, including investor protection.
Information about the Small Business Forum is available at
http://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/sbforum.shtml.

framework for smaller offerings while maintaining appropriate protections for investors. The
final rules complement recent efforts by the U.S. Congress, 10 state legislatures, 11 and state
securities regulators 12 to modernize existing federal and state securities laws and regulations to
assist smaller companies with capital formation. We believe our amendment to Rule 504 to
increase its aggregate offering ceiling from $1 million to $5 million will significantly diminish
the utility of Rule 505 and we are therefore repealing that rule.
Consistent with commenters’ suggestions 13 and the recommendations of the 2015 Small
Business Forum, 14 we are retaining and modernizing Rule 147 under the Securities Act as a safe

Congress enacted the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”), which was signed into
law by President Obama on April 5, 2012. Pub. L. No. 112-106, 126 Stat. 306. Pursuant to Title II of the
JOBS Act, the Commission adopted new paragraph (c) of Rule 506 of Regulation D, removing the
prohibition on general solicitation or general advertising for securities offerings relying on Rule 506. See
SEC Rel. No. 33-9415 (July 10, 2013). Pursuant to Title IV of the JOBS Act, the Commission amended
Regulation A in order to permit issuers to raise up to $50 million annually. See SEC Rel. No. 33-9741
(Mar. 25, 2015) (“2015 Regulation A Release”). Pursuant to Title III of the JOBS Act, the Commission
adopted rules permitting companies to use the Internet to offer and sell securities through crowdfunding
(“Regulation Crowdfunding”). See SEC Rel. No. 33-9974 (Oct. 30, 2015) (“Regulation Crowdfunding
Adopting Release”). Congress also enacted the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act of 2015
(“FAST Act”), which was signed into law by President Obama on December 4, 2015. Pub. L. No. 114-94,
Sec 129 Stat. 1312 (2015). The FAST Act includes several amendments to the federal securities laws,
including a new exemption to Section 4 of the Securities Act for secondary sales of securities that are
purchased by an accredited investor, among other requirements (Section 76001), and changes to facilitate
initial public offerings by emerging growth companies (Sections 71001 through 71003).

harbor for intrastate offerings exempt from registration pursuant to Securities Act Section
3(a)(11). These amendments will modernize the safe harbor, while keeping within the statutory
parameters of Section 3(a)(11), so that issuers may continue to rely upon the rule for offerings
pursuant to state law exemptions, including crowdfunding provisions, that are conditioned upon
compliance with Section 3(a)(11) and Rule 147.
Securities Act Section 3(a)(11) provides an exemption from registration under the
Securities Act for “[a]ny security which is part of an issue offered and sold only to persons
resident within a single State or Territory, where the issuer of such security is a person resident
and doing business within, or, if a corporation, incorporated by and doing business within, such
State or Territory.” 15 In 1974, the Commission adopted Rule 147 under the Securities Act to
provide objective standards for local businesses seeking to rely on Section 3(a)(11). 16 The
Rule 147 safe harbor was intended to provide assurances that the intrastate offering exemption
would be used for the purpose Congress intended in enacting Section 3(a)(11), namely the local

financing of companies by investors within the company’s state or territory. 17 Rule 147 reflects
this Congressional intent and generally relies upon state regulation to effectively protect
investors.
Notwithstanding the importance of these limitations, due to developments in modern
business practices and communications technology in the years since Rule 147 was adopted, we
have determined that it is necessary to update the requirements of Rule 147 to ensure its
continued utility. 18 We are also establishing a new intrastate offering exemption under the
Securities Act, designated Rule 147A, that will further accommodate modern business practices
and communications technology and provide an alternative means for smaller companies to raise
capital locally.
We are adopting new Rule 147A pursuant to our general exemptive authority under
Section 28 of the Securities Act, 19 and therefore, new Rule 147A will not be subject to the
statutory limitations of Section 3(a)(11). Accordingly, Rule 147A will have no restriction on
offers, but will require that all sales be made only to residents of the issuer’s state or territory to
ensure the intrastate nature of the exemption. Rule 147A also will not require issuers to be
incorporated or organized in the same state or territory where the offering occurs so long as
issuers can demonstrate the in-state nature of their business, which we believe will expand the

The Commission has not amended Rule 147 since its adoption, other than in 2013 when the Commission

Securities Act, which was renumbered as Section 4(a)(2) by Section 201(c) of the JOBS Act, Pub. L. No.

being adopted today is necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of
investors.

number of businesses that will be able to seek intrastate financing under Rule 147A, as compared
to amended Rule 147. Certain provisions of existing Rule 147 concerning legends and
mandatory disclosures to purchasers and prospective purchasers will apply to offerings
conducted pursuant to amended Rule 147 and Rule 147A. 20
As in current Rule 147, nothing in either amended Rule 147 or new Rule 147A will
obviate the need for compliance with any applicable state law relating to the offer and sale of
securities. Thus, states will retain the flexibility to adopt requirements that are consistent with
their respective interests in facilitating capital formation and protecting their resident investors in
intrastate securities offerings, including the authority to impose additional disclosure
requirements regarding offers and sales made to persons within their state or territory, or the
authority to limit the ability of certain bad actors from relying on applicable state exemptions. In
addition, both federal and state antifraud provisions will continue to apply to offers and sales
made pursuant to amended Rule 147 and new Rule 147A.
The staff will seek to collaborate with state regulators in gathering information about
intrastate crowdfunding offerings and, based on the sharing of this information and other relevant
inputs, the staff will undertake to study and submit a report to the Commission, no later than
three years following the effective date of amended Rule 147 and new Rule 147A, on capital
formation and investor protection in offerings under these rules. The report will include, but not
be limited to, a review of information about:
(1) the use of amended Rule 147 and new Rule 147A;
(2) repeat use by the same issuers of amended Rule 147 or new Rule 147A;

20

See Rules 147(f) and 147A(f).

8

(3) the use by issuers of alternative federal offering exemptions concurrently or close in
time to an offer or sale under amended Rule 147 or new Rule 147A;
(4) fraud associated with, or issuer non-compliance with provisions of, amended Rule
147 or new Rule 147A;
(5) the role of intrastate broker-dealers and other intermediaries in offerings conducted
pursuant to amended Rule 147 or new Rule 147A; and
(6) the application of state bad actor disqualification provisions in offerings conducted
pursuant to amended Rule 147 or new Rule 147A to inform whether the Commission should
consider including bad actor disqualification provisions in amended Rule 147 and new Rule
147A.
We also are amending Rule 504 of Regulation D under the Securities Act to increase the
aggregate amount of securities that may be offered and sold pursuant to Rule 504 in any twelvemonth period from $1 million to $5 million and to disqualify certain bad actors from
participation in Rule 504 offerings. The higher offering ceiling amount will promote capital
formation by increasing the flexibility of state securities regulators to implement coordinated
review programs to facilitate regional offerings. 21 The bad actor disqualification provisions will
provide for greater consistency across Regulation D. We believe these amendments to Rule 504

21

The state registration of securities offerings under coordinated review programs is an example of the efforts
being undertaken by states to streamline the state registration process for issuers seeking to undertake
multi-state registrations. These programs establish uniform review standards and are designed to expedite
the registration process, thereby potentially saving issuers time and money. Participation in such programs
is voluntary. The states have created coordinated review protocols for equity, small company and franchise
offerings; direct participation program securities; and for certain offerings of securities pursuant to
Regulation A. More information on coordinated review programs is available at
http://www.nasaa.org/industry-resources/corporation-finance/coordinated-review/.

will significantly diminish the utility of Rule 505, which historically has been little utilized in
comparison to Rule 506 of Regulation D. 22 We, therefore, are repealing Rule 505.

AMENDMENTS TO RULE 147 AND NEW RULE 147A

A.

Explanation of Amendments to Rule 147 and New Rule 147A
Numerous commenters 23 and the 2015 Small Business Forum 24 recommended retaining

Rule 147 as a safe harbor under Section 3(a)(11). Many of these commenters also recommended
adopting a substantially similar new exemption pursuant to the Commission’s general exemptive
authority under Section 28 as an alternative to the Section 3(a)(11) exemption and safe harbor for
companies that wish to conduct intrastate offerings under slightly broader conditions than
contemplated by Section 3(a)(11). After considering the comments, we are amending Rule 147
to modernize the rule to incorporate most of our proposed amendments, except for the two
proposed amendments that do not fit within the statutory limits of Section 3(a)(11)—allowing
issuers to make offers accessible to out-of-state residents and to be incorporated out-of-state.
These two provisions are the distinguishing features of the new Rule 147A exemption that we
are establishing pursuant to our general exemptive authority under Section 28. Aside from these

22

For the period 2009 through 2015, 132,091 Forms D were filed. Of these Forms D, 3,758 reported an
offering made in reliance upon Rule 505 of Regulation D, representing approximately 3% of all offerings
made in reliance upon Regulation D and 5% of all Regulation D offerings raising less than $5 million.
During this time period, 1,548 Forms D reported reliance only on Rule 505, and 2,210 Forms D reported
reliance on Rule 505 and another Regulation D exemption. By contrast, for the period 2009 through 2015,
5,532 filings reported an offering made in reliance upon Rule 504, representing approximately 4% of all
offerings made in reliance upon Regulation D and 13% of all Regulation D offerings raising less than $1
million. During this time period, 4,308 Forms D reported reliance only on Rule 504, and 1,224 Forms D
reported reliance on Rule 504 and another Regulation D exemption. All other Form D filings during this
period reported an offering made in reliance on Rule 506.

two provisions, the remaining provisions of new Rule 147A are substantively the same as the
provisions of amended Rule 147.
1. Manner of Offering
a. Proposed Amendments
Rule 147, as proposed, would have required issuers to limit sales to in-state residents, but
would no longer have limited offers by the issuer to in-state residents. 25 Accordingly, under our
proposal, amended Rule 147 would have permitted issuers to engage in general solicitation and
general advertising that could reach out-of-state residents in order to locate potential in-state
investors using any form of mass media, including unrestricted, publicly-available Internet
websites, to advertise their offerings, so long as all sales of securities so offered were made to
residents of the state or territory in which the issuer has its principal place of business. In the
Proposing Release, the Commission noted that market participants and commenters have
indicated that the combined effect of the statutory limitation on offers in Section 3(a)(11) and the
prescriptive threshold requirements of Rule 147 unduly limits the availability of the exemption
for local companies that would otherwise conduct intrastate offerings. 26
Given that proposed Rule 147 would have allowed offers to be made to or be accessible
by out-of-state residents, including advertising offers on publicly-available Internet websites, the
proposal would have required an issuer to include a prominent disclosure on all offering
materials used in connection with a Rule 147 offering stating that sales will be made only to
residents of the same state or territory as the issuer. 27 This proposed disclosure requirement was

25

See proposed Rule 147(d).

26

See Proposing Release at text accompanying note 18

27

See proposed Rule 147(f)(3).

11

intended to advise investors who are not residents of the state in which sales are being made that
the intrastate offering would be unavailable to them.
As proposed, Rule 147 would no longer have remained a safe harbor for conducting a
valid intrastate exempt offering under Section 3(a)(11). An issuer that attempted to comply with
Rule 147, as proposed to be amended, but failed to do so, could rely on any other available
exemption. Failure to satisfy the requirements of Rule 147, as proposed to be amended,
however, would also have likely resulted in a failure to satisfy the statutory requirements for the
intrastate offering exemption under Section 3(a)(11), since the requirements of Section 3(a)(11)
would be more restrictive than under Rule 147, as proposed to be amended.
b. Comments on Proposed Amendments
All commenters that addressed the issue expressed support for eliminating the limitation
on offers to in-state residents while continuing to require that all sales be made to in-state
residents. 28 Many of these commenters also expressed support for retaining existing Rule 147 as
a safe harbor under Section 3(a)(11), in order to allow issuers to take advantage of existing state
crowdfunding provisions. 29 As explained by one commenter, if the Commission eliminated the
Rule 147 safe harbor, state legislative and/or rulemaking action would be required, since almost

all of the state crowdfunding exemptions are premised on the offering qualifying under
Section 3(a)(11) and its Rule 147 safe harbor. 30 The commenter noted that eliminating the Rule
147 safe harbor would leave these state crowdfunding exemptions unavailable until states
modified their exemptions to accommodate the removal of Rule 147 as a safe harbor to Section
3(a)(11). 31 In order to avoid this problem, some commenters recommended that the Commission
interpret Section 3(a)(11) and Rule 147 to allow for offers to be viewed by out-of-state
residents. 32 A few of these commenters stated that Section 3(a)(11) should be interpreted to
allow for offers to be viewed by out-of-state residents, so long as such offers indicate that they
are being made to residents of a single state. 33
One commenter also noted that issuers currently rely on Section 3(a)(11) and Rule 147 to
conduct forms of intrastate offerings other than pursuant to state crowdfunding provisions. 34 In
the view of this commenter, removal of Rule 147 as a safe harbor under Section 3(a)(11) would
also present problems for these exempt offerings, thereby severely restricting other local capital
raising options. 35

NASAA Letter. According to the NASAA Letter, as of January 2016, of the 29 states plus the District of
Columbia that adopted or were finalizing rulemaking implementing crowdfunding exemptions, 29 were
premised on the offering qualifying under Section 3(a)(11) and its Rule 147 safe harbor: Alabama,
Arizona, Colorado, District of Columbia, Georgia, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas,
Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New
Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and
Wisconsin. As of January 2016, the exemptions were effective in 27 of the 30 jurisdictions: Minnesota
and New Jersey were finalizing rulemaking, and New Mexico was working on draft regulations. Of the
states with state crowdfunding exemptions, only Iowa and Vermont do not explicitly reference Rule 147,
and Maine relies on Rule 504 rather than Section 3(a)(11).

Although commenters overwhelmingly supported retaining existing Rule 147 as a safe
harbor to Section 3(a)(11), many commenters also supported adopting a substantially similar
new exemption under the Commission’s general exemptive authority under Section 28 for
companies that conduct an intrastate offering but may not qualify for the Section 3(a)(11)
exemption.36 Similarly, the 2015 Small Business Forum recommended that the Commission
take a “side-by-side” approach in introducing a new Rule 147—as it did with Rule 506 and
Regulation A 37—keeping old Rule 147 in place as a safe harbor under Section 3(a)(11) (but
amending it to the extent permissible given the statutory limitations of Section 3(a)(11)) while
also adopting a new exemption. 38 Several commenters stated that establishing a new exemption
under Section 28, in addition to retaining existing Rule 147, would afford the states time to
amend their existing state crowdfunding provisions, as well as to adopt new state crowdfunding
provisions. 39 One commenter supported leaving the existing Rule 147 as a safe harbor to Section
3(a)(11) while adopting the proposed new exemption as new Rule 505. 40
Several commenters supported our proposal to require prominent disclosure on all
offering materials used in connection with a Rule 147 offering stating that sales will be made
only to residents of the same state or territory as the issuer. 41 One commenter supported the
proposed prominent disclosure requirement, but only to the extent it is required on all general

For example, pursuant to Title II of the JOBS Act, the Commission adopted the Rule 506(c) exemption that
permits an issuer to engage in general solicitation under certain circumstances while retaining Rule 506(b)
as a safe harbor, which prohibits general solicitation. Pursuant to Title IV of the JOBS Act, the
Commission also adopted Tier 1 and Tier 2 categories under Regulation A.

solicitation and advertising materials. 42 Two other commenters noted that appropriate
accommodations should be made to permit use of space-constrained social media
communications such as Twitter. 43 Two commenters noted that the Commission’s efforts to
modernize these requirements should preserve state authority over intrastate offerings, including
the authority to impose additional disclosure requirements. 44
c. Final Rules
After considering these comments and the recommendations of the 2015 Small Business
Forum, we are adopting new Rule 147A to allow issuers to make offers accessible to out-of-state
residents, so long as sales are limited to in-state residents. We are also retaining amended Rule
147 as a safe harbor under Section 3(a)(11) to preserve the continued availability of existing state
exemptive provisions that are specifically conditioned upon issuer reliance on Section 3(a)(11)
and Rule 147. Issuers relying on amended Rule 147 as a safe harbor under Section 3(a)(11) must
continue to limit all offers and sales to in-state residents. 45
We believe offers made over the Internet that can be viewed by a significant number of
out-of-state residents are not consistent with Section 3(a)(11) and Rule 147, even if such offers
include prominent disclosure stating that sales will be made only to residents of the same state or
territory as the issuer. 46 When Section 3(a)(11) was enacted in 1934, Congress noted, among
other things, that “a person who comes within the purpose of the exemption, but happens to use a
newspaper for the circulation of his advertising literature, which newspaper is transmitted in

15

interstate commerce, does not thereby lose the benefits of the exemption.” 47 Further, in 1937 the
Commission released guidance on the nature of the Section 3(a)(11) exemption in the form of a
letter from the Commission’s General Counsel. 48 The letter stated that securities exempt from
registration pursuant to Section 3(a)(11) “may be made the subject of general newspaper
advertisement (provided the advertisement is appropriately limited to indicate that offers to
purchase are solicited only from, and sales will be made only to, residents of the particular state
involved).” 49 In its 1961 Release, the Commission explained that in order “[t]o give effect to the
fundamental purpose of the exemption, it is necessary that the entire issue of securities shall be
offered and sold to, and come to rest only in the hands of residents within the state. If any part of
the issue is offered or sold to a non-resident, the exemption is unavailable not only for the
securities so sold, but for all securities forming a part of the issue, including those sold to
residents.” 50 We do not read the legislative history for Section 3(a)(11) and the prior
Commission statements as envisioning widespread out-of-state offers, but rather as recognition
that some media of communication, such as a local newspaper or periodical, could only be
imperfectly targeted to residents of a particular state. The Internet, however, is not similarly
targeted to residents of a particular state, making it difficult for issuers to keep the distribution of
such offers local in nature.

See H.R. Rep. No. 73-1838, at 40-41 (1934) (Conf. Rep.). Section 3(a)(11) initially was enacted as

the Securities Act, including revising and redesignating Section 5(c) as Section 3(a)(11).

1961 Release; see also 1937 Letter of General Counsel (stating that Section 3(a)(11) is “limited to cases in
which the entire issue of securities is offered and sold exclusively to residents of the state in question”).

16

Given the foregoing, we believe that the most appropriate means to permit the offer and
sale of securities on Internet websites, or using any other form of mass media likely to reach
significant numbers of out-of-state residents, is to adopt a new intrastate offering exemption
pursuant to the Commission’s general exemptive authority under Section 28. Accordingly, new
Rule 147A will require issuers to limit sales to in-state residents, but will not limit offers by the
issuer to in-state residents. New Rule 147A thereby will permit issuers to engage in general
solicitation and general advertising of their offerings, using any form of mass media, including
unrestricted, publicly-available Internet websites, so long as sales of securities so offered are
made only to residents of the state or territory in which the issuer is resident.
Consistent with the proposal, both Rule 147A and amended Rule 147 will require issuers
to include prominent disclosure with all offering materials stating that sales will be made only to
residents of the same state or territory as the issuer. 51 We believe this disclosure will help alert
potential investors that only residents of the state in which the issuer is located are eligible to
participate in the offering. Nothing in this disclosure requirement, however, will prevent state
authorities from imposing additional disclosure requirements or other requirements on offers or
sales made to persons within their states.
Two commenters noted that appropriate accommodations should be made to permit use
of space-constrained social media communications such as Twitter. 52 To accommodate spaceconstrained social media communication, when offering materials are distributed through a
communications medium that has technological limitations on the number of characters or
amount of text that may be included in the communication and including the required statements

51

See Rules 147(f)(3) and 147A(f)(3).

17

in their entirety, together with the other information, would cause the communication to exceed
the limit on the number of characters or amount of text, an issuer could satisfy the disclosure
requirement by including an active hyperlink to the required disclosure that otherwise would be
required by the rules. The communication should prominently convey, through introductory
language, that required information is provided through the hyperlink. We believe this guidance
will accommodate advancements in social media, while still providing potential investors with
the disclosure required by the rules. Where an electronic communication is capable of including
the entirety of the required disclosure, along with the other information, without exceeding the
applicable limit on the number of characters or amount of text, the use of a hyperlink to the
required statements should not be used.
2. Elimination of Residence Requirement for Issuers
a. Proposed Amendments
For corporations, limited partnerships, trusts, or other forms of business organizations,
we proposed to eliminate the current requirement in Rule 147 that limits the availability of the
rule to issuers incorporated or organized in the state in which an offering takes place. Our
proposed amendments would have expanded the universe of eligible issuers by eliminating the
current “residence” requirement, while continuing to require that an issuer have a sufficient instate presence determined by the location of the issuer’s principal place of business. 53
The proposed amendments also would have replaced the current rule’s “principal
office” 54 requirements for an issuer with a “principal place of business” requirement. 55 The

53

See proposed Rule 147(c)(1). See also discussion on principal place of business in Section II.B.1below,
and the related discussion of the proposed requirement that an issuer satisfy at least one of four threshold
requirements in order to help ensure the in-state nature of its business.

18

proposed rule defined the term “principal place of business” to mean the location from which the
officers, partners, or managers of the issuer primarily direct, control and coordinate the activities
of the issuer. 56 As noted in the Proposing Release, an issuer would have been able to have a
“principal place of business” within only one state or territory and would have therefore been
able to conduct an offering pursuant to amended Rule 147 only within that particular state or
territory. We also proposed to restrict the ability of an issuer that has changed its principal place
of business from conducting an intrastate offering in a different state for a period of nine months
from the date of the last sale in the prior state, 57 which was consistent with the duration of the
resale limitation period specified in proposed Rule 147(e). 58
b. Comments on Proposed Amendments
Commenters were divided on the proposal to eliminate the requirement in Rule 147 that
entities be incorporated or organized under the laws of the state or territory in which the offering
takes place. Several commenters supported eliminating this requirement and stated that the
jurisdiction of entity formation should not affect the ability of an issuer to be considered resident
for purposes of an intrastate offering and that there are valid business reasons for incorporating
or organizing in states, such as Delaware, which do not detract from an issuer’s connection to the
state in which its principal place of business is located. 59 Other commenters opposed eliminating

See Bishop Letter (“The application of state securities laws is not dependent upon the state of incorporation

offering takes place, 60 and some of these commenters stated that the intrastate exemption should
promote state and local economic development goals in addition to capital formation—goals
that, in their view, would be curtailed in the absence of an in-state organization requirement. 61
Commenters also were divided on replacing the current in-state organization requirement
in Rule 147(c)(1) with a principal place of business requirement. While two commenters viewed
the principal place of business standard along with a “doing business” test as sufficiently
demonstrating the in-state nature of an issuer’s business, 62 two other commenters opposed the
proposed principal place of business requirement. 63 One commenter noted that the jurisdictional
reach of state securities laws is independent of whether an issuer is conducting any business
within the state and indicated that a state’s jurisdiction is established by the offer or sale of a
security within the state. 64 Another commenter stated that the principal place of business

requirement is “anti-competitive in nature and disruptive in spurring economic growth for small
businesses.” 65
Several commenters supported the proposed nine-month waiting period until the offering
comes to rest, consistent with the requirements of proposed Rule 147(e), before an issuer may
change its principal place of business to another state or territory and make a subsequent offering
of securities in that new state or territory in reliance on proposed Rule 147. 66 No commenters
opposed the proposed waiting period.
c. Final Rules
We are adopting changes to the residency requirements for issuers conducting exempt
intrastate offerings largely as proposed, but with certain modifications to reflect our decision to
retain existing Rule 147 as a safe harbor to the Section 3(a)(11) exemption. Since we are
retaining Rule 147 as a safe harbor and since Section 3(a)(11) expressly requires that if the
issuer is a corporation that it be “incorporated by and doing business within, such state or
territory,” we are not eliminating the “residence” requirement in current paragraph (c)(1) of
Rule 147, as proposed. Instead, we are retaining the requirement that an issuer shall be deemed
a resident of a state or territory in which it is incorporated or organized for issuers that are
incorporated or organized under state or territorial law, such as corporations, limited
partnerships and trusts.
In addition, for consistency between the provisions of Rule 147 and new Rule 147A, 67
throughout amended Rule 147, we are replacing the “principal office” requirement with the

65

Exante Letter.

66

CFIRA Letter; CrowdCheck Letter; NASAA Letter.

67

See Rules 147(c)(1), 147(d)(1), 147A(c)(1) and 147A(d)(1). The principal place of business definition is
consistent with the use of that term in Exchange Act Rule 3a71-3, 17 CFR 240.3a71-3, for cross-border

21

proposed “principal place of business” requirement. 68 Instead of “principal office,” amended
Rule 147 and new Rule 147A will refer to the term “principal place of business” to mean the
location from which the officers, partners, or managers of the issuer primarily direct, control
and coordinate the activities of the issuer. 69 We do not expect this change will significantly
alter the scope of existing Rule 147 as we believe “principal place of business” is conceptually
similar to principal office location.
Under amended Rule 147, issuers that are incorporated or organized under state or
territorial law will be deemed a “resident” of a particular state or territory in which they are both
incorporated or organized and have their “principal place of business.” 70 Specifically, the
“principal office” requirement contained in current Rule 147(c)(2)(iv) 71 will be updated and
replaced with the “principal place of business” requirement in amended Rule 147(c)(1)(i).
Similarly, issuers that are general partnerships, or in the form of another business organization
not organized under any state or territorial law, shall be deemed to be a “resident” of the state or
territory in which they have their “principal place of business.” 72
Consistent with the proposal, new Rule 147A(c)(1) will rely solely on the principal place
of business requirement to determine the state or territory in which the issuer shall be deemed a
“resident,” not only for corporate issuers, but for all issuers, including issuers that are not

security based swap dealing activity, and the use of the term “principal office and place of business” in
Investment Advisers Act Rule 203A-3(c), 17 CFR 275.203A-3(c).
68

For example, as proposed, we are amending paragraph (d)(1) of Rule 147 to replace the “principal office”
requirement with “principal place of business.” See also Section II.B.3 below discussing the use of the
“principal place of business” standard for the residence of entity purchasers.

organized under any state or territorial law, such as general partnerships. 73 Although
commenters were divided on whether to retain the requirement that entities be incorporated or
organized under the laws of the state in which the offering takes place, we continue to believe
that using a principal place of business requirement in lieu of an in-state formation requirement
to establish the issuer’s residency is more consistent with modern business practices in which
issuers are permitted to incorporate or organize in states other than the state or territory of their
principal place of business, for example, to take advantage of well-established bodies of
corporate or partnership law. 74 We continue to believe that, outside the statutory requirements
of Section 3(a)(11), the jurisdiction of entity formation should not affect the ability of an issuer
to be considered “resident” for purposes of an intrastate offering exemption at the federal level.
While we recognize that some commenters supported retaining an in-state formation
requirement as a means of ensuring that the economic and social benefits of the offering remain
within the state, the objectives of our rulemaking in this area are more broadly focused on
facilitating capital formation by small businesses. 75 We believe that retaining an in-state
formation requirement in new Rule 147A would be unnecessarily restrictive and limit the
usefulness of the exemption, potentially to the detriment of local economic development.
We are, however, retaining the proposed principal place of business requirement, despite
the views of several commenters that such a requirement is unnecessary or inappropriate. 76

73

See note 56 above.

74

For example, data provided by issuers in Form D filings with the Commission indicates that approximately
37% of Rule 504 offerings and 39% of Rule 505 offerings indicated in their Form D filings that they had
different states of incorporation and principal places of business. Form D data also indicates that
approximately 65% of all Rule 506 offerings initiated during 2009-2015 reported different states of
incorporation and operations. See discussion in Section V.B.2.b.ii below.

75

See e.g., Rule 147 Adopting Release at text accompanying note 2.

76

Bishop Letter; Exante Letter.

23

Although, as noted by one commenter, the jurisdictional reach of state securities laws is
independent of whether an issuer is conducting any business within the state since a state’s
jurisdiction is established by the offer or sale of a security within the state, 77 we believe that
states will have a particular interest in regulating intrastate offerings for the protection of
investors where there is a meaningful nexus between the state, issuers and investors.
To ensure an appropriate connection between the state, issuers and investors, amended
Rule 147(d) and Rule 147A(d) will require an issuer to be a resident of the same state where
purchasers are resident or where the issuer reasonably believes they are resident. 78 Viewed
together, paragraphs (c) and (d) of each of Rules 147 and 147A help to ensure the local
intrastate character of the offering by requiring that both issuers and purchasers reside and have
their principal place of business (for purchasers, the principal place of business requirement
only applies to purchasers who are legal entities) 79 in the same state or territory where the
offering takes place.
For situations where an issuer changes its principal place of business to another state
after conducting an intrastate offering in reliance on Rule 147 or Rule 147A, we are adopting
provisions in both rules that limit the ability of an issuer to conduct a subsequent intrastate
offering pursuant to Rule 147 or Rule 147A until such time as securities sold in reliance on the
exemption in the prior state have come to rest in that state. 80 This is consistent with the view
that securities sold in an intrastate offering in one state should have to come to rest within such

77

Bishop Letter.

78

See Rule 147A(c)(1).

79

Under both amended Rule 147(d)(2) and Rule 147A(d)(2), the residence of an individual (natural person) is
determined by the state or territory in which his or her principal residence is located at the time of the offer
and sale to the individual.

80

See Rules 147(e) and 147A(e).

24

state before purchasers may resell their securities to out-of-state residents. 81 Accordingly, both
rules provide that issuers who have previously conducted an intrastate offering pursuant to Rule
147 or Rule 147A will not be able to conduct another subsequent intrastate offering pursuant to
either rule in a different state for a period of six months from the date of the last sale in the prior
state, which is consistent with the duration of the resale limitation period specified in our
amendments to Rule 147(e) and new Rule 147A(e). 82 The use of a six-month period is a change
from the proposed nine-month period, and aligns these provisions with changes being made to
amended Rule 147(e) and new Rule 147A(e), consistent with commenters’ suggestions to
reduce the nine-month resale limitation period to six months. 83
B.

Common Requirements of the Amendments to Rule 147 and New Rule 147A
Our amendments to Rule 147 and the provisions of new Rule 147A are substantially

identical, except that, as discussed above, new Rule 147A allows an issuer to make offers
accessible to out-of-state residents and to be incorporated or organized out-of-state. 84 Under the
rules we adopt today, both amended Rule 147 and new Rule 147A will include the following
provisions:
•

A requirement that the issuer satisfy at least one “doing business” requirement
that will demonstrate the in-state nature of the issuer’s business.

•

A new “reasonable belief” standard for issuers to rely upon in determining the
residence of the purchaser at the time of the sale of securities.

A limit on resales to persons resident within the state or territory of the offering
for a period of six months from the date of the sale by the issuer to the purchaser
of a security sold pursuant to the exemption.

•

An integration safe harbor that will include any prior offers or sales of securities
by the issuer, as well as certain subsequent offers or sales of securities by the
issuer occurring after the completion of the offering.

Disclosure requirements, including legend requirements, to offerees and
purchasers about the limits on resales.
1. Requirements for Issuers “Doing Business” In-State
a.

Proposed Amendments

Under the proposed rules, an issuer would be required to meet at least one of the
following requirements in order to be considered “doing business” in-state:
•

The issuer derived at least 80% of its consolidated gross revenues from the operation of a
business or of real property located in or from the rendering of services within such state
or territory; 85

85

See proposed Rule 147(c)(2)(i) and related notes to the rule indicating how and when an issuer would
calculate its revenue for purposes of compliance with the proposed rule, based on when the first offer of
securities is made pursuant to the exemption.

26

•

The issuer had at the end of its most recent semi-annual fiscal period prior to the first
offer of securities pursuant to the exemption, at least 80% of its consolidated assets
located within such state or territory; 86

•

The issuer intends to use and uses at least 80% of the net proceeds to the issuer from sales
made pursuant to the exemption in connection with the operation of a business or of real
property, the purchase of real property located in, or the rendering of services within such
state or territory; 87 or

•

A majority of the issuer’s employees are based in such state or territory. 88
b.

Comments on the Proposed Amendments

Several commenters supported our proposed amendments to the current “doing business”
requirements in Rule 147(c)(2). 89 One commenter specifically favored the proposed disjunctive
approach, requiring an issuer to satisfy one of four threshold tests, thereby enabling different
types of issuers (e.g., a brick-and-mortar business versus an online business) to confirm local
residency and demonstrate the in-state nature of their business. 90 Another commenter, although
noting that the proposed requirements and thresholds appropriately reflect characteristics that are
in keeping with establishing a local presence, was concerned that having to meet only one
requirement may not establish the local connection of the issuer to the state to the degree

anticipated by Section 3(a)(11) and encouraged a close review of this issue in a Commission
study. 91
Two commenters supported our proposed amendment to the “doing business” test to add
an alternative threshold requirement based on the location of a majority of an issuer’s
employees. 92 Several commenters supported using this additional criterion, but with different
percentage thresholds. 93 Some of these commenters recommended requiring that at least 80% of
the issuer’s employees be based in the state, 94 while another commenter supported requiring that
at least 75% of the issuer’s employees be based in the state. 95
Several commenters opposed our proposed “doing business” requirements in favor of
alternative standards. 96 For example, some of these commenters supported the use of five
alternative criteria in order for an issuer to be deemed a “state business,” specifically: the
issuer’s main office be located in-state, and at least 80% of the funds raised be used in-state,
work is done in-state, employees live in-state and owners reside in-state. 97 Another commenter
supported generally these same criteria, but using 75% thresholds as opposed to 80%

from the strict 80% thresholds in favor of majority requirements that would harmonize the
current “doing business” tests with the proposed test for number of employees. 99 Finally,
another commenter suggested a periodic review by the Commission to evaluate the 80%
thresholds to determine whether the exemption succeeds in facilitating the goal of small business
capital formation while protecting investors. 100
c.

Final Rules

After considering the comments, we are adopting, as proposed, updated and modernized
“doing business” requirements in Rule 147 and new Rule 147A to comport with contemporary
small business practices. 101 We believe these updated requirements will expand the universe of
issuers that may rely on Section 3(a)(11) and the amended Rule 147 safe harbor, as well as new
Rule 147A, to conduct exempt intrastate offerings, while continuing to require issuers to have an
in-state presence sufficient to justify reliance on these provisions. Given the increasing
“interstate” nature of small business activities, we believe it has become increasingly difficult for
companies, even smaller companies that are physically located within a single state or territory,
to satisfy the issuer “doing business” requirements of current Rule 147(c)(2). 102 Accordingly,
we believe these issuer “doing business” requirements, identical for both amended Rule 147 and

98

Wolff Letter (recommending 75% thresholds for use of funds, work done in-state, and number of
employees residing in-state but that the rules require only a majority of the owners’ primary residences be
located in-state).

issuers to assess. Additionally, the high and precise threshold can exclude issuers that rationally should
qualify.”); Pearl Letter.

29

new Rule 147A, will provide issuers with greater flexibility in conducting intrastate offerings
and expand the availability of these two intrastate offering provisions. 103
As proposed, we are adopting amendments to Rule 147(c)(2) and including provisions in
new Rule 147A(c)(2) that will provide issuers with greater flexibility to satisfy the current
“doing business” requirements by adding an alternative test based on the location of a majority
of the issuer’s employees while retaining the three 80% threshold tests in current Rule
147(c)(2). 104 Furthermore, while the substance of the three 80% threshold requirements of
current Rule 147(c)(2) is being retained in the final rules, compliance with any one of the 80%
threshold requirements (or the additional test based on the majority of employees) will be
sufficient to demonstrate the in-state nature of the issuer’s business, as proposed. This is a
change from current Rule 147(c)(2), which requires issuers to satisfy all three 80% threshold
requirements.
We recognize that commenters had various alternative views on these requirements.
While some commenters sought to require issuers to meet additional criteria, other commenters
sought to lower the percentage thresholds in the criteria to ease the issuer requirements. We
believe that the approach we are adopting in the final rules will provide issuers with additional
flexibility to satisfy the requirements, while continuing to function as meaningful indicia of the
in-state nature of the issuer’s business. In light of the fact that issuers will need to meet only one
of the threshold tests, we are not changing the current 80% threshold tests to a majority
requirement as one commenter suggested. 105 We believe it is appropriate to first observe how

the updated doing business in-state requirements are used by issuers in practice before making
any further changes. 106 Except as discussed below, we also are not adopting alternative criteria
for the doing business in-state requirements, as suggested by several commenters. 107 We believe
the existing criteria have generally served states, issuers and investors well by being easy to
understand and apply, and when updated as discussed above, will appropriately reflect
characteristics in keeping with a local business presence. 108
We are also making certain technical revisions to the three current 80% thresholds, as
proposed, that we believe will simplify the structure and application of the rules. 109 In light of
our amendments to require issuers to satisfy only one of the threshold tests, we are eliminating
the current provision in Rule 147(c)(2)(i)(B), which does not apply the revenue test to issuers
with less than $5,000 in revenue during the prior fiscal year. 110 While this accommodation may
be reasonable in the context of the current conjunctive 80% threshold requirements of
Rule 147(c)(2), we do not believe it is necessary under the new disjunctive approach that we are
adopting in these rules.
Consistent with the proposal, and as supported by commenters, we are adding an
alternative requirement to the three modified 80% threshold requirements. This requirement,
which relates to the location of a majority of the issuer’s employees, will provide an additional

106

As we indicated in the Proposing Release, we expect the staff to undertake to study and submit a report to
the Commission no later than three years following the effective date of the final rules on whether this new
framework appropriately provides assurances that an issuer is doing business in the state in which the
offering takes place.

107

See Ely Letter; MacDougall Letter; Pearl Letter; Terdal Letter.

See CFA Letter.

109

For example, in order to streamline the presentation of Rule 147(c)(2), we are re-designating current
Rule 147(c)(2)(i)(A)-(B), 17 CFR 230.147(c)(2)(i)(A)-(B), which includes instructions on how to calculate
revenue under Rule 147(c)(2)(i), as Instruction to Paragraph (c)(2)(i) of Rule 147. Similarly, Rule 147A
will also include an instruction on how to calculate revenue under Rule 147A(c)(2)(i).

method by which an issuer may demonstrate that it conducts in-state business sufficient to justify
reliance on either Rule 147 or new Rule 147A. For these purposes, we are permitting an issuer
to satisfy the “doing business” requirements by having a majority of its employees based in such
state or territory. 111 An employee would be based in the same state or territory of the issuer for
purposes of this test if such employee is based out of offices located within such state or
territory. 112 For example, if an employee provides services in the Maryland, Virginia and
Washington, DC metro area out of the offices of a company in Maryland, the employee would be
based in Maryland for purposes of this test. While some commenters suggested different
thresholds for the employee test (ranging from 75% to 80%), we believe that using a majority of
the employees test provides a standard that more accurately captures the increasingly flexible
ways that companies structure and conduct their business operations, while still requiring that
more employees be located in-state than elsewhere. Current workforce trends, such as
telecommuting, whereby employees often work in a different geographical location from their
employer, suggest that flexibility is particularly needed in this area. We believe adding this
criterion to expand upon the current doing business requirements in Rule 147(c)(2) will provide
additional flexibility to issuers by making these requirements more consistent with modern
business practices, especially in light of the different roles employees play within smaller
companies and the different locations in which employees carry out such roles, while still
providing important indicia of the in-state nature of an issuer’s business.

Reasonable Belief as to Purchaser Residency Status
a. Proposed Amendments

Consistent with the requirements in Regulation D, 113 we proposed to add a reasonable
belief standard to the issuer’s determination as to the residence of the purchaser at the time of the
sale of the securities. 114 As proposed, an issuer would satisfy the requirement that the purchaser
in the offering be a resident of the same state or territory as the issuer’s principal place of
business by either the existence of the fact that the purchaser is a resident of the applicable state
or territory, or by establishing that the issuer had a reasonable belief that the purchaser of the
securities in the offering was a resident of such state or territory. 115 We also proposed to
eliminate the requirement in current Rule 147 that issuers obtain a written representation from
each purchaser as to his or her residence, as we believed this requirement may be unnecessary in
light of the proposed reasonable belief standard. 116
b. Comments on the Proposed Amendments
Several commenters supported the proposal to include a reasonable belief standard. 117
One of these commenters stated that a reasonable belief standard will provide more certainty for
issuers about the availability of the exemption and increase its utility without sacrificing investor
protection. 118
Commenters were divided on whether to eliminate the requirement to obtain a written
113

Rule 501(a) of Regulation D includes in the definition of “accredited investor,” persons who come within
the enumerated categories of the rule, or who the issuer reasonably believes come within any of such
categories, at the time of sale to such person. 17 CFR 230.501(a).

representation from the purchaser as to his or her residence, with two commenters supporting the
proposed elimination of the requirement 119 and two commenters opposing it. 120 Commenters
opposing elimination of the requirement stated that the written representation should not be the
sole indication of residency under a facts and circumstances exercise, but asserted that it is a
useful indication of residency. 121
Several commenters requested that the Commission provide a safe harbor for determining
an individual purchaser’s residence, based upon certain objective criteria. 122 Two of those
commenters supported the creation of a non-exclusive safe harbor setting out the means by
which a reasonable belief may be established, including the circumstances in which an issuer
may rely on the steps taken by a third-party, such as a service provider or intermediary. 123
Another of those commenters stated that Commission staff should work with the states to
standardize requirements for determining state of residency for purposes of investor participation
in an offering to help ensure compliance with the residency requirement. 124 In addition, the 2015
Small Business Forum recommended that the Commission create a safe harbor for determining
the “place of business” of a non-natural person investor in Rule 147 offerings, which could be as
simple as a self-certification as to its place of business. 125

c. Final Rules
Consistent with the proposal, and with the determination of accredited investor status
under Regulation D, 126 we are adopting amendments to Rule 147 and a provision in new Rule
147A that will include a reasonable belief standard for the issuer’s determination as to the
residence of the purchaser at the time of the sale of the securities. 127 Under the final rules, an
issuer will satisfy the requirement that the purchaser in the offering be a resident of the same
state or territory in which the issuer is resident by either the existence of the fact that the
purchaser is a resident of the applicable state or territory, or by establishing that the issuer had a
reasonable belief that the purchaser of the securities in the offering was a resident of such state or
territory. 128 Under current Rule 147(d), regardless of the efforts an issuer takes to determine that
potential investors are residents of the state in which the issuer is resident, the exemption is lost
for the entire offering if securities are offered or sold to just one investor that was not in fact a
resident of such state. We continue to believe that permitting issuers to sell on the basis of a
reasonable belief of a purchaser’s in-state residency status will increase the utility of amended
Rule 147 and new Rule 147A by providing issuers with additional certainty about the availability
of the exemption under Section 3(a)(11) or new Rule 147A while still providing appropriate
investor protections. 129
In a change from the proposal, both amended Rule 147 and new Rule 147A will include a
requirement that issuers obtain a written representation from each purchaser as to his or her

126

129

The burden will continue to be on the issuer to establish that the purchaser is an in-state resident or that the
issuer had a reasonable belief as to residency. Otherwise, the sale to a non-resident purchaser would
preclude reliance on amended Rule 147 or new Rule 147A.

35

residence. 130 We are persuaded by those commenters who stated that this requirement should be
retained and considered as evidence of, but not be dispositive of, the purchaser’s residency. In
the context of Section 3(a)(11), the Commission has previously indicated that “[t]he mere
obtaining of formal representations of residence … should not be relied upon without more as
establishing the availability of the exemption.” 131 Whether an issuer has formed a reasonable
belief that the prospective purchaser is an in-state resident will be determined on the basis of all
facts and circumstances. Obtaining a written representation from purchasers of in-state
residency status will not, without more, be sufficient to establish a reasonable belief that such
purchasers are in-state residents. 132
In addition to the written representation, other facts and circumstances could include, but
will not be limited to, for example, a pre-existing relationship between the issuer and the
prospective purchaser that provides the issuer with sufficient knowledge about the prospective
purchaser’s principal residence or principal place of business so as to enable the issuer to have a
reasonable basis to believe that the prospective purchaser is an in-state resident. An issuer may
also consider other facts and circumstances when establishing the residency of a prospective
purchaser, such as evidence of the home address of the prospective purchaser, as documented by
a recently dated utility bill, pay-stub, information contained in state or federal tax returns, any
documentation issued by a federal, state, or local government authority, such as a driver’s license
or identification card, or a public or private database that the issuer has determined is reasonably
reliable, including credit bureau databases, directory listings, and public records.

36

While a few commenters 133 and the 2015 Small Business Forum recommended that the
Commission provide a safe harbor for determining a purchaser’s residence, including the
circumstances in which a reasonable belief may be established, we are not doing so in the final
rules. Our rules do not provide a safe harbor for the reasonable belief determination made under
Rule 501(a) of Regulation D for exempt offerings, and we do not believe that the determinations
required for amended Rule 147 and new Rule 147A present a more compelling case for having
such a provision. In addition, we are concerned that a safe harbor could be viewed as an
exclusive or minimum standard. We believe that requiring issuers to consider the facts and
circumstances in order to establish a reasonable basis to believe that the purchaser is a resident of
the same state or territory in which the issuer is resident is appropriate and will provide sufficient
certainty for issuers seeking to satisfy the requirements of the exemption. Commission staff will
consider available information on issuer compliance with the “reasonable belief” standards in
connection with the study of amended Rule 147 and new Rule 147A. 134
3. Residence of Entity Purchasers
a. Proposed Amendments
We proposed to define the residence of a purchaser that is a legal entity, such as a
corporation, partnership, trust or other form of business organization, as the location where, at
the time of the sale, the entity has its principal place of business. 135 For these purposes, we also
proposed to define a purchaser’s “principal place of business,” consistent with the proposed

133

CFIRA Letter; CrowdCheck Letter; Localstake Letter; WBA Letter.

134

See Section I above.

135

See proposed Rule 147(d). Under the current rule, an entity is a resident of the state or territory where the
entity has its “principal office.” Current Rule 147 does not define “principal office.” 17 CFR
230.147(c)(2)(iv).

37

definition for issuer eligibility purposes, as the location in which the officers, partners, or
managers of the entity primarily direct, control and coordinate its activities. 136
b. Comments on the Proposed Amendments
Two commenters supported the proposed amendments to replace the “principal office”
requirement for entity purchasers with the “principal place of business” standard, consistent with
the standard for issuers. 137 One commenter suggested that the Commission clarify how the
residency of non-business trusts should be determined. 138
c. Final Rules
Consistent with the proposal, we are adopting amendments to Rule 147 and a provision in
new Rule 147A that will define the residence of a purchaser that is a legal entity, such as a
corporation, partnership, trust or other form of business organization, as the location where, at
the time of the sale, the entity has its principal place of business. 139 The final rules define a
purchaser’s “principal place of business,” consistent with the definition for determining issuer
residency contained in paragraph (c)(1) of Rules 147 and 147A, as the location in which the
officers, partners, or managers of the entity primarily direct, control and coordinate its
activities. 140 In addition, as suggested by one commenter, 141 we are adding an instruction to the
requirement as to the residency of the purchaser stating that a trust that is not deemed by the law

4. Limitation on Resales
a.

Proposed Amendments

We proposed to amend the limitation on resales in Rule 147(e) to provide that for a
period of nine months from the date of the sale by the issuer of a security sold pursuant to this
rule, any resale by a purchaser would need to be made only to residents within the purchaser’s
state or territory of residence. 143 In contrast, Rule 147(e) currently requires that during the
period in which securities are offered and sold in reliance on the intrastate offering exemption,
and for a period of nine months from the date of the last sale by the issuer of such securities, all
resales of any securities sold in the offering shall only be made to persons resident within the
state or territory of which the issuer is a resident. In the Proposing Release, we explained that
the determination as to when a given purchase of securities in an intrastate offering has come to
rest in-state depends less on a defined period of time after the final sale by the issuer in such
offering than it does on whether a resident purchaser has taken the securities “without a view to
further distribution or resale to non-residents.” 144 In this regard, we believed that a time-based
limitation on potential resales to non-residents that relates back to the date of the purchase by a
resident investor from the issuer would more precisely address the concern regarding out-of-state
resales.

See Instruction 1 to Paragraph (d)(1) of Rule 147 and Instruction 1 to Paragraph (d)(1) of Rule 147A.

143

Proposed Rule 147(e).

144

See Proposing Release, at text accompanying note 87.

39

We also proposed to amend Rule 147(b) so that an issuer’s ability to rely on Rule 147
would no longer be conditioned on a purchaser’s compliance with Rule 147(e). 145 We believed
that this proposed amendment to the application of Rule 147(e), as it relates to Rule 147(b),
would increase the utility of the exemption by eliminating the uncertainty created in the offering
process for issuers under the current rules. As proposed, issuers would remain subject to
requirements relating to, for example, in-state sales limitations, legends, stop transfer instructions
for transfer agents, and offeree and purchaser disclosures in order to satisfy the exemption at the
federal level. In addition, issuers would continue to be subject to the antifraud and civil liability
provisions of the federal securities laws, as well as state securities law requirements. Lastly,
although we did not propose to amend our rules to provide that securities issued under amended
Rule 147 be considered “restricted securities” under Rule 144(a)(3), 146 we requested comments
on this question.
b.

Comments on the Proposed Amendments

Several commenters supported the proposed change to the limitation on resales by
resident purchasers to non-residents based on the date of sale by the issuer to the relevant
purchaser rather than based on the date when the offering terminates. 147 Commenters, however,
had differing views on the length of the holding period from the date of sale. Two commenters
supported a nine-month holding period from the date of sale. 148 One of these commenters
reasoned that this period sufficiently demonstrates the purchase was for investment without an

intent to distribute out-of-state or avoid registration. 149 Two other commenters stated that a
period of six months is adequate to establish that securities have “come to rest” in a state. 150
Those commenters noted that a nine-month period does not exist in any other securities law
requirements, so the potential exists for confusion. One commenter recommended that the
Commission clarify that bona fide gifts are not subject to the limitation on resales out-of-state,
and that a donee is deemed to have acquired the securities when they were acquired by the
donor. 151
Commenters were divided on whether securities issued under amended Rule 147 should
be considered “restricted securities” under Rule 144(a)(3). One commenter stated that securities
issued under amended Rule 147 should be considered “restricted securities” under Rule
144(a)(3). 152 Two other commenters stated that the securities should not be treated as “restricted
securities” under Rule 144(a)(3), noting that the “coming to rest” in-state purpose of the ninemonth restriction is sufficiently distinct from the policy considerations underlying Rule 144. 153
In addition, several commenters supported no longer conditioning the availability of the
exemption on purchaser compliance with Rule 147(e). 154 One of those commenters reasoned
that if an issuer takes reasonable steps to comply with the limitations on resale, the issuer should

later date. 155
c.

Final Rules

After considering the comments, we are adopting a requirement in amended Rule 147 and
new Rule 147A providing that for a period of six months from the date of the sale of the security
by the issuer any resale of the security shall be made only to persons resident within the state or
territory in which the issuer was resident at the time of the sale of the security by the issuer. 156
We are persuaded by those commenters that indicated that a period of six months is adequate to
establish that securities sold in an intrastate offering have “come to rest” in a state by analogizing
to provisions of Rule 144, in which a six-month holding period is deemed sufficient to establish
a requisite investment intent. 157 In this regard, given the use of a six-month resale restriction in
the Rule 144 context, we believe that a similar resale restriction in the intrastate offering context
should provide adequate assurance that the securities will come to rest in-state. 158
We note that bona fide gifts are not subject to the limitation on resales in amended Rule
147 or new Rule 147A. 159 Since bona fide gifts are not transactions for value, they require no
investment decision by the donee and thus do not involve the sale of a security subject to

155

NASAA Letter.

156

Rules 147(e) and 147A(e).

157

See CFIRA Letter and CrowdCheck Letter. Rule 144 provides a safe-harbor from being deemed a
“statutory underwriter” under Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act. Specifically, Rule 144(d)(1)(i)
requires a six-month holding period for restricted securities sold by issuers reporting under the Exchange
Act in order for a purchaser to resell such securities and not be deemed an underwriter.

158

In such circumstances, resales of securities that were initially purchased in an intrastate offering must
themselves be registered or exempt from registration pursuant to any state securities laws where such resale
takes place.

159

See Bishop Letter.

42

regulation under the Securities Act. 160 However, we note that subsequent resales of donated
securities are subject to the resale restrictions regardless of the state in which the holder of the
donated securities resides. To address bona fide gifts of securities to out-of-state donees, as well
as the resales of securities that were wrongfully sold to out-of-state purchasers, within the six
month re-sale limitation period, we are revising our proposed resale limitation to focus on the
state or territory in which the issuer was resident, as opposed to where the last purchaser of the
securities may have resided. Accordingly, the resale limitation in the final rules limits resales to
“persons resident within the state or territory in which the issuer was resident…at the time of the
sale of the security by the issuer” as opposed to limiting resales to “persons resident within the
purchaser’s state or territory of residence,” as proposed. We believe this revision will address
situations in which purchasers in the offering subsequently gift or wrongfully sell their securities
to out-of-state residents who then wish to resell their securities within the six month limitation of
paragraph (e). This change to the rules makes clear that the six-month limitation on resales
applies to all holders of the securities, including holders subsequent to the original purchaser,
whether they received the shares as a gift, donation, or by purchase. 161
As proposed, the resale limitation period for both amended Rule 147(e) and new Rule
147A(e) will relate back to the date of purchase by a resident investor from the issuer, in contrast
to current Rule 147(e) that does not start the resale limitation period until the offering has

160

Section 2(a)(3) of the Securities Act defines “sale” or “sell” to “include every contract of sale or disposition
of a security or interest in a security, for value.” A lack of monetary consideration, however, does not
always mean that there was not a sale or offer for sale for purposes of Section 5. See, e.g., Capital General
Corporation, 54 SEC Docket 1714, 1728-29 (July 23, 1993) (Capital General's “gifting” of securities
constituted a sale because it was a disposition for value, the “value” arising “by virtue of the creation of a
public market for the issuer's securities.”). See also SEC v. Harwyn Industries Corp., 326 F. Supp. 943
(S.D.N.Y. 1971).

161

See Rules 147(e) and 147A(e).

terminated (i.e., until all offers and sales have ceased). 162 We continue to believe that a timebased limitation on potential resales to non-residents of securities purchased in an intrastate
offering that relates back to the date of purchase by a resident investor from the issuer would
more precisely address the concern regarding out-of-state resales.
In light of our revision to the resale limitation to focus on the state where the issuer is a
resident, we are including additional language in amended Rule 147(e) and new Rule 147A(e) to
specify that all re-sales during this six month resale limitation period will be restricted to the
state or territory in which the issuer was a resident at the time of the sale of the security by the
issuer to a purchaser. Accordingly, if an issuer were to change its state or territory of residence
during the six month resale limitation period, all resales would, nevertheless, continue to be
limited to the state or territory in which the issuer resided at the time of the original sale of
securities in reliance upon either Rule 147 or Rule 147A. We believe this additional language
will preserve the intent of the proposed resale restriction—to help ensure that the securities
offered pursuant to an intrastate offering exemption have come to rest within the state of the
offering before being resold.
As proposed, an issuer’s ability to rely on the respective rules will not be conditioned on
a purchaser’s compliance with Rule 147(e) and Rule 147A(e). 163 As discussed in the Proposing
Release, the application of current Rule 147(e) in the overall scheme of the safe harbor can cause
uncertainty for issuers. We continue to believe that removing the condition on purchaser
compliance with Rule 147(e) will increase the utility of the exemption by eliminating the
uncertainty created in the offering process for issuers under the current rules. As one commenter
162

The resale limitation period may end on different dates for different purchasers if the issuer sold shares on
multiple dates.

163

See Rules 147(b) and 147A(b). Current Rule 147(a) would be re-designated as Rule 147(b).

44

noted, if an issuer takes reasonable steps to comply with the limitations on resale, it should not
lose the availability of the exemption due to a purchaser not complying with the resale
limitations. 164 We continue to believe that eliminating this uncertainty should not result in an
increased risk of issuer non-compliance with the rules, because issuers will remain subject to
requirements relating to, for example, in-state sales limitations, legends, stop transfer instructions
for transfer agents, and offeree and purchaser disclosures, in order to satisfy the exemption at the
federal level. 165 In addition, issuers will continue to be subject to the antifraud and civil liability
provisions of the federal securities laws, as well as state securities law requirements.
Lastly, while one commenter believed that securities issued under amended Rule 147
should be considered “restricted securities” under Rule 144(a)(3), 166 we believe that limiting the
resale of these securities only to persons resident within the same state or territory in which the
issuer is a resident for a period of six months from the date of the sale of the security by the
issuer to the purchaser is sufficient to assure that the offering has come to rest in the state or
territory in which the issuer resides and thereby preserve the local character of the offering. We
note that states are free to impose any additional requirements they believe are necessary to
protect the residents of their states, including imposing further transfer restrictions on securities
issued under amended Rule 147 or new Rule 147A similar to that required under Rule 144(a)(3).
In addition, persons reselling securities will need to consider whether they could be an
“underwriter” if they acquired the securities with a view to “distribution” or if they are

Proposed Amendments

The proposed Rule 147 integration safe harbor would include any prior offers or sales of
securities by the issuer, as well as certain subsequent offers or sales of securities by the issuer
occurring within six months after the completion of an offering exempted by Rule 147. As
proposed, offers and sales made pursuant to Rule 147 would not be integrated with:
•

Prior offers or sales of securities; or

•

Subsequent offers or sales of securities that are:
•

Registered under the Act, except as provided in proposed paragraph (h) of Rule
147;

•

Exempt from registration under Regulation A (17 CFR § 230.251 et seq.);

•

Exempt from registration under Rule 701 (17 CFR § 230.701);

•

Comments on the Proposed Amendments

One commenter supported including registered offers and sales and certain other exempt
offerings occurring within six months after completion of the offering in the integration safe
harbor, as proposed. 170 The same commenter did not support providing a safe harbor for any and
all prior offers or sales of securities by the issuer, as proposed in paragraph (g)(1) of the amended
rule, and instead recommended restricting the safe harbor to cover only offers and sales of
securities that take place before the six-month period immediately preceding the Rule 147
offering. 171 While acknowledging that the proposed integration safe harbor is consistent with the
integration safe harbor in Rule 251(c) of Regulation A, the commenter distinguished Regulation
A from Rule 147 by noting that “Regulation A is a quasi-registration subject to regulatory
oversight by the Commission and the states while a Rule 147 offering may be exempt at both the
federal and state level.” In determining an integration safe harbor model to follow, the
commenter indicated it would be better to look to Rule 502(a) of Regulation D, which limits the
safe harbor for private offerings to offers and sales occurring either six months before, or six
months after, a Regulation D offering. 172
On the other hand, two commenters believed that Rule 147 offerings should not be

offers or sales of securities by or for the issuer that are of the same or a similar class as those offered or sold
under Regulation D, other than those offers or sales of securities under an employee benefit plan as defined
in Rule 405 under the Act.” 17 CFR 230.502(a).

integrated with any other exempt offerings. 173 One of these commenters recommended that Rule
147 contain language expressly stating that an offering made in reliance on Rule 147 will not be
integrated with another exempt offering made concurrently, provided that each offering meets
the requirements of the claimed exemption. 174
c.

Final Rules

After considering the comments, we are adopting amendments to the integration safe
harbor under Rule 147 and providing an identical integration safe harbor provision in new Rule
147A, substantially as proposed. The integration safe harbor will cover any prior offers or sales
of securities by the issuer, as well as certain subsequent offers or sales of securities by the issuer
occurring after the completion of an offering pursuant to Rule 147 or Rule 147A, as applicable.
Accordingly, offers and sales made pursuant to Rules 147 and 147A will not be integrated with:
•

Offers or sales of securities made prior to the commencement of offers and sales of
securities pursuant to Rules 147 or 147A; or

•

Offers or sales of securities made after completion of offers and sales pursuant to Rules
147 or 147A that are:
•

Registered under the Securities Act, except as provided in Rule 147(h) or Rule
147A(h);

•

Exempt from registration under Regulation A (17 CFR § 230.251 et seq.);

•

Exempt from registration under Rule 701 (17 CFR § 230.701);

•

Made pursuant to an employee benefit plan;

Exempt from registration under Regulation S (17 CFR §§ 230.901 through

•

or

•

Made more than six months after the completion of an offering conducted
pursuant to Rules 147 or 147A. 175

As discussed in the Proposing Release, integration safe harbors provide issuers, particularly
smaller issuers whose capital needs often change, with greater certainty about their eligibility to
comply with an exemption from Securities Act registration. 176 Consistent with the proposal and
the approach taken in Rule 251(c) of Regulation A, the safe harbor from integration provided by
Rule 147(g) and Rule 147A(g) will expressly provide that any offer or sale made in reliance on
the respective rules will not be integrated with any other offer or sale made either before the
commencement of, or more than six months after the completion of, the respective intrastate
offerings under either Rule 147 or Rule 147A. For transactions that fall within the scope of the
safe harbor, issuers will not have to conduct an integration analysis of the terms of any offering
being conducted under the other specified provisions in order to determine whether the two
offerings would be treated as one for purposes of qualifying for either exemption. 177 While one
commenter recommended that the Commission adopt a safe harbor more closely aligned with the

175

See Rules 147(g) and 147A(g).

176

See Proposing Release at Section II.B.4.d. (Integration); see also 2015 Regulation A Release at Section
II.B.5. (Integration).

177

The issuer will, however, need to comply with the requirements of each exemption that it is relying upon.
For example, an offering made pursuant to Rule 506(b) will not be integrated with a subsequent offering
pursuant to Rule 147A, but the issuer will need to comply with the requirements of each rule, including the
limitation on general solicitation for offers made pursuant to Rule 506(b).

49

provisions of Rule 502(a) of Regulation D, 178 we believe the integration safe harbor in Rule
251(c) of Regulation A is more consistent with the Commission’s post-JOBS Act approach to
integration that has evolved since the adoption of Regulation D in 1982 to better articulate the
principles underlying the integration doctrine in light of current offering practices and
developments in information and communication technology. 179 As we explained in the
Proposing Release, we believe that our approach to integration will provide issuers with greater
certainty as to the availability of an exemption for a given offering and increase consistency in
the application of the integration doctrine among the exemptive rules available to smaller issuers,
while preserving important investor protections provided in each exemption. 180
The bright-line integration safe harbor we are adopting in amended Rule 147(g) and new
Rule 147A(g) will assist issuers, particularly smaller issuers, in analyzing certain transactions,
but will not address the issue of potential offers or sales that occur concurrently with, or close in
time after, a Rule 147 or 147A offering. There is no presumption that offerings outside the
integration safe harbors should be integrated. Rather, whether concurrent or subsequent offers
and sales of securities will be integrated with any securities offered or sold pursuant to amended
Rule 147 or new Rule 147A will depend on the particular facts and circumstances, including
whether each offering complies with the requirements of the exemption that is being relied upon
for the particular offering. 181 For example, an issuer conducting a concurrent exempt offering

See also, Regulation Crowdfunding Adopting Release.

180

See Proposing Release at text accompanying note 103. See also Rule 251(c) of Regulation A [17 CFR
230.251(c)]; Rule 701 [17 CFR 230.701]. Each exemption is designed based on a particular type of offer
and investor, with corresponding requirements that must be satisfied.

181

The integration concept was first articulated by the Commission in 1933 and was further developed in two
interpretive releases issued in the 1960s. See SEC Rel. No. 33-97 (Dec. 28, 1933); SEC Rel. No. 33-4434
(Dec. 6, 1961); SEC Rel. No. 33-4552 (Nov. 6, 1962). The interpretive releases stated that determining
whether a particular securities offering should be integrated with another offering requires an analysis of

50

for which general solicitation is not permitted will need to be satisfied that purchasers in that
offering were not solicited by means of the offering made in reliance on Rule 147 or new Rule
147A. 182 If an offer fails to comply with the requirements of the exemption, and the offer is not
registered and no other exemption is available, that offer would be in violation of Section 5 of
the Securities Act.
Amended Rule 147, as a safe harbor under Section 3(a)(11), will continue to prohibit outof-state offers to any person not residing in the same state or territory in which the issuer is
resident. Accordingly, an issuer conducting a concurrent exempt offering for which general
solicitation is permitted across state lines would be unlikely to comply with the in-state offer
restriction in Rule 147(b). 183 For example, issuers relying on amended Rule 147 will not be able
to conduct a concurrent Regulation Crowdfunding offering, since by its nature a Regulation

the specific facts and circumstances of the offerings. The Commission identified five factors to consider in
making the determination of whether the offerings should be integrated. See SEC Rel. No. 33-4552 (Nov.
6, 1962). See also Rule 502(a) of Regulation D. More recently, the Commission has provided additional
guidance to help issuers evaluate whether two offerings should be integrated. In 2007, the Commission
provided a framework for analyzing how an issuer can conduct simultaneous registered and private
offerings. See SEC Release No. 33-8828 (Aug. 3, 2007) [72 FR 45116 (Aug. 10, 2007)]. In 2015, when
implementing provisions of the JOBS Act, the Commission applied this framework to concurrent exempt
offerings, including situations where one offering permits general solicitation and the other does not. See
2015 Regulation A Release at Section II.B.5 and Regulation Crowdfunding Adopting Release at Section
II.A.1.c. In those releases, the Commission noted that an offering made pursuant to Regulation A or
Regulation Crowdfunding should not be integrated with another exempt offering made by the issuer,
provided that each offering complies with the requirements of the exemption that is being relied upon for
the particular offering. Id.
182

For a concurrent offering under Rule 506(b), purchasers in the Rule 506(b) offering could not be solicited
by means of a general solicitation under Rule 147 or new Rule 147A. The issuer would need an alternative
means of establishing how purchasers in the Rule 506(b) offering were solicited. For example, the issuer
may have had a preexisting substantive relationship with such purchasers. Otherwise, the solicitation
conducted in connection with the Rule 147 or Rule 147A offering would very likely preclude reliance on
Rule 506(b). See also SEC Rel. No. 33-8828 (Aug. 3, 2007) [72 FR 45116 (Aug. 10, 2007)].

183

See Rule 147(b).

51

Crowdfunding offering would involve a multistate offer due to the offering terms being made
publicly available from an intermediary’s online platform. 184
An issuer relying on the new Rule 147A exemption, which permits multi-state offers,
may conduct a concurrent exempt offering for which general solicitation is permitted, so long as
the issuer complies with the legend and disclosure requirements of Rule 147A(f), as well as any
additional restrictions on the general solicitation required by the other exemption concurrently
being relied upon by the issuer. For example, the limitations imposed on advertising the terms of
the offering pursuant to Rule 204 of Regulation Crowdfunding would limit the issuer’s general
solicitation in a concurrent offering made pursuant to Rule 147A. Similarly, an issuer
conducting a concurrent Rule 506(c) offering could not include in its Rule 506(c) general
solicitation materials an advertisement of a concurrent Rule 147A offering, unless that
advertisement also included the disclosure required by, and otherwise complied with, paragraph
(f) of Rule 147A. 185
As discussed in the Proposing Release, we are mindful of the risk that offers made
pursuant to an exemption shortly before a registration statement is filed could be viewed as
conditioning the market for that registered offering. Accordingly, final Rules 147 and 147A will
exclude from the safe harbor any such offer made to persons other than qualified institutional
buyers and institutional accredited investors within the 30-day period before a registration
statement is filed with the Commission.186 Commission staff expects to review issuer

184

For the same reasons, issuers will not be able to rely on amended Rule 147 and conduct concurrent
Regulation A offerings or registered public offerings.

185

See Rule 147A(f); see also discussion in Section II.A.1.

186

See Rules 147(h) and 147A(h). In such circumstances, whether an offer made within the thirty-day period
before the filing of a registration statement constitutes an impermissible offer for purpose of Securities Act
Section 5(c) will be based on the facts and circumstances of such offer.

and new Rule 147A. 187
6. Disclosures to Investors
a.

Proposed Amendments

We proposed to retain the substance of the disclosure requirements of current
Rule 147(f)(3), in modified form. As proposed, Rule 147(f)(3) would require issuers to make
specified disclosures to offerees and purchasers about the limitations on resale contained in
proposed Rule 147(e) and to include the legend set forth in proposed Rule 147(f)(1)(i) on the
certificate or other document evidencing the offered security. Although the disclosure should be
prominently disclosed to each offeree and purchaser at the time any offer or sale is made by the
issuer to such person, the proposed amendments would no longer require that such disclosure be
made in writing in all instances. Instead, the proposed amendments would require issuers to
provide the required disclosure to offerees in the same manner in which an offer is
communicated, while continuing to require written disclosure to all purchasers. In addition, the
proposed amendments would no longer require issuers to disclose to offerees and purchasers the
stop transfer instructions provided by an issuer to its transfer agent 188 or the provisions of
Rule 147(f)(2) regarding the issuance of new certificates during the Rule 147(e) resale period. 189
b.

Comments on the Proposed Amendments

Two commenters supported the proposal to include in the text of the amended rule the
specific language of the required disclosure. 190 These commenters also stated that all offerees

53

and purchasers should continue to receive written disclosures, rather than, as proposed,
permitting offerees to receive oral disclosures if the offer is communicated orally. 191
c.

Final Rules

After considering the comments, we are adopting amendments to Rule 147 and a
provision in new Rule 147A that will require issuers to make specified disclosures to offerees
and purchasers about the limitations on resale contained in Rules 147(e) and 147A(e),
respectively. Issuers will also be required to meet the legend requirement of Rules 147(f)(1)(i)
and 147A(f)(1)(i), respectively. Although the disclosure should be prominently disclosed to each
offeree and purchaser at the time any offer or sale is made by the issuer to such person,
consistent with the proposal, the amendment and new rule will not require that such disclosure be
made in writing in all instances.
While two commenters recommended that we require issuers to provide all offerees
written disclosures, rather than permitting offerees to receive oral disclosures if the offer is
communicated orally, 192 we are not adopting that requirement in our rules. We believe the
approach we are adopting—requiring issuers to provide the disclosure to offerees in the same
manner in which an offer is communicated—will provide appropriate flexibility to issuers in the
conduct of their offerings and avoid potential confusion as to when, for example, an oral offer
must be followed up with a written disclosure. 193 Requiring the disclosure to be made orally if
the offer is made orally also will help ensure that the investor receives the required disclosure
when most relevant (i.e., immediately upon learning about the offer). Furthermore, we believe

191

Id.

192

Id.

54

our amendments to Rule 147(f)(3) and the provision in new Rule 147A(f)(3) will maintain
appropriate investor protections, especially in light of the new provision requiring issuers to
provide written disclosure to all purchasers within a reasonable period of time before the date of
sale. We note that this requirement to provide written disclosure a reasonable period of time
before the date of sale is consistent with the disclosure delivery requirements of Regulation D
and Rule 701. 194 Finally, while we are not adopting commenters’ suggestions to require that
written disclosure be provided to all offerees, nothing in our rules prevents state regulators, that
deem it necessary and appropriate, from requiring such written disclosures for offers to residents
within their states. State regulators are in a position to tailor any such rules to their local capital
markets in a manner that addresses capital market practices and investor protection measures
they deem appropriate for offers and sales to residents of their state.
Consistent with the proposal, issuers will also be required to satisfy the legend
requirement in Rules 147(f)(1)(i) and 147A(f)(1)(i), respectively. However, issuers will not be
required to disclose to offerees and purchasers the stop transfer instructions provided by an issuer
to its transfer agent 195 or the provisions of Rules 147(f)(2) and 147A(f)(2), respectively,
regarding the issuance of new certificates during the resale period. 196 Although issuers will have
to comply with these transfer agent instruction requirements, 197 we continue to believe that

193

In addition, it may not be possible for an issuer to provide written disclosures to all offerees. For example,
an issuer conducting an offer over the radio would not be able to provide the written disclosures to
everyone listening to the offer on the radio as it would not know the identity of each of the offerees.

194

See e.g., Rules 501(i)(4) and 502(b)(1) of Regulation D and Rule 701(e).

195

See 17 CFR 230.147(f)(1)(ii).

196

See 17 CFR 230.147(f)(2). Additionally, as discussed in Section II.B.1 above, we are requiring issuers in
offerings conducted pursuant to Rule 147 or Rule 147A to disclose to each offeree in the manner in which
any offer is communicated and to each purchaser of a security in writing that sales will be made only to
residents of the same state or territory as the issuer. See Rules 147(f)(3) and 147A(f)(3).

197

See Rules 147(f)(1)(ii), 147(f)(2), 147A(f)(1)(ii) and 147A(f)(2).

55

requiring issuers to disclose information regarding such requirements to offerees and purchasers
at the time of the offer and/or sale will not enhance the disclosure requirements under Rules
147(e), 147A(e), 147(f)(1) or 147A(f)(1), and we therefore are eliminating the disclosure
requirements related to stop transfer instructions and the issuance of new certificates from Rule
147 and not including them in new Rule 147A. 198
Finally, in order for the required disclosure to offerees and purchasers under amended
Rule 147(f) and new Rule 147A(f) to be as clear as possible, and consistent with our revisions to
make the issuer’s state of residency the focus of the relevant resale restrictions, we are adding a
requirement that the issuer identify in this disclosure the particular state or territory in which the
issuer was resident at the time of the original sale of the security. Since a small business may
change the location of its residence and principal activities within the six-month resale limitation
period provided for in amended Rule 147(e) and new Rule 147A(e), we believe this information,
which should be readily available to the issuer, will assist purchasers in understanding the
implications of the applicable resale restrictions.
7. State Law Requirements
a.

Proposed Amendments

We proposed to limit the availability of Rule 147 to issuers that have registered an
offering in the state in which all of the purchasers are resident or that conduct the offering
pursuant to an exemption from state law registration in such state that limits the amount of
securities an issuer may sell pursuant to such exemption to no more than $5 million in a twelvemonth period and that limits the amount of securities an investor can purchase in any such

198

See Rules 147(f)(3) and 147A(f)(3).

56

offering. 199 In the Proposing Release, we expressed our preliminary view that, in light of the
other proposed changes to Rule 147, including a maximum offering amount limitation and
investment limitations in the rule would provide investors with additional protection and would
be consistent with existing state law crowdfunding provisions. 200
b.

Comments on the Proposed Amendments

All commenters that addressed the issue opposed any limits at the federal level on
offering size or investment size. 201 In general, these commenters preferred that any limits be
imposed through the state legislative and/or rulemaking process, which they stated may be better
situated to making a determination about specific limits.202 Commenters also stated that the
requirements are unnecessary at the federal level since these are local offerings where only the
individual state’s residents are involved. 203 One of these commenters noted the potential
disparate impact on larger versus smaller states with different resident populations and gross
domestic products. 204 Another of these commenters noted that, in addition to the regulation of
these offerings at the state level, to the extent federal regulatory oversight is deemed necessary,
these offerings are also subject to the Commission’s powers to enforce the antifraud provisions

of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. 205 Another of these
commenters stated that the baseline cost of the proposed federal requirements may prevent state
policy makers from adding investor protection provisions that the states consider to be more
effective due to the cumulative compliance burden. 206 In addition, the 2015 Small Business
Forum recommended that the Commission remove the $5 million limit in the proposal,
permitting the states to set their own limits as appropriate. 207
A few commenters stated that, if the proposed limits were retained, any limit on the
amount a company can raise under Rule 147 should be indexed for inflation, 208 with one of these
commenters suggesting an automatic, periodic review of any such limits. 209 One commenter
strongly encouraged the Commission to raise the offering limit significantly. 210 Two
commenters believed that, if the proposed limits were retained, Rule 147 should be amended to
require that the offering, not the state exemption, be limited to no more than $5 million in order
to allow issuers to rely upon existing state law exemptions. 211 One of these commenters also
suggested that, if the proposed investment limits were retained, the Commission should establish
them as direct requirements of amended Rule 147 and should only apply them to non-accredited
investors. 212

Final Rules

Given the comments received, the recommendations of the 2015 Small Business Forum
and the intrastate nature of the offerings, we are not limiting amended Rule 147 and new Rule
147A to offerings that either are registered in the state where all of the purchasers are resident or
that are conducted pursuant to an exemption from state law registration in a state that limits the
amount of securities an issuer may sell pursuant to such exemption to no more than $5 million in
a twelve-month period and that limits the amount of securities an investor can purchase in any
such offering. Consistent with the policy underlying Section 3(a)(11), we believe it appropriate
that the resident investor protections in intrastate offerings primarily flow from the requirements
of state securities law. For example, as with the federal securities laws, states generally require
an issuer to register an offering with appropriate state authorities when offers or sales of
securities are made to their residents, unless the state has adopted, by rule or statute, an
exemption from registration. As noted in the Proposing Release, of the states that have adopted
and/or enacted crowdfunding provisions that require an issuer to comply with Rule 147, either
alone or in conjunction with Section 3(a)(11), no state has adopted and/or enacted a
crowdfunding provision with an aggregate offering amount that exceeds $5 million.213
Additionally, almost all of these states have adopted provisions that impose investment
limitations on investors.
In light of these existing limitations in state exemptions and the fact that all commenters
opposed our proposed limits at the federal level on offering size and investment size, we are not

213

See http://www.nasaa.org/industry-resources/corporation-finance/instrastate-crowdfunding-resourcecenter/intrastate-crowdfunding-directory/. Illinois is the only state with a crowdfunding provision
allowing for a maximum aggregate offering amount up to $5 million in a twelve-month period. All other
states that have adopted some form of a state-based crowdfunding provision limit the aggregate offering

59

adopting the proposed federal limits on state exemptions. As commenters noted, states can
decide whether to adopt requirements not specifically contemplated by the federal requirements
that are consistent with their respective interests in facilitating capital formation and protecting
their resident investors in intrastate securities offerings within their jurisdiction. 214 If any states
determine to amend their statutes and/or rules to require compliance with new Rule 147A, those
states can consider whether any additional requirements should be adopted at the state level
given their interest in regulating local offerings within their jurisdiction. Moreover, in addition
to state securities law requirements, issuers will continue to be subject to the antifraud and civil
liability provisions of the federal securities laws.
C.

Additional Considerations
In addition to soliciting specific comments on the proposals, we also solicited general

comments, including additional or different revisions to the rules and other matters that may
impact the proposals.
1. Notice Filings
Commenters were divided on whether to require issuers utilizing the exemption to make
a notice filing with the Commission. While one commenter specifically stated that additional
federal administrative obligations, such as new minimum disclosure or delivery requirements,
registration and/or additional filings with the Commission, should not be imposed on issuers for
conducting intrastate crowdfunding, 215 another commenter recommended that the Commission

amount to between $1 million and $2.5 million. See ILLINOIS HOUSE BILL 3429, § 4.T. (2015), available at
https://legiscan.com/IL/text/HB3429/id/1257029.
214

States currently employ this approach to varying degrees in their respective state crowdfunding statutes.
See, e.g., D.C. MUN. REGS. tit. 26-B, § 250 (2014) (escrow required until minimum offering amount
satisfied), IND. CODE § 6-3.1-24-14 (2014) (funding portal required).

215

60

require issuers utilizing Rule 147 to file a notice with the Commission, but (similar to
Regulation D) the exemption should not be conditioned on the filing. 216 Given the local
intrastate nature of the exemptions, we continue to believe that the limited benefits of a notice
filing with the Commission would not justify the costs and burdens on issuers to add such a
requirement. We note, however, that states could make a notice filing (at the state level) a
condition to any state law exemption. 217 In this regard, we note that a vast majority of intrastate
crowdfunding provisions require a notice filing with a state regulator. 218 Commission staff will
seek to collaborate with state regulators to consider filing data in connection with the study of
amended Rule 147 and new Rule 147A. 219
2. Intrastate Broker Dealer Exemption
Exchange Act Section 15(a)(1) exempts from broker-dealer registration requirements
under Section 15(b) a broker-dealer whose business is exclusively intrastate and who does not
use any facility of a national securities exchange (“intrastate broker-dealer exemption”). 220
Several commenters supported interpreting the intrastate broker-dealer exemption under the
Exchange Act to include intermediaries whose activities are limited to facilitating intrastate

216

Campbell Letter.

217

See NASAA Letter.

218

E.g., Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Kansas,
Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New
Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia,
Wisconsin, Wyoming and the District of Columbia. Other states have pending legislation that would
require notice filings for intrastate crowdfunded offerings, e.g., California, Hawaii, Missouri, Nevada, and
New Hampshire.

219

See Section I above.

220

Under Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, it is generally unlawful for any broker or dealer to use any
means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to effect any transaction in, or to induce or attempt to
induce the purchase or sale of, any security (other than an exempt security) unless the broker or dealer is
registered with the Commission. Section 15(a)(1) provides an exemption from registration for “a broker or
dealer whose business is exclusively intrastate and who does not make use of any facility of a national
securities exchange.”

61

offerings using the Internet. 221 One commenter was concerned that intrastate intermediaries
operating exclusively online may not qualify for the intrastate exemption from registration if
they post information on the Internet and it is accessed by out-of-state residents. 222 The
commenter, therefore, suggested that the Commission clarify that an entity will not relinquish its
ability to rely on the intrastate broker-dealer exemption solely because it has a web presence, as
long as it continues to operate and conduct sales intrastate. 223 Two commenters similarly
suggested that intrastate intermediaries should be able to rely on the intrastate broker-dealer
exemption from broker-dealer registration if they use the Internet to facilitate offerings being
conducted in reliance on Rule 147. 224
We agree with the commenters that it would be helpful to provide guidance regarding the
use of the Internet by a person that seeks to rely on the intrastate broker-dealer exemption. 225 In
providing this guidance, we are seeking to take into account the contemporary business practices

221

See NASAA Letter; NextSeed Letter; WBA Letter. The commenters were focused, in particular, on
intermediaries that facilitate intrastate crowdfunding offerings using the Internet.

222

NASAA Letter. This commenter noted that an SEC staff Guide to Broker-Dealer Registration indicates
that information posted on the Internet that is accessible by persons in another state would be considered an
interstate offer of securities and would require federal broker-dealer registration. See id. See also Guide to
Broker-Dealer Registration, Division of Trading and Markets, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(Apr. 2008), available at https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/bdguide.htm. The Commission has not
previously spoken to this issue, and the guidance in this release is intended to take into account modern
business practices of broker-dealers and clarify the permissibility of the use of the Internet by brokerdealers relying on the intrastate broker-dealer exemption. To the extent the staff guidance is inconsistent, it
is superseded.

223

See NASAA Letter. The commenter also suggested that intrastate broker-dealers be permitted to advertise
and use the Internet without having to register with the Commission so long as they used certain
disclaimers. Id.

224

NextSeed Letter (“[S]tate crowdfunding intermediaries should be permitted to use the internet to facilitate
intrastate crowdfunding offerings pursuant to Rule 147 and still be able to rely on the intrastate brokerdealer exemption.”); WBA Letter (“If crowdfunding offerings conducted in accordance with amended Rule
147 are intrastate in nature, then state crowdfunding portals which exclusively host such offerings should
be deemed to conduct ‘exclusively intrastate’ business under [Section] 15(a)(1).”).

225

Although commenters focused on broker-dealers who facilitate intrastate crowdfunding offerings, we are
providing more general guidance not limited to offerings relying upon intrastate crowdfunding provisions
under state law.

62

of broker-dealers, which have evolved over the years to include as a routine matter the use of the
Internet as an essential tool in conducting business. As noted elsewhere, the actions we are
taking today are intended to facilitate capital formation, while maintaining appropriate investor
protections. We believe that a broker-dealer whose business otherwise meets the requirements of
the intrastate broker-dealer exemption should not cease to qualify for the intrastate broker-dealer
exemption solely because it has a website that may be viewed by out-of-state persons, so long as
the broker-dealer takes measures reasonably designed to ensure that its business remains
exclusively intrastate. 226 The use of disclaimers clearly indicating that the broker-dealer’s
business is exclusively intrastate and that the broker-dealer can only act for or with, and provide
broker-dealer services to, a person in its state could be one means reasonably designed to ensure
that the broker-dealer’s business remains exclusively intrastate so long as the broker-dealer does
not provide brokerage services to a person that indicates that it is, or that the broker-dealer has
reason to believe is, not within the broker-dealer’s state of residence. 227 These measures are not

226

As noted, Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act provides an exemption from registration for “a broker or
dealer whose business is exclusively intrastate.” Our guidance today is intended to provide clarity
regarding when a broker-dealer’s business will be “exclusively intrastate” in connection with its use of the
Internet. As discussed in this section of this release, a broker-dealer with a website that may be viewed by
an out-of-state person may still be able to rely on the intrastate exemption if the broker-dealer implements
measures reasonably designed to ensure that its business remains exclusively intrastate. This guidance is
separate and apart from the question of whether a security may be offered and sold on the broker-dealer’s
website in reliance on an exemption from registration under Section 5 of the Securities Act. In this regard,
we note that an offer in the context of the Securities Act has generally been defined broadly, and the
considerations involved in determining whether an offer includes an impermissible general solicitation are
necessarily distinct from the considerations as to whether a broker-dealer’s activities occur exclusively
within a single state. Therefore, a broker-dealer facilitating an offering pursuant to an exemption from
registration under the Securities Act should be careful not to engage in activity that would compromise the
issuer’s ability to rely on the applicable exemption to Securities Act Section 5. See, e.g., Rules 147 and
147A, including paragraphs (d) and (f) and the Instruction to paragraph (d).

227

This guidance is consistent with the concepts articulated in prior Commission guidance for foreign brokerdealers. See Interpretation: Re: Use of Internet Web Sites to Offer Securities, Solicit Securities
Transactions, or Advertise Investment Services Offshore, SEC Rel. No. 33-7516 (Mar. 23, 1998)
(“Offshore Interpretation”). In the Offshore Interpretation, the Commission stated that it would not
consider a foreign broker-dealer’s advertising on an Internet website to constitute an attempt to induce a
securities transaction with U.S. persons if the foreign broker-dealer takes measures reasonably designed to
ensure that it does not effect securities transactions with U.S. persons as a result of its Internet activities.

63

intended to be exclusive. A broker-dealer could adopt other measures reasonably designed to
ensure that it does not provide brokerage services to persons that are not within the same state as
the broker-dealer. We do not believe, however, that an intermediary’s business would be
“exclusively intrastate” if it sold securities or provided any other brokerage services to a person
that indicates that it is, or that the broker-dealer has reason to believe is, not within the brokerdealer’s state of residence. 228 We believe that this guidance will facilitate capital formation by
smaller companies while maintaining appropriate protections for investors. 229 This guidance
also is consistent with, and will further, the goal of modernizing our rules to comport with
contemporary business practices.
3. Section 12(g) Registration
Several commenters recommended exempting securities issued in reliance upon Rule 147
from the reporting requirements of Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. 230 Most of these
commenters asserted that the Rule 147 exemption would be of limited utility if the securities
were not exempted from Section 12(g). 231 In addition, the 2015 Small Business Forum

The Commission further stated that, as applied in the broker-dealer context, a foreign broker-dealer
generally would be considered to have taken measures reasonably designed to ensure it does not effect
securities transactions with U.S. persons as a result of its Internet activities if it: (i) posts a prominent
disclaimer on the website either affirmatively delineating the countries in which the broker-dealer's services
are available, or stating that the services are not available to U.S. persons; and (ii) refuses to provide
brokerage services to any potential customer that the broker-dealer has reason to believe is, or that indicates
that it is, a U.S. person, based on residence, mailing address, payment method, or other grounds.
228

See, e.g., In the Matter of Professional Investors, Inc., 37 S.E.C. 173, 175-176 (1956) (indicating that a
broker-dealer that effected transactions on national securities exchanges for its customers and its own
account and, as an underwriter, sold stock on behalf of an out-of-state issuer no longer had an exclusively
intrastate business and the intrastate exemption from registration as a broker-dealer was therefore not
available); Peoples Securities Company, 39 S.E.C. 641, 652-653 (1960) (stating that a broker-dealer’s
business was not exclusively intrastate based on its interstate activities, which included sales of securities to
out-of-state residents), aff'd sub nom. Peoples Securities Co. v. S.E.C., 289 F.2d 268 (C.A. 5, 1961).

229

Commission staff expects to consider the role of intrastate broker-dealers and other intermediaries in
offerings under amended Rule 147 or new Rule 147A in connection with its study. See Section I above.

recommended that the Commission provide a permanent exemption from Section 12(g)
registration under the Exchange Act for securities sold in a Rule 147 offering. 232 As amended by
the JOBS Act, Section 12(g) requires, among other things, that an issuer with total assets
exceeding $10,000,000 and a class of securities held of record by either 2,000 persons or 500
persons who are not accredited investors to register such class of securities with the
Commission. 233
Section 12(g) was originally enacted by Congress as a way to ensure that purchasers of
over-the-counter securities about which there was little or no information, but which had a
significant shareholder base, were provided with ongoing information about their investment. 234
Unlike Tier 2 offerings under Regulation A 235 or Regulation Crowdfunding, 236 where the
Commission provided conditional exemptions from registration under Section 12(g), issuers that
utilize the exemptions under amended Rule 147 or new Rule 147A will not be required to
comply with ongoing reporting requirements. Given the lack of ongoing reporting requirements,
we believe that the Section 12(g) record holder and asset thresholds continue to provide an
important baseline above which issuers should generally be subject to the disclosure obligations
of the Exchange Act. As the shareholder base of these issuers and their total assets grow, we

232

See 2015 Small Business Forum Recommendations.

233

See Section 501 of the JOBS Act. See also 17 CFR 240.12g-1. In the case of an issuer that is a bank, a
savings and loan holding company or a bank holding company, Exchange Act Section 12(g)(1)(B) (15
U.S.C. 78l(g)(1)(B)) requires, among other things, that the issuer, if it has total assets exceeding
$10,000,000 and a class of securities held of record by 2,000 persons, register such class of securities with
the Commission. See Section 601 of the JOBS Act and Section 85001 of the FAST Act. See also 17 CFR
240.12g-1.

believe that the additional protections that will be provided by registration under Section 12(g)
are necessary and appropriate.
4. Exclusion of Investment Companies
In the proposing release, we asked whether we should leave existing Rule 147 in place
and unchanged as a safe harbor under Section 3(a)(11) while adopting the proposed revisions to
Rule 147 as a new rule, and if so, whether we should make any additional changes to the
proposed rule. One commenter that recommended retaining the existing Rule 147 safe harbor
and adopting a new exemption also recommended that the new exemption exclude investment
companies subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”), 237
including private equity funds, from relying upon Rule 147. 238 Under Section 24(d) of the
Investment Company Act, 239 the Section 3(a)(11) exemption is not available for an investment
company registered or required to be registered under the Investment Company Act. 240 Since we
are retaining Rule 147 as a safe harbor under Section 3(a)(11), Rule 147 will continue to be
unavailable for an investment company registered or required to be registered under the
Investment Company Act. To provide a consistent treatment between Rule 147 and new Rule
147A, we are specifically excluding an issuer that is an investment company registered or
required to be registered under the Investment Company Act from relying on Rule 147A. 241 As

239

15 U.S.C. 80a-24(d).

240

See 1961 Release at note 1.

241

See Rule 147A(a). Investment companies are companies that are registered or required to be registered
under the Investment Company Act. 15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq. Private funds (including private equity funds
and other pooled investment vehicles) generally rely on the exclusions from the definition of “investment
company” in Sections 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. See 15 U.S.C. 80a-3(c). Private
funds are precluded from relying on either of these exclusions if they make a public offering of their
securities. Id. Accordingly, if such a private fund engaged in a public offering of its securities, that private
fund would no longer be able to rely on the applicable exclusion under Section 3(c)(1) or (7) and thus

66

described above, the final rules maintain a consistent approach across the two intrastate offering
exemptions, where possible, including with respect to issuer eligibility. In addition, this same
commenter also recommended excluding other types of issuers from Rule 147. 242 Since these
other types of issuers are not excluded from existing Rule 147 and because we believe that,
absent specific Congressional direction or evidence of abuse, the states should have the
discretion to determine whether any additional restrictions are appropriate for offerings
conducted exclusively within their jurisdiction, we are not amending Rule 147 or including a
provision in Rule 147A to exclude other types of issuers from these provisions.
5. Trust Indenture Act
Two commenters supported exempting securities issued in reliance upon Rule 147, as
proposed to be amended, from the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. 243 Rule 147 offerings are
exempt from the Trust Indenture Act pursuant to Section 304(a)(4) which exempts any security
issued in reliance on Section 3(a)(11) of the Securities Act. 244 Since the Trust Indenture Act
applies to any debt security sold through the use of the mails or interstate commerce, including
debt securities sold in transactions that are exempt from Securities Act registration, the issuance
of a debt security under new Rule 147A, as a new exemption not under Section 3(a)(11), raises
questions about the applicability of the Trust Indenture Act. We note, however, that Trust

would be required to be registered under the Investment Company Act, unless another exclusion or
exemption is available. As a result, the private fund would be an “investment company” for purposes of
Section 24(d) and would be excluded from the Section 3(a)(11) exemption and safe harbor of existing Rule
147.
242

Specifically, NASAA also recommended excluding the following types of issuers from the exemption:
holding companies (i.e., companies whose principal purpose is owning stock in, or supervising the
management of, other companies); blind pools; commodity pools; public companies reporting under the
Exchange Act; and blank check companies (i.e., development stage companies that either have no specific
business plan or purpose or have indicated that their business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition
with an unidentified company or companies or other entity or person).

243

NextSeed Letter; WBA Letter.

67

Indenture Act Section 304(a)(8) 245 and Rule 4a-1 246 provide an exemption for the issuance of up
to $50 million of debt securities without an indenture in any 12-month period. Given the
existing exemption for up to $50 million of debt securities, we do not believe that a specific
exemption from the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act for offerings of debt securities under
Rule 147A is necessary at this time.
6. Other Requirements
Two commenters recommended that the Commission work with the states to encourage,
or amend Rule 147 in a way that encourages, issuers to use any U.S. escrow agent, as opposed to
using only escrow agents registered in the state of the offering, which is often a requirement of
state law. 247 Another commenter recommended amending Rule 147 to include bad actor
disqualification provisions similar to those set forth under Rule 506(d). 248
As noted elsewhere, the amendments we are adopting today are intended to facilitate
capital formation, while maintaining appropriate investor protections and providing state
securities regulators with the flexibility to add additional investor protections they deem
appropriate for offerings within their state. Moreover, a broad consensus of commenters
opposed additional requirements for exempt intrastate offerings beyond those currently
contemplated by our rules. 249 State legislatures and/or securities regulators have a significant
interest in intrastate offerings made to their residents and therefore may wish to impose, and are
uniquely positioned to determine, additional requirements they deem necessary or appropriate for

the protection of their residents. Consistent with our approach to other aspects of the final rules,
we believe it is appropriate in these circumstances to defer to the states regarding which, if any,
of the additional provisions recommended by commenters should supplement the federal rules.
In this regard, we note that bad actor disqualification provisions are a feature of most state
crowdfunding exemptions. 250 In addition, a majority of states have adopted the Uniform Limited
Offering Exemption (“ULOE”), or a variant of that uniform exemption. 251 The ULOE includes a
bad actor disqualification provision. 252 Other state exemptions include bad actor disqualification
provisions, 253 and the small corporate offering registration (“SCOR”) program 254 also
contemplates disqualification of an issuer or any of its officers, directors, principal stockholders
or promoters because of prior violations of the securities laws. We believe that state and federal

and the Small Offering Exemption in Washington, WAC 460-44A-504.

Forty-three states, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico have adopted some
form of the SCOR program or recognize the filing of Form U-7 (also referred to as uniform limited offering
registration (“ULOR”)). See CCH Blue Sky Law Reporter, Blue Sky Findings Lists, Small Corporate
Offering Registration Program and Form U-7, ¶ 6461 (2016). SCOR and Form U-7 were developed by
NASAA as a registration format for companies registering securities under state securities laws when
relying upon an exemption from Securities Act registration, including Rule 504. A company may not use
the SCOR Form to offer and sell its securities if the company or any of its officers, directors, principal
stockholders or promoters are disqualified because of prior violations of the securities laws. A company
also may not use salespersons who are disqualified because of prior violations of the securities laws. See
SCOR Overview, available from the NASAA website at http://www.nasaa.org/industryresources/corporation-finance/scor-overview/.

regulators share an interest in collaborative efforts that facilitate capital formation and investor
protection. Accordingly, Commission staff will seek to collaborate with state regulators to
review data on the application of state bad actor disqualification provisions in offerings
conducted pursuant to amended Rule 147 or new Rule 147A to inform whether the Commission
should consider including bad actor disqualification provisions in Rules 147 and 147A. 255

AMENDMENTS TO RULES 504 AND 505 OF REGULATION D

A.

Overview of Rules 504 and 505
Rule 504 256 of Regulation D provides issuers with an exemption from registration for

offers and sales of up to $1 million of securities in a twelve-month period, provided that the
issuer is not:
•

subject to reporting pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; 257

•

an investment company; 258 or

•

a development stage company that either has no specific business plan or purpose or that
has indicated that its business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition with an
unidentified company or companies (“blank check company”). 259

Additionally, Rule 504 imposes certain conditions, including limitations on the use of general
solicitation or general advertising in the offering and the restricted status of securities issued
pursuant to the exemption, with limited exceptions for offers and sales made:

exclusively in one or more states that provide for the registration of the securities, and
require the public filing and delivery to investors of a substantive disclosure document
before sale, and are made in accordance with state law requirements;

•

in one or more states that have no provision for the registration of the securities or the
public filing or delivery of a disclosure document before sale, if the securities have been
registered in at least one state that provides for such registration, public filing and
delivery before sale, offers and sales are made in that state in accordance with such
provisions, and the disclosure document is delivered before sale to all purchasers
(including those in the states that have no such procedure); or

•

exclusively according to state law exemptions from registration that permit general
solicitation and general advertising so long as sales are made only to “accredited
investors” as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D. 260
Rule 504, together with Rules 505 and 506, comprise the Securities Act exemptions and

safe harbor in Regulation D. 261 Regulation D offerings are exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act. Offerings conducted pursuant to Rule 504 or Rule 505,
however, must be registered in each state in which they are offered or sold unless an exemption

Investor Exemption,” which was adopted by NASAA in 1997. CCH NASAA Reporter Para. 361.
Generally, the model rule exempts offers and sales of securities from state registration requirements, if
among other matters, the securities are sold only to persons who are, or are reasonably believed to be,
“accredited investors” as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D, 17 CFR 230.501(a). The model rule
restricts transfer of the securities for 12 months after issuance except to other accredited investors or if
registered. General solicitations by any means under that provision are generally limited to a type of
“tombstone” ad. See Model Accredited Investor Exemption, available from the NASAA website at

recently adopted a form of state-based crowdfunding that permits the use of general solicitation
but has provided for an abbreviated state registration procedure where, in addition to following
various state-specific requirements for registration, an issuer also complies with Rule 504 of
Regulation D. 264 Additionally, offerings conducted pursuant to Rules 505 and 506 are subject to
bad actor disqualification provisions, while offerings conducted pursuant to Rule 504 are not
subject to such provisions. 265

Amendments to Rule 504
1.

Proposed Amendments to Rule 504

In an effort to facilitate capital formation, including facilitating the development of
comprehensive regional coordinated review programs at the state level, and enhance investor
protection, we proposed to increase the aggregate amount of securities that may be offered and
sold in any twelve-month period pursuant to Rule 504 from $1 million to $5 million and to
disqualify certain bad actors from participation in Rule 504 offerings. We further proposed a
technical amendment to Rules 504 and 505 to account for the re-designation of Securities Act

Regulation D, under certain circumstances, for failure to file a Form D notice. Rule 508 provides a safe
harbor for certain insignificant deviations from a term, condition, or requirement of Regulation D.
262

Section 18(b)(4)(D) of the Securities Act provides “covered security” status to all securities sold in
transactions exempt from registration under Commission rules promulgated under Section 4(a)(2), which
includes Rule 506 of Regulation D. Covered security status under Section 18 provides for the preemption
of state securities laws registration and qualification requirements for offerings of such securities. In
comparison, securities issued pursuant to either Rules 504 or 505 are not covered securities as these two
exemptions are adopted pursuant to the Commission’s authority under Section 3(b)(1) of the Securities Act.

263

See note 254 above.

264

Of the 34 states and the District of Columbia that have adopted intrastate crowdfunding provisions, only
Maine allows an issuer to rely upon Rule 504 of Regulation D where the issuer is required to file with the
Maine securities regulator in an abbreviated registration procedure. See ME. REV. STAT. tit. 32, § 16304(6A)(D) (2013).

Section 3(b) as Section 3(b)(1) that occurred as a result of the enactment of the JOBS Act in
2012. 266 Additionally, to account for the proposed increase in the Rule 504 aggregate offering
amount limitation, we proposed technical amendments to the notes to Rule 504(b)(2) that would
update the current illustrations in the rule regarding how the aggregate offering limitation is
calculated in the event that an issuer sells securities pursuant to Rule 504 and Rule 505 within
the same twelve-month period. 267

Comments on the Proposed Amendments to Rule 504

Many commenters supported, and no commenters opposed, increasing the Rule 504
offering amount limit from $1 million to $5 million. 268 These commenters stated that increasing
the offering amount limit will allow more small businesses to use this capital raising tool, better
satisfying the needs of these businesses for capital formation and helping to facilitate multi-state
offerings. 269 Several commenters stated that Rule 504 is currently being underutilized, in part,
due to the low offering amount limit of $1 million and the erosion of the dollar’s value due to
inflation since the offering amount limit was last raised in 1988 from $500,000 to $1 million. 270
As Rule 504 allows issuers to conduct an offering in multiple states and provides an opportunity
for states to coordinate a regional review of the offering, commenters stated that an increase in
the Rule 504 offering amount limit will encourage new interstate, regional approaches to
crowdfunding and other small business offerings and will provide greater utility to a regional

review of those offerings. 271 Two commenters stated that the offering amount limit should be
increased to $10 million in order to offset the significant compliance costs involved in state
registration and review. 272 In addition, the 2015 Small Business Forum recommended that the
Commission increase the proposed limit on Rule 504 to $10 million, permitting the states to set
their own limit as appropriate. 273 Another commenter stated that Rule 504 should be
automatically indexed for inflation in order to preserve the utility of the rule from the erosion of
the dollar’s value in real terms. 274 Two commenters stated the Commission should use its
general exemptive authority under Section 28 for future increases in the Rule 504 offering
limitation.275 Several commenters also supported, and no commenters opposed, amending Rule
504 to include bad actor disqualification provisions to provide a more uniform set of bad actor
triggering events across Regulation D. 276
In response to our solicitation for comment on whether to repeal Rule 504(b)(1)(iii) or
amend the rule to place limitations on resale, one commenter recommended that the Commission
not repeal or amend Rule 504(b)(1)(iii), but retain this provision to provide an environment that

and sales of securities that are conducted “according to state law exemptions from registration
that permit general solicitation and general advertising so long as sales are made only to
‘accredited investors’ as defined in Rule 501(a).” Securities sold without registration in reliance
on this provision are not subject to the limitations on resale established in Rule 502(d) and, as
such, are not “restricted securities” for purposes of Rule 144(a)(3)(ii). Another commenter
indicated that “the Commission should consider amending Rule 504 to permit resales of
securities issued in Rule 504 ‘public offerings’ in states where the offering complies with
exemptions that permit general solicitation or advertising and that require dissemination of a
state law compliant disclosure document.” 278
One commenter recommended that the Commission exempt securities sold under Rule
147 and 504 from the requirements of Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 279
In addition, the 2015 Small Business Forum recommended that the Commission provide a
permanent exemption from Section 12(g) registration under the Exchange Act for securities sold
in a Rule 504 offering. 280

The amendments that we are adopting to Rule 504 will raise the aggregate amount of
securities an issuer may offer and sell in any twelve-month period from $1 million to $5 million,
which is the maximum statutorily allowed under Section 3(b)(1). 281 The Commission has not
raised the 12-month aggregate offering amount limit in Rule 504 since 1988, when the
Commission increased the original Rule 504 offering amount limit of $500,000 to $1 million. 282
Adjusted for inflation, the $1 million limit in 1988 would equate to approximately $2 million
today. 283 We believe the $5 million limit will facilitate issuers’ ability to raise capital. We also
believe that our amendments to increase the aggregate offering amount limit in Rule 504 to
$5 million may bolster efforts among the states to enter into, or revise existing, regional
coordinated review programs that are designed to increase efficiencies associated with the
registration of securities offerings in multiple jurisdictions without increasing risks to investors.
Increasing the aggregate offering amount limit from $1 million to $5 million will also increase
the flexibility of state securities regulators to set their own limits and to consider whether any
additional requirements should be implemented at the state level.
Although two commenters and the 2015 Small Business Forum recommended that the
Commission increase the Rule 504 offering amount limit to $10 million, we are not exceeding
the maximum offering amount permitted under Section 3(b)(1). Although, as several
commenters noted, we could use our exemptive authority under Section 28 of the Securities Act

281

Rules 504 and 505 were adopted pursuant to the Commission’s small issues exemptive authority under
Section 3(b)(1) of the Securities Act, which gives the Commission authority to adopt an exemption for
offerings not exceeding $5 million where the Commission believes registration under the Securities Act is
not necessary by reason of the small amount involved or the limited character of the public offering.

to raise the maximum offering amount above $5 million,284 in accord with the suggestion of one
of those commenters, 285 we believe it appropriate to first observe market activity under a new
maximum offering amount of $5 million before raising the Rule 504 offering limit higher.
In conjunction with our increase to the Rule 504 aggregate offering amount limit, we are
also adopting provisions that will disqualify certain bad actors from participation in offerings
conducted pursuant to the exemption. 286 We believe that the disqualification provisions that we
are adopting, which are substantially similar to related provisions in Rule 506 of
Regulation D, 287 will create a more consistent regulatory regime across Regulation D and
provide additional protections to investors in Rule 504 offerings.
The Rule 504 disqualification provisions will be implemented by reference to the
disqualification provisions of Rule 506 of Regulation D. 288 We believe that creating a uniform
set of bad actor triggering events across the various exemptions from Securities Act registration
should simplify due diligence, particularly for issuers that may engage in different types of
exempt offerings. In accordance with the views of several commenters, 289 the bad actor
triggering events for Rule 504 will be substantially similar to existing provisions in
Regulation D, 290 Regulation A, 291 and Regulation Crowdfunding 292 and will apply to the issuer

and other covered persons (such as underwriters, placement agents, and the directors, officers
and significant shareholders of the issuer). Consistent with the Commission’s treatment of
disqualification in Rule 506(e), 293 disqualification will only occur for triggering events that occur
after effectiveness of any amendments, but disclosure will be required for triggering events that
pre-date effectiveness of any amendments. 294
We also sought public comment on whether additional changes to Rule 504 should be
adopted in the final amendments. In particular, in conjunction with the increase in the Rule 504
offering amount limit, we contemplated amending the calculation of the aggregate offering limit
in Rule 504(b)(2). Currently, this rule requires issuers to aggregate all securities sold within the
preceding 12 months in any transaction that is exempt under Section 3(b) or in violation of
Section 5(a) of the Securities Act for purposes of computing the aggregate offering amount under
Rule 504. 295 This rule also includes illustrations of how the aggregate offering limit is calculated
in the event that an issuer sells securities pursuant to Rule 504 and Rule 505 within the same
twelve-month period. 296
When the current aggregation provisions in Rules 504 and 505 were originally adopted in
Rule 505’s predecessor, Rule 242, the Commission noted that aggregating offering amounts
across offerings conducted pursuant to Section 3(b) was intended to “limit the potential for the
issuer to raise large sums by circumventing the registration provisions of the Securities Act

through multiple offerings pursuant to Section 3(b).” 297 In the intervening years, however, in
implementing Congressional mandates, 298 the Commission has increased the number of
exemptive provisions available to issuers, particularly smaller issuers, to raise large sums of
capital in a more cost-effective manner in offerings that are exempt from registration, while
continuing to provide appropriate safeguards for investors. 299 Therefore, we sought comment on
whether the current requirements for Rule 504(b)(2), as they relate to the aggregation of offering
proceeds across all offerings that are conducted pursuant to Securities Act Section 3(b)(1),
should be retained in the amendments. 300
Although no commenters responded to our request for comment on this issue, in light of
our repeal today of Rule 505, which is the only other existing exemption in Regulation D
promulgated under Section 3(b)(1), we are amending Rule 504(b)(2) to omit any reference to the
aggregation of offering proceeds across all offerings that are conducted pursuant to Section 3(b)
of the Securities Act. Correspondingly, we are also deleting the related note under Rule
504(b)(2) illustrating how the aggregate offering amount limitation is calculated in the event that
an issuer sells securities pursuant to Rule 504 and Rule 505 within the same twelve-month
period.
We are also adopting a further technical amendment to the second note to Rule 504(b)(2),
as proposed. Specifically, we are updating the illustration of how the aggregate offering amount

limitation is calculated to account for the increase to the Rule 504 aggregate offering amount
limitation from $1 million to $5 million.301
One commenter 302 and the 2015 Small Business Forum recommended that the
Commission provide an exemption from Section 12(g) registration under the Exchange Act for
securities sold in a Rule 504 offering. 303 As discussed above, Section 12(g) requires, among
other things, that an issuer with total assets exceeding $10,000,000 and a class of securities held
of record by either 2,000 persons, or 500 persons who are not accredited investors, register such
class of securities with the Commission.304 Unlike Tier 2 offerings under Regulation A 305 or
Regulation Crowdfunding, 306 where the Commission provided conditional exemptions from
registration under Section 12(g), issuers that utilize the exemptions under amended Rule 504 will
not be required to comply with ongoing reporting requirements. Given the lack of ongoing
reporting requirements under Rule 504, we believe that the Section 12(g) record holder and asset
thresholds continue to provide an important baseline above which issuers should generally be
subject to the disclosure obligations of the Exchange Act. As the shareholder base of these
companies and their total assets grow, we believe that the additional protections that will be
provided by registration under Section 12(g) are necessary and appropriate.
Another commenter recommended that the Commission amend Rule 504 to permit the
resale of securities issued in Rule 504 “public offerings” in states where the offering complies
with exemptions that permit general solicitation or advertising and that require a public filing and

delivery of a state law compliant disclosure document before any sales to purchasers. 307 As
discussed above, Rule 504 currently permits the resale of securities issued in Rule 504 offerings
that involve general solicitation or advertising where either the offering is registered in one or
more states and one or more states require the dissemination of a state-approved disclosure
document or the offering is exempt but sales are only made to accredited investors. 308 Consistent
with the limitations on resales in other Securities Act exemptions that permit general solicitation
or advertising, such as Rule 506(c) and Regulation Crowdfunding, we have concerns with
expanding the ability to issue freely tradable securities under Rule 504 to offerings that permit
general solicitation or advertising to non-accredited investors without state registration. Further,
we believe that the additional protections that will be provided by the limitations on resale for
securities offered and sold in these transactions, which are directed primarily to non-accredited
investors, 309 are necessary and appropriate given that these offerings are not registered at either
the state or federal level.
C.

Repeal of Rule 505
In light of the proposed amendments to Rule 504, we solicited comments on whether we

should repeal Rule 505 as an exemption from registration. Rule 505 is used far less frequently
than Rule 506, 310 and in the Proposing Release, we noted that an increase in the Rule 504
offering amount limit from $1 million to $5 million could further diminish its utility. 311

an accredited investor.

Comments on Repealing Rule 505

Three commenters responded to our request for comment on Rule 505. One commenter
recommended that the Commission review the Rule 505 exemption “to consider whether
modifications may and/or should be made to modernize the exemption; for example, reviewing
the aggregate offering amount or information requirements.” 312 This commenter strongly
opposed, however, replacing Rule 505 with a new Securities Act exemption providing “covered
security status” under Section 18 of the Securities Act to securities issued in reliance on the new
exemption. 313 This commenter cautioned “against considering a new framework for Rule 505
that is contrary to the rule’s original intent and purpose—to be a coordinated federal-state
exemption and ‘to achieve a uniform system of federal-state limited offering exemptions that
facilitates capital formation consistent with the protection of investors.’” 314
Another commenter stated that changes to Rule 505 aimed at facilitating very small
offerings by early stage companies merit further consideration. 315 This commenter also
recommended that the Commission consider “whether an exempt, simple debt-only offering is
feasible and could be made cost-efficient for smaller issuers.” 316 According to this commenter,
the Commission should explore whether an exemption focused on simple debt securities could
serve the needs of small businesses and investors, especially since the unique nature of simple
debt securities may warrant more modest and easier compliance requirements, while not

82

sacrificing investor protections, as compared to an exemption that permits both debt and equity
offerings. 317
Finally, another commenter stated that, if the proposed changes to Rule 504 are adopted,
Rule 505 would be substantially similar to Rule 504, making Rule 505 unnecessary, unless the
Commission increases the aggregate offering amount that may be raised under Rule 505 in any
twelve-month period. 318 This commenter recommended, for example, that the ceiling could be
raised from $5 million to $10 million or some larger amount, thereby preserving Rule 505 as a
viable alternative exemption. Despite its infrequent use, the commenter noted that Rule 505
serves the purpose of permitting issuers to sell to up to 35 non-accredited investors without
having to be satisfied that these investors meet a financial sophistication test. 319
2.

Repeal of Rule 505

After considering these comments, we are repealing Rule 505. After the effective date of
the repeal of Rule 505, issuers will no longer be able to make offers and sales of securities in
reliance on Rule 505. We believe that amending Rule 504 to increase the aggregate offering
amount from $1 million to $5 million will further reduce the incentives to use Rule 505 by
issuers contemplating an exempt offering. We also believe that, even if we were to raise the
Rule 505 aggregate offering amount limit from $5 million to $10 million, or some higher

316

Id.

317

Id. In commenting on the proposed amendments to Rule 147, one commenter noted that small businesses
are likely to seek debt financing more frequently than equity offerings. See Nextseed Letter (“equity
offerings are more likely to be attractive to technology-based, high growth companies that cannot
financially support debt obligations,” as compared to “Main Street” businesses (e.g., local restaurants
operated by friends and families) that are inherently local in nature seeking to raise not millions of dollars,
but much smaller amounts of capital that traditional lenders are increasingly reluctant to fund).

318

ABA Letter.

319

Id. In contrast, issuers relying upon Rule 506(b) may sell to up to 35 non-accredited investors, but each
non-accredited investor must satisfy a financial sophistication test set forth in Rule 506(b)(2)(ii).

83

amount, such a higher limit would not increase the utility of the Rule 505 exemption as
compared to Rule 506, which has no limit, given the historical use of Rule 505 as compared to
Rule 506. Further, although Rule 505 provides issuers the ability to sell securities to up to 35
non-accredited investors without having to make a finding, as in Rule 506(b)(2)(ii), that such
persons have the knowledge and experience in financial matters that they are capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment, 320 this provision does not appear to
have historically resulted in the Rule 505 exemption being widely utilized. 321
We believe the flexibility of the requirements of Rule 504, as amended today, as well as
the availability of Rule 506(b) and Rule 506(c) will continue to fulfill the original objectives of
Regulation D to achieve uniformity between state and federal exemptions in order to facilitate
capital formation consistent with the protection of investors. 322 Amended Rule 504 will be
available only to non-reporting issuers 323 that are not investment companies 324 or development
stage companies 325 for offerings of up to $5 million in a twelve-month period and will permit
general solicitation and the issuance of unrestricted securities in certain limited situations. 326
Rule 506(b) and 506(c) are available to all issuers without any aggregate offering amount

Cf., 17 CFR 506(b)(2)(ii).

For the period 2009-2015, there were a total of 1,542 Rule 505 offerings. During this same time period,
there were a total of 70,793 Rule 506(b) offerings of $5 million or less. See Table 5 in Section V.A.2.b
below. See also Scott Bauguess, Rachita Gullapalli and Vladimir Ivanov, ‘‘Capital Raising in the U.S.: An

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
This section analyzes the expected economic effects of the final rules relative to the

current baseline, which is the regulatory framework and state of the market 331 in existence today,

327

See 17 CFR 230.506(b)(2).

328

See 17 CFR 230.506(c).

329

See 17 CFR 230.506(b)(2) and 17 CFR 230.502(d).

330

See SEC Release No. 33-10003 [81 FR 2743] (Jan. 19, 2016) (revising Form S-1 to permit a smaller
reporting company to incorporate by reference into its registration statement any documents filed by the
issuer subsequent to the effective date of the registration statement). The information delivery
requirements under Rule 505 for an Exchange Act reporting issuer that sells securities to a non-accredited
investor are similar to the disclosure requirements for a registered offering under the Securities Act. See
Rule 502(b)(2)(ii).

331

The term “market” as used throughout this economic analysis refers to capital markets in general, and
where discussed in the context of a specific rule, relates to the provisions of the relevant exemption or safe
harbor. We refer, for example, to the Rule 147 safe harbor and Rule 504 exemption as the Rule 147 and
Rule 504 markets because each of those rules’ provisions prescribe requirements that determine who can
participate and how the participants (issuers/investors/intermediaries) can engage in transactions under each

85

including current provisions available to potential issuers to raise capital up to $5 million. We
are mindful of the costs imposed by, and the benefits obtained from, the final rules. Relative to
this baseline, our analysis considers the anticipated benefits and costs for market participants
affected by the final rules as well as the impact of the final rules on efficiency, competition and
capital formation. 332 We also analyze the potential benefits and costs stemming from
alternatives to the final rules that we considered. Many of the benefits and costs discussed below
are difficult to quantify, especially when analyzing the likely effects of the final rules on
efficiency, competition and capital formation. For example, it is difficult to precisely estimate
the extent to which amended Rule 147 and new Rule 147A will promote future reliance by
issuers on these provisions, or the extent to which future use of amended Rule 147 and new Rule
147A will affect the use of other offering methods. Similarly, it is difficult to quantify the effect
of the final rules on investor protection. Therefore, much of the discussion in this section is
qualitative in nature. However, where possible, we have attempted to quantify the expected
effects of the final rules.
A.

Baseline
The final rules will modernize Rule 147, a safe harbor under Section 3(a)(11), and

establish new Rule 147A in order to facilitate intrastate offerings, including intrastate
crowdfunded offerings under state securities laws. We also are amending Rule 504 of Regulation
D to raise the aggregate amount that can be raised during a twelve-month period from $1 million

exemption. Participants face different trade-offs when choosing between the markets created by each of
the exemptions and safe harbors.
332

Securities Act Section 2(b) and Exchange Act Section 3(f) direct us, when engaging in rulemaking that
requires us to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, to
consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action will promote efficiency, competition,
and capital formation. See 15 U.S.C. 77b(b) and 15 U.S.C. 78c(f). In addition, Exchange Act Section
23(a)(2) requires us, when adopting rules, to consider the impact that any new rule would have on

86

as established in 1988, to $5 million and to disqualify certain bad actors from participating in
Rule 504 offerings. In light of the amendments to Rule 504, we are also repealing Rule 505, an
alternate exemption available under Regulation D for offerings of up to $5 million during a
twelve-month period.
The final rules will primarily impact the financing market for startups and small
businesses. 333 The baseline for our economic analysis—including the baseline for our
consideration of the effects of the final rules on efficiency, competition and capital formation—is
the regulatory framework and market structure in existence today in which startups and small
businesses seeking to raise capital through securities offerings must register the offer and sale of
securities under the Securities Act, unless they can rely on an existing exemption from
registration under the federal securities laws.
In addition to a description of the type and number of issuers that currently offer and sell
securities in reliance on Rules 147, 504 and 505, our analysis includes a description of the types
of investors who purchase or may consider purchasing such securities and a discussion of the
role of intermediaries in such offerings. Table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of Rules
147, 504 and 505.

The final rules that amend existing Rules 147 and 504, establish new Rule 147A, and
repeal Rule 505 will primarily affect securities issuers, particularly startups and small businesses,
that rely on unregistered offerings under these and other provisions or safe harbors to raise
capital, as well as accredited and non-accredited investors who participate in unregistered
offerings.
a. Issuers
i. Rule 147 Issuers
Under current Rule 147, there is no limit on the amount of capital that can be raised.
Since the Section 3(a)(11) exemption is not available for an investment company registered or
required to be registered under the Investment Company Act, 340 the existing Rule 147 safe
harbor is also not available to these issuers. Current Rule 147 has no other restrictions on the
type of issuers that may rely on the safe harbor. However, there are in-state residency and
eligibility requirements that an issuer must satisfy in order to rely on Rule 147. Eligible issuers
are those that are incorporated or organized in-state, have their “principal office” in-state, and
can satisfy three 80% threshold requirements concerning their revenues, assets and use of net
proceeds.
While we lack data on the number and size of Rule 147 offerings 341 or the type of issuers
currently relying on the Rule 147 safe harbor, the nature of the eligibility requirements and other
restrictions of the rule lead us to believe that it is used by U.S. incorporated entities that are

340

See 15 U.S.C. 80a-24(d) and 1961 Release at note 1.

341

Unlike Regulation D, which requires the filing of a Form D, Rule 147 does not require any filing with the
Commission, and we thus have no source of reliable data about the prevalence and scope of Rule 147
offerings. Commission staff will seek to collaborate with state regulators in gathering information for the
study of amended Rule 147 and new Rule 147A. See Section I above.

89

likely small businesses seeking to raise small amounts of capital locally without incurring the
costs of registering with the Commission.
Currently, most of the states that have enacted crowdfunding provisions require issuers
that intend to conduct intrastate crowdfunding offerings to use Rule 147. 342 Based on
information from NASAA, 343 as of May 20, 2016, 34 states and the District of Columbia have
enacted crowdfunding provisions, and more states are expected to promulgate similar provisions
in the near future. Since December 2011, when the first state (Kansas) enacted its crowdfunding
provisions, 179 state crowdfunding offerings have been reported to be filed with the respective
state regulator. 344 Of these offerings, 166 were reported to be approved or cleared, as of July
2016. 345
Given that investment companies are statutorily restricted from relying on
Section 3(a)(11) 346 and that almost all the enacted state crowdfunding provisions currently
exclude reporting companies, we expect that issuers that rely on Rule 147 are likely operating
companies (“non-fund issuers”) that are not reporting under the Exchange Act. As stated above,
information on the size of these issuers is not available. Data from NASAA shows that most

issuers are from various industries including agriculture, manufacturing, business services, retail,
entertainment, and technology.
We anticipate that many potential issuers of securities under amended Rule 147 and new
Rule 147A, particularly those utilizing the exemptions for intrastate crowdfunding, will continue
to be small businesses, early stage firms and “idea” stage business ventures that have not yet
commenced operations. Some of these issuers may lack business plans that are sufficiently
developed to attract venture capitalists (VCs) or angel investors that invest in high risk ventures,
or may not offer the profit potential or business model to attract such investors. 347
ii. Rule 504 and Rule 505 Issuers
Rules 504 and 505 of Regulation D provide exemptions from registration under
Section 3(b)(1) of the Securities Act for small offerings where the Commission believes
registration under the Securities Act is not necessary by reason of the small amount involved or
the limited character of the public offering. An analysis of Form D filings indicates that reliance
on these two exemptions has been declining over time. As shown in Figure 1, while offerings
under Rule 506(b) of Regulation D grew significantly from 1993 to 2015, offerings under
Rule 504 and Rule 505 in 2015 were approximately a quarter of 1993 levels. In addition, while
offering activity under Rule 504 has been higher than under the Rule 505 exemption, the number
of new Rule 504 offerings peaked in 1999, with 3,402 new offerings initiated, and steeply
declined afterward. 348 Compared to the early 1990s when Rule 504 offerings constituted

347

In this regard, a study of one large crowdfunding platform revealed that relatively few companies on that
platform operate in technology sectors that typically attract VC investment activity. See Ethan R. Mollick,
The Dynamics of Crowdfunding: An Exploratory Study, J. BUS. VENT., January 2014 (1-16).

348

While there is a strong, positive correlation of the incidence of new Regulation D offerings with the
economic conditions of the public market (see Section 4.2 of Unregistered Offerings White Paper), some of
the decline in Rule 504 offerings during the early 2000s could also be attributed to the 1999 Commission
decision to reinstate the ban on general solicitation in Rule 504 offerings. See Seed Capital Release and

91

approximately 28% of all new Regulation D offerings, the proportion of Rule 504 offerings
between 2009 and 2015 ranged between 3% and 4% of all new Regulation D offerings. The
number of new Rule 505 offerings peaked in 1996 at 1,124 (12% of all new Regulation D
offerings), and during 2015, less than 1% of all new Regulation D offerings claimed the Rule
505 exemption.

The current limited use of the Rule 504 and Rule 505 exemptions and the predominance
of Rule 506, especially Rule 506(b), are also evident when we consider the total amount raised in
offerings under each of these exemptions. Overall, capital formation in the Rule 504 and Rule

Release No. 34-69959 (July 10, 2013). Though the incidence of new Rule 506 offerings recovered in 2003
with improved conditions in the public markets, the number of new Rule 504 offerings remained well
below the pre-2000 levels.
349

Data is not readily available for the period 2002-2008 during which Form D was a paper-based filing. The
form became available electronically in March 2009. Since the data for year 2009 is only for the period
April to December, the number of new Regulation D offerings shown is underestimated for 2009.

92

505 markets individually constituted approximately 0.1% of the capital raised in all Regulation D
offerings initiated during 2009-2015. 350 Considering only Regulation D offerings of up to $1
million (the maximum amount that a Rule 504 offering can raise in a year) initiated by non-fund
issuers, the share of Rule 504 offerings was slightly higher at approximately 7%. Similarly,
considering only Regulation D offerings by non-fund issuers of up to $5 million (the maximum
amount that an existing Rule 505 offering or amended Rule 504 offering can raise in a year), the
share of the total amount raised for Rule 505 offerings was less than 2%.
Table 2 presents data on the number of new Rule 504 and 505 offerings and amounts
reported to be raised in these offerings during the period 2009-2015. 351 Since investment
companies are excluded from using the two exemptions, issuers relying on Rules 504 and 505
are predominantly non-fund issuers. 352 Form D data also indicates that the mean and median
Rule 504 offering sizes during 2009-2015 were approximately $0.5 million and $0.36 million,
respectively, while the average and median Rule 505 offering sizes were approximately $1.90
million and $1.54 million, respectively.

350

Based on staff analysis of Form D filings. See also Unregistered Offerings White Paper.

351

Id. This analysis uses the same assumptions and methodologies described in the Unregistered Offerings
White Paper.

352

Non-fund issuers constituted 98% and 93% of all Rule 504 and Rule 505 offerings, respectively. In terms
of amounts reported to be raised, non-fund issuers raised 96% and 76% of all amounts reported to be raised
in Rule 504 offerings and Rule 505 offerings, respectively. Based on information in Form D filings, funds
using the Rule 504 or Rule 505 exemption were not registered under the Investment Company Act.

Companies that file reports with the Commission under Section 12(b), Section 12(g) or
Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act can use the Rule 505 exemption but not the Rule 504
exemption. Data from Form D filings indicates that approximately 10 of 278 unique Rule 505
issuers during 2014 and 8 of 163 unique Rule 505 issuers during 2015 were reporting
companies. 354 These reporting companies initiated 12 Rule 505 offerings during 2014 and 11
such offerings during 2015. The mean size of Rule 505 offerings by reporting companies was
approximately $824,000 and the median size was approximately $200,000.

Based on staff analysis of Form D filings. This analysis uses the same assumptions and methodologies
described in the Unregistered Offerings White Paper. As noted in the Unregistered Offerings White Paper,
some issuers in Regulation D offerings check multiple exemptions in their Form D filing. Under those
circumstances, staff assigns the highest checked numerical exemption to the offering. While issuers in
4,308 offerings checked only the Rule 504 exemption and reported to raise $719 million during the period
2009-2015, issuers in an additional 1,224 offerings checked the Rule 504 exemption along with the Rule
505 and/or the Rule 506 exemption and safe harbor. Similarly, issuers in 1,520 offerings checked only the
Rule 505 exemption and reported to raise $1,399 million during 2009-2015; issuers in an additional 68 new
offerings checked the Rule 504 and 505 exemptions; and issuers in 2,170 new offerings checked the Rule
505 exemption along with the Rule 506 exemption.

their Form D filings (approximately 70% of all Rule 504 issuers and 80% of all Rule 505
issuers), more than three quarters of those offerings were initiated by issuers that had no
revenues or had revenues or net asset values of less than $1 million. From this reported size, we
believe that a vast majority of Rule 504 and Rule 505 issuers likely consist of startups and small
businesses. These issuers’ small size is also consistent with their younger age, as measured by
years since incorporation. Based on Form D filings, 51% of Rule 504 issuers and 62% of Rule
505 issuers initiated their offerings during the year of their incorporation or in the subsequent
year. Another 14% of Rule 504 and Rule 505 issuers initiated their offerings between two and
three years since incorporation. 356

With regard to the geographical location of issuers, Form D filings indicate that during
the period 2009-2015, most Rule 504 and Rule 505 issuers had their principal place of business
in California (22% and 21%), followed by Texas, New York, Florida, Colorado and Illinois;
most were incorporated in Delaware (19%, 23%), California (13%, 12%), Nevada and Texas. In
addition, approximately 37% of Rule 504 offerings and 39% of Rule 505 offerings reported
having different states of incorporation and principal places of business. While only
approximately 2% of Rule 504 and Rule 505 offerings were initiated by foreign-incorporated
issuers, a larger number of issuers (4-5%) reported their principal place of business to be outside
the United States. In addition, approximately 89% of issuers in the Rule 504 market and 93% of

357

96

issuers in the Rule 505 market initiated only one offering. Approximately 83% of Rule 504
offerings and 79% of Rule 505 offerings during the period 2009-2015 were equity offerings. 358
b. Investors
Currently, Rule 147 limits offers and sales to residents of the same state or territory as the
issuer. While there are generally no limitations on who can invest in Rule 504 offerings, only
accredited investors and up to 35 non-accredited investors can participate in Rule 505 offerings.
Although the Commission does not require a form to be filed in connection with Rule 147
offerings, and thus does not receive information concerning investors participating in these
offerings, data from Form D filings provide some insights into the number and characteristics of
investors in Rule 504 and Rule 505 offerings.
Data in Table 3 below shows that more than 34,000 investors participated in new Rule
504 offerings initiated during the period 2009-2015, while almost 14,400 investors participated
in new Rule 505 offerings initiated during the same period. 359 An analysis of the same Form D
filings indicates that, for new Rule 504 offerings that reported sales, the mean number of
investors was approximately 11 and the median number of investors was approximately four.
The mean and median number of investors in new Rule 505 offerings that reported sales was 12
and seven, respectively.

The presence of non-accredited investors was larger in Rule 504 offerings, where the
number of non-accredited investors is not limited, than in Rule 505 or Rule 506 offerings, where
the number of non-accredited investors is limited to 35. Data in Table 3 above shows that issuers
in approximately 57% of Rule 504 offerings and 41% of Rule 505 offerings during 2009-2015
reported having sold or intending to sell to non-accredited investors. 361
Given existing investment limitations under state crowdfunding provisions, we believe
that many investors affected by amended Rule 147 and new Rule 147A will likely be individual
retail investors whose broad access to potentially riskier investment opportunities in early-stage
ventures is currently limited, either because they do not have the necessary accreditation or

360

Id. The data shown in the table represents offerings that reported sales to investors.

361

Form D data shows that Rule 504 offerings that involved non-accredited investors were, on average,
smaller and had a fewer mean number of investors (8) than those offerings that involved only accredited
investors (9). In contrast, Rule 505 offerings that indicated potential sales to non-accredited investors were,
on average, larger and had a greater mean number of investors (11) than Rule 505 offerings that sold only
to accredited investors (8). We note that since issuers do not file Form D at the close of the offering, the
number of investors reported in initial Form D filings may be an underestimate (offerings reporting zero

sophistication to invest in most private offerings, or because they do not have sufficient funds to
participate as angel investors. Intrastate crowdfunding offerings may provide retail investors
with additional investment opportunities, although the extent to which they invest in such
offerings will likely depend on their view of the potential return on investment as well as the
potential risks, including fraud.
In contrast, larger, more sophisticated or well-funded investors may be less likely to
invest in intrastate crowdfunding offerings. The relatively low offering amount limits, in-state
investor residency requirements, and low investment limits for crowdfunding investors under
state laws 362 may make these offerings less attractive for such investors, which include VCs and
angel investors. 363 While an intrastate crowdfunding offering can result in increased visibility
for an issuer, it is likely that such investors will elect to invest in offerings relying on Rule 506,
which are not subject to the investment limitations applicable to crowdfunding.
c. Intermediaries
Issuers that undertake private offerings may use broker-dealers to help them with various
aspects of the offering and to help ensure compliance with the ban on general solicitation and
advertising that exists for most private offerings. Private offerings can also involve finders and
investment advisers who connect issuers with potential investors for a fee. 364 We do not have
information on the extent of intermediary use in Rule 147 offerings; however, an analysis of

investors are included).
362

Most state crowdfunding provisions allow up to a $2 million offering size and a maximum investment of
$10,000 by non-accredited investors.

363

An observer suggests that, unlike angels, VCs may be less interested in crowdfunding because, if VCs rely
on crowdfunding sites for their deal flow, it would be difficult to justify charging a 2% management fee
and 20% carried interest to their limited partners. See Ryan Caldbeck, Crowdfunding – Why Angels,
Venture Capitalists And Private Equity Investors All May Benefit, FORBES, Aug. 7, 2013.

364

Depending on the nature and scope of their activities, these persons may need to be registered as brokerdealers or finders under state law.

99

Form D filings indicates that intermediaries are used less frequently in Rule 504 offerings than in
registered offerings. Approximately 20% of Rule 504 offerings and 29% of Rule 505 offerings
reported using an intermediary during the period 2009-2015. 365 The average commissions and
fees paid by issuers that reported using an intermediary was approximately 6% of the offering
amount for Rule 504 and 5.6% for Rule 505. 366
Although we are unable to predict the potential use of broker-dealers, transfer agents, 367
investment advisers and finders in private offerings as a result of the adoption of the final rules,
data on the use of broker-dealers and finders in the Rule 506 market suggests that they do not
currently play a large role in private offerings. Form D filings indicate that approximately 17%
of Rule 506 offerings with an offering size up to $5 million, including 18% of such Rule 506
offerings initiated by non-fund issuers, used an intermediary during 2009-2015. 368 The use of a
broker-dealer or a finder increased with offering size, while the average percentage of the total
fee declined with offering size. 369 We base these estimates, however, only on available data
from the Regulation D market. It is possible that issuers engaging in other types of unregistered

367

Aside from their standard role in maintaining records of ownership of securities, transfer agents play an
important role in private offerings that involve restricted securities, in which there may be limitations on
resale of such securities for a certain period or to certain types of investors. In addition to ensuring
compliance with such provisions, only a transfer agent can remove a restrictive legend from the security,
which is done with the consent of the issuer.

368

Based on staff analysis of Form D filings.

369

Based on analysis of Form D filings for 2009-2015, approximately 20% of all Rule 506 offerings reported
using an intermediary. Further, intermediaries participated in approximately 16% of Rule 506 offerings of
up to $1 million and 31% of offerings of more than $50 million during the period 2009-2015. The average
total fee (commission plus finder fee) paid by issuers conducting offerings of up to $1 million was 6.2%,
while the average total fee paid by issuers conducting offerings of more than $50 million was 1.9%. See
also Section 5.3 in the Unregistered Offerings White Paper.

offerings, for which data is not available to us, may use broker-dealers and finders more
frequently or less frequently. 370
2. Alternative Methods of Raising up to $5 Million of Capital
The potential economic impact of the final rules, including their effects on efficiency,
competition and capital formation, will depend primarily on the extent of use of amended Rules
147 and 504 and new Rule 147A and how these methods compare to alternative sources of
capital that startups and small businesses can utilize.
As the amendments to Rule 504 would permit offerings up to $5 million by all types of
issuers (other than investment companies, Exchange Act reporting companies and development
stage companies), the analysis below discusses alternatives available for startups and small
businesses to access up to $5 million in capital. Current state crowdfunding provisions, most of
which require issuers to rely on Rule 147 for federal exemption, have offering limits of up to $4
million and most restrict private funds from utilizing the crowdfunding provisions. In addition,
final Rules 147, 147A and 504 all exclude investment companies. Thus, our analysis below also
includes a discussion of alternative sources for non-fund issuers to raise capital up to $5
million.371
Startups and small businesses can potentially access a variety of external financing

370

A number of states that have enacted crowdfunding provisions require that the offer and sale of securities
by means of intrastate crowdfunding be conducted through a funding portal or a broker-dealer. Some
intrastate crowdfunding provisions require the offering portals to be registered with the state or as a brokerdealer. Based on FOCUS Reports filed with the Commission, as of December 2015, there were 4,122
registered broker-dealers, with average total assets of approximately $0.98 billion per broker-dealer. The
aggregate assets of these registered broker-dealers totaled approximately $4.1 trillion. See Regulation
Crowdfunding Adopting Release for a more detailed discussion of intermediaries in crowdfunding
offerings.

371

While offerings greater than $5 million that are registered or exempt under state law, subject to certain
conditions, could be raised under amended Rule 147 or new Rule 147A, we believe that the impact of the
final rules on larger offerings is not likely to be significant, given the local nature of offerings under these
exemptions and current state regulations applicable for larger offerings. See Section V.B (discussing the

101

sources in the capital markets through, for example, registered or unregistered offerings of debt,
equity or hybrid securities and bank loans. Issuers seeking to raise capital must register the offer
and sale of securities under the Securities Act or qualify for an exemption from registration
under the federal securities laws. Registered offerings, however, are generally too costly to be
viable alternatives for startups and small businesses. Issuers conducting registered offerings
incur a variety of fees and expenses related to registration and reporting requirements. Two
surveys concluded that the average initial compliance cost associated with conducting an initial
public offering is $2.5 million, followed by an ongoing compliance cost for public companies of
$1.5 million per year. 372 Moreover, issuers conducting registered offerings usually pay
underwriter fees, which average approximately 7% for initial public offerings, approximately 5%
for follow-on equity offerings and approximately 1-1.5% for public bond issuances. 373 Hence,

impact of the final rules in detail).
372

See IPO Task Force, Rebuilding the IPO On-Ramp (Oct. 20, 2011), at 9, available at http://www.sec.gov/
info/smallbus/acsec/rebuilding_the_ipo_on-ramp.pdf (“IPO Task Force”). The estimates should be
interpreted with the caveat that most companies in the IPO Task Force surveys likely raised more than $1
million. The IPO Task Force surveys do not provide a breakdown of costs by offering size. However,
compliance related costs of an initial public offering and subsequent compliance related costs of being a
reporting company likely have a fixed cost component that would disproportionately affect smaller issuers .
Title I of the JOBS Act provided certain accommodations to issuers that qualify as emerging growth
companies (EGCs). According to a recent working paper, the underwriting, legal and accounting fees of
EGC and non-EGC initial public offerings were similar (based on a time period from April 5, 2012 to April
30, 2015). For a median EGC initial public offering, gross spread comprised 7% of proceeds and
accounting and legal fees comprised 2.4% of proceeds. See Susan Chaplinsky, Kathleen W. Hanley, and S.
Katie Moon, “The JOBS Act and the Costs of Going Public,” working paper, October 4, 2015, available at

for a small issuer seeking to raise less than $5 million, a registered offering typically may not be
economically feasible relative to options available under exempt offerings.
a. Exempt Offerings
For startups and small businesses that can potentially access capital under Rules 147, 504
and 505, offerings under other existing exemptions or safe harbors from registration may
represent alternative methods of raising capital. For example, startups and small businesses
could rely on current exemptions and safe harbors, such as Section 3(a)(11), Section 4(a)(2), 374
Regulation A, 375 Section 4(a)(6), 376 and Rule 506 of Regulation D. 377
Each of these provisions, however, includes restrictions that may limit its suitability for
startups and small businesses seeking to raise capital up to $5 million. Table 4 below lists the
main requirements of these provisions.

ECON.121-143 (2015); see also Chaplinsky Study.
374

Securities Act Section 4(a)(2) provides that the provisions of the Securities Act shall not apply to
“transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering.”

375

Regulation A provides an exemption from registration for certain small issuances. The Commission
recently adopted amendments to Regulation A that became effective on June 19, 2015. See 2015
Regulation A Release.

376

Regulation Crowdfunding provides an exemption from registration for small offerings up to $1 million sold
within a twelve month period. The rules became effective on May 16, 2016. See Regulation Crowdfunding
Adopting Release.

377

Rule 506(b) of Regulation D provides a nonexclusive safe harbor from registration for certain types of
securities offerings. Rule 506(c) of Regulation D is an exemption from registration that the Commission
adopted to implement Section 201(a) of the JOBS Act.

While we do not have data on offerings relying on an exemption under Section 3(a)(11)
or Section 4(a)(2), data available from Regulation D and Regulation A filings allow us to gauge
how frequently issuers seeking to raise up to $5 million rely on these provisions. Based on Form
D filings from 2009 to 2015, a substantial number of issuers chose to raise capital by relying on
Rule 506(b), even though their offering size would qualify under Rule 504 or Rule 505. 385 As
shown in the upper part of Table 5, most Regulation D issuers made offers for amounts of up to
$1 million from 2009 to 2015. A large majority of offerings up to $5 million relied on the Rule
506(b) exemption. The lower part of Table 5 shows a similar pattern for the number of offerings
by non-fund issuers.
The overwhelming majority of non-fund issuers (approximately 73%) conducting
offerings less than $5 million were five years or younger, and 64% of such issuers were two
years or younger, with a median age of approximately one year. More than 93% of the non-fund
issuers that made Regulation D offerings of $5 million or less during this period were organized

384

General solicitation and general advertising is permitted under Rule 506(c). All purchasers must be
accredited investors and the issuer must take reasonable steps to verify accredited investor status.

385

See Unregistered Offerings White Paper. This tendency could, in part, be attributed to two features of Rule
506: preemption from state registration (“blue sky”) requirements and an unlimited offering amount. See
also report from U.S. Government Accountability Office, Factors That May Affect Trends in Regulation A
Offerings, GAO-12-839 (Jul. 3, 2012), available at http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-12-839.

Note: Data based on Form D filings for Regulation D offerings and Form 1-A filings for qualified Regulation A
offerings from 2009 to 2015. We consider only new offerings and exclude offerings that do not report offering size
and report amount sold as $0 on Form D. Data on Rule 506(c) offerings covers the period from September 23, 2013
(the date the rule became effective) to December 31, 2015. We also use the maximum amount indicated in Form 1A to determine offering size for Regulation A offerings.

Table 5 also includes the number of Regulation A offerings by size. From 2009 to 2015,
49 issuers relied on Regulation A for offerings of up to $5 million.387 This data includes 17
offerings, of which 11 have offering sizes of up to $5 million, initiated subsequent to the
effectiveness of amendments to Regulation A in June 2015. The amendments allow issuers to
raise up to $50 million over a 12-month period and preempt state registration requirements for
certain Regulation A offerings (Tier 2 offerings). As these amendments became effective only

386

These percentages could be higher because almost 55% of the issuers that conduct Regulation D offerings
of $5 million or less declined to disclose the size of the offering.

387

We only consider offerings with offering statements that have been qualified by the Commission. For
purposes of counting offerings, we exclude amendments or multiple 1-A filings by the same issuer in a
given year. For purposes of determining the offering size for Regulation A offerings, we use the maximum
amount indicated on the latest pre-qualification Form 1-A or amended Form 1-A. We reclassify two
offerings that are dividend reinvestment plans with uncertain offering amounts as having the maximum

recently, more time is needed to assess how the changes in Regulation A will affect capital
raising by small issuers. 388
b. Regulation Crowdfunding
The analysis above does not include data regarding securities-based crowdfunding
transactions under the recently adopted Regulation Crowdfunding exemption. The new rules,
which became effective on May 16, 2016, supplement the existing regulatory scheme of
exemptions and safe harbors that are described above and provide start-ups and small businesses
with an alternate source for raising capital through offerings exempt from registration under the
Securities Act. As of September 30, 2016, approximately 114 offerings relying on the federal
crowdfunding exemption filed a Form C with the Commission.389
Offerings pursuant to these rules are limited to a maximum amount of $1 million over a
12-month period and are subject to ongoing disclosure requirements. Securities issued pursuant
to these rules can be sold to an unlimited number of investors (subject to specified investment
limits), are freely tradable after one year, and can be offered and sold without state qualification
or registration. Unlike intrastate crowdfunding provisions enacted at the state level, the new
federal crowdfunding exemption allows interstate offerings, whereby an issuer can make offers
and sell to investors in multiple states. Table 6 presents a comparison of the provisions of
Regulation Crowdfunding and current intrastate crowdfunding provisions that rely on current
Rule 147 for federal exemption.

See 2015 Regulation A Adopting Release.

389

Based on Form C filings, as of September 30, 2016. Analysis of data reported in Form C and Form C-U
filings indicates that the mean maximum offer size was approximately $643,150 and the mean amount
reported to be raised per offering was $440,480 . Based on filings of Form C-U as of September 30, 2016,
12 offerings were reported to be completed.

While equity-based financing, including principal owner equity, accounts for a significant

small businesses include loans from commercial banks, finance companies and other financial
institutions, business credit cards and credit lines. 392
For example, a 2014 study reports that startups frequently resort to bank financing early
in their lifecycle. 393 The study finds that businesses rely heavily in the first year after formation
on external debt sources such as bank financing, mostly in the form of personal and commercial
bank loans, business credit cards, and credit lines. 394 Another report shows a decline in

cumulative bank lending to small businesses, which fell by $100 billion from 2008 to 2011. 395
This report also shows that less than one-third of small businesses reported having a business
bank loan by 2012. Similarly, an FDIC report shows that, as of December 2015, small business
lending, specifically business loans of up to $1 million, by FDIC-insured depository institutions
amounted to approximately $606 billion, which is 15% lower than the June 2008 level but 2%
above December 31, 2014 level. 396
An earlier study by Federal Reserve Board staff covering the pre-recessionary period
suggests that 60% of small businesses had outstanding credit in the form of a credit line, a loan
or a capital lease. 397 These loans were borrowed from two types of financial institutions:
depository and non-depository institutions (e.g., finance companies, factoring or leasing
companies). 398 Lines of credit were the most widely used type of credit. 399 Other types included
mortgage loans, equipment loans, and motor vehicle loans. 400
Small businesses may also receive funding from various loan guarantee programs of the
Small Business Administration (“SBA”), which makes credit more accessible to small businesses
by either lowering the interest rate of the loan or enabling a market-based loan that a lender

microloans 403 and Certified Development Company loans (CDC loans). 404 For example, in fiscal
year 2015, the SBA supported approximately $33.2 billion in 7(a) and CDC loans, microloans
and surety bonds distributed to approximately 61,000 small businesses. 405 In addition,
investments in high-growth small businesses through its Small Business Investment Company
program increased from $5.5 billion in 2014 to $6.3 billion in 2015.406 SBA guaranteed loans,
however, currently account for a relatively small share (20%) of the balances of small business
loans outstanding. 407
Borrowing from financial institutions is, however, relatively costly for many early-stage
issuers and small businesses as they may have low revenues, irregular cash-flow projections,

insufficient assets to offer as collateral, and high external monitoring costs. 408 Many startups and
small businesses may find loan requirements imposed by financial institutions difficult to meet
and may not be able to rely on these institutions to secure funding. For example, financial
institutions generally require a borrower to provide collateral and/or a guarantee, 409 which
startups, small businesses and their owners may not be able to provide. Collateral may also be
required for loans guaranteed by the SBA.
Other sources of debt financing for startups and small businesses include peer-to-peer and
peer-to-business lending, 410 microfinance, 411 and other alternative online lending channels. 412

Approximately 92% of all small business debt to financial institutions is secured, and owners of the
company guarantee about 52% of that debt. See Allen N. Berger and Gregory F. Udell, 1995, Relationship
Lending and Lines of Credit in Small Firm Finance, Journal of Business 68(3), pp. 351–381. Some studies
of small business lending also document the creation of local captive markets with higher borrowing costs
for small, informationally opaque companies as a result of strategic use of soft information by local lenders.

Financial Studies 13(7), pp. 2757–2788.

Such debt transactions are facilitated by online platforms that connect borrowers and lenders and
potentially offer small businesses additional flexibility with regard to pricing, repayment schedules,
collateral or guarantee requirements, and other terms. See Ian Galloway, Peer-to-Peer Lending and

estimated to have disbursed $292.1 million across 36,936 microloans, with an estimated $427.6 million in
outstanding microloans (across 45,744 in microloans). See FIELD at the Aspen Institute, U.S.

Several models of online small business lending have emerged: online lenders raising capital from
institutional investors and lending on their own account (e.g., short-term loan products similar to a
merchant cash advance); peer-to-peer platforms; and "lender‐agnostic" online marketplaces that facilitate
small business borrower access to various loan products from traditional and alternative lenders, including
term loans, lines of credit, merchant cash advances and factoring products,. See Karen Gordon Mills and
Brayden McCarthy, The State of Small Business Lending: Credit Access during the Recovery and How

which includes peer-to-peer lending to consumers and businesses, had risen to approximately
$11.08 billion in 2014.413 Technology has facilitated the growth of alternative models of small
business lending. According to one academic study, 414 the outstanding portfolio balance of
online alternative lenders has doubled every year, albeit this market represents less than $10
billion in outstanding loan capital. According to the 2015 Small Business Credit survey, 415 20%
of all small businesses surveyed applied for credit with an online lender. 416
Family and friends are also sources through which startups and small businesses can raise
capital. This source of capital is usually available early in the lifecycle of a small business,
before the business engages with arm’s-length, more formal funding channels. 417 Among other
things, family and friends may donate funds, loan funds or acquire an equity stake in the
business. A recent study finds that most of the capital supplied to startups by friends and family
is in the form of loans. 418 Family and friends, however, may be able to provide only a limited

small businesses that have been in business for less than 2 years and 3-5 years, respectively, applied for
credit with online lenders. By comparison, 11% of small businesses with revenue between $1million-$10
million and 6% of small businesses with revenue greater than $10 million applied for credit to an online
lender. Mature (older, higher revenue, greater number of employees) categories of small businesses were
much more likely to apply for credit with bank lenders than with online lenders.

financing sources that could allow us to quantify their magnitude or compare them to other
current sources of capital.
B.

Analysis of Final Rules
1. Broad Economic Considerations
The final rules are intended to streamline and modernize the capital raising options

available to startups and small businesses, including through the use of intrastate and regional
securities offering provisions that have been enacted or could be enacted by various states, and
thereby promote capital formation within the larger economy.
Securities-based crowdfunding is a relatively new and evolving capital market that
provides startups and small businesses an alternative mechanism of raising funds by selling small
amounts of securities to a large number of investors using the Internet. Title III of the JOBS Act
directed the Commission to establish rules for an exemption that would facilitate this market at
the federal level. Around the same time, some states began enacting intrastate crowdfunding
statutes and rules that provide issuers with exemptions from state registration. Most intrastate
crowdfunding provisions require issuers to comply with the requirements of Section 3(a)(11) and
Rule 147, while three states currently provide issuers with the option of utilizing Rule 504 or
another Regulation D exemption. 419
By establishing new Rule 147A and modernizing the existing requirements under Rule
147, the final rules could facilitate capital formation through intrastate crowdfunded offerings as
well as through other state registered or state exempt offerings. Raising the offering amount
419

Maine’s provisions currently permit interstate crowdfunding utilizing the Rule 504 exemption and
Mississippi and Vermont dually offer intrastate crowdfunding under Section 3(a)(11) and interstate
crowdfunding under Rule 504. See NASAA Letter.

115

limit under amended Rule 504 from $1 million to $5 million may facilitate smaller offerings,
including those registered or exempt from registration in a particular state, or regional offerings
made pursuant to regional state coordinated review programs. 420 Such programs, when
implemented, may enable issuers relying on Rule 504 to register an offering in any one rather
than in each of the several states where they conduct offers and sales, thereby saving them time
and money. In light of the current infrequent use of the Rule 505 exemption and the increase in
the maximum offering size under Rule 504 to $5 million, repealing Rule 505 will simplify the
existing Securities Act exemptive framework without significantly diminishing issuers’ capital
raising options.
The amendments to Rule 147 and Rule 504 and the establishment of Rule 147A will
remove or reduce certain impediments to capital raising identified by market participants and
commenters. 421 As discussed below, the effects of the final rules on capital formation will
depend, first, on whether issuers that currently raise or plan to raise capital will choose to rely on
the safe harbor and exemptions provided by amended Rules 147 and 504 and new Rule 147A in
lieu of other methods of raising capital, such as Regulation Crowdfunding and Rule 506 of
Regulation D. To assess the likely impact of the final rules on capital formation, we consider the
features of amended Rules 147 and 504 and new Rule 147A that potentially could increase
securities offerings by new issuers and by issuers that already rely on other private offering
methods.

See e.g., Transcript of Record at 78, SEC Advisory Committee on Small and Emerging Companies (June 3,
2015), available at http://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/acsec/acsec-minutes-060315.pdf. See also 2015
Small Business Forum Recommendations; ABA Letter; CFIRA Letter; CrowdCheck Letter; Milken Letter.

116

Second, to the extent that securities offerings relying on the final rules provide capital
raising options for issuers that currently do not have access to capital, the final rules could
enhance the overall level of capital formation in the economy, in addition to any reallocation of
demand for capital amongst the various capital raising methods that could arise from issuers
changing such methods.
Third, to the extent that states currently have residency and eligibility requirements that
correspond to existing Rule 147, the impact of amended Rule 147 and new Rule 147A on capital
formation will significantly depend on whether state law is amended to align with the final rules.
Any changes to intrastate and regional securities offering provisions that may be enacted by
states would, in turn, affect the expected use of amended Rules 147 and 504 and new Rule 147A.
Currently, most intrastate crowdfunding provisions require issuers to rely on Rule 147 and
Section 3(a)(11) for exemption from Securities Act registration. To the extent state law
provisions are amended to allow these offerings to comply with amended Rule 147, new Rule
147A or amended Rule 504, the choice between these three exemptions could depend on issuers’
preferences with respect to general solicitation, target investor base, issuer incorporation and
investor location. For example, while issuers relying on the amended Rule 147 safe harbor must
be incorporated in the state where they seek to conduct an intrastate offering, there is no such
restriction for issuers relying on the Rule 147A exemption. While both Rule 147 and Rule 147A
offerings will be restricted to in-state investors, Rule 504 offerings will be available to investors
in more than one state, thus facilitating regional offerings. At the same time, there is no limit on
the maximum offering amount under amended Rule 147 or new Rule 147A, while amended
Rule 504 limits the maximum amount that can be sold over a twelve-month period to $5 million.
Finally, the impact of the final rules on aggregate capital formation also will depend on

117

whether new investors are attracted to the Rule 147, Rule 147A and Rule 504 markets or whether
investors reallocate existing capital among various types of offering methods. If the final rules
allow issuers to reach a category of potential investors significantly different from those that they
can reach through other offering methods, or attract existing investors to invest a greater share of
their wealth in primary offerings, then capital formation, in aggregate, could increase. On the
other hand, if the final rules are viewed as substantially similar to alternate offering methods,
investors with limited investment capital may simply reallocate their capital from other markets
to the Rule 147, Rule 147A or Rule 504 markets. Investor demand for securities offered under
the final rules could, in particular, depend on the extent to which expected risk, return and
liquidity of the offered securities compare to what investors can obtain from securities in other
exempt offerings and in registered offerings.
Investor demand also will depend on whether state disclosure requirements are sufficient
to enable investors to evaluate the aforementioned characteristics of offerings made pursuant to
Rules 147, 147A or 504. For example, investors may be less willing to participate in offerings
that are made in reliance on exemptions both from state and federal registration and that are
subject to fewer disclosure requirements. For some investors, these concerns may be mitigated
by other state and federal provisions, such as the amendment being adopted to disqualify certain
bad actors from participation in Rule 504 offerings or the disclosure requirements for larger
intrastate crowdfunding offerings under state law provisions. 422
In sum, we believe that the potential use of Rules 147, 147A and 504 will depend largely
on how issuers perceive the trade-off between the costs of compliance under federal provisions

422

See NASAA’s Intrastate Crowdfunding Resource Center, available at http://www.nasaa.org/industryresources/corporation-finance/instrastate-crowdfunding-resource-center/.

118

as well as state regulation, if any, and the benefits of access to non-accredited investors. For
instance, relative to Regulation Crowdfunding, the extent to which issuers rely on Rules 147,
147A or 504 for intrastate crowdfunding offerings will depend on whether the benefits of a
larger offering amount and fewer reporting requirements outweigh the costs of a more
geographically limited investor base, compliance with issuer residency requirements and the
potential for registration under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. In this regard, we believe a
small, local business that serves local customers (e.g., a hair salon or a pizza shop), rather than a
scalable business like a technology start-up, is more likely to use intrastate crowdfunding than
interstate crowdfunding. 423 Compared to Rules 147, 147A and 504, other exemptions and safe
harbors already being utilized could remain attractive to issuers. For example, offerings
conducted pursuant to the exemption from registration under Rule 506(b) of Regulation D, which
accounts for a significant amount of exempt offerings, 424 are subject to limits on participation by
non-accredited investors. In contrast, issuers relying on Rules 147, 147A or 504 could generally
sell securities to an unlimited number of non-accredited investors, which would allow for a more
diffuse investor base. General solicitation is currently permitted under Rule 506(c) of Regulation
D, and issuers relying on Rule 506(c) can more easily reach institutional and accredited
investors, making it less necessary for them to seek capital from a broader non-accredited
investor base, especially if trading platforms aimed at accredited investors in privately placed
securities continue to develop. 425 In addition, offerings under Rule 506(b) that are limited to
423

See discussion in Section V.2 above.

425

See e.g., NASDAQ Private Market overview, available at
https://www.nasdaqprivatemarket.com/market/overview (explaining that “NASDAQ Private Market's

institutions and individual clients with access to the market. Companies use a private portal to enable
approved parties to access certain information and transact in its securities.”).

119

accredited investors require only a notice filing with the Commission and have no specified
disclosure requirements. Finally, relative to Regulation A, Rules 147, 147A and 504 will have
fewer disclosure and other regulatory requirements at the federal level. However, unlike
securities issued in reliance on Regulation A, which are freely tradable, securities issued under
Rules 147, 147A and 504 could be less liquid due to their resale restrictions.
Overall, the amendments to Rules 147, 147A and 504 could increase the aggregate
amount of capital raised if used by issuers that have not previously conducted securities
offerings. The net effect also will depend on whether investors find the rules’ investor
protections to be sufficient to evaluate the expected return and risk of such offerings. As noted
above, the final rules may have a limited impact on capital formation if they simply cause issuers
to conduct, and investors to reallocate their participation across, different types of offerings.
However, even redistribution among capital raising methods will have a net positive effect on
capital formation and allocative efficiency if it allows issuers to access capital at a lower cost.
As the final rules are not currently in effect, data does not exist to estimate the effect of
the final rules on the potential rate of substitution between alternative methods of raising capital
and the overall expansion or decline in capital raising by potential issuers affected by the rules.
However, we anticipate that the final rules, by lowering investor search costs and easing issuer
eligibility requirements, will result in an increased use of the federal intrastate offering
provisions, including for intrastate crowdfunding, as more states enact provisions facilitating
such offerings.

Similarly, we expect the final rules will increase the use of the Rule 504

exemption, especially by facilitating efforts among state securities regulators to implement
regional coordinated review programs that will enable regional offerings. Although it is not
possible to predict the extent of such increase or the type and size of issuers that will conduct

120

intrastate and small regional offerings, the current number of businesses pursuing similar levels
of financing through alternative capital raising methods, as discussed in the baseline analysis
above, provide an upper bound for Rule 147, Rule 147A and Rule 504 usage. 426 Nevertheless,
the baseline data show that the potential number of issuers that might seek to offer and sell
securities in reliance on Rules 147, 147A and 504 is large, particularly when compared to the
current number of approximately 9,000 reporting companies. 427
We recognize that the amendments to Rules 147 and 504 and new Rule 147A could raise
investor protection concerns. For instance, as discussed in detail further in this section, allowing
issuers with more geographically dispersed assets and revenues than currently permitted to rely
on Rules 147 and 147A may raise concerns about reduced oversight by state securities
regulators. We believe however, that the amended “doing business” tests along with the
principal place of business requirement are sufficient to provide assurance of the local nature of
an issuer’s business operations. 428 We also believe such concerns are mitigated by the continuing
applicability of state regulatory requirements, which may impose additional eligibility conditions
for issuers in these offerings, as well as the residency requirements for investors that remain
under the final rules.
Similarly, there could be concerns about not having an offering size limit at the federal
level or not requiring a limit under state law if the issuer relies on a state exemption for an

426

We believe the numbers in the baseline analysis provide an upper bound because, unlike Rule 147
offerings, investors from multiple states are permitted to invest in Regulation D offerings, which attracts
more issuers, especially those that want to raise larger amounts. Similarly, unlike Rule 504, Rule 506
provides state law preemption and permits unlimited offering amounts, which appears to make Rule 506
offerings more attractive for issuers.

121

intrastate offering. In adopting existing Rules 147, 504 and 505, the Commission relied
substantially upon state securities laws and regulations on the rationale that the size and/or local
nature of smaller offerings conducted pursuant to these provisions does not warrant imposing
extensive regulation at the federal level. 429 The final rules preserve this approach by permitting
state legislators and securities regulators to determine the specific additional rule requirements, if
any, that should be mandated to regulate local offerings and provide additional investor
protections. In this regard, the final rules provide greater flexibility to states in designing
regulations that would work best for issuers and investors in their respective jurisdictions. We
believe that such latitude could improve the efficiency of local capital markets and lead to
competition between states in attracting issuers to locate to their jurisdictions.
In addition to state regulations, the amendments to Rule 504 to disqualify certain bad
actors from participation in Rule 504 offerings could help to address such investor protection
concerns. We also note that the Commission will retain authority under the antifraud provisions
of the federal securities laws to pursue enforcement action against issuers and other persons
involved in such offerings. 430 Nevertheless, if investors demand higher returns because of a
perceived increase in the risk of fraud as a result of less extensive federal regulation, issuers may
face a higher cost of capital. We are unable to predict if or how the final rules will affect the
incidence of fraud in intrastate and Rule 504 offerings.
The impact of the repeal of Rule 505 will depend on the trade-offs that Rule 505 issuers
and investors face when switching to alternate offering methods, predominantly other

429

See Seed Capital Release and Rule 147 Adopting Release. See also, ABA Letter and NASAA Letter.

430

See, e.g., Seed Capital Release at note 20 and accompanying text (Rule 504 offerings are subject to Section
17 of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77q(a), Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78j(b) and Rule
10b-5 thereunder [17 CFR 240.10b-5]).

122

unregistered offerings. This will be contingent on whether issuers can raise the desired amount of
capital at the same or lesser cost as under Rule 505 in a timely manner.
For example, if issuers switch to offerings under Rule 506(b), they may only offer and
sell to investors that are accredited or that, unlike in a Rule 505 offering, either alone or with a
purchaser representative, 431 are sophisticated (i.e., have sufficient knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters to make them capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the
prospective investment). However, the possibility of raising unlimited amounts of capital and
preemption from state blue sky laws may offset some of these concerns for potential issuers that
subsequent to the repeal of Rule 505, would switch to a Rule 506 offering. In contrast, if issuers
switch to offerings under amended Rule 504, they could replicate most characteristics of an
offering under existing Rule 505 and receive some additional benefits, such as access to an
unlimited number of non-accredited investors and the ability to engage in general solicitation in
certain situations. However, reporting companies, albeit a small proportion of all Rule 505
issuers, 432 are not permitted to utilize the Rule 504 exemption.
As an alternative to Rule 505, issuers may also opt for a registered offering to raise
capital. As noted above, a registered offering may not be economically feasible for small issuers
relative to an exempt offering, 433 but may provide a reasonable alternative for Rule 505 issuers
that are reporting companies.. Registered offerings, unlike Rule 505 or Rule 506(b) offerings,
have benefits like providing investors with unrestricted securities, and providing issuers access to
431

A purchaser representative is someone who is not an affiliate of the issuer but has such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters that he is capable of evaluating, alone, or together with other
purchaser representatives of the purchaser, or together with the purchaser, the merits and risks of the
prospective investment. See also Rule 501, Regulation D of Securities Act.

432

As discussed in Section IV(A)(1)(ii), the number of reporting companies that conducted a Rule 505
offering during 2014 and 2015 was 10 and 8, respectively.

See discussion in Section V(A(1)(c)(2) above.

an unlimited number of non-accredited investors and investors who prefer offerings that have the
protections of the registration process. On the other hand, the costs of registering an offering
compared with costs of raising capital through an exempt offering, including Rule 505 or Rule
506(b) offerings, may also affect an issuer’s willingness to switch to a registered offering. Such
costs include the costs of disclosure required for a registered offering relative to the disclosure
required under Rule 505 or 506(b) when non-accredited investors are solicited, 434 including any
costs associated with Commission staff review of the registration statement. Recent regulatory
changes to Form S-1 435 that permit forward incorporation by reference of certain information
required under Exchange Act reporting requirements may have lowered the costs of registered
offerings for eligible smaller reporting companies by eliminating the need to update information
in the Form S-1 that has become stale or is incomplete through a post-effective amendment.
Whether Rule 505 issuers, in particular those that are reporting companies, switch to a registered
offering or another form of unregistered offering such as Rule 506 offering will depend on how
they assess such costs of registration relative to the benefits like broader access to non-accredited
investors. 436
The effect of the repeal of Rule 505 will also depend on investors’ willingness and ability
to participate in an alternate unregistered offering, such as a Rule 504 or Rule 506 offering, or a

434

The disclosure requirements under Rule 505 and Rule 506(b) for an Exchange Act reporting issuer that
sells securities to a non-accredited investor are similar to the disclosure requirements for a registered
offering under the Securities Act. See Rule 502(b)(2)(ii) of Regulation D. Note that if the Rule 505 or
506(b) offering is soliciting only accredited investors, there is no equivalent requirement for information
being furnished.

registered offering. This willingness will rest on whether investors find disclosure requirements
and investor protections in alternate markets to be sufficient, relative to the Rule 505 market, to
evaluate the expected return and risk of such offerings. For example, it is possible that investor
protection levels will be perceived to be lower in a Rule 506 offering as these offerings are
preempted from state or Commission registration. In addition, “unsophisticated” non-accredited
investors that may have been able to participate in a Rule 505 investment opportunity may not be
able to participate in a Rule 506(b) offering without a purchaser representative and hence may
find their set of investment opportunities reduced. Similarly, while more than 35 non-accredited
investors (the maximum eligible to invest in a Rule 505 offering) will be able to participate in an
offering under amended Rule 504, Rule 504 has fewer disclosure requirements at the federal
level relative to a Rule 505 or 506 offering, which may raise potential investor protection
concerns. Such concerns, however, may be offset by disclosure requirements imposed at the
state level. Thus, the net impact on the overall level of investor protection will likely depend on
the capital markets that substitute for the repealed Rule 505 market.
Overall, the repeal of Rule 505 may not have a significant or any impact on capital
formation if issuers can successfully find commensurate investor interest in an alternate
unregistered or registered offering market. If issuers are not able to find an alternate exemption
and raise sufficient amounts of capital, an outcome we believe is unlikely, overall capital
formation in the economy and allocative efficiency of capital markets could slightly decline.
In the sections below, we analyze in more detail the potential costs and benefits
stemming from the specific amendments and new rule being adopted today, as well as their
impact on efficiency, competition and capital formation, relative to the baseline discussed above.

2. Analysis of Amendments to Existing Rule 147 and New Rule 147A
The amendments to Rule 147 and new Rule 147A will modernize and expand the options
available under federal law for exempt intrastate offerings by local companies, including
offerings relying upon crowdfunding provisions under state securities laws.
a. Retention of Existing Rule 147
The proposed amendments would have replaced the existing Rule 147 safe harbor with a
new intrastate offering exemption. In contrast, the final rules amend Rule 147 and retain it as a
safe harbor under Section 3(a)(11), while also establishing new Rule 147A pursuant to the
Commission’s general exemptive authority under Section 28. Because most state crowdfunding
provisions require issuers to comply with Section 3(a)(11) and Rule 147, retention of Rule 147
within the statutory parameters of Section 3(a)(11) will enable issuers to continue to rely upon
the existing safe harbor to conduct intrastate offerings until states update their laws or regulations
to allow issuers to rely on new Rule 147A. 437 This will help to ensure that intrastate offering
activity is not adversely affected during the interim period or in states that do not amend their
laws, and will thus provide greater certainty to market participants, including issuers and
investors who participate in such intrastate offerings. 438 Together, the amendments to Rule 147
and new Rule 147A seek to modernize federal regulation of intrastate offerings to comport with
contemporary business practices and communications technology, while retaining the underlying
intent of the rules to permit issuers to raise money from investors resident within the same state
without registering the offering at the federal level.

437

Most states that have enacted state crowdfunding provisions require issuers to comply with the provisions
of Section 3(a)(11) and Rule 147. See note 30 above.

438

See, e.g., ABA Letter, NASAA Letter, CrowdCheck Letter, Guzik Letter, NextSeed Letter and the 2015
Small Business Forum Recommendations.

126

Amended Rule 147 will differ from new Rule 147A with respect to two provisions that
are statutorily mandated by Section 3(a)(11). Under Section 3(a)(11), and by extension the safe
harbor under Rule 147, offers can be made only to in-state residents and issuers are required to
be incorporated in the state where they conduct the intrastate offering. The provisions of new
Rule 147A will not include these two limitations; however, both Rule 147 and 147A will require
an issuer to have its principal place of business within the state or territory of the offering. In the
following sections, we first discuss the economic effects of not including the two statutory
limitations contained in Rule 147 within new Rule 147A and then discuss the amendments that
are substantially identical under Rules 147 and 147A.
b. Distinguishing Provisions under New Rule 147A
i. Elimination of Restrictions on Manner of Offering
Offers pursuant to current and amended Rule 147 must be limited to in-state residents. 439
However, the provisions under new Rule 147A will allow an issuer to make offers to out-of-state
residents, as long as sales are made only to residents of the issuer’s state or territory. 440 Both
amended Rule 147 and new Rule 147A require issuers to include prominent disclosures on all
offering materials stating that sales will be made only to residents of the same state or territory as
the issuer, while also disclosing that the securities are being sold in an unregistered offering and
have resale restrictions for a six-month period. 441 In addition, under both rules, states retain the
flexibility to impose additional disclosure or other requirements related to offers and sales made
in the intrastate offering. As Internet-based advertising is easily accessible across state lines,

439

See Rule 147(b).

440

See Rule 147A(b).

441

See Rules 147(f) and 147A(f).

127

issuers relying on existing Rule 147 that choose to disseminate offering materials using online
media could have a higher risk of being non-compliant unless they take additional and
potentially costly precautions to restrict any advertising that can be viewed outside their state of
incorporation. Eliminating manner of offering restrictions in Rule 147A will allow issuers to
engage in broad-based solicitations, including on publicly accessible websites, in order to
successfully locate potential in-state investors. For example, an issuer resident in New Jersey
will be permitted under Rule 147A to advertise and disseminate offering information through
online media to reach New Jersey residents, including those who may work and access the online
solicitation while in New York. Thus, Rule 147A will provide issuers with the flexibility to
utilize a wider array of options to advertise their offerings, allowing them to take advantage of
modern communication technologies such as the Internet and other social media platforms to
reach investors. 442 In this regard, we expect Rule 147A to be particularly effective at facilitating
state-based crowdfunding offerings that rely heavily on online platforms to bring issuers and
investors together. 443 Online advertising provides a lower cost and more efficient means of
communicating with a more diffused base of prospective investors. Consequently, eliminating
manner of offering restrictions in Rule 147A should result in lower search costs for Rule 147A
issuers. The provisions may facilitate compliance with the rules’ requirements as issuers will not
need to limit advertising or take additional precautions to ensure that only in-state residents view
the offering.
Under the final rules, issuers will be able to choose between utilizing Rule 147 and Rule
147A for intrastate offerings based on their preferences for communicating with investors. This

442

128

could enable a larger number of issuers to utilize intrastate offerings to meet their capital raising
needs. To the extent issuers shift from another unregistered capital market to the Rule 147A
market, capital formation may not increase but the allocative efficiency of capital markets could
improve, if issuers are able to meet their capital raising needs more effectively and investors are
better able to find investment opportunities that satisfy their financial objectives. We believe
that eliminating the manner of offering restrictions in Rule 147A will attract a number of new
issuers that previously could not avail themselves of lower-cost capital raising opportunities,
such as intrastate crowdfunding, that primarily rely on online media to advertise the offering to
large numbers of investors. Such improved access to cheaper capital raising methods may result
in higher levels of capital formation in the economy.
In addition, eliminating manner of offering restrictions in Rule 147A may result in a
greater number of investors becoming aware of a larger and more diverse set of investment
opportunities in private offerings, enabling them to diversify their investment portfolios and
allocate their capital more efficiently. Further, broadly advertised offerings under Rule 147A
may compete for potential investors more effectively with offerings where general solicitation is
also permitted, such as Rule 504, Rule 506(c), and Regulation A offerings. The final rules could
thus intensify competition among unregistered capital markets for attracting issuers that want to
raise capital and investors that are looking for suitable investment opportunities. An increase in
competition could change the number and type of market participants across various markets,
which would impact the relative demand for and supply of capital in each of these markets.
However, as issuers utilizing Rule 147A advertise more widely and freely, the likelihood
of out-of-state investors purchasing into an intrastate offering could increase. The inclusion of
legends and other mandatory disclosures may mitigate this concern and may provide a certain

129

measure of investor protection, although out-of-state investors in their desire to participate in an
attractive investment opportunity may overlook the legends or disclosures or may simply
disregard them. While issuers are required to have a reasonable belief that all their purchasers
are resident within the state and obtain a written representation from each purchaser as to his or
her residence, the probability of circumventing the out-of-state sale restrictions by investors who
misrepresent their residency status could increase as out-of-state residents may view Internetbased advertising and become aware of Rule 147A offerings in another state. Likewise, there
may be an increased probability that out-of-state purchasers will attempt to purchase in resale
transactions that occur within the restricted period. However, due to inclusion of rule provisions
such as the requirement of written representation by investors as to their residency status as well
as requirements related to legends, transfer agent instructions and prominent disclosure about
limitations on resales, we believe that such concerns may not be significantly higher than under
amended Rule 147, which retains the restrictions related to manner of offerings. Allowing
Internet-based advertising of Rule 147A offerings and the potential increased use of the intrastate
offering exemptions could also impact the effectiveness of state oversight if regulators do not
have adequate resources to monitor the manner in which these securities are marketed to the
general public. Overall, we believe that the final rules will modernize existing regulations to
reflect modern business practices and technological developments while maintaining appropriate
investor protections.
ii. Incorporation and Principal Place of Business
Requirements
New Rule 147A will eliminate the current requirements in Rule 147 for issuers to be
incorporated and have their principal office in the state where an offering is being conducted. In
order to establish sufficient in-state presence to be eligible to conduct an exempt intrastate
130

offering, in lieu of such requirements, Rule 147A will require issuers to have their principal
place of business in the state where an offering is conducted. The principal place of business
will be defined as the location from which officers, partners or managers of the issuer primarily
direct, control and coordinate the activities of the issuer. 444
We believe that the elimination of the incorporation or organization in-state requirement
in Rule 147A better comports with modern business practices and thereby will make it easier for
a greater number of issuers to utilize the new exemption, relative to amended Rule 147. A
significant number of public and private companies are incorporated in states other than the state
in which their principal place of business is located, thereby precluding otherwise eligible issuers
from utilizing Rule 147 to conduct an intrastate offering. 445
Most of these companies have chosen to incorporate in jurisdictions where corporate laws
are consistent with modern business practices or provide more flexibility. 446 For example,
according to one academic study, corporate laws affect company value, even after controlling for

444

See Rule 147A(c)(1). Corporations, limited partnerships and trusts relying on amended Rule 147 will
continue to be required to be organized or incorporated in the state where the offering is being conducted in
order to establish in-state residency. Rule 147(c), however, will be amended by replacing the principal
office requirement with a principal place of business requirement. We believe principal place of business is
conceptually similar to principal office location. See Section II(A)(2).

445

For example, based on analysis of EDGAR filing data, 76% of Exchange Act reporting companies
indicated, in their 2015 Form 10-K filings, that they had a separate state of principal executive office and
state of incorporation. Analyzing by size (assets), more than two-thirds of the smallest 10% of reporting
companies reported different states of incorporation and principal office. The practice of incorporating in
different states extends beyond public companies to private and smaller companies. During 2009-2015,
37% of Rule 504 offerings and 39% in Rule 505 offerings indicated in their Form D filings that they had
different states of incorporation and principal place of business. See baseline analysis in Section
IV(A)(1)(ii). Form D data also indicates that approximately 65% of all Rule 506 offerings initiated during
2009-2015 reported different states of incorporation and operations. While smaller companies may be less
likely than larger companies to have separate states of incorporation and principal places of business, Form
D data indicates that a considerable number of small businesses are currently unable to meet the state of
incorporation requirement in existing Rule 147.

446

See ABA Letter, CFA Letter, CrowdCheck Letter, Milken Letter.

131

company size, diversification, profitability, investment opportunities and industry. 447 Thus,
companies may have strong incentives to select perceived favorable regimes, such as that of
Delaware. 448 These studies and industry practices indicate that companies’ choice of state of
incorporation depends on the economic benefits derived from the regulatory environment in
which the company is organized and not necessarily where the company operates most
efficiently.
Since the geographical location of investment and employment is aligned more closely
with the principal place of business of a company than where it is incorporated, we believe
replacing the current incorporation and residency requirements of current Rule 147 with a
principal place of business requirement in Rule 147A will be sufficient to establish the in-state
nature of the issuer’s business. Such a change will also be consistent with the objectives of the
current intrastate offering exemption, while making it easier for more issuers to utilize the new
exemption relative to the amended Rule 147 safe harbor under Section 3(a)(11).
By not requiring issuers to be incorporated in-state, it may be possible for foreign
incorporated issuers that have their principal place of business in a U.S. state to be able to access
the Rule 147A capital market. This will create a uniform standard for companies that are
operating locally, irrespective of their country or state of incorporation, to utilize the Rule 147A
exemption. Form D filings for the period 2009-2015 reported that approximately 2.5% of
Regulation D offerings (approximately 3,211 offerings) were initiated by issuers that were
incorporated outside of the United States and had their principal place of business in a U.S. state.

Domestic Tax Haven,” J. FIN. ECON., Volume 108, Issue 3, (2013) at 751-772 (explaining that Delaware’s
tax laws play an economically important role in U.S. companies’ decision to locate in Delaware).

132

Allowing issuers to raise capital in the state in which it has its principal place of business,
without regard to the jurisdiction of incorporation under new Rule 147A, could enable issuers to
organize or incorporate in foreign jurisdictions with perceived advantages that may increase the
financial viability of such issuers, especially for early stage companies. However, to the extent
that it is more difficult to enforce securities and other relevant laws against such foreign
organized or incorporated issuers, risks to investors in such issuers could increase. Overall,
given the intrastate character of Rule 147A offerings, we do not think it likely that a significant
number of foreign issuers will seek to utilize this exemption.
Under Rule 147 and Rule 147A, issuers will be able to have a “principal place of
business” within only one state or territory, and therefore the issuer will be able to conduct an
intrastate (Rule 147 or Rule 147A) offering in only one state or territory. To mitigate the risk of
issuers switching their principal place of business to a different state in order to conduct Rule
147 or Rule 147A offerings in multiple states, the final rules limit issuers that change their
principal place of business from utilizing the exemption to conduct another intrastate offering in
a different state for a period of six months from the date of last sale of securities under the prior
Rule 147 or Rule 147A offering. These provisions will help to deter issuers from misusing the
amended residency requirements to change their principal place of business in order to sell to
residents in multiple states. The duration of this limitation is consistent with the period for
which resales to out-of-state investors will be prohibited.
To the extent a change in principal place of business to a new state is motivated by
business or regulatory considerations, this amendment could affect the capital raising prospects
of companies by requiring them to delay their subsequent intrastate offerings or seek to conduct
an offering under another exemption. For example, certain start-ups and small businesses that

133

could potentially relocate their principal place of business in pursuit of costs savings could be
affected by the final rules.
c. Common Requirements of Amended Rule 147 and New Rule 147A
i. “Doing Business” In-State Tests
Similar to the proposed amendments, the final rules will modify the current “doing
business” in-state requirements in Rule 147 by requiring issuers to satisfy one of four specified
tests. A similar requirement will be included in Rule 147A. The specified tests will include a
new test whereby issuers can satisfy the “doing business” requirement if a majority of their
employees are located in the offering state. Specifically, under amended Rule 147 and new Rule
147A, in order to be deemed “doing business” in a state, issuers will have to satisfy at least one
of the following requirements:
•

80% of the issuer’s consolidated assets are located within such state or territory;

•

80% of the issuer’s consolidated gross revenues are derived from the operation of a
business or of real property located in or from the rendering of services within such state
or territory;

•

80% of the net proceeds from the offering are intended to be used by the issuer, and are
in fact used, in connection with the operation of a business or of real property, the
purchase of real property located in, or the rendering of services within such state or
territory; or

•

A majority of the issuer’s employees are in such state or territory.
The modifications to the existing “doing business” in-state tests will modernize the Rule

147 safe harbor and provide greater flexibility to potential issuers relying on Rules 147 and 147A
to conduct intrastate offerings. This will ease issuer burden in complying with the provisions,
134

while also better aligning the rules with modern business practices such that issuers will be able
to use the test that best reflects the local nature of their business operations. 449
Rule 147 currently requires issuers to satisfy all three “doing business” in-state tests,
which can be burdensome even for small businesses that have a strong nexus to one state. For
example, for some startups and early stage ventures that are unable to access alternate methods
of raising capital and therefore seek to rely on the intrastate offering exemption, the existing
“doing business” tests, by restricting these issuers’ operations and capital investments
substantially to one state may have adverse effects on their growth and viability. Moreover, in
recent years new business models have emerged that may make satisfying all three tests ill-suited
for issuers who would otherwise be able to rely on Rule 147 as a capital raising option. For
example, businesses that use new technologies (e.g., e-businesses) to make their operations more
efficient tend to be more geographically distributed in their operations or revenues than what is
permitted under current Rule 147. 450 According to an academic study, advances in computing
and communications have fundamentally changed how information can be stored, distributed,
modified or assimilated, which has enabled businesses to become more geographically dispersed
and modular rather than centralized into discrete units. 451 Similarly, the growth of modern
technologies has made it easier for companies, through e-commerce and shared logistical
networks, to reach a larger and more diffused customer base, leading to more dispersed revenue
streams.
449

See also CFA Letter.

450

Consider the example of an e-commerce company that invests in distribution facilities outside its state to
meet the needs of customers who are resident outside that state. Under current requirements, such an issuer
may be able to invest only a small part (less than 20%) of the capital raised in a Rule 147 offering outside
its principal state of business to remain eligible for the exemption. See also NASAA Letter.

451

See Mohanbir Sawhney and Deval Parikh, “Where Value Lives in A Networked World,” Harvard Business
Review (2001).

135

Requiring an issuer to own a majority of its assets, invest most of the capital it raises, and
obtain its revenue in one state could create inefficient constraints for startups and small
businesses to operate and grow in the modern business environment. While the original intent of
Section 3(a)(11) and Rule 147 was to ensure that investors and issuers are located in the same
state so that they are potentially familiar with each other, 452 current business practices of issuers,
consumption habits of customers, and the set of available investment opportunities of investors
have expanded greatly since Rule 147 was adopted in 1974. In view of these changes, we
believe that the modifications to the “doing business” requirements in the final rules will provide
issuers with greater flexibility in conducting intrastate offerings and help to eliminate potential
uncertainty about the availability of intrastate offering exemptions.
Compared to current Rule 147, the revised “doing business” requirements in the final
rules will enable a greater number of companies to rely on Rule 147 or Rule 147A to raise capital
through local offerings. Such new issuers could be those entities that are currently accessing
capital through alternate means, or they could be issuers that could not previously raise sufficient
amounts of capital in any market but would be able to use amended Rule 147 or new Rule 147A
to meet their funding needs. In addition, to the extent raising capital in a Rule 147 or Rule 147A
offering is less costly than raising capital using alternate means, issuers will benefit from such
lower costs. Easier access to local capital may enable issuers to finance investment opportunities
in a timely manner, thereby accelerating company growth and promoting state employment and
economic growth.
As more companies become eligible or are willing to raise capital pursuant to amended
Rule 147 or new Rule 147A, the set of investment opportunities for investors will also increase
452

See Rule 147 Adopting Release.

136

in a corresponding manner, resulting in greater allocative efficiency and capital formation.
These economic benefits generally depend on the extent to which increased use of the intrastate
offering provisions, compared to current Rule 147, arises as a result of substitution out of other
types of offerings. On one hand, if increased use of the intrastate offering provisions causes
issuers and investors to migrate from other types of offerings as a result of marginally more
attractive prospects for investment and capital raising, the aggregate increase in capital formation
may not be significant but competition amongst types of private offerings will be higher. 453 On
the other hand, if amended Rule 147 or new Rule 147A attracts new issuers, capital formation
levels will increase in the economy. We believe that, by facilitating intrastate crowdfunding, the
final rules could provide new company growth and consequently lead to an overall increase in
capital formation. Further, the final rules could lead to increased capital formation by facilitating
other state registered or exempt offerings, including those with amounts greater than what is
allowed for intrastate crowdfunding offerings. However, since we do not have data on the
existing use of Rule 147, we are unable to quantify or predict the extent of any increase in
offering activity under amended Rule 147 or new Rule 147A.
At the same time, if issuers with assets and operations dispersed over more than one state
make use of amended Rule 147 or new Rule 147A, there may be concerns that state oversight of
such issuers could weaken, with a consequent reduction in investor protection. We believe,
however, that qualifying under any one of the four “doing business” in-state tests and requiring
an issuer to have its principal place of business in the state, such that the officers and managers
of the issuer primarily direct, control and coordinate the activities of the issuer in the state, will

453

We note that issuers that meet current requirements under existing Rule 147 will also be eligible to rely on
amended Rule 147 or Rule 147A.

137

provide state regulators with a sufficient basis from which to monitor an issuer’s activities and
enforce state securities laws for the protection of their residents. 454 Further, state enforcement
actions aimed at protecting in-state investors can extend to issuers whose assets are located
beyond the boundaries of the state, which could potentially deter issuers from engaging in
fraudulent intrastate offerings. Moreover, with the adoption of amendments to Rule 147 and new
Rule 147A, state regulators may choose to amend their state regulations to comport with these
provisions, which would allow them to consider any additional requirements, including
qualification tests, for issuers to comply with state securities offerings regulations.
Finally, we note that the high threshold levels specified in the final rules’ “doing
business” tests may preclude certain issuers whose business models result in widely distributed
operations (e.g., some e-commerce companies) from qualifying under any of the four tests and
thus from relying on these intrastate offering provisions. Such issuers could rely on alternate
capital raising methods such as Regulation Crowdfunding. To the extent these issuers are unable
to raise the required capital through alternate methods, these provisions could adversely impact
capital formation and investment opportunities for such firms. We believe, however, that the
vast majority of issuers will be able to satisfy the “doing business” test requirements in order to
qualify for local capital-raising.
ii. Reasonable Belief and Written Representation As to
Purchaser Residency Status
Amended Rule 147 and new Rule 147A include a reasonable belief standard for
determining whether a purchaser is a state resident at the time of the sale of the securities. In a
change from the proposed rules, the final rules will retain the requirement of current Rule 147
454

See also CFA Letter and NASAA letter.

138

that an issuer obtain investor representations as to his or her residency status. The reasonable
belief standard is conceptually consistent with similar requirements in Regulation D offerings
and will provide greater certainty to issuers as to their compliance with the conditions of the
exemption, potentially encouraging greater reliance on the final rules. 455
Retaining the written representation requirement could constrain issuer flexibility if the
requirement predisposes them to rely on particular modes of residency verification over
others. 456 It could also result in somewhat higher compliance costs for issuers. At the same
time, the requirement could help to better ensure that issuers are selling to investors who are
residents of the state in which the offering is being conducted. In this way, requiring a
representation as to the purchaser’s residency may mitigate some of the investor protection
concerns raised by commenters. 457 While a formal representation of residency by itself is not
sufficient to establish a reasonable belief that such purchasers are in-state residents, the
representation requirement, together with the reasonable belief standard, may result in better
compliance with the final rules, which would serve to increase investor protections. It is
possible, however, that some issuers may consider a written representation to be dispositive of
reasonable belief of investor’s residency status, which would increase the risk of issuers’
violating the final rules.
As an alternative, we considered providing a safe harbor for determining purchaser’s
residence, as requested by several commenters. 458 A safe harbor could provide greater certainty

455

See NASAA Letter.

456

For example, issuers may find it easier to obtain a proof of residency document directly from the purchaser
along with a written representation, whereas they may have found it more efficient to rely on an alternate
mode like third-party verification if a written representation was not required.

for issuers as to their compliance with the rules’ provisions, potentially encouraging greater use
of the intrastate offering exemptions and enhancing capital formation. However, a safe harbor
also could be viewed as an exclusive or a minimum standard that could restrict issuer choice of
verification methods, and we believe that requiring issuers to consider the facts and
circumstances of the offering and sale will best serve issuers’ compliance with the final rules.
iii. Residence of Entity Purchasers
Amended Rule 147 and new Rule 147A define the residence of a purchaser that is a legal
entity—such as a corporation, partnership, trust or other form of business organization—as the
location where, at the time of the sale, the entity has its principal place of business. This
definition will create consistency in defining the place of residence of entity investors with that
of the issuer while also helping to ensure that investors are sufficiently local by nature.
iv. Limitations on Resales
Consistent with the proposal, amended Rule 147 and new Rule 147A will limit resales to
in-state residents during a defined restricted period from the date of sale by the issuer. In a
change from the proposed rules, this restricted period has been reduced from nine to six months.
Current Rule 147 provides a restricted period of nine months, and the start date for the restricted
period is from “date of last sale” rather than from the “date of sale” for the particular security in
question. In addition, the issuers’ ability to rely on Rules 147 and 147A will not be conditioned
on a purchaser’s compliance with the rules’ resale restrictions.
Under the final rules, after expiration of the restricted period, investors will be able to sell
their securities to out-of-state purchasers, even if the offering is not yet completed. While
reducing the restricted period to six months may raise investor protection concerns, including
concerns about increased probability that the securities will be purchased with an intention to

140

distribute, we are persuaded by commenters that suggested a six-month period would be
adequate to assure that the securities have come-to-rest in the state of issuance. 459 In addition,
state regulators will have the flexibility to impose additional transfer restrictions under amended
Rule 147 or new Rule 147A, if warranted within their jurisdiction. Additional language in
amended Rule 147(e) and new Rule 147A(e) that specifies that all re-sales during this six-month
restricted period will be limited to the state or territory in which the issuer is a resident at the
time of the sale of the security by the issuer will help to maintain the intrastate nature of the
offering even if the issuer relocates its principal place of business to a different state. The final
rules, by shortening the restricted period, will provide greater liquidity for Rule 147 and Rule
147A securities, making them more attractive to investors, which could lead to greater investor
participation and an increase in the supply of capital available in intrastate offerings. Further, it
could improve price discovery and lead to lower capital raising costs for issuers.
Additionally, not conditioning the availability of amended Rule 147 or new Rule 147A
on the issuer complying with the provisions relating to resale restrictions will provide greater
certainty to issuers conducting an offering pursuant to these provisions. For example, issuers
will not need to be concerned about potentially losing the exemption if the resale provisions are
violated under circumstances that are beyond their control. At the same time, given that issuers
will continue to be subject to other compliance requirements, such as in-state sales limitations,
mandatory offeree and purchaser disclosures, and stop transfer instructions, as well as federal
antifraud and civil liability provisions, we believe that the final rules will not reduce investor
protections.

459

See note 157. See also text accompanying notes 167 and 168.

141

Rule 147(f) and new Rule 147A(f) require disclosure of the resale restrictions to every
offeree in the manner in which the offering is communicated. Compared to the requirements in
current Rule 147, which require written disclosure of resale restrictions, these provisions will
provide greater flexibility to issuers and ease compliance burdens in cases of oral offers, while
potentially making it easier for investors to be made aware of the resale restrictions at the time an
offer is made. This change will lower the regulatory burden for issuers, especially smaller
issuers; however, where an offer is communicated other than in writing, it also may adversely
impact the information provided to potential investors (offerees) because the investor may not
receive such information in writing at the time an offering is initially made and being considered.
To the extent that investors would be more likely to comprehend or heed written disclosures,
these changes may adversely impact investor protection. This impact will be mitigated by the
requirement to provide disclosure about resale restrictions, in writing, to every purchaser a
reasonable period of time before the date of sale. 460
Rule 147(f)(3) is also being amended to remove the requirement to disclose to offerees
and purchasers the stop transfer instructions provided by an issuer to its transfer agent and the
provisions of Rule 147(f)(2) regarding the issuance of new certificates during the resale period,
which also will ease compliance burdens for issuers. These changes are not expected to
adversely affect investor protection, since the information in question relates to technical aspects
of the securities transfer process and does not address securities ownership rights as such.
v. Integration
The final rules, similar to the proposed rules, will expand the current Rule 147 integration
safe harbor such that offers and sales pursuant to amended Rule 147 or Rule 147A will not be
460

Id.

142

integrated with: (i) any offers or sales of securities made prior to the commencement of the
offering, (ii) any offers or sales made more than six months after the completion of the offering,
or (iii) any subsequent offer or sale of securities that is either registered under the Securities Act,
exempt from registration pursuant to Regulation A, Regulation S, Rule 701, or Section 4(a)(6),
or made pursuant to an employee benefit plan. Compared to the integration safe harbor in
current Rule 147, the expanded integration safe harbor in the final rules will provide issuers with
greater certainty that they can engage in other exempt or registered offerings either prior to or
near in time of an intrastate offering without risk of becoming ineligible to rely on Rule 147 or
Rule 147A. Similarly, the addition of Section 4(a)(6) to the list of exempt offerings that will not
be integrated with a Rule 147 or Rule 147A offering will provide certainty to issuers that they
can conduct concurrent crowdfunding offerings as per the provisions of the respective
exemptions. This flexibility and ensuing regulatory predictability will be especially beneficial
for small issuers who likely face greater challenges in relying on a single financing option for
raising sufficient capital. While the expanded scope of the integration safe harbor may raise
concerns that an issuer could more easily structure a single transaction as a series of exempt
offerings to avoid securities registration, 461 the final rules provide for non-integration only to the
extent that the issuer meets the requirements of each of the offering exemptions being used to
raise capital. 462 Furthermore, the final rules require an issuer to wait at least 30 calendar days
between its last offer made to investors other than qualified institutional buyers or institutional
accredited investors in reliance on Rule 147 or Rule 147A and the filing of a registration
statement with the Commission, which will provide additional protection to investors in

461

See NASAA Letter

462

See also note 177.

143

registered offerings who might otherwise be influenced by an earlier intrastate offering.
Therefore, we do not believe that the adoption of the integration safe harbor will result in
reduced investor protections.
vi. Intrastate Broker-Dealer Exemption and Additional
Considerations
We are also providing guidance regarding the use of the Internet by a person that seeks to
rely on the intrastate broker-dealer exemption. 463 Our guidance clarifies that a person whose
business otherwise meets the requirements of the intrastate broker-dealer exemption should not
cease to qualify for the exemption solely because it has a website that may be viewed by out-ofstate persons, so long as the broker-dealer takes measures reasonably designed to ensure that its
business remains exclusively intrastate. This guidance will provide greater certainty to market
participants about intermediaries’ ability to participate in intrastate offerings that seek to raise
capital via online media without having to register as a broker-dealer with the Commission.
Such certainty may increase both the demand for and the supply of intermediaries in Rule 147
and Rule 147A offerings, which could facilitate a greater number of intrastate offerings,
especially crowdfunding offerings. At the same time, despite the measures taken by brokerdealers that are reasonably designed to ensure that their businesses remain exclusively intrastate,
the risk of non-compliance with the exemptions under Section 5 may somewhat increase for
issuers if out-of-state investors, attracted by the intrastate broker’s website, invest in the offering
through misrepresentations of their residency status.

463

Exchange Act Section 15(a)(1) exempts from broker-dealer registration requirements under Section 15(b) a
broker-dealer whose business is exclusively intrastate and who does not use any facility of a national
securities exchange.

144

vii. Alternatives Considered
The paragraphs below discuss major alternatives that we considered in addition to the
alternatives discussed in the individual sub-sections above.
(a)

“Doing Business” Tests

As an alternative to the “doing business” tests in the final rules, we considered lowering
the percentage thresholds for the existing tests but retaining the requirement that all tests be
satisfied. For example, compared with the current 80% threshold requirements, requiring issuers
to have the majority of their assets, derive the majority of their revenue, and use the majority of
their offering proceeds in-state could better comport with modern business practices, provide
greater flexibility and make it less burdensome for issuers to satisfy these requirements, while
still providing some indicia of the in-state nature of the issuer’s business. 464 Such a change
would also provide a consistent standard for the “doing business” tests in Rule 147 and Rule
147A, aligning the current tests with the new majority employees test and tests from other rules
that use a majority threshold for determining issuer status, such as the test for determining
foreign private issuer status. 465 In this way, such an alternative could encourage greater reliance
on Rule 147 and Rule 147A and thereby promote additional capital formation through exempt
intrastate offerings. However, lowering the percentage thresholds would necessarily weaken the
required nexus between the issuer and the state contemplated by current Rule 147 and Section
3(a)(11). To the extent that such a change would result in less effective state regulation, there
could be increased concerns that investor protections in exempt intrastate offerings may be
reduced.

464

See, e.g., Milken Letter.

465

See Securities Act Rule 405 and Exchange Act Rule 3b-4.

145

As another alternative to the final rules, we considered eliminating the requirement to
qualify under any of the “doing business” tests. This alternative would significantly ease the
burden for potential issuers in complying with Rules 147 and 147A, while also modernizing the
rules to better align them with current business practices. As described above, in recent years
new business models have emerged that may make the eligibility tests ill-suited for relying on
the intrastate exemptions as a capital raising option. In view of broad changes in modern
business practices, the principal place of business requirement may be sufficiently effective in
establishing the local nature of an offering pursuant to Rule 147 or Rule 147A for purposes of
compliance with the “doing business” in-state requirement at the federal level. The alternative
will enable a larger number of issuers to qualify under the intrastate exemptions, which could
increase capital formation. Relative to the adopted approach, this alternative also could provide
more flexibility to state regulators to enact their own eligibility and residency requirements that
better suit the interests of issuers and investors in their state, rather than imposing a uniform
approach at the federal level that may function more effectively in some states than others.
However, eliminating the “doing business” tests could allow issuers with widelydispersed operations over more than one state or even no business operations (besides having a
principal place of business in-state) to make greater use of amended Rule 147 or new Rule 147A.
Without sufficient local presence or an appropriate nexus with the issuer and the state, local
oversight of such issuers could weaken, with a consequent decrease in investor protection.
Although some of these concerns could be mitigated by continuing to restrict sales to in-state
residents and the inclusion of the principal place of business requirement, as well as by the
ability of states to extend their enforcement activities to issuers whose assets are located beyond
state borders, we believe the approach we are adopting in the final rules will provide issuers with

146

sufficient flexibility to satisfy these requirements, while maintaining important indicia of the instate nature of the issuer’s business. As noted above, given the other changes we are adopting to
modernize our exemptive framework for intrastate offerings, we believe it is appropriate to first
observe how the updated doing business in-state requirements are used by issuers in practice
before making any further changes
(b)

State Law Requirements and Additional Federal
Restrictions

In a change from the proposed rules, the final rules will not require that the offering be
registered under state law or conducted pursuant to a state law exemption that limits the amount
of securities an issuer may sell pursuant to amended Rule 147 or new Rule 147A and the amount
of securities than can be purchased by an investor in the offering. These requirements, as
proposed, could provide additional protections at the federal level and could mitigate investor
protection concerns that may arise from the modernization of the federal regulatory regime
applicable to intrastate offerings. However, as noted by some commenters, conditioning the final
rules on specified state law requirements would reduce the flexibility of state regulators to design
rules that best conform to the requirements of issuers and investors in their states and, by
imposing a uniform standard, could disadvantage certain jurisdictions relative to others. 466 Such
requirements could thus unduly restrict capital raising options of issuers, especially those issuers
that sell primarily to accredited investors, and could also restrict legitimate state interests in
permitting larger offerings within their jurisdictions that otherwise rely on the federal intrastate
exemptions.

466

See CFIRA Letter, Milken Letter, NASAA Letter, NextSeed letter. See also ABA Letter stating that such
limits would be inconsistent “with Congressional intent that local offerings do not require federal
regulation and are best left to be regulated by the states”.

147

We also note that the maximum amount that can be raised under existing intrastate
crowdfunding provisions is less than the limit of $5 million that was proposed as a limit on
certain intrastate offerings. Most of these states have also adopted provisions that impose
investment limitations on investors. Thus, the protections provided by such limitations will
remain available to investors in many intrastate crowdfunding offerings. States also retain the
flexibility to enact additional measures under state law to strengthen issuer eligibility
requirements for intrastate offerings.
We recognize that conditioning the federal exemption on certain state law exemptions or
requirements could raise concerns that the provisions will be utilized to conduct offerings in
states that lack sufficient investor protection safeguards, leading to a “race-to-the-bottom”
between state legislators and regulators through significant easing of compliance provisions in
order to attract more issuers. We believe, however, that such an outcome may be unlikely
because state legislators and regulators have economic and reputational incentives to provide
local issuers and investors with robust capital markets that are sustainable over the long run.
Robust competition between states to enact securities laws that attract issuers to their territories
would result in better regulations that promote effective functioning of local financial markets
among the states, issuers and investors.
We also considered excluding certain types of issuers from relying on Rule 147 or Rule
147A, since it is likely that intrastate offerings and, especially crowdfunded offerings, may have
a large proportion of retail investors. 467 Further, we also considered whether to extend bad actor
disqualification provisions to these rules, similar to the provisions under Rule 506(d) of

467

See NASAA Letter.

148

Regulation D. 468 Such provisions could enhance investor protections and promote regulatory
consistency with other unregistered offering exemptions. However, these provisions are already
a feature of most state crowdfunding exemptions, and additional restrictions at the federal level
could reduce states’ flexibility in enacting provisions that work best for their local jurisdictions.
In this regard, we believe that states are well positioned to determine whether these or additional
requirements are necessary in their jurisdictions.
(c)

Exemption from Section 12(g) Requirements

Amended Rule 147 and new Rule 147A do not exempt securities issued in intrastate
crowdfunding from reporting requirements under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. 469 As
crowdfunded offerings are purchased in small amounts by a relatively large number of investors,
issuers using Rule 147 or Rule 147A for state crowdfunding offerings may exceed record holder
thresholds that trigger registration requirements under Section 12(g). In contrast to intrastate
crowdfunding offerings, securities issued under Regulation Crowdfunding do not count toward
the record holder thresholds for triggering registration under Section 12(g), subject to certain
conditions. This may place an additional regulatory burden on Rule 147 and Rule 147A issuers,
making them less likely to initiate intrastate crowdfunding offerings. As an alternative to the
final rules, an exemption from the registration requirements under Section 12(g) for intrastate
crowdfunded offerings could encourage issuers to rely on Rule 147 or Rule 147A by allowing
such issuers to delay registration, and thereby avoid the regulatory obligations of ongoing
reporting requirements under the Exchange Act. 470 However, as Rule 147 and Rule 147A issuers

468

Recommendations.

149

will not be required to submit financial reports on an ongoing basis, such a provision may result
in less information about these issuers being available to the market to the possible detriment of
existing and prospective investors. Such concerns are mitigated under Regulation Crowdfunding
as issuers relying on that exemption are required to file ongoing financial reports with the
Commission. Under Rule 147 and Rule 147A, however, issuers will not be subject to any
federal ongoing reporting requirements, which could make the additional protections provided by
registration under Section 12(g) especially beneficial to the issuers’ investors.
3. Analysis of Amendments to Rule 504
The final rules related to Rule 504 will increase the maximum aggregate amount that can
be raised under a Rule 504 offering, in a 12-month period, from $1 million to $5 million and will
disqualify certain bad actors from participation in Rule 504 offerings. Additionally, in order to
account for the increase in the Rule 504 aggregate offering amount limitation, we are adopting
technical amendments to the notes to Rule 504(b)(2) that will update the current illustrations in
the rule regarding how the aggregate offering limitation is calculated in the event that an issuer
sells securities in multiple offerings pursuant to Rule 504, within the same twelve-month
period. 471 All other provisions of current Rule 504 of Regulation D will remain unchanged.
a.

Increase in Maximum Aggregate Amount to $5 million

As shown in the baseline analysis above, use of Rule 504 offerings has been declining
over the past decade, in absolute terms as well as relative to Rule 506 of Regulation D.
Compared to Rule 504 offerings, Rule 506 offerings have the advantage of preemption from
state registration. Thus, even though Rule 506(b) offerings, unlike Rule 504 offerings, are
limited to accredited investors and up to 35 non-accredited investors, capital raising activity
471

See Notes 1 and 2 to Rule 504(b)(2), 17 CFR 230.504(b)(2).

150

during the last two decades suggests that the benefits of state preemption outweigh unrestricted
access to non-accredited investors. With the adoption of Rule 506(c), which allows for general
solicitation, the comparative advantage of current Rule 504 has further diminished.
The current $1 million maximum amount was set by the Commission in 1988 and was
meant to provide “seed capital” for small and emerging businesses. 472 Given the high costs of
raising capital from public sources, the unregistered offerings market has expanded significantly
in the past twenty-five years. The growth of angel investors and VCs, who invest primarily
through unregistered offerings, has also increased seed capital available for investment at the
initial stages of a company. Angel investments in 2015 amounted to approximately $25 billion,
and the average angel deal size was approximately $346,000. 473 According to PWC MoneyTree,
in 2008, U.S. VCs made $1.5 billion of seed investments in 440 companies. 474 This represents
an average seed investment of $3.5 million per company. While the involvement of VCs at the
seed stage has been increasing over the years, it is reported that some angel investments at the
seed stage have included investments as large as $2.5 million per entity. 475 Given these changes,
amending the Rule 504 offering size from $1 million to $5 million would better comport with
market trends that indicate demand for larger seed capital infusions.

472

See Seed Capital Release.

473

According to a recent report, angel investments amounted to $24.6 billion in 2015, with approximately
71,100 entrepreneurial ventures receiving angel funding and approximately 304,930 active angel investors.
Seed/startup stage investments accounted for approximately 28% of the $24.6 billion. See Jeffrey Sohl, The
Angel Investor Market in 2015: A Buyer’s Market, Center for Venture Research, May 25, 2015, available

151

Four parallel developments may further change the regulatory landscape surrounding
existing Rule 504. First, the use of current Rule 504 could be diminished by interstate
crowdfunding offerings pursuant to Regulation Crowdfunding, which allows issuers to raise up
to $1 million over a 12-month period with unlimited access to non-accredited investors, permits
general solicitation, and provides preemption from state regulation and exemption from
Exchange Act reporting, subject to certain conditions. Second, at least 34 states and the District
of Columbia have enacted and several other states are in the process of enacting their own
crowdfunding exemptions where the maximum amount that can be raised in a 12-month period
ranges from $250,000 to $4 million, depending on the state (up to $2 million for all but three
states). The maximum offering amounts for intrastate crowdfunding thus exceed the current
offer limit under Rule 504. While most state crowdfunding exemptions require use of Rule 147,
currently three states allow issuers to conduct intrastate crowdfunding under the Rule 504
exemption. 476 Third, state regulators have been working to implement regional coordinated
review programs in order to facilitate regional offerings that could potentially save issuers time
and money. Additionally, at least one state is in the process of enacting reciprocal crowdfunding
provisions, which may allow issuers to conduct regional crowdfunding offerings under state
law. 477 Since amended Rule 147 and new Rule 147A will be restricted to intrastate offerings,
Rule 504 will be the most likely federal exemption that could be used for such regional offerings.

financing as the first round of financing by a company in which the company raises between $250,000 and
$2,500,000 and in which professional investors play a lead role.
476

Maine’s provisions currently permit interstate crowdfunding utilizing the Rule 504 exemption, and
Mississippi and Vermont dually offer intrastate crowdfunding under Section 3(a)(11) and interstate
crowdfunding under Rule 504. See NASAA Letter.

477

See http://www.nasaa.org/industry-resources/corporation-finance/coordinated-review/. See also, the
“Reciprocal Crowdfunding Exemption” proposed by the Massachusetts Securities Division, available at
http://www.sec.state.ma.us/sct/crowdfundingreg/Reciprocal%20Crowdfunding%20Exemption%20%20MA.PDF.

152

Fourth, Tier 1 of amended Regulation A, which became effective in June 2015 and has similar
eligibility criteria as Rule 504, allows offerings up to $20 million without any restrictions on
resale of securities. In light of these developments, the increase in the maximum amount that can
be raised in Rule 504 offerings to $5 million could help make this market more attractive for
startups and small businesses while also facilitating intrastate and regional offerings greater than
$1 million.
A higher offering amount limit for Rule 504 offerings could increase the number of
issuers that rely on the exemption. 478 To the extent that amended Rule 504 permits issuers to
raise larger amounts of capital at lower costs than other unregistered capital markets, the final
rules could also lower issuer cost of capital and facilitate intrastate crowdfunding and the
regional offerings market as it evolves. In addition to new issuers raising capital for the first
time, it is likely that some issuers currently using other unregistered capital markets may shift to
the amended Rule 504 market. Such potential trends would increase competition for supply of
and demand for capital between the different unregistered markets, especially the exemptions
pursuant to amended Rule 147, Rule 147A, Rule 506 of Regulation D, Regulation A, Regulation
Crowdfunding, and Sections 4(a)(2) and 3(a)(11). Further, modernizing our exemptive scheme
in order to provide issuers, and especially small businesses, with more viable options for capital
raising could foster an environment that encourages new market participants with promising
ventures to enter the capital markets, thereby enhancing the overall level of capital formation in
the economy and investment opportunities. The amendments could also encourage new

478

See CFA Letter, CFIRA Letter, NASAA Letter.

153

interstate and regional approaches to crowdfunding and other offering methods 479 and lead to
greater coordination for regional review of capital raising options.
Increasing the Rule 504 offering amount limit could also increase the number of investors
(including non-accredited investors) that can access such exempt offerings, thereby providing
them with a wider array of investment opportunities to diversify their investment portfolios.
This, in turn, could have positive effects on the supply of capital and the allocative efficiency of
unregistered capital markets. To the extent that non-accredited investors are less capable of
evaluating investment opportunities than accredited investors, 480 an increase in the number of
Rule 504 offerings could raise investor protection concerns.
A higher offering amount limit, together with a potential increase in the number of
investors that can access Rule 504 offerings, may raise concerns about a potential increase in the
incidence of fraud under the final rules. The Commission’s experience with the elimination of
the prohibition against general solicitation for Rule 504 offerings in 1992 481 and its subsequent
reinstatement in 1999 as a result of heightened fraudulent activity482 illustrates the potential for
fraud in the Rule 504 market. It should be noted, however, that in 1998 and 1999 the
Commission concluded that the increase in fraud occurred because of rule provisions that
permitted general solicitation of investors and free transferability of issued securities. 483 As a

Id. See also Proposed Revision of Rule 504 of Regulation D, the “Seed Capital” Exemption, No. 33-7541
(May 21, 1998). As the Commission noted at the time it proposed to eliminate the unrestricted status of
securities issued under Rule 504, securities issued in these Rule 504 offerings may have facilitated a
number of fraudulent secondary transactions in the over-the-counter markets. The Commission also noted

154

result, under that regime, a non-reporting company was able to sell up to $1 million of
unrestricted securities in a 12-month period and be subject only to the antifraud and civil liability
provisions of the federal securities laws. In contrast, the final rules will only increase the
aggregate offering amount limitation of Rule 504, thereby retaining existing restrictions on
general solicitation and the restricted securities status of most offered securities. State
registration requirements may also mitigate the risk for investor abuse in Rule 504 offerings.
Enforcement cases over the past several years involving Rule 504 offerings could also
raise concerns about the potential for increased incidence of fraud under the final rules. Most of
these cases have involved promoters who engaged in secondary market sales of unrestricted
securities that were previously issued in reliance on Rule 504(b)(1)(iii), defrauding investors and,
in some cases, unsophisticated issuers. 484 Securities issued in reliance on Rule 504(b)(1)(iii) are
exempt from state registration, and issuers relying on the exemption are permitted to market the
securities using general solicitation so long as sales are made only to accredited investors. 485 We
recognize that an increase in the maximum offering size could increase the risk of investor harm,
at least in offerings that are exempt from state registration. Some of these concerns could be

that these securities were issued by “microcap” companies, characterized by thin capitalization, low share
prices and little or no analyst coverage. As the freely-tradable nature of the securities facilitated the
fraudulent secondary transactions, the Commission proposed to “implement the same resale restrictions on
securities issued in a Rule 504 transaction as apply to transactions under the other Regulation D
exemptions,” in addition to reinstating the prohibition against general solicitation. Although the
Commission recognized that resale restrictions would have “some impact upon small businesses trying to
raise ‘seed capital’ in bona fide transactions,” it believed at the time that such restrictions were necessary so
that “unscrupulous stock promoters will be less likely to use Rule 504 as the source of the freely tradable
securities they need to facilitate their fraudulent activities in the secondary markets.”
484

See, e.g., SEC v. Stephen Czarnik, Case No. 10-cv-745 (S.D.N.Y.), Litigation Release No. 21401 (Feb. 2,
2010); SEC v. Yossef Kahlon, a/k/a Jossef Kahlon and TJ Management Group, LLC, Case No. 4:12-cv-517
(E. D. Tex.) (Aug. 14, 2012).

485

The extent to which general solicitation may be used in connection with an offering conducted in reliance
on Rule 504(b)(1)(iii) will depend on the specific state exemption being relied upon. In this regard, the
NASAA Model Accredited Investor Exemption specifies that only a tombstone ad may be used in making a

155

mitigated by the inclusion of bad actor disqualification provisions in Rule 504, as discussed
below.
b.
Bad Actor Disqualification Provisions and Additional
Amendments
The amendments to Rule 504 will include bad actor disqualification provisions that are
substantially similar to related provisions in Rule 506 of Regulation D. 486 Consistent with
Rule 506(d), the final rules will require that the covered person’s status be assessed at the time of
the sale of securities. As in Rule 506(d), the disqualification provisions will not preclude the
participation of bad actors whose disqualifying events occurred prior to the effective date of the
final rules, which could expose investors to risks that arise when bad actors are associated with
an offering. However, similar to Rule 506(e), issuers will be required to disclose bad actor
disqualifying events that occurred prior to the effectiveness of the final rules. The risks to
investors from participation of covered persons who otherwise would be disqualified may
therefore be partly mitigated as investors will have access to relevant information that could
inform their investment decisions. Disclosure of prior bad actor disqualifying events may make
it more difficult for issuers to attract investors, and as a result, issuers may experience a similar
impact to being disqualified. Some Rule 504 issuers may accordingly choose to exclude
involvement by prior bad actors to avoid such disclosures.
We expect that the bad actor disqualification provisions could help reduce the potential
for fraud in these types of offerings and thus strengthen investor protection. 487 If disqualification

standards lower the risk premium associated with the risk of fraud due to the presence of bad
actors in securities offerings, they could also reduce the cost of capital for issuers that rely on the
amended Rule 504 exemption. In addition, the requirement that issuers determine whether any
covered persons are subject to disqualification might reduce the need for investors to conduct
their own due diligence on such persons and could therefore increase efficiency. While fraud
can still occur without prior incidence of disqualification on the part of the issuer or covered
persons, these provisions could mitigate some of the concerns relating to incidence of fraud in
offerings pursuant to amended Rule 504, including offerings subject to regional coordinated
review programs that could be registered in one jurisdiction but offered and sold in multiple
other jurisdictions.
The disqualification provisions could also impose costs on issuers and covered persons.
Issuers that are disqualified from using amended Rule 504 may experience an increased cost of
capital or a reduced availability of capital, which could have negative effects on capital
formation. Similarly, other covered persons may experience reductions in revenue or market
share (for market intermediaries) or demotion or termination of employment or other limitations
on career advancement (for individuals) as a result of disqualification from Rule 504 offerings.
In addition, issuers may incur costs and transactional delays related to seeking disqualification
waivers from the Commission and replacing personnel or avoiding the participation of covered
persons who are subject to disqualifying events. Issuers also might incur costs to restructure
their share ownership to avoid beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the issuer's outstanding
voting equity securities by individuals subject to disqualification.
The final rules will provide, by reference to Rule 506(d), a reasonable care exception,
similar to other exemptions and safe harbors under Regulation D. A reasonable care exception

157

could facilitate capital formation by encouraging issuers to proceed with Rule 504 offerings in
situations in which issuers otherwise might have been deterred from relying on Rule 504 if they
risked potential liability under Section 5 of the Securities Act for unknown disqualifying events.
At the same time, this exception also could increase the potential for fraud, compared with an
alternative of not providing a reasonable care exception, by limiting issuers’ incentives to
determine whether bad actors are involved with their offerings. We also recognize that some
issuers might incur costs associated with conducting and documenting their factual inquiry into
possible disqualifications. The rule’s flexibility with respect to the nature and extent of the
factual inquiry required could allow an issuer to tailor its factual inquiry as appropriate to its
particular circumstances, thereby potentially limiting costs. Finally, we note that extending the
disqualification provisions to Rule 504 will create a more consistent regulatory regime under
Regulation D that will simplify due diligence requirements and thereby benefit issuers and
investors that participate in different types of exempt offerings. 488
The amendment to Rule 504(b)(2) will update the current illustrations of how the
aggregate offering limitation is calculated in the event that an issuer sells securities in multiple
offerings pursuant to Rule 504 within the same twelve-month period. By enabling market
participants to calculate more easily the amounts permitted to be sold, this amendment will
facilitate issuer compliance with the increased aggregate offering limitation.
c.

Alternatives Considered

As an alternative to the final rules, we considered raising the offering limit under Rule
504 to an amount less than $5 million. For example, adjusted for inflation, the $1 million in

488

See NASAA Letter.

158

1988 would equate to approximately $2 million today. 489 Additionally, offering amount limits
under various state crowdfunding provisions generally are set around $2 million for most
jurisdictions, with $4 million being the highest offering limit in one state. Increasing the
maximum Rule 504 offering to an amount less than $5 million could help alleviate concerns
about a decrease in investor protection from unlimited access to non-accredited investors. At the
same time, this alternative could limit the use of Rule 504 as a capital raising option for issuers.
We also considered increasing the maximum offering limit under amended Rule 504 to
an amount greater than $5 million. For example, we could align the maximum offering limit to
that of the Tier 1 offer limit ($20 million) under amended Regulation A. This could allow for
more cost-effective state registration, while also providing a competitive alternative to eligible
issuers in Tier 1 of the Regulation A market. However, unlike the Regulation A market, nonaccredited investors have no investment limits under the Rule 504 provisions. Moreover,
enforcement cases over the past several years have highlighted instances of fraud in Rule
504(b)(1)(iii) offerings. 490 A higher maximum offering amount may thus lead to greater investor
protection concerns.
In light of concerns about potential abuses involving securities issued in reliance on
Rule 504(b)(1)(iii), 491 we considered, as an alternative, to impose resale restrictions on such
securities. This could increase investor protection by helping to ensure that securities initially
sold pursuant to the exemption are only resold by initial purchasers after the passage of a
specified time period. However, these restrictions would reduce the liquidity of Rule

504(b)(1)(iii) securities, which could increase the cost of capital for issuers seeking to raise
capital in reliance on this rule provision. At the same time, increasing investor protection
through resale restrictions could attract somewhat greater investor interest and lower the
expected risk premium, which would mitigate, to some extent, the higher costs arising from less
liquid securities. We note that states are free to enact additional restrictions in such offerings if
they deem them necessary or appropriate.
Additionally, Rule 504 could be amended to include additional mandatory disclosures, or
other requirements, to address investor protection concerns arising from the increase in the
maximum offering size. While such additional requirements could mitigate some of these
concerns, they would also increase the compliance obligations for Rule 504 issuers and may also
overlap with similar requirements under state law in the jurisdiction in which such Rule 504
offering is registered.
4. Analysis of Repeal of Rule 505
The final rules also eliminate the exemption under Rule 505 of Regulation D. Rule 505,
like Rule 504, was created under Section 3(b)(1) of the Securities Act to exempt offerings of up
to $5 million over a 12-month period. As discussed in the baseline analysis, reliance on Rule
505 is much less frequent than even Rule 504 and has declined steadily in the past 15-20 years in
terms of the number of new offerings and the amount of capital raised. 492
We believe that amended Rule 504, by allowing offerings up to $5 million, will likely
further diminish the utility of current Rule 505 for issuers that are currently eligible to use both

492

During the period 2009-2015, there were 1,588 new offerings of less than or equal to $5 million by nonfund issuers that relied on Rule 505 compared to 64,862 such offerings that relied on Rule 506. Including
offerings in which the issuer checked both the Rule 505 and Rule 506 exemptions on the Form D (2,170
new offerings), the proportion of Rule 505 offerings in Regulation D offerings rises from 2% to 5.3%. See
Section V.A.2 and Table 5.

160

exemptions because Rule 504 provides access to an unlimited number of non-accredited
investors and restricted access to general solicitation. 493 Other exemptions from registration may
also provide an alternative to Rule 505 offerings. For example, Rule 506(b) enables issuers to
raise unlimited amounts of capital along with providing preemption from state registration,
although being limited to 35 non-accredited investors who need to be sophisticated, either
individually or through a purchaser representative. Similarly, while Regulation A offerings have
greater disclosure requirements, they may be sold to non-accredited investors and have the added
benefit of unrestricted resales of securities. We recognize that reporting companies that are
potential Rule 505 issuers may find it relatively harder to shift to another type of unregistered
offering as they are excluded from using Rule 504, Regulation A and Regulation Crowdfunding.
Such issuers, however, constitute a small proportion of current Rule 505 issuers and, absent
disqualifying bad actor events, could likely avail themselves of Rule 506. Alternatively, Rule
505 issuers, particularly those that are reporting companies, could also raise capital through a
registered offering if they seek investment from non-accredited investors and investors who
prefer securities issued through registered offerings. In view of recent changes to Form S-1 494
and the availability of shelf registration to eligible reporting issuers, the costs of raising capital
through a registered offering for issuers that are reporting companies, may be comparable to
costs of a Rule 505 offering that solicits non-accredited investors and requires registration under
state regulations. Whether Rule 505 issuers, particularly those that are reporting companies,
switch to an unregistered offering such as a Rule 506 offering or a registered offering will
depend on how these issuers assess the costs of registration relative to benefits such as broader
493

Unlike offerings conducted pursuant to Rule 506, Rule 504 and Rule 505 offerings are subject to state
securities law registration and qualification requirements.

494

See note 435 above.

161

access to non-accredited investors and investors who prefer securities issued through registered
offerings. 495
The impact of the elimination of Rule 505 will depend on whether issuers are able to
access alternate capital markets and raise the desired amount of capital at a comparable cost and
in a timely manner, as they would in the current Rule 505 market. To the extent that issuers are
not able to raise sufficient or any amount of capital in such alternate markets, overall capital
formation in the economy and allocative efficiency of capital markets could decline. We believe
that Rule 505 issuers likely will be able to shift to other exemptions or alternately to follow-on
registered offerings in case of issuers that are reporting companies, at little or no additional cost.
In the short term, the repeal likely will increase competition amongst markets for attracting
potential Rule 505 issuers and investors, but in the long-run, it may decrease the overall level of
competition amongst the various capital markets to attract new issuers and investors.
As discussed above, the impact on efficiency, competition and capital formation of the
repeal of Rule 505 also will depend on investor willingness and ability to purchase in an alternate
unregistered capital market. For example, unsophisticated investors that may be eligible to
purchase in a Rule 505 offering may not be able to purchase in a Rule 506 offering and hence
may find their set of investment opportunities reduced. Further, as Rule 506 offerings are
preempted from state registration, potential Rule 505 investors may be reluctant to purchase in a
Rule 506 offering once Rule 505 is repealed, due to investor protection concerns. Similarly,
Rule 504 offerings are subject to fewer investor disclosure requirements at the federal level,
relative to a Rule 505 offering, that could also raise potential investor protection concerns. The
net impact on the overall level of investor participation could thus depend on the type of offering
495

See discussion in Section V(B)(1) and note 436.

162

that primarily substitutes for the repealed Rule 505 market.
Overall, we believe that the repeal of Rule 505 will not have a significant impact or any
impact on capital formation because issuers will likely be successful at finding commensurate
capital supply in an alternate unregistered capital market. Repeal of Rule 505 will streamline the
existing exemptive framework to provide a clearer and less complex set of rules and regulations
for the issuer to choose among.
As an alternative to the repeal of Rule 505, we considered increasing the maximum
amount that can be raised over a period of 12 months to a higher amount. For example, adjusting
for inflation, $5 million in 1988 would equate to approximately $10 million today. Retention of
Rule 505 with a higher offering limit would allow issuers (in contrast to Rule 506) to access to
up to 35 non-accredited investors without having to ensure that these investors are sophisticated
investors. It would also allow reporting companies (in contrast to Rule 504) to avail themselves
of the exemption for raising capital. However, we believe that in view of the widespread use of
Rule 506 and the decreased use of Rule 505 in capital formation in the Regulation D market, a
higher ceiling is not likely to increase reliance on the exemption.
VI.

PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT

A.

Rules 147(f)(1)(iii) and 147A(f)(1)(iii)
Rule 147 and new Rule 147A contain “collection of information” requirements within the

meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”). 496 Specifically, Rules 147(f)(1)(iii)
and 147A(f)(1)(iii) each contain a provision requiring issuers relying on the rules to “obtain a
written representation from each purchaser as to his or her residence.” There are two titles for
these collection of information requirements. The first title is: “Rule 147(f)(1)(iii) Written
496

44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.

163

Representation as to Purchaser Residency,” a new collection of information. The second title is:
“Rule 147A(f)(1)(iii) Written Representation as to Purchaser Residency,” a new collection of
information. We are requesting comment on these collection of information requirements in this
adopting release, and intend to submit these requirements to the Office of Management and
Budget (“OMB”) for review in accordance with the PRA and its implementing regulations. 497 If
approved, responses to the new collection of information requirement would be mandatory for
issuers seeking to rely upon the rules to conduct exempt intrastate offerings. An agency may not
sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays
a currently valid OMB control number.
In the Proposing Release, we solicited comment on our proposal to eliminate the
requirement in Rule 147(f)(1)(iii) to obtain a written representation as to the purchaser’s
residency. In response to comments received, we have decided not to eliminate the requirement
and are adopting an identical requirement in new Rule 147A(f)(1)(iii) under the Securities
Act. 498
Both Rule 147(f)(1)(iii) and new Rule 147A(f)(1)(iii) will require the issuer to obtain
from the purchaser a written representation as to the purchaser’s residency. The representation is
not required to be presented in any particular format, although it must be in writing.
Representations obtained by the issuer are not required to be kept confidential, and there is no
mandatory retention period. The hours and costs to the issuer and purchaser associated with
preparing, furnishing, obtaining and collecting these written representations constitute paperwork

497

In the Proposing Release, we did not submit a PRA analysis because we proposed to eliminate the written
representation requirement in Rule 147(f)(1)(iii), and our other proposed amendments to Rule 147 did not
contain a “collection of information” requirement within the meaning of the PRA. At this time, we do not
have any comments regarding overall burden estimates for the final rules. This release is requesting such
comments.

164

burdens and costs imposed by these collection of information requirements.
The required written representation by the purchaser as to his or her residence is identical
under both Rule 147(f)(1)(iii) and new Rule 147A(f)(1)(iii). Similarly, both rules define the
residence of the purchaser in the same manner, as follows:
(1) A corporation, partnership, limited liability company, trust or other form of business
organization shall be deemed to be a resident of a state or territory if, at the time of the
offer and sale to it, it has its principal place of business within such state or territory.
Principal place of business is defined as the state or territory in which the officers,
partners or managers of the issuer primarily direct, control and coordinate the activities of
the issuer.
(2) Individuals shall be deemed to be residents of a state or territory if such individuals
have, at the time of the offer and sale to them, their principal residence in the state or
territory.
We expect that the determination of a purchaser’s residence will be easiest for natural
persons. 499 This determination may be more difficult for purchasers who have more than one
place of residence. We also expect this determination to be more difficult for purchasers who are
legal entities, such as corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies and trusts which will
have to undertake a factual inquiry to determine in what state or territory their “principal place of
business” is located.
We anticipate that the requirement for issuers to obtain a written representation from each
purchaser as to his or her residence, as required under Rule 147(f)(1)(iii) and Rule

498

See text accompanying notes 119, 120, and 121 above.

499

See Section II.B.2(c) above.

165

147A(f)(1)(iii), will result in a burden and cost to issuers to meet these requirements in order to
sell securities in an exempt intrastate offering. For purposes of the PRA, for each of Rule 147
and Rule 147A, we estimate that the total annual paperwork burden for all affected issuers
arising from this collection of information requirement will be approximately 175 hours of issuer
(company) personnel time and approximately $70,000 for the services of outside professionals at
an average cost of $400 per hour.
Similarly, we anticipate that the written representation required by purchasers, including
the obligation to determinate the state or territory of their residence, as required under Rule
147(f)(1)(iii) and Rule 147A(f)(1)(iii), will result in a burden incurred by purchasers in order to
purchase securities in an exempt intrastate offering. For purposes of the PRA, for each of Rule
147 and Rule 147A, we estimate that the total annual paperwork burden for all affected
purchasers arising from this collection of information requirements will be approximately 1,750
hours of purchaser time and no cost incurred for the services of outside professionals.
In deriving our estimates, we assume that:
•

Approximately 700 issuers 500 will conduct a Rule 147 and Rule 147A offering
each year, respectively, and each issuer will spend an average of fifteen minutes
to obtain and collect the written representation from each purchaser in the offering
as to his or her state or territory of residence;

•

Each of the approximately 700 issuers will retain outside professional firms to
spend an average of fifteen minutes helping the issuer comply with this

500

We rely upon the number of offerings under Rules 504 and 505 of Regulation D for the year ended
December 31, 2015 as a proxy for the average annual number of offerings under Rule 147 and new Rule
147A. Based on staff analysis of Form D filings, there were 519 new Form D filings reporting reliance on
Rule 504 and 179 new Form D filings reporting reliance on Rule 505 in 2015. See Figure 1 in Section

166

requirement to obtain and collect the written statement of residency from each
purchaser in the offering at an average cost of $400 per hour;
•

Each Rule 147 and Rule 147A offering will have an average of approximately 10
purchasers of securities, resulting in approximately 7,000 purchasers per year for
each exemption; and

•

Each purchaser in a Rule 147 and Rule 147A offering will spend an average of
approximately fifteen minutes preparing a written statement of residency to
provide to the issuer and will incur no cost for the services of outside
professionals to satisfy this requirement.

Since Rule 147 does not require the issuer to file any type of notice form with the
Commission, it is difficult to determine accurately the number of Rule 147 offerings conducted
annually or estimate the annual number of offerings that will be made in reliance on the updated
rule and the new Rule 147A exemption. As a result, we are using the number of offerings made
in reliance on the exemptions in Rules 504 and 505 of Regulation D for the year ended
December 31, 2015 as a proxy to estimate the average annual number of Rule 147 offerings,
given that both Rule 147 and Rules 504 and 505 provide exemptions to Securities Act
registration designed to facilitate smaller issuers raising seed capital. Given that Rule 147A is
very similar to Rule 147, as amended, we are using this same methodology and estimate for the
number of offerings under newly adopted Rule 147A.
It is also difficult to provide any standardized estimates of the burdens and costs involved
for the issuer to obtain and collect these written statements of purchaser residency. We expect,

V.A.1, above. For purposes of these PRA estimates, we estimate that an average of 700 issuers will
conduct a Rule 147 and new Rule 147A offering each year, respectively.

167

however, that the burdens and costs to issuers may be higher or lower depending on the size of
the offering and the number of purchasers acquiring securities in the offering, which may, in
turn, be affected by the state or territory where the offering occurs.
These estimates include the time and cost to the issuer to implement a system to obtain
and collect the written statements of residency by purchasers in their offerings, including the
preparation of written materials, such as subscription agreements or questionnaires to potential
purchasers. These estimates also include the time and cost incurred by an issuer’s in-house and
outside counsel and executive officers of collecting these written statements received from
purchasers in their offerings.
In deriving our estimates, we recognize that these burdens and costs will likely vary
among issuers based on the size of their offerings and the number of purchasers acquiring
securities in their offerings. We believe that some issuers will experience burdens and costs in
excess of these estimated averages and other issuers may experience less than these estimated
average burdens and costs.
Similarly, it is difficult to provide any standardized estimates of the burdens and costs to
purchasers in determining their state or territory of residence and preparing their related written
statements of residency to the issuer. We expect, however, that the burden to purchasers may be
higher or lower depending on whether the purchaser is a natural person or legal entity, and, if a
legal entity, the extent of the entity’s activities in other states or territories. If a legal entity, we
realize there may be a wide range of management structures, involving management teams
potentially residing in multiple states or territories, thereby complicating the determination of the
purchaser’s principal place of business.
These estimates include the time and cost to the purchaser to determine the purchaser’s

168

state or territory of residence and prepare a written statement of residency for the issuer. In the
case of purchasers who are legal entities, these estimates also include the time and cost incurred
by purchasers’ in-house counsel and executive officers to undertake a factual inquiry to
determine the state or territory of the purchaser’s principal place of business.
In deriving our estimates, we recognize that the burdens and costs will likely vary
between natural person and legal entity purchasers. In the case of purchasers who are legal
entities, these burdens and costs will be based on a number of factors, including the location and
structure of their management teams. We believe that some natural person and legal entity
purchasers will experience burdens and costs in excess of our estimated averages, and that others
may experience burdens and costs less than our estimated averages.

B.

Amendments to Rule 504 of Regulation D
The amendments to Rule 504 of Regulation D contain “collection of information”

requirements within the meaning of the PRA. There are two titles for the collection of
information requirements contemplated by the amendments. The first title is: “Form D” (OMB
Control No. 3235-0076), an existing collection of information. 501 The second title is:
“Regulation D Rule 504(b)(3) Felons and Other Bad Actors Disclosure Statement,” (OMB
Control No. 3235-0746), a new collection of information. Although the amendments to Rule
504 do not alter the information requirements set forth in Form D, the amendments are expected

501

Form D was adopted pursuant to Sections 2(a)(15), 3(b), 4(a)(2), 19(a) and 19(c)(3) of the Securities Act,
15 U.S.C. 77b(a)(15), 77c(b), 77d(a)(2), 77s(a) and 77s(c)(3).

170

to increase the number of new Form D filings made pursuant to Regulation D. Additionally, the
mandatory bad actor disclosure provisions that will be required under Rule 504 contain
“collection of information” requirements within the meaning of the PRA. We published a notice
requesting comment on these collection of information requirements in the Proposing Release,
and we submitted the proposed amendments to the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”)
for review and approval in accordance with the PRA and its implementing regulations. 502 While
several commenters provided qualitative comments on the possible costs of the proposed
amendments, we did not receive comments on our PRA analysis and thus are adopting our
estimates substantially as proposed, except as otherwise noted herein.
The information collection requirements related to the filing of Form D with the
Commission are mandatory to the extent that an issuer elects to make an offering of securities in
reliance on the relevant exemption. Responses are not confidential, and there is no mandatory
retention period for the information disclosed. The hours and costs associated with preparing
and filing forms and retaining records constitute reporting and cost burdens imposed by the
collection of information requirements. We applied for an OMB control number for the
proposed new collection of information in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3507(j) and 5 CFR
1320.13, and OMB assigned a control number to the new collection, as specified above.
Responses to the new collection of information will be mandatory for issuers raising capital
under Rule 504 of Regulation D.
Form D (OMB Control No. 3235-0076)
The Form D filing is required for issuers as a notice of sales without registration under
the Securities Act based on a claim of exemption under Regulation D or Section 4(a)(5) of the
502

44 U.S.C. 3507(d); 5 CFR 1320.11.

171

Securities Act. The Form D must include basic information about the issuer, certain related
persons, and the offering. This information is used by the Commission to observe use of the
Regulation D exemptions and safe harbor.
As the amendments are not altering the information requirements of Form D, the
amendments will not affect the paperwork burden of the form, and the burden for responding to
the collection of information in Form D will be the same as before the amendments to Form D.
However, we estimate that the amendments to increase the aggregate amount of securities that
may be offered and sold in any 12-month period in reliance on Rule 504 will increase the
number of Form D filings that are made with the Commission. We do not believe this increase
will be materially offset by a decrease in the number of Form D filings that are made with the
Commission attributable to our repeal of Rule 505 of Regulation D.
The table below shows the current total annual compliance burden, in hours and in costs,
of the collection of information pursuant to Form D. For purposes of the PRA, we estimate that,
over a three-year period, the average burden estimate will be four hours per Form D. Our burden
estimate represents the average burden for all issuers. This burden is reflected as a one hour
burden of preparation on the company and a cost of $1,200 per filing. In deriving these
estimates, we assume that 25% of the burden of preparation is carried by the issuer internally and
that 75% of the burden of preparation is carried by outside professionals retained by the issuer at
an average cost of $400 per hour. The portion of the burden carried by outside professionals is
reflected as a cost, while the portion of the burden carried by the issuer internally is reflected in
hours.

For the year ended 2015, there were 22,854 new Form D filings. The annual number of
new Form D filings rose from 13,764 in 2009 to 22,854 in 2015, an average increase of
approximately 1,515 Form D filings per year, or approximately 9%. Assuming the number of
Form D filings continues to increase by 1,515 filings per year for each of the next three years, the
average number of Form D filings in each of the next three years would be approximately
25,900.
We estimate that the amendments to Rule 504 will result in a much smaller annual
increase in the number of new Form D filings than the average annual increase that has occurred
over the past six years. To estimate how the amendments to Rule 504 will impact the number of
new Form D filings, we used as a reference point the impact of a past rule change on the market
for Regulation D offerings. In 1997, the Commission amended Rule 144(d) under the Securities
Act 504 to reduce the holding period for restricted securities from two years to one year, 505 thereby
increasing the attractiveness of Regulation D offerings to investors and to issuers. Prior to
503

Although the number of responses for Form D is reported as 21,824 in the OMB’s Inventory of Currently
Approved Information Collections, available at
http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain;jsessionid=D37174B5F6F9148DB767D63DF6983A65, we
have prepared a new estimate based on the historical trend of the annual number of new Form D filings.
Based on an average increase of approximately 1,515 new Form D filings per year over the past six years,
we believe that the average number of new Form D filings in each of the next three years will be
approximately 25,884, or 25,900 rounded to the nearest hundredth.

amending Rule 144(d), there were 10,341 Form D filings in 1996, which was followed by a 20%
increase in the number of Form D filings in each of the subsequent three calendar years, reaching
17,830 by 1999. Although it is not possible to predict with any degree of certainty the increase
in the number of Rule 504 offerings following the amendments, we estimate for purposes of the
PRA that there will be a similar 20% increase over the number of new Form D offerings that
relied on either Rule 504 or 505 in 2015 after the amendments become effective. 506 In 2015,
there were 519 new Form D filings reporting reliance on Rule 504 and 179 new Form D filings
reporting reliance on Rule 505. 507 We estimate that there will be approximately 100 new Form
D filings in each of the next three years attributable to the amendments. 508
Based on these increases, we estimate that the total annual compliance burden of the
collection of information requirements for issuers making Form D filings after amending Rule
504 to increase the aggregate offering amount from $1 million to $5 million will be 26,000 hours
of issuer personnel time and $31,200,000 for the services of outside professionals.

506

We include the number of new Form D filings that rely on Rule 505 in these estimates since we are
repealing Rule 505, which has provided an alternative Regulation D exemption available for both nonreporting and reporting issuers under the Exchange Act. Rule 505 has a maximum offering limitation of no
more than $5 million in a twelve month period. We believe that issuers who are non-reporting under the
Exchange Act that have previously relied upon Rule 505 will rely upon Rule 504 upon effectiveness of the
amendments, which will raise the maximum offering limitation under Rule 504 from $1 million to $5
million. Reporting issuers under the Exchange Act, who would have otherwise relied upon Rule 505, will
now have to rely upon Rule 506 of Regulation D, once the repeal of Rule 505 becomes effective, since
Rule 504 is unavailable to reporting issuers.

507

Only 10 of the 179 new Form D filings that reported reliance on Rule 505 in 2015 were filed by reporting
issuers under the Exchange Act. The remaining 169 new Form D filings were filed by non-reporting
issuers.

508

We estimate the number of new Form D filings attributable to the amendments over the next three years, as
follows: 698 new Form D filings in 2015 relying on either Rules 504 or 505, less 10 new Form D filings
made by reporting issuers under Rule 505 in 2015, multiplied by 20%, equals 138. Rounding 138 to the
nearest hundredth provides an estimate of 100 new Form D filings attributable to the amendments.

Regulation D Rule 504(b)(3) Felons and Other Bad Actors Disclosure Statement (OMB Control
No. 3235-0746)
Under the amendments, Rule 504 will disqualify issuers from reliance on Rule 504 if
such issuer would be subject to disqualification under Rule 506(d) of Regulation D. 510
Consistent with the requirements of Rule 506(e), the amendments require the issuer in a
Rule 504 offering to furnish to each purchaser, a reasonable time prior to sale, a written
description of any disqualifying events that occurred before effectiveness of the amendments and
within the time periods described in the list of disqualification events set forth in Rule 506(d)(1)
of Regulation D, 511 for the issuer or any other “covered person” associated with the offering. For
purposes of the mandatory disclosure provision described in the note to Rule 504(b)(3), 512
issuers will be required to ascertain whether any disclosures are required in respect of covered
persons involved in their offerings, prepare any required disclosures and furnish them to
purchasers.

509

The information in this column is not based on the number of responses for Form D of 21,824, as reported
in the OMB’s Inventory of Currently Approved Information Collections, but rather on a new estimate of
the average number of new Form D filings in each of the next three years. We prepared this estimate based
on the historical trend of the annual number of new Form D filings. See text accompanying note 503
above. Based on an average increase of approximately 1,515 new Form D filings per year over the past six
years, we estimate that the number of new Form D filings after the amendment to Rule 504 would be the
average number of new Form D filings we estimate in each of the next three years of 25,900, plus the
additional 100 filings we estimate would be filed as a result of the amendment to Rule 504.

175

The disclosure required to be furnished to investors does not involve submission of a
form filed with the Commission and is not required to be presented in any particular format,
although it must be in writing. The hours and costs associated with preparing and furnishing the
required disclosure to investors in the offering constitute reporting and cost burdens imposed by
the collection of information.
The disclosure or paperwork burden imposed on issuers appears in an instruction to
Rule 504(b)(3) and pertains to events that occurred before effectiveness of the final rules but
which would have triggered disqualification had they occurred after effectiveness. Issuers
relying on Rule 504 will be required to furnish disclosure of any relevant past events that would
have triggered disqualification under Rule 504(b)(3) that relate to the issuer or any other covered
person. If there are any such events, a disclosure statement will be required to be furnished, a
reasonable time before sale, to all purchasers in the offering. The disclosure requirement will
serve to protect purchasers by ensuring that they receive information about any covered persons
that were subject to such disqualifying events.
The disclosure requirement will not apply to triggering events occurring after the
effective date of the amendments, because those events will result in disqualification from
reliance on Rule 504 (absent a waiver or other exception provided in Rule 506(d)), rather than
any disclosure obligation.
The steps that issuers take to comply with the disclosure requirement are expected to
mirror the steps they would take to determine whether they are disqualified from relying on Rule
504. For purposes of estimating burdens and costs, we have assumed that issuers planning or
conducting a Rule 504 offering will undertake a factual inquiry to determine whether they are
512

See Note to Rule 504(b)(3).

176

subject to any disqualification in order to utilize the reasonable care provisions set forth in Rule
506(d)(2)(iv). Disqualification and mandatory disclosure will be triggered by the same types of
events in respect of the same covered persons, with disqualification arising from triggering
events occurring after the adoption and effectiveness of the amendments and mandatory
disclosure applicable to events occurring before that date. Therefore, we expect that the factual
inquiry process for the disclosure statement requirement will impose a limited incremental
burden on issuers.
The burdens and costs may vary depending on the size of the issuer and the
circumstances of the particular Rule 504 offering. We do not anticipate that it will generally be
necessary for any issuer or any compensated solicitor to make inquiry of any covered individual
with respect to ascertaining the existence of events that require disclosure more than once,
because the period to be covered by the inquiry will end with the effective date of the new
disqualification rules. However, issuers may incur additional burden and costs for each Rule 504
offering due to changes in management or intermediaries, other changes to the group of covered
persons or if questions arise about the accuracy of previous responses.
We anticipate that the Regulation D Rule 504(b)(3) Felons and Other Bad Actors
Disclosure Statement will result in an incremental increase in the burdens and costs for issuers
that rely on the Rule 504 exemption. For purposes of the PRA, we estimate the total annual
increase in paperwork burden for all affected Rule 504 issuers to comply with our collection of
information requirements will be approximately 880 hours of company personnel time and
approximately $9,600 for the services of outside professionals. These estimates include the
incremental time and cost of conducting a factual inquiry to determine whether the Rule 504
issuers have any covered persons with past disqualifying events. The estimates also include the

177

cost of preparing a disclosure statement that issuers will be required to furnish to each purchaser
a reasonable time prior to sale.
In deriving our estimates, consistent with those assumptions used in the PRA analysis for
the Rule 506 bad actor disqualification provisions, 513 we assume that:
•

Approximately 800 issuers 514 relying on Rule 504 of Regulation D will spend on
average one additional hour to conduct a factual inquiry to determine whether any
covered persons had a disqualifying event that occurred before the effective date
of the amendments; and

•

On the basis of the factual inquiry, approximately eight issuers (or approximately
1%) will spend ten hours to prepare a disclosure statement describing matters that
would have triggered disqualification under Rule 504(b)(3) of Regulation D had
they occurred on or after the effective date of the amendments; and

•

For purposes of the Rule 504(b)(3) disclosure statement, approximately eight
issuers will retain outside professional firms to spend three hours on disclosure
preparation at an average cost of $400 per hour.

513

See SEC Rel. No. 33-9414 (July 10, 2013).

514

Based on staff analysis of Form D filings, there were 519 new Form D filings reporting reliance on Rule
504 and 179 new Form D filings reporting reliance on Rule 505 in 2015. See Figure 1 in Section V.A.1,
above. Of the 179 new Form D filings reporting reliance on Rule 505 in 2015, 10 new Form D filings were
made by reporting issuers under the Exchange Act and 169 new Form D filings were made by nonreporting issuers under the Exchange Act. For purposes of the PRA estimates, and based on the data
provided for Rule 504 and Rule 505 offerings in 2015, we assume that approximately 800 issuers would
file a Form D indicating reliance on Rule 504 after the effectiveness of the amendments to Rule 504
(calculated as follows: 519 new Rule 504 filings and 169 new Rule 505 filings by non-reporting issuers in
2015, rounded to the nearest hundredth, or 700 new Form D filings, plus 100 additional new Form D filings
attributable to the amendments to Rule 504). This figure includes non-reporting issuers under the
Exchange Act that, before adoption of amendments to Rule 504, would have conducted offerings pursuant
to Rule 505, but that after adoption of the amendments to Rule 504 and repeal of Rule 505 will likely
conduct their offerings pursuant to Rule 504.

178

The increase in burdens and costs associated with conducting a factual inquiry for the
disclosure statement requirement should be minimal given that issuers are likely to conduct
simultaneously a similar factual inquiry for purposes of determining disqualification from
Rule 504.
It is difficult to provide any standardized estimates of the costs involved with the factual
inquiry. There is no central repository that aggregates information from all federal and state
courts and regulators that would be relevant in determining whether a covered person has a
disqualifying event in his or her past. In this regard, we are currently unable to estimate the
burdens and costs for issuers in a verifiable way. We expect, however, that the costs to issuers
may be higher or lower depending on the size of the issuer and the number and roles of covered
persons. We realize there may be a wide range of issuer sizes, management structures, and
offering participants associated with Rule 504 offerings and that different issuers may develop a
variety of different factual inquiry procedures.
Where the issuer or any covered person will be subject to an event covered by
Rule 504(b)(3) that existed before the effective date of these rules, the issuer will be required to
prepare disclosure for each relevant Rule 504 offering. The estimates include the time and the
cost of data gathering systems, the time and cost of preparing and reviewing disclosure by inhouse and outside counsel and executive officers, and the time and cost of delivering or
furnishing documents and retaining records.
Issuers conducting ongoing or continuous offerings may need to update their factual
inquiry and disclosure as necessary to address additional covered persons. The annual
incremental paperwork burden, therefore, depends on an issuer's Rule 504 offering activity and
the changes in covered persons from offering to offering. For example, some issuers may only

179

conduct one Rule 504 offering during a year while other issuers may have multiple, separate
Rule 504 offerings during the course of the same year involving different financial
intermediaries, newly hired executive officers or new 20% shareholders, any of which will result
in a different group of covered persons. In deriving our estimates, we recognize that the burdens
will likely vary among individual companies based on a number of factors, including the size and
complexity of their organizations. We believe that some companies will experience costs in
excess of this estimated average and other companies may experience less than the estimated
average costs.
VII.

FINAL REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT ANALYSIS
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”) 515 requires the Commission, in promulgating

rules under Section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 516 to consider the impact of those
rules on small entities. The Commission has prepared this Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
(“FRFA”) in accordance with Section 604 of the RFA. 517 This FRFA relates to the amendments
to Rules 147 and 504, new Rule 147A and the repeal of Rule 505, all of which rules are under
the Securities Act. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) was prepared in
accordance with the RFA and included in the Proposing Release.
A.

Need for the Rules

The amendments to Rule 147 are designed to modernize the safe harbor, consistent with
the Section 3(a)(11) exemption from registration for intrastate securities offerings. New Rule
147A, which will be similar to amended Rule 147 but will have no restriction on offers and will
allow issuers to be incorporated or organized out-of-state, establishes a new Securities Act

515

5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.

516

5 U.S.C. 553.

180

exemption for intrastate offerings of securities by local companies. Together, the amendments to
Rule 147 and new Rule 147A are designed to facilitate capital formation by making it easier to
engage in exempt intrastate offerings while maintaining appropriate protections for investors
who purchase securities in these offerings.
The amendments to Rule 504 are designed to facilitate capital formation by increasing
the flexibility of state securities regulators to implement regional coordinated review programs
that will facilitate regional offerings. The amendments to Rule 504 will raise the aggregate
amount of securities an issuer may offer and sell in any 12-month period from $1 million to
$5 million and disqualify certain bad actors from participating in Rule 504 offerings. We believe
that raising the aggregate offering limitation and disqualifying certain bad actors will maximize
the flexibility of state securities regulators to implement regional coordinated review programs
and provide for greater consistency across Regulation D. We believe our amendment to Rule
504 to increase its aggregate offering ceiling from $1 million to $5 million will significantly
diminish the utility of Rule 505 of Regulation D, and we are therefore repealing that rule.
B.

Significant Issues Raised by Public Comments

In the Proposing Release, we requested comment on all aspects of the IRFA, including
the number of small entities that would be affected by the proposed amendments, the existence
or nature of the potential impact of the proposals on small entities discussed in the analysis, and
how to quantify the impact of the proposed amendments. We did not receive any comments
specifically addressing the IRFA. We did, however, receive comments from members of the
public on matters that could potentially impact small entities. These comments are discussed at
length by topic in the corresponding subsections of Sections II. and III. above.
517

5 U.S.C. 604.

181

Many commenters recommended making changes to the proposed rules that, in their
view, would make the exemptions a more viable capital raising option for smaller issuers.
Numerous commenters supported 518 the proposal to eliminate the Rule 147 limitation on offers
to in-state residents while continuing to require that all sales be made to in-state residents.
However, many commenters also supported 519 and the 2015 Small Business Forum
recommended 520 retaining Rule 147 as a safe harbor under Section 3(a)(11), while adopting a
substantially similar new exemption pursuant to the Commission’s general exemptive authority
under Section 28 as an alternative to the Section 3(a)(11) exemption for companies that are
conducting an intrastate offering. Many commenters opposed any limits at the federal level on
offering size or investment size, 521 and the 2015 Small Business Forum recommended permitting
the states to set their own limits as appropriate. 522 In addition, several commenters supported 523
and the 2015 Small Business Forum recommended 524 exempting securities issued in reliance
upon Rule 147 from the reporting requirements of Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. Several
commenters also supported interpreting the intrastate broker-dealer exemption under the

Exchange Act to include intermediaries whose activities are limited to facilitating intrastate
offerings using the Internet. 525
Amended Rule 147 and new Rule 147 take into account some of the suggestions by
commenters and the recommendations of the 2015 Small Business Forum on ways to make the
intrastate offering exemptions more useful for small entities. For example, the final rules retain
Rule 147 as a safe harbor under Section 3(a)(11), while adopting a substantially similar new
exemption pursuant to the Commission’s general exemptive authority under Section 28 as an
alternative to the Section 3(a)(11) exemption for companies that are conducting an intrastate
offering. As described above, the final rules will modernize existing Rule 147 and maintain a
consistent approach across the two intrastate offering provisions, where possible. Also, given the
comments received, the recommendations of the 2015 Small Business Forum and the local
intrastate nature of the exemptions, amended Rule 147 and new Rule 147A will not contain any
limits at the federal level on offering size or investment size.
As noted in Section II.C above, however, we are not persuaded that securities issued in
reliance upon Rule 147 or Rule 147A should be exempt from the reporting requirements of
Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. Given the lack of ongoing reporting requirements under
these rules, we believe that the Section 12(g) record holder and asset thresholds continue to
provide an important baseline above which issuers should generally be subject to the disclosure
obligations of the Exchange Act. As the shareholder base and total assets of these issuers grow,
we believe that the additional protections that will be provided by registration under Section
12(g) are necessary and appropriate.

525

NASAA Letter; NextSeed Letter; WBA Letter.

183

Additionally, as noted in Section II.B.2.c above, in response to the request by several
commenters to interpret the intrastate broker-dealer exemption under the Exchange Act to
include intermediaries whose activities are limited to facilitating intrastate offerings using the
Internet, 526 we are providing guidance that a broker-dealer whose business otherwise meets the
requirements of the intrastate broker-dealer exemption should not cease to qualify for the
intrastate broker-dealer exemption solely because it has a website that may be viewed by out-ofstate persons, so long as the broker-dealer takes measures reasonably designed to ensure that its
business remains exclusively intrastate.
A few commenters also recommended changes to Rules 504 and 505 that, in their view,
would make the exemptions a more viable capital raising option for smaller issuers. Two
commenters suggested 527 and the 2015 Small Business Forum recommended 528 that the Rule 504
offering amount limit be increased to $10 million. In addition, one commenter suggested 529 and
the 2015 Small Business Forum recommended 530 that securities sold under Rule 504 be exempt
from the requirements of Section 12(g). For Rule 505, one commenter suggested that the
Commission consider changes to Rule 505 to facilitate very small offerings by early stage
companies, such as a simple debt-only offering exemption for smaller issuers. 531 Another
commenter noted that, if the proposed changes to Rule 504 are adopted, Rule 505 would be
substantially similar to Rule 504, making Rule 505 unnecessary, unless the Commission

increases the aggregate offering amount that may be raised under Rule 505 in any twelve-month
period. 532
As supported by many commenters, the final amendments to Rule 504 will increase the
offering amount limit from $1 million to $5 million. 533 We believe that the $5 million threshold
will facilitate issuers’ ability to raise capital, while remaining within the statutory requirements
of Section 3(b)(1). As noted in Section III.B above, although two commenters and the 2015
Small Business Forum recommended that the Commission increase the Rule 504 offering
amount limit to $10 million, we are not exceeding the maximum offering amount permitted
under Section 3(b)(1). Although, as several commenters noted, we could use our exemptive
authority under Section 28 of the Securities Act to raise the maximum offering amount above $5
million,534 in accord with the suggestion of one of those commenters, 535 we believe it appropriate
to first observe market activity under a new maximum offering amount of $5 million before
raising the Rule 504 offering limit any higher.
As noted in Section III.B above, we are not persuaded that securities issued in reliance
upon Rule 504 should be exempt from the reporting requirements of Section 12(g) of the
Exchange Act. Similar to Rules 147 and 147A, given the lack of ongoing reporting requirements
under Rule 504, we believe that the Section 12(g) record holder and asset thresholds continue to
provide an important baseline above which issuers should generally be subject to the disclosure

532

ABA Letter. This commenter recommended, for example, that the offering amount limit could be raised
from $5 million to $10 million or some larger amount, thereby preserving Rule 505 as a viable alternative
exemption.

185

obligations of the Exchange Act. As the shareholder base and total assets of these companies
grow, we believe that the additional protections that will be provided by registration under
Section 12(g) are necessary and appropriate.
After considering the comments, we are repealing Rule 505. As discussed in Section
III.C, amending Rule 504 to increase the aggregate offering amount limit from $1 million to
$5 million may further reduce the incentives to use Rule 505 by issuers contemplating an exempt
offering. We also believe that, even if we were to raise the Rule 505 aggregate offering amount
limit from $5 million to $10 million, or some higher amount, such a higher limit would not
increase the utility of the Rule 505 exemption as compared to Rule 506 which has no limit, given
the historically diminished utility of Rule 505 as compared to Rule 506. 536 Further, although
Rule 505 provides issuers the ability to sell securities to up to 35 non-accredited investors
without having to make a finding, as in Rule 506(b)(2)(ii), that such persons have the knowledge
and experience in financial matters that they are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the
prospective investment, 537 this provision does not appear to have historically resulted in the Rule
505 exemption being widely utilized. 538 We will continue to evaluate whether we should replace
Rule 505 with a substantially different exemption with new criteria, such as an exemption
limited to a very small aggregate offering amount by early stage companies, or an exemption
limited only to “simple debt securities” with very modest compliance requirements.
In the light of the changes discussed above, we believe that the final rules provide smaller
issuers with an appropriately tailored regulatory regime that takes into account the needs of small
entities to have viable intrastate capital formation options, while maintaining appropriate investor

protections.
C.

Small Entities Subject to the Rules

For purposes of the RFA, under our rules, an issuer, other than an investment company, is
a “small business” or “small organization” if it has total assets of $5 million or less as of the end
of its most recent fiscal year and is engaged or proposing to engage in an offering of securities
which does not exceed $5 million.539 For purposes of the RFA, an investment company is a
small entity if it, together with other investment companies in the same group of related
investment companies, has net assets of $50 million or less as of the end of its most recent fiscal
year. 540
While we lack data on the number and size of Rule 147 offerings or the type of issuers
currently relying on the Rule 147 safe harbor, the nature of the eligibility requirements and other
restrictions of the rule lead us to believe that it is used by U.S. incorporated entities that are
likely small businesses seeking to raise small amounts of capital locally without incurring the
costs of registering with the Commission. Currently, most states that have enacted crowdfunding
provisions require issuers that intend to conduct intrastate crowdfunding offerings to rely upon
Rule 147. Since December 2011, when the first state crowdfunding provision was enacted, 179
state crowdfunding offerings have been reported to be filed with the respective state
regulators. 541 Of these offerings, 166 were reported to be approved or cleared, as of June 20,
2016. 542 We expect that almost all of the entities conducting these offerings were small issuers.

It is difficult to predict the number of small entities that will use amended Rule 147 and
new Rule 147A due to the many variables included in the amendments. Nevertheless, we
believe that the final rules will increase the overall number of offerings relying on the intrastate
exemptions due to the ability to make out-of-state offers under Rule 147A, the expanded number
of issuers that will be eligible to use the intrastate exemptions due to the lack of an in-state
incorporation requirement in Rule 147A and the modernized “doing business” requirements of
Rules 147 and 147A, and other significant changes summarized in Section II above.
The amendments to Rule 504 will affect small issuers that rely on this exemption from
Securities Act registration. All issuers that sell securities in reliance on Regulation D are
required to file a Form D with the Commission reporting the transaction. For the year ended
December 31, 2015, 20,736 issuers made 22,854 new Form D filings, and of these Form D
filings, 493 issuers relied on the Rule 504 exemption. Based on the information reported by
issuers on Form D, we estimate that there were 269 small issuers 543 relying on the Rule 504
exemption in 2015. This number likely underestimates the actual number of small issuers
relying on the Rule 504 exemption, however, because 41% of issuers that are not pooled
investment funds and 38% of issuers that are pooled investment funds declined to report their
amount of revenues or assets on their Form D filed with the Commission.
It is difficult to predict the number of small entities that will use amended Rule 504 due
to the variables included in the amendments. Nevertheless, we believe that the final rules for
Rule 504 will increase the overall number of offerings relying on the exemption due to the

543

Of this number, 265 of these issuers are not pooled investment funds, and 4 are pooled investment funds.
We also note that issuers that are not pooled investment funds disclose only revenues on Form D, and not
total assets. To estimate the number of small issuers, for non-pooled investment funds, we have included
issuers that disclosed up to $5 million in revenues, including those with no revenues, and for pooled

188

increase in the offering amount limit from $1 million to $5 million, as summarized in Section III
above.
The repeal of Rule 505 will affect small issuers that rely on this exemption from
Securities Act registration. For the year ended December 31, 2015, of the 20,736 issuers that
made new Form D filings, 163 issuers relied on the Rule 505 exemption. Based on the
information reported by issuers on Form D, we estimate that there were 112 small issuers 544
relying on the Rule 505 exemption in 2015. This number likely underestimates the actual
number of small issuers relying on the Rule 504 exemption, however, because 25% of issuers
that are not pooled investment funds and 38% of issuers that are pooled investment funds
declined to report their amount of revenues or assets on their Form D filed with the Commission.
D.

Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping and Other Compliance Requirements

Amended Rule 147 and new Rule 147A will not impose any reporting or recordkeeping
requirements, but will require that issuers conducting offerings in reliance on these rules make
certain specific disclosures to each offeree and purchaser in the offering. These disclosures will
be made to each offeree in the manner in which any such offer is communicated and to each
purchaser of a security in writing. Amended Rule 147 and new Rule 147A will also require that
issuers place a specific legend on the certificate or other document evidencing the securities that
are being offered in reliance on the rules.
In order to comply with Rules 147(d) and 147A(d), sales of securities must be made only

investment funds, we have included issuers that disclosed up to $5 million in net asset value, including
those with no asset value.
544

Of this number, 107 are not pooled investment funds, and 5 are pooled investment funds. We also note that
issuers that are not pooled investment funds disclose only revenues on Form D and not total assets. To
estimate the number of small issuers, for non-pooled investment funds, we have included issuers that
disclosed up to $5 million in revenues, including those with no revenues, and for pooled investment funds,

189

to residents of the state or territory in which the issuer has its residence or who the issuer
reasonably believes, at the time of sale, are residents of the state or territory in which the issuer
has its residence. In light of the comments received on the proposal, Rules 147 and 147A will
include a requirement that issuers obtain a written representation from each purchaser as to his or
her residence. 545 This written representation, however, will not be sufficient, by itself, to
establish reasonable belief. In addition to the written representation, an issuer will need to
consider other facts and circumstances.
The amendments to Rule 504 will increase the aggregate offering ceiling from $1 million
to $5 million and disqualify certain bad actors from participating in Rule 504 offerings. Issuers
will need to comply with all the current requirements of Rule 504, including the filing of a
Form D. 546 Also, as is the case under current Rule 504, issuers relying on the rule that wish to
engage in general solicitation and issue freely tradable securities may also be required to register
their offering with at least one state regulator. The amendments to Rule 504 will also impose a
disclosure requirement with respect to bad actor disqualifying events that occurred before the
effective date of the disqualification provisions and that would have triggered disqualification
had they occurred after that date. 547 Such disclosure will be required to be in writing and
furnished to each purchaser a reasonable time prior to sale. There no prescribed format for such
disclosure.
In addition, we assume that issuers will exercise reasonable care to ascertain whether a

we have included issuers that disclosed up to $5 million in net asset value, including those with no asset
value
545

See Rules 147(f)(1)(iii) and 147A(f)(1)(iii).

546

Rule 503 requires an issuer relying on any exemption under Regulation D to file a Form D within 15
calendar days after the first sale of securities in the offering.

547

See Rule 504(b)(3).

190

disqualification exists with respect to any covered person and document their exercise of
reasonable care. The steps undertaken by issuers to exercise reasonable care may vary with the
circumstances. In addition, issuers will have to prepare any necessary disclosure about
preexisting events. We expect that the costs of compliance will vary depending on the size and
nature of the offering but will generally be lower for small entities than for larger ones because
of the relative simplicity of their organizational structures and securities offerings and the
generally smaller numbers of individuals and entities involved.
E.

Agency Action to Minimize Effect on Small Entities

The Regulatory Flexibility Act directs us to consider significant alternatives that would
accomplish the stated objectives of our amendments, while minimizing any significant adverse
impact on small entities. Specifically, we considered the following alternatives: (1) establishing
different compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the resources
available to small entities; (2) clarifying, consolidating or simplifying compliance and reporting
requirements for small entities under the rule; (3) using performance rather than design
standards; and (4) exempting small entities from coverage of all or part of the amendments.
With respect to clarification, consolidation and simplification of the final rules’
compliance and reporting requirements for small entities, amended Rule 147 and new Rule 147A
do not impose any new reporting requirements. To the extent the final rules may be considered
to create a new compliance requirement to have a reasonable belief that a prospective purchaser
is a resident of the state or territory in which the issuer is a resident, including a requirement that
issuers obtain a written representation from each purchaser as to his or her residence (as
currently required in Rule 147), the precise steps necessary to meet the “reasonable belief”
requirement will vary according to the circumstances, and this flexible standard will be

191

applicable to all issuers, regardless of size. Overall, the final rules are designed to streamline and
modernize the rule for all issuers, both large and small.
In connection with amended Rule 147 and new Rule 147A, we do not think it feasible or
appropriate to establish different compliance or reporting requirements or timetables for small
entities. The final rules are designed to facilitate access to capital for both large and small
issuers, but particularly smaller issuers who may satisfy their financing needs by limiting the
sales of their securities only to residents of the state or territory in which the issuers are resident.
The final rules do not contain any reporting standards and the compliance requirements they do
include are minimal and designed with the limited resources of smaller issuers in mind.
Similarly, we do not believe it is necessary to clarify, consolidate or simplify reporting or
compliance requirements for small entities as the final rules contain more streamlined
requirements for all issuers, both large and small. For example, the rules simplify the “doing
business” in-state determination by amending the current requirements in Rule 147 so that an
issuer’s ability to rely on the safe harbor will be based on its ability to satisfy updated and
modernized issuer requirements, while continuing to require issuers to have an in-state presence
sufficient to justify reliance on the Section 3(a)(11) exemption. New Rule 147A includes similar
modernized “doing business” in-state requirements. With respect to using performance rather
than design standards, we note that the final rules establish a “reasonable belief” standard for the
determination of a prospective purchaser’s residency status, which we believe is a performance
standard. Although the final rules will require a written representation from investors, the rules
recognize that reasonable belief can be established in a variety of ways (e.g., through preexisting knowledge of the purchaser, obtaining supporting documentation, or using other
appropriate methods). We believe that the use of a performance standard accommodates

192

different types of offerings and purchasers without imposing overly burdensome methods that
may be ill-suited or unnecessary to a particular offering or purchaser, given the facts and
circumstances.
With respect to exempting small entities from amended Rule 147 and new Rule 147A, we
believe such an approach would increase, rather than decrease, their regulatory burden. The final
rules are designed to facilitate an issuer’s access to capital, regardless of the size of the issuer.
We have endeavored throughout these rules to minimize the regulatory burden on all issuers,
including small entities, while meeting our regulatory objectives.
In connection with our amendments to Rule 504 of Regulation D, we do not think it is
feasible or appropriate to establish different compliance or reporting requirements or timetables
for small entities. Our amendments are intended to facilitate issuers’ access to capital and are
particularly designed for smaller issuers who are not subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and who are offering no more than $5 million of their
securities in any twelve month period. The amendments also exclude felons and other “bad
actors” from involvement in Rule 504 offerings, which we believe could benefit small issuers by
increasing investor protection and trust in such offerings. Increased investor trust could
potentially reduce the cost of capital and create greater opportunities for small businesses to raise
capital.
With respect to clarification, consolidation and simplification of the compliance and
reporting requirements for small entities, the amendments to Rule 504 do not impose any new
reporting requirements. To the extent the amendments may be considered to create a new
compliance requirement to exercise reasonable care to ascertain whether a disqualification exists
with respect to any offering and to furnish a written description of preexisting triggering events,

193

the precise steps necessary to meet that requirement will vary according to the circumstances. In
general, we believe the requirement will more easily be met by small entities than by larger ones
because we believe that their structures and securities offerings would be generally less complex
and involve fewer participants.
With respect to the use of performance or design standards, we note that the “reasonable
care” exception is a performance standard. With respect to exempting small entities from
coverage of these amendments, we believe that such an approach would increase, rather than
decrease, their regulatory burden. Regulation D was designed, in part, to provide exemptive
relief for smaller issuers. Furthermore, exempting small entities from Rule 504’s bad actor
provisions could result in a decrease in investor protection and trust in this small offerings
market, thereby potentially increasing the issuer’s cost of capital. We have endeavored to
minimize the regulatory burden on all issuers, including small entities, while meeting our
regulatory objectives, and have included a “reasonable care” exception and waiver authority for
the Commission to provide additional flexibility with respect to the application of these
amendments.

§ 230.147 is revised to read as follows:

§ 230.147 Intrastate offers and sales.
(a) This rule shall not raise any presumption that the exemption provided by section 3(a)(11)
of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77c(a)(11)) is not available for transactions by an issuer which do not
satisfy all of the provisions of this rule.
(b) Manner of offers and sales. An issuer, or any person acting on behalf of the issuer, shall
be deemed to conduct an offering in compliance with section 3(a)(11) of the Act (15 U.S.C.
77c(a)(11)), where offers and sales are made only to persons resident within the same state or
territory in which the issuer is resident and doing business, within the meaning of section
3(a)(11) of the Act, so long as the issuer complies with the provisions of paragraphs (c), (d), and
(f) through (h) of this section.
(c) Nature of the issuer. The issuer of the securities shall at the time of any offers and sales
be a person resident and doing business within the state or territory in which all of the offers and

(i) It is incorporated or organized, and it has its principal place of business, if a
corporation, limited partnership, trust or other form of business organization that is organized
under state or territorial law. The issuer shall be deemed to have its principal place of business
in a state or territory in which the officers, partners or managers of the issuer primarily direct,
control and coordinate the activities of the issuer;

196

(ii) It has its principal place of business, as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this
section, if a general partnership or other form of business organization that is not organized

(iii) Such person’s principal residence is located, if an individual.
(2) The issuer shall be deemed to be doing business within a state or territory if the issuer
satisfies at least one of the following requirements:
(i) The issuer derived at least 80% of its consolidated gross revenues from the
operation of a business or of real property located in or from the rendering of services within
such state or territory;
(ii) The issuer had at the end of its most recent semi-annual fiscal period prior to an
initial offer of securities in any offering or subsequent offering pursuant to this section, at least
80% of its assets and those of its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis located within such state or
territory;
(iii) The issuer intends to use and uses at least 80% of the net proceeds to the issuer
from sales made pursuant to this section (§ 230.147) in connection with the operation of a
business or of real property, the purchase of real property located in, or the rendering of services
within such state or territory; or
(iv) A majority of the issuer’s employees are based in such state or territory.
Instruction to Paragraph (c)(1): An issuer that has previously conducted an intrastate offering
pursuant to this section (§ 230.147) or Rule 147A (§ 230.147A) may not conduct another
intrastate offering pursuant to this section (§ 230.147) in a different state or territory, until the
expiration of the time period specified in paragraph (e) of this section (§ 230.147(e)) or

197

paragraph (e) of Rule 147A (§ 230.147A(e)), calculated on the basis of the date of the last sale in
such offering.
Instruction to Paragraph (c)(2)(i): Revenues must be calculated based on the issuer’s most
recent fiscal year, if the first offer of securities pursuant to this section is made during the first
six months of the issuer’s current fiscal year, and based on the first six months of the issuer’s
current fiscal year or during the twelve-month fiscal period ending with such six-month period, if
the first offer of securities pursuant to this section is made during the last six months of the
issuer’s current fiscal year.
(d) Residence of offerees and purchasers. Offers and sales of securities pursuant to this
section (§ 230.147) shall be made only to residents of the state or territory in which the issuer is
resident, as determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, or who the issuer reasonably
believes, at the time of the offer and sale, are residents of the state or territory in which the issuer
is resident. For purposes of determining the residence of offerees and purchasers:
(1) A corporation, partnership, limited liability company, trust or other form of business

sale to it, it has its principal place of business, as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section,
within such state or territory.
(2) Individuals shall be deemed to be residents of a state or territory if such individuals
have, at the time of the offer and sale to them, their principal residence in the state or territory.
(3) A corporation, partnership, trust or other form of business organization, which is
organized for the specific purpose of acquiring securities offered pursuant to this section (§
230.147), shall not be a resident of a state or territory unless all of the beneficial owners of such

198

Instruction to Paragraph (d): Obtaining a written representation from purchasers of in-state
residency status will not, without more, be sufficient to establish a reasonable belief that such
purchasers are in-state residents.
Instruction to Paragraph (d)(1): A trust that is not deemed by the law of the state or territory of
its creation to be a separate legal entity is deemed to be a resident of each state or territory in
which its trustee is, or trustees are, resident.
(e) Limitation on resales. For a period of six months from the date of the sale by the issuer
of a security pursuant to this section (§ 230.147), any resale of such security shall be made only
to persons resident within the state or territory in which the issuer was resident, as determined
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, at the time of the sale of the security by the issuer.
Instruction to Paragraph (e): In the case of convertible securities, resales of either the
convertible security, or if it is converted, the underlying security, could be made during the
period described in paragraph (e) only to persons resident within such state or territory. For
purposes of this paragraph (e), a conversion in reliance on section 3(a)(9) of the Act (15 U.S.C.
77c(a)(9)) does not begin a new period.
(f) Precautions against interstate sales. (1) The issuer shall, in connection with any
securities sold by it pursuant to this section:
(i) Place a prominent legend on the certificate or other document evidencing the
security stating that: “Offers and sales of these securities were made under an exemption from
registration and have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933. For a period of six
months from the date of the sale by the issuer of these securities, any resale of these securities (or
the underlying securities in the case of convertible securities) shall be made only to persons

199

resident within the state or territory of [identify the name of the state or territory in which the
issuer was resident at the time of the sale of the securities by the issuer].”;
(ii) Issue stop transfer instructions to the issuer's transfer agent, if any, with respect to
the securities, or, if the issuer transfers its own securities, make a notation in the appropriate
records of the issuer; and
(iii) Obtain a written representation from each purchaser as to his or her residence.
(2) The issuer shall, in connection with the issuance of new certificates for any of the

the time period specified in paragraph (e), take the steps required by paragraphs (f)(1)(i) and (ii)
of this section.
(3) The issuer shall, at the time of any offer or sale by it of a security pursuant to this
section (§ 230.147), prominently disclose to each offeree in the manner in which any such offer
is communicated and to each purchaser of such security in writing a reasonable period of time
before the date of sale, the following: “Sales will be made only to residents of [identify the name
of the state or territory in which the issuer was resident at the time of the sale of the securities by
the issuer]. Offers and sales of these securities are made under an exemption from registration
and have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933. For a period of six months from
the date of the sale by the issuer of the securities, any resale of the securities (or the underlying
securities in the case of convertible securities) shall be made only to persons resident within the
state or territory of [identify the name of the state or territory in which the issuer was resident at
the time of the sale of the securities by the issuer].”
(g) Integration with other offerings. Offers or sales made in reliance on this section will not
be integrated with:

200

(1) Offers or sales of securities made prior to the commencement of offers and sales of
securities pursuant to this section (§ 230.147); or
(2) Offers or sales made after completion of offers and sales of securities pursuant to this
section (§ 230.147) that are:
(i) Registered under the Act, except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section (§
230.147);
(ii) Exempt from registration under Regulation A (§ 230.251 et seq.);
(iii) Exempt from registration under Rule 701 (§ 230.701);

(v) Exempt from registration under Regulation S (§§ 230.901 through 230.905);
(vi) Exempt from registration under section 4(a)(6) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6));
or
(vii) Made more than six months after the completion of an offering conducted
pursuant to this section (§ 230.147).
Instruction to Paragraph (g): If none of the safe harbors applies, whether subsequent offers and
sales of securities will be integrated with any securities offered or sold pursuant to this section (§
230.147) will depend on the particular facts and circumstances.
(h) Offerings limited to qualified institutional buyers and institutional accredited investors.
Where an issuer decides to register an offering under the Act after making offers in reliance on
this section (§ 230.147) limited only to qualified institutional buyers and institutional accredited
investors referenced in section 5(d) of the Act, such offers will not be subject to integration with
any subsequent registered offering. If the issuer makes offers in reliance on this section (§
230.147) to persons other than qualified institutional buyers and institutional accredited investors

201

referenced in section 5(d) of the Act, such offers will not be subject to integration if the issuer
(and any underwriter, broker, dealer, or agent used by the issuer in connection with the proposed
offering) waits at least 30 calendar days between the last such offer made in reliance on this
section (§ 230.147) and the filing of the registration statement with the Commission.

Add § 230.147A to read as follows:

§ 230.147A Intrastate sales exemption.
(a) Scope of the exemption. Offers and sales by or on behalf of an issuer of its securities
made in accordance with this section (§ 230.147A) are exempt from section 5 of the Act (15
U.S.C. 77e). This exemption is not available to an issuer that is an investment company
registered or required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C.
80a-1 et seq.).
(b) Manner of offers and sales. An issuer, or any person acting on behalf of the issuer, may
rely on this exemption to make offers and sales using any form of general solicitation and
general advertising, so long as the issuer complies with the provisions of paragraphs (c), (d), and
(f) through (h) of this section.
(c) Nature of the issuer. The issuer of the securities shall at the time of any offers and sales
be a person resident and doing business within the state or territory in which all of the sales are
made.
(1) The issuer shall be deemed to be a resident of the state or territory in which it has its
principal place of business. The issuer shall be deemed to have its principal place of business in
a state or territory in which the officers, partners or managers of the issuer primarily direct,
control and coordinate the activities of the issuer.

202

(2) The issuer shall be deemed to be doing business within a state or territory if the issuer
satisfies at least one of the following requirements:
(i) The issuer derived at least 80% of its consolidated gross revenues from the
operation of a business or of real property located in or from the rendering of services within
such state or territory;
(ii) The issuer had at the end of its most recent semi-annual fiscal period prior to an
initial offer of securities in any offering or subsequent offering pursuant to this section, at least
80% of its assets and those of its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis located within such state or
territory;
(iii) The issuer intends to use and uses at least 80% of the net proceeds to the issuer
from sales made pursuant to this section (§ 230.147A) in connection with the operation of a
business or of real property, the purchase of real property located in, or the rendering of services
within such state or territory; or
(iv) A majority of the issuer’s employees are based in such state or territory.
Instruction to Paragraph (c): An issuer that has previously conducted an intrastate offering
pursuant to this section (§ 230.147A) or Rule 147 (§ 230.147) may not conduct another intrastate
offering pursuant to this section (§ 230.147A) in a different state or territory, until the expiration
of the time period specified in paragraph (e) of this section (§ 230.147A(e)) or paragraph (e) of
Rule 147 (§ 230.147(e)), calculated on the basis of the date of the last sale in such offering.
Instruction to Paragraph (c)(2)(i): Revenues must be calculated based on the issuer’s most
recent fiscal year, if the first offer of securities pursuant to this section is made during the first
six months of the issuer’s current fiscal year, and based on the first six months of the issuer’s
current fiscal year or during the twelve-month fiscal period ending with such six-month period, if

203

the first offer of securities pursuant to this section is made during the last six months of the
issuer’s current fiscal year.
(d) Residence of purchasers. Sales of securities pursuant to this section (§ 230.147A) shall
be made only to residents of the state or territory in which the issuer is resident, as determined
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, or who the issuer reasonably believes, at the time of
sale, are residents of the state or territory in which the issuer is resident. For purposes of
determining the residence of purchasers:
(1) A corporation, partnership, limited liability company, trust or other form of business
organization shall be deemed to be a resident of a state or territory if, at the time of sale to it, it
has its principal place of business, as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, within such state
or territory.
(2) Individuals shall be deemed to be residents of a state or territory if such individuals
have, at the time of sale to them, their principal residence in the state or territory.
(3) A corporation, partnership, trust or other form of business organization, which is
organized for the specific purpose of acquiring securities offered pursuant to this section (§
230.147A), shall not be a resident of a state or territory unless all of the beneficial owners of
such organization are residents of such state or territory.
Instruction to Paragraph (d): Obtaining a written representation from purchasers of in-state
residency status will not, without more, be sufficient to establish a reasonable belief that such
purchasers are in-state residents.
Instruction to Paragraph (d)(1): A trust that is not deemed by the law of the state or territory of
its creation to be a separate legal entity is deemed to be a resident of each state or territory in
which its trustee is, or trustees are, resident.

204

(e) Limitation on resales. For a period of six months from the date of the sale by the issuer
of a security pursuant to this section (§ 230.147A), any resale of such security shall be made only
to persons resident within the state or territory in which the issuer was resident, as determined
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, at the time of the sale of the security by the issuer.
Instruction to Paragraph (e): In the case of convertible securities, resales of either the
convertible security, or if it is converted, the underlying security, could be made during the
period described in paragraph (e) only to persons resident within such state or territory. For
purposes of this paragraph (e), a conversion in reliance on section 3(a)(9) of the Act (15 U.S.C.
77c(a)(9)) does not begin a new period.
(f) Precautions against interstate sales. (1) The issuer shall, in connection with any
securities sold by it pursuant to this section:
(i) Place a prominent legend on the certificate or other document evidencing the
security stating that: “Offers and sales of these securities were made under an exemption from
registration and have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933. For a period of six
months from the date of the sale by the issuer of these securities, any resale of these securities (or
the underlying securities in the case of convertible securities) shall be made only to persons
resident within the state or territory of [identify the name of the state or territory in which the
issuer was resident at the time of the sale of the securities by the issuer].”;
(ii) Issue stop transfer instructions to the issuer's transfer agent, if any, with respect to
the securities, or, if the issuer transfers its own securities, make a notation in the appropriate
records of the issuer; and
(iii) Obtain a written representation from each purchaser as to his or her residence.

205

(2) The issuer shall, in connection with the issuance of new certificates for any of the
securities that are sold pursuant to this section (§ 230.147A) that are presented for transfer during
the time period specified in paragraph (e), take the steps required by paragraphs (f)(1)(i) and (ii)
of this section.
(3) The issuer shall, at the time of any offer or sale by it of a security pursuant to this
section (§ 230.147A), prominently disclose to each offeree in the manner in which any such offer
is communicated and to each purchaser of such security in writing a reasonable period of time
before the date of sale, the following: “Sales will be made only to residents of the state or
territory of [identify the name of the state or territory in which the issuer was resident at the time
of the sale of the securities by the issuer]. Offers and sales of these securities are made under an
exemption from registration and have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933. For a
period of six months from the date of the sale by the issuer of the securities, any resale of the
securities (or the underlying securities in the case of convertible securities) shall be made only to
persons resident within the state or territory of [identify the name of the state or territory in
which the issuer was resident at the time of the sale of the securities by the issuer].”
(g) Integration with other offerings. Offers or sales made in reliance on this section will not
be integrated with:
(1) Offers or sales of securities made prior to the commencement of offers and sales of
securities pursuant to this section (§ 230.147A); or
(2) Offers or sales of securities made after completion of offers and sales of securities
pursuant to this section (§ 230.147A) that are:
(i) Registered under the Act, except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section (§
230.147A);

206

(ii) Exempt from registration under Regulation A (§ 230.251 et seq.);
(iii) Exempt from registration under Rule 701 (§ 230.701);
(iv) Made pursuant to an employee benefit plan;
(v) Exempt from registration under Regulation S (§§ 230.901 through 230.905);
(vi) Exempt from registration under section 4(a)(6) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6));
or
(vii) Made more than six months after the completion of an offering conducted
pursuant to this section (§ 230.147A).
Instruction to Paragraph (g): If none of the safe harbors applies, whether subsequent offers and
sales of securities will be integrated with any securities offered or sold pursuant to this section (§
230.147A) will depend on the particular facts and circumstances.
(h) Offerings limited to qualified institutional buyers and institutional accredited investors.
Where an issuer decides to register an offering under the Act after making offers in reliance on
this section (§ 230.147A) limited only to qualified institutional buyers and institutional
accredited investors referenced in section 5(d) of the Act, such offers will not be subject to
integration with any subsequent registered offering. If the issuer makes offers in reliance on this
section (§ 230.147A) to persons other than qualified institutional buyers and institutional
accredited investors referenced in section 5(d) of the Act, such offers will not be subject to
integration if the issuer (and any underwriter, broker, dealer, or agent used by the issuer in
connection with the proposed offering) waits at least 30 calendar days between the last such offer
made in reliance on this section (§ 230.147A) and the filing of the registration statement with the
Commission.

is added, to read as follows:

*****
(b) * * *
(2) The aggregate offering price for an offering of securities under this § 230.504, as
defined in § 230.501(c), shall not exceed $5,000,000, less the aggregate offering price for all
securities sold within the twelve months before the start of and during the offering of securities
under this § 230.504, in violation of section 5(a) of the Securities Act.
Instruction to Paragraph (b)(2): If a transaction under § 230.504 fails to meet the limitation on
the aggregate offering price, it does not affect the availability of this §230.504 for the other
transactions considered in applying such limitation. For example, if an issuer sold $5,000,000 of
its securities on January 1, 2014 under this § 230.504 and an additional $500,000 of its securities

208

on July 1, 2014, this § 230.504 would not be available for the later sale, but would still be
applicable to the January 1, 2014 sale.
(3) Disqualifications. No exemption under this section shall be available for the
securities of any issuer if such issuer would be subject to disqualification under § 230.506(d) of
this section on or after [INSERT DAY 60 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE
FEDERAL REGISTER]; provided that disclosure of prior “bad actor” events shall be required in
accordance with § 230.506(e).
Instruction to Paragraph (b)(3): For purposes of disclosure of prior “bad actor” events pursuant
to § 230.506(e), an issuer shall furnish to each purchaser, a reasonable time prior to sale, a
description in writing of any matters that would have triggered disqualification under this
paragraph (b)(3) but occurred before [INSERT DAY 60 DAYS AFTER DATE OF
PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER].
