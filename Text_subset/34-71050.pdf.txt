In the Matter of
GLG PARTNERS, INC. and
GLG PARTNERS, L.P.,

ORDER INSTITUTING CEASE-ANDDESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES
EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASEAND-DESIST ORDER

Respondents.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission” or “SEC”) deems it appropriate
that cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) against GLG Partners, Inc. (“GPI”) and GLG
Partners, L.P. (“GLG”) (collectively, “Respondents”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondents have submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, Respondents consent to the entry of this Order Instituting Ceaseand-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making
Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offer, the Commission finds1 that:
Respondents
1.
GPI is a Delaware corporation with its principal offices in New York, NY. During
the time period relevant to this proceeding, GPI was listed on the NYSE. GPI served as the
holding company for U.K. investment adviser GLG, which was GPI’s then-primary subsidiary, as
well as various GLG affiliates. During this time period, GLG shared senior management with GPI.
GPI’s common stock and warrants to purchase the common stock were securities registered
pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. On October 14, 2010, GPI was acquired by a
U.K.-listed issuer. GPI’s stock and warrants are no longer listed.
2.
GLG is a U.K. investment adviser structured as an English limited partnership, with
its headquarters in London, England. It has operated in the U.S. directly and through affiliates.
GLG is not registered with the Commission but is authorized and regulated by the U.K. Financial
Conduct Authority. GLG is the investment manager for the GLG Emerging Markets Fund (“EM
Fund”) and was the investment manager for the EM Fund’s side-pocket fund, GLG Emerging
Markets (Special Assets) Fund (“EMSA1 Fund”), prior to the EMSA1 Fund’s dissolution. The
EM and EMSA1 Funds were hedge funds, formed as Cayman Islands limited liability companies,
which had U.S. investors. GLG is not currently a subsidiary of GPI but remains its affiliate.
Summary
3.
This matter involves investment adviser GLG’s failure to maintain sufficient
controls relating to the valuation of fund assets. Under GLG’s asset valuation policies, assets
which were not quoted in the market and whose value could not readily be determined through
outside data sources (“Level 3 assets”) were to be priced monthly by an independent pricing
committee (“IPC”). However, GLG had established inadequate controls to ensure information
relevant to Level 3 asset valuations was provided to the IPC, and, on various occasions, GLG
failed to provide material information to the IPC. In addition, GLG had established no mechanism
for ensuring that the IPC had sufficient time to review pricing recommendations, and, in certain
instances, GLG failed to provide the IPC with enough time to review recommendations. GLG also
generally kept no record of the IPC’s basis for monthly decisions to keep Level 3 asset valuations
unchanged, which violated GLG’s Pricing Policy directive that “comprehensive documentation”
be maintained “to ensure the rationale supporting any judgments made is recorded and available
for future reference.”
4.
As a result of these controls failures, GLG overvalued a 25% private equity stake in
an emerging market coal-mining company (“Coal Co.”) from November 2008 through November
The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents’ Offer and are not binding on any other
person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

2010. This Level 3 asset had been purchased in March 2008 by the EM Fund and transferred in
June 2008 to the EMSA1 Fund. The Coal Co. asset was overvalued by roughly $160 million for
25 months, resulting in inflated fee revenue of $7,766,667 for GLG and its parent GPI, then a U.S.listed issuer. The overvaluation of the asset led to misstatements in GPI’s filings with the SEC
relating to the period from 2008 through the second quarter of 2010.
5.
By their actions, GPI violated Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the
Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13, and 12b-20, and GLG was a cause
of these violations.
Background
GLG’s Valuation Policies and Practices
6.
Each GLG fund’s asset valuation policies were set forth in the fund’s prospectus as
well as the Pricing and Valuation Policy for GLG Funds (“Pricing Policy”). The EM Fund
prospectus provided that a Level 3 asset would be valued as determined by the fund’s directors, in
good faith and with care, in consultation with GLG and the fund’s administrator. The summary of
terms for the EMSA1 Fund stated that the EMSA1 Fund was adopting the same valuation
principles described in the EM Fund prospectus. GLG’s use of the term “Level 3” was not
equivalent, and did not purport to be equivalent, to the concept of Level 3 inputs contained in U.S.
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or International Financial Reporting Standards.
7.
The Pricing Policy set forth the “framework and methodology for determination,
validation, approval, regular monitoring and review of pricing across the GLG Funds.” Pursuant to
the Pricing Policy, each fund’s directors delegated the responsibility for approving prices and
pricing mechanisms to GLG’s IPC. Furthermore, the Pricing Policy stated that documents
supporting valuations should be made and kept.
8.
Pursuant to the Pricing Policy, the IPC met on a monthly basis, but GLG or the
fund administrator could call additional meetings “on an ad hoc basis on short notice to approve a
price of an asset, and/or provide additional information.” The IPC did not have a fixed
membership but required a “quorum” of participants from four separate groups for its meetings.
The quorum for an IPC meeting consisted of:
1. any one Director of the relevant fund; 2. a representative of the Fund
Administrator; 3. a representative from senior management of [GLG]; 4. a
representative from the risk management team of [GLG].
Although not expressly stated in the Pricing Policy, only participants falling into the four
categories of quorum members could vote to approve prices, and all votes were required to be
unanimous. A senior member of GLG’s middle-office accounting staff acted as a non-voting
“chair” for the meetings, which were typically held by teleconference.
9.
Under the Pricing Policy, “All assets priced using Level 3 prices should be referred
to the IPC on a monthly basis for ratification and approval by the IPC.”
3

10.
GLG’s middle-office accounting department did not have a systematic, monthly
practice for asking GLG fund managers whether changes to the values of Level 3 assets were
warranted for any assets held in their funds’ portfolios. Instead, the middle-office accounting staff
sporadically collected some changes in Level 3 pricing recommendations and other updates from
the various GLG fund managers, then set the monthly meeting agenda and circulated the available
information to an e-mail list of potential IPC participants in advance of monthly meetings.
11.
Beginning in 2009, an undocumented supplemental practice developed for
conducting “semi-annual private-equity reviews” in January and July, at which all of the GLG
funds’ Level 3 assets were reviewed by the IPC. Commentaries and documentation relevant to
each position’s mark were prepared by the GLG fund teams, collected by middle-office accounting
staff, and then distributed by middle-office accounting staff to the potential IPC participants in
advance of these semi-annual meetings. The lack of an established practice for monthly reviews
created confusion within GLG as to whether relevant information and changes in pricing
recommendations should be transmitted to the IPC on an ongoing, monthly basis or whether
transmittal could be delayed until the next semi-annual review.
Purchase and Initial Marking of Coal Co. Stake
12.
In December 2007, GLG agreed to buy a 25% stake in Coal Co. for $210 million.
It was the EM Fund’s objective to sell the stake in a potential near-term IPO. The EM Fund
closed the Coal Co. purchase on March 20, 2008. On March 31, 2008, the IPC approved an initial
valuation or “mark” of $425 million for the position. GLG based its recommendation for the $425million mark on an internal valuation report prepared by an EM Fund analyst. This internal report
employed a discounted-cash-flow (“DCF”) analysis as well as a review of comparable public
equities. The report took note of a large increase in coking coal prices that had occurred in late
2007 and early 2008 as the primary justification for the mark-up over the EM Fund’s purchase
price. Furthermore, the report projected that Coal Co. would be able to quadruple its coal
production over the next four or five years, pursuant to its management’s aggressive expansion
plans. Three months later, the Coal Co. position was transferred to the EMSA1 Fund.
13.
The manager of the EM and EMSA1 Funds resigned from GLG on October 31,
2008, along with the analyst who had prepared GLG’s internal valuation report on Coal Co. and
who was responsible for ongoing updates of GLG’s DCF model for the position. Until June 2011,
the Coal Co. stake remained in the EMSA1 Fund, which did not accept additional investment
during that period.
GLG’s Policies and Procedures Failed to Ensure Timely Transmittal of
Relevant Information to IPC, Resulting in Overvaluation of Coal Co. Position
14.
On a number of occasions between November 2008 and December 2010, GLG
employees received information calling into question the $425-million valuation for the Coal Co.
position, but there were inadequate policies and procedures to ensure that relevant information
such as this was timely provided to the IPC or that recommendations to lower the mark were
4

forwarded to the IPC expediently. Additionally, there was confusion among GLG’s fund
managers, middle-office accounting personnel, and senior management as to whose role it was to
determine that valuation issues should be elevated to the IPC.
15.
GLG also failed to implement policies and procedures to ensure that the IPC
participants were provided with sufficient time to thoroughly review pricing recommendations and
supporting documentation forwarded to the IPC. This failure occurred despite prior guidance from
the GLG funds’ independent auditor, in early 2008, that the IPC should be given adequate time
before making determinations in order to make sure that sufficient rigor was exercised with respect
to valuations. As a result of these failures, the Coal Co. position remained overvalued during the
entire period from November 1, 2008 through November 30, 2010.
2008 – 2009
16.
By the time that the Coal Co. mark for the month of November 2008 was ratified
by the IPC, several of the key bases for the initial mark of $425 million no longer held true. Coal
Co. and GLG were no longer pursuing an IPO in the near to mid-term, there had been a significant
decline in emerging equity markets and in the stock prices of comparable coal miners, and coking
coal prices had begun a steep decline. GLG failed to provide current information on these factors
to the IPC at that time. Additionally, GLG failed to inform the IPC that Coal Co. had experienced
significant shortfalls in its projected output, GLG’s prior DCF model for Coal Co. was no longer
being updated, and internal doubts had arisen among GLG’s analysts regarding the continued
validity of the Coal Co. mark. During this same time period, GLG and GPI employees with
responsibility for the EMSA1 Fund discussed in e-mails their intention to obtain a third-party
valuation of Coal Co. and to reexamine the position’s mark on the basis of the third-party
valuation. However, there was no established procedure for obtaining third-party valuations and
the third-party valuation was not obtained until January 2010.
17.
During the first half of 2009, GLG’s policies and procedures failed to ensure
transmittal of additional relevant, valuation-related information to the IPC. For example, the IPC
was not informed of a continued drop in Coal Co.’s output and in the price of coking coal.
Moreover, the IPC was not informed that GLG’s analysts were reaching lower valuations for the
Coal Co. position. During the second half of 2009, the IPC received no updates on the Coal Co.
position prior to the year-end semi-annual private-equity review.
First Half of 2010
18.
GLG obtained a third-party valuation of Coal Co. in January 2010. The EM Fund
co-manager’s primary objective in obtaining the third-party valuation report was to assist in GLG’s
private-market attempts to sell the EMSA1 Fund’s stake in Coal Co. rather than as a pricing
document to be submitted to the IPC. He obtained a brief, free valuation report from one of EM
Fund’s brokers, as a client accommodation. When he later forwarded the report to the middleoffice accounting staff, the middle-office accounting staff, who lacked expertise in valuing assets,
assumed that the report was sufficient for the IPC to base pricing decisions upon. In actuality, the
report was based on limited sources of information, and the third-party firm had made no attempt
5

to contact Coal Co. directly in order to obtain or verify information contained in the report.
Nevertheless, the third-party report reflected a valuation for the EMSA1 Fund’s Coal Co. stake of
$350 million, which was $75 million less than the EMSA1 Fund’s $425-million mark.
19.
After receiving the report from the fund manager, GLG’s middle-office accounting
staff failed to forward it to the list of potential IPC participants until after business hours on the
night before the January 2010 semi-annual private-equity review meeting. The report was
provided to the participants as part of an extensive production of data and recommendations for all
37 private-equity positions held by GLG firm-wide. GLG thus did not provide sufficient time for
the IPC participants to review the report in depth prior to the IPC meeting, which was held at 12:30
PM. The IPC approved maintaining the existing mark of $425 million based on a $200 million
range of values that only appeared on the report’s cover page rather than the actual valuation of
$350 million set forth in the body of the report. Despite guidance from its funds’ auditor in early
2008 that the IPC would benefit from technical assistance when considering valuations, GLG did
not obtain such assistance for the IPC in evaluating the third-party report on Coal Co. or at any
point during the relevant period.
Second Half of 2010 – January 2011
20.
In mid-June 2010, GLG concluded that its efforts to find a private-market buyer for
the Coal Co. position had failed and that a near-term IPO was still unlikely. In order to present the
EMSA1 Fund investors with an alternative exit opportunity, GLG decided to hire a global financial
services firm to conduct an auction of the EMSA1 Fund shares, the value of which, by that time,
was almost entirely in the Coal Co. stake. The high bidder in the auction would be permitted to
make a tender offer to many of the EMSA1 Fund shareholders2 and, in June 2011, this bidder and
all non-tendering shareholders would automatically be subscribed into a successor special-assets
fund. The auction plan included preparation and issuance of a detailed Coal Co. valuation report
by the financial services firm.
21.
Although the EM Fund co-manager received the financial services firm’s draft
report and final valuation figures in September 2010, GLG lacked policies and procedures to
ensure that the conclusions of the financial services firm were timely forwarded to and considered
by the IPC. The draft report provided a preliminary valuation range of $221-259 million and a
stated midpoint of $240 million. The final report provided a final valuation range of $246-284
million and a stated midpoint of $265 million, which was $160 million less than GLG’s $425
million mark. However, a recommendation to lower the Coal Co. mark to the financial services
firm’s final valuation of $265 million was not presented to the IPC in connection with the IPC’s
monthly meetings for September, October or November 2010. Instead, the recommendation was
put forward in January 2011 in connection with the IPC’s semi-annual private equity review, to be
effective December 1, 2010. At that time, however, the financial services firm’s report was not
shared with the IPC, based on confidentiality concerns associated with the auction process. In
“U.S. persons,” as well as Canadian, Australian, Japanese, and South African shareholders, among
others, were to be excluded from the offer.
2

6

addition, the IPC was not provided with any valuation recommendation for the Coal Co. position
or other related materials in advance of the January 2011 meeting.
Failure to Document IPC’s Basis for Monthly Decisions
to Keep Level 3 Asset Valuations Unchanged
22.
The Pricing Policy directed that Level 3 prices be “ratifi[ed] and approv[ed]”
monthly and that “comprehensive documentation” be maintained “to ensure the rationale
supporting any judgments made is recorded and available for future reference.” However, for 21
of 25 months from November 2008 through November 2010, GLG failed to document the basis for
the IPC’s monthly ratification and approval of the EMSA1 Fund’s $425-million Coal Co. mark.
Inflated Fee Revenue to GLG and GPI
23.
The EMSA1 Fund’s summary of terms provided that the EMSA1 Fund would
charge a 2% annual management fee and a 0.5% annual administration fee – identical to fee
percentages charged by the EM Fund. Both the management fee and the administration fee were
calculated on the basis of the EMSA1 Fund’s monthly net asset value (“NAV”). Contractually, the
EMSA1 Fund remitted the 2% management fee to GLG and remitted 2/3 of the 0.5%
administration fee, i.e., 0.33%, to a GPI subsidiary. Accordingly, a total of 2.33% in annual fees
was remitted to GPI, calculated on the full amount of the Coal Co. position’s valuation, which was
by far the largest component of the EMSA1 Fund’s NAV.
24.
As a result of GLG’s deficient valuation policies and procedures, the monthly
valuation for the EMSA1 Fund’s Coal Co. position was overstated by approximately $160 million
during the period from November 1, 2008 through November 30, 2010. This led to inflated or
excess management and administration fees remitted to GLG and/or GPI totaling approximately
$7,766,667.
Misstatements in GPI’s Filings
25.
GPI’s SEC filings contained a number of misstatements related to AUM which
resulted from the $160-million overvaluation of the Coal Co. position from November 2008
through November 2010. AUM was a key metric for GPI because the issuer’s revenues were
largely a function of various types of fee revenues calculated as percentages of AUM.
Information regarding AUM was thus necessary to an understanding of the results of GPI’s
operations. Beginning in the second quarter of 2009, GPI’s filings frequently highlighted GLG’s
“long-short fund” and “alternative strategy” AUM, which included the EMSA1 Fund’s AUM, as
preferential to its “long-only fund” AUM because the former categories typically had a higher
fee structure. Some of GPI’s misstatements were made in quarterly or annual reports, while
others appeared in press releases and/or investor presentations filed as exhibits to Forms 8-K.
26.
In all, at least 14 of GPI’s filings, filed with the Commission from March 2009
through August 2010, contained the following types of misstatements: (1) overstatements of
AUM of the EMSA1 Fund; (2) overstatements of combined AUM of GLG special assets funds;
7

and (3) overstatements of AUM of GLG “mixed asset” long-short funds as a percentage of
alternative-strategy AUM. These overstatements ranged in magnitude from 8.9% to 36.4%. For
example, GLG’s $160 million overvaluation of the EMSA1 Fund’s Coal Co. position resulted in
GPI’s overstatement of the EMSA1 Fund’s AUM by about 33.3% in its 2008 annual report and
by 36.4% in its 2009 annual report. In addition, the combined AUM of GLG special assets funds
was overstated by between 14% and 18% from the fourth quarter of 2008 through the second
quarter of 2010.
Violations of the Exchange Act
27.
Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act requires public companies to devise and
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain accountability for assets. Section
13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires public companies to make and keep books, records and
accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the company’s transactions and
dispositions of its assets. No showing of scienter is required to establish a violation of Sections
13(b)(2)(A) and (B). SEC v. World-Wide Coin Investments, Ltd., 567 F.Supp. 724, 751 (N.D. Ga.
1983).
28.
As set forth above, GPI and its wholly-owned subsidiary, GLG, failed to design and
maintain adequate internal controls related to the valuation of fund assets, on the basis of which fee
revenues were calculated and recorded. GLG had inadequate policies and procedures to ensure
that information relevant to valuations was provided to the IPC when it became available, and, in
various instances, GLG failed to provide necessary information to the IPC due to confusion within
GLG regarding whose role it was to elevate such information to the IPC. GLG had no policies or
procedures to ensure that the IPC had sufficient time to review valuation recommendations, and, in
various instances, GLG failed to provide the IPC with sufficient time to review such
recommendations. In addition, GLG generally kept no record of the IPC’s basis for monthly
decisions to keep individual Level 3 fund asset valuations unchanged. As a result of these failures,
the books and records of GPI and GLG were inaccurate because the EMSA1 Fund’s Coal Co.
position was overvalued from November 2008 through November 2010. GPI thus violated
Sections 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, and GLG was a cause of these
violations.
29.
Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder
require issuers of registered securities to file factually accurate annual, quarterly, and current
reports with the SEC. No showing of scienter is required to establish a violation of Section 13(a).
SEC v. Savoy Indus., Inc., 587 F.2d 1149, 1167 (D.C. Cir. 1978), cert denied, 440 U.S. 913 (1979).
Exchange Act Rule 12b-20 requires the addition to such reports of further material information as
necessary to make the required report statements not misleading.
30.
As set forth above, GPI filed numerous reports with the SEC covering the period
2008 through June 30, 2010 that contained inaccuracies related to overstated AUM, which were
8

material. GPI thus violated the aforementioned reporting provisions, and GLG, through its
valuation-related controls failures, was a cause of these violations.

E.
Pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, a Fair
Fund is created for the disgorgement, interest and/or penalties referenced in paragraphs C-D above.
Regardless of whether any such Fair Fund distribution is made, amounts ordered to be paid as civil
money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be treated as penalties paid to the government for all
purposes, including all tax purposes. To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty,
Respondents agree that in any Related Investor Action, they shall not argue that they are entitled
to, nor shall they benefit by, offset or reduction of any award of compensatory damages by the
amount of any part of Respondents’ payment of a civil penalty in this action ("Penalty Offset"). If
the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a Penalty Offset, Respondents agree that they
shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting the Penalty Offset, notify the
Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount of the Penalty Offset to the United States
Treasury or to a Fair Fund, as the Commission directs. Such a payment shall not be deemed an
additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil penalty imposed
in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a "Related Investor Action" means a private
damages action brought against Respondent by or on behalf of one or more investors based on
substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the Commission in this
proceeding.

By the Commission.
