I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are,
instituted pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), Section 21C of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), Sections 203(f) and 203(k) of the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”), and Section 9(b) of the Investment Company
Act of 1940 (“Investment Company Act”) against Keith MacDonald Summers (“Summers” or
“Respondent”).

II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, Respondent admits the Commission’s
jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these proceedings, and consents to the entry of this
Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the
Securities Act of 1933, Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Sections 203(f) and
203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Section 9(b) of the Investment Company Act
of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order
(“Order”), as set forth below.
III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:
SUMMARY
1.
Respondent Keith M. Summers, a fund manager, who resides in Canada, breached
his fiduciary duty and defrauded Tricoastal Capital Partners, LLC (“TCP Fund”), his advisory fund
client, and its investors between July 2009 and July 2013. Summers raised $4,690,000 for TCP
Fund, a Delaware LLC, primarily from U.S. investors during the relevant period. As the managing
member of TCP Fund, Summers presented himself as a successful fund manager with a model
driven investment strategy involving exchange traded funds or ETFs. However, Summers solicited
investors by lying to them about TCP Fund’s assets under management or AUM, the intended use
of its assets and its historic performance. Summers also defrauded TCP investors by concealing
trading losses from them. Moreover, Summers fraudulently withdrew and misappropriated
$918,885 of investor funds from TCP Fund to pay for personal living expenses and unreimbursed
business expenses throughout the relevant period. In July 2013, Summers reported his misconduct
to Canadian authorities. On June 4, 2014, Summers pleaded guilty to criminal fraud charges in a
parallel Canadian criminal proceeding in R v. Summers, Information No. 12000143, before the
Ontario Court of Justice (Toronto Region). By virtue of the conduct described in this Order,
Summers willfully violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Advisers Act, and Rule
206(4)-8 thereunder.
RESPONDENT
2.
Keith M. Summers, age 49, is a Canadian citizen who resides in Burlington, Ontario,
Canada. Summers was the managing member of TCP Fund, an unregistered investment fund, and
the sole principal and director of Tricoastal Capital Management Ltd., an unregistered investment
advisory firm. Summers directed TCP Fund and managed its investments at all times since its
inception. Summers maintained a nominal office presence in Buffalo, New York, but operated
TCP Fund from his home office at the time in Burlington, Ontario.

OTHER RELEVANT ENTITIES
3.
Tricoastal Capital Partners, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, is an
investment fund excluded from the definition of “investment company” under Section 3(c)(1) of the
Investment Company Act. Summers formed TCP Fund in 2004. As its sole officer and director,
Summers managed and controlled TCP Fund at all times.
4.
Tricoastal Capital Management Ltd. (“TCM”), a Canadian corporation organized
under the laws of the province of Ontario, Canada, is an unregistered investment advisory firm.
Summers formed TCM in 2007. Summers managed and controlled TCM at all times as its sole
principal and director, and its controlling shareholder. TCM has ceased its operations.
FACTS
5.
Between July 2009 and April 2012, Summers raised $4,690,000 for TCP Fund
primarily from eight U.S. investors. Summers presented himself to investors as a successful fund
manager who used a quantitative model-driven investment strategy involving exchange traded
funds (“ETFs”) to generate consistent long-term returns. Summers used a model to select a basket
of index ETFs in which he invested TCP Fund every month. At the beginning of every month,
Summers would invest TCP Fund equally among the ETFs and hold the ETFs until the end of the
month at which time he would sell them. Summers then repeated the process the following month
by investing in a different basket of ETFs.
6.
During the relevant period, Summers intentionally and knowingly solicited
potential investors by means of material misrepresentations and omissions. From the very outset,
Summers misrepresented, orally and in certain written communications, the size of TCP Fund or
its assets under management or AUM to attract investors. In July 2009, Summers told potential
investors that he had $2 million in AUM when in fact he had no assets under management. By
November 2009, Summers had raised approximately $1 million from investors based on those
misrepresentations. From 2010 to 2012, Summers continued to overstate TCP Fund’s AUM,
typically misrepresenting to prospective investors that he managed $10 million to $15 million
when in fact he had far fewer assets under management at the time.
7.
Summers also misrepresented to potential investors the historic performance of
TCP Fund in certain marketing materials and then concealed trading losses from them after they
invested in TCP Fund. From July 2009 to August 2011, Summers sometimes “smoothed” TCP
Fund’s reported monthly performance by over-reporting or under-reporting returns to investors.
Summers marketed TCP Fund to potential investors based on these smoothed returns instead of the
fund’s actual returns. While his ETF trading strategy performed relatively well in 2009 and 2010,
Summers started to experience significant trading losses in 2011. By August 2011, Summers
began to underreport significant losses in certain months to investors on their monthly account
statements.
8.
In May 2012, Summers experienced at least a 10.46% loss. By then, Summers had
lost faith in his ETF trading strategy and abandoned it for a far riskier strategy involving
3

derivatives, including futures and options on market volatility indices, in an attempt to recover
previous losses.
9.
TCP Fund suffered over $1,202,000 in additional trading losses as a result of
Summers’ riskier investment strategy. Beginning in July 2012, Summers began to conceal his
trading losses by preparing and delivering false monthly account statements that reported positive
returns in almost every month to investors based on what the performance of TCP Fund would
have been if he had maintained the original ETF strategy.
10.
In March 2013, the largest fund investor asked Summers for a copy of TCP Fund’s
audited financial statements. In April 2013, Summers prepared and delivered to the investor
forged audited financial statements from a fake audit firm for fiscal year 2012 for TCP Fund which
reflected an inflated AUM and false returns for the fund.
11.
Meanwhile, from July 2009 until July 2013, Summers also intentionally and
knowingly made unauthorized withdrawals and misappropriated $918,885 from TCP Fund.
During the period, unbeknownst to investors, Summers withdrew money from the fund in excess
of the management fees and reimbursements to which he was entitled under the terms of the
Offering Memorandum or Operating Agreement for TCP Fund. Summers used the money to pay
for personal living expenses and unreimbursed business expenses.
12.
On July 12, 2013, Summers reported his misconduct to the Ontario Securities
Commission when he realized the largest fund investor was on the verge of discovering that he had
forged TCP Fund’s purported audited financial statements. At the time, there remained
approximately $1,396,000 in assets in the brokerage account that Summers maintained on behalf of
TCP Fund at a financial institution in New York, New York. Summers raised $4,117,685.15 from
TCP Fund investors after taking into account approximately $572,000 in redemptions during the
relevant period.
13.
On June 4, 2014, Summers pleaded guilty to criminal fraud charges in R v.
Summers, Information No. 12000143, a parallel criminal proceeding before the Ontario Court of
Justice (Toronto Region), based upon the misconduct described above.
VIOLATIONS
14.
As a result of the conduct described above, Summers willfully violated Section
17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, which
prohibit fraudulent conduct in the offer or sale of securities and in connection with the purchase or
sale of securities.
15.
As a result of the conduct described above, Respondents willfully violated Sections
206(1) and 206(2) of the Advisers Act, which prohibit fraudulent and deceptive conduct by an
investment adviser with respect to any client or prospective client, and Section 206(4) of the
Advisers Act and Rule 206(4)-8 promulgated thereunder, which prohibit making an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitting to state any material fact to any investor or prospective
4

investor in a pooled investment vehicle and engaging in any act, practice, or course of business that
is fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative with respect to any investor or prospective investor in the
pooled investment vehicle.
IV.

impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondent Summers’ Offer.
Accordingly, pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act, Section 21C of the Exchange
