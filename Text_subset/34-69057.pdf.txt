Respondents.

On December 18, 2009, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
(“Commission”) issued a Notice of Proposed Plan of Distribution and Opportunity for Comment
(“Distribution Plan”) (Exchange Act Rel. No. 61208) pursuant to Rule 1103 of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. §201.1103. The Notice
advised parties that they could obtain a copy of the Distribution Plan at www.sec.gov. The
Notice also advised that all persons desiring to comment on the Distribution Plan could submit
their comments, in writing, within 30 days of the date of the Notice. No comments were
received by the Commission in response to the Notice. On March 5, 2010, the Commission
issued an Order Approving Plan and Appointing a Plan Administrator (Exchange Act Rel. No.
61653).
The Distribution Plan provides that the Plan Administrator will compile the necessary
information regarding the Harmed Investors described in the Distribution Plan to be submitted to
the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Management Service (“FMS”) in the required file
format, and Commission staff will then obtain authorization from the Commission to disburse
pursuant to SEC Rule 1101(b)(6).1

The Distribution Plan provides for three disbursement payments to the Harmed Investors. This is the
second Order Directing Disbursement. The first Order Directing Disbursement was approved on
September 17, 2010 (Exchange Act Rel. No. 62936).

Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the Commission staff shall transmit the electronic file
containing the necessary information regarding the Harmed Investors to FMS for the transfer and
distribution of $121,117.06 in funds to the Harmed Investors in accordance with the Distribution
Plan.
By the Commission.
