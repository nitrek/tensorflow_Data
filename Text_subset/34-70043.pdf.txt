__________________________________________:
The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has requested a second extension of time,
until October 18, 2013, to submit a proposed Plan of Distribution under Rule 1101(a) of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1101(a).
The Commission issued two orders dated December 17, 2012, finding that Aladdin
Capital Management LLC and Aladdin Capital LLC (collectively “Aladdin”) violated Section
17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Section 206(2) of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) when Aladdin misled investors regarding coinvestments in two collateral debt obligations (“CDOs”) that Aladdin managed and marketed,
and Joseph A. Schlimm, who was responsible for ensuring that Aladdin co-invested alongside
its clients in the CDOs, but failed to ensure that Aladdin actually did so, violated Section

17(a)(2) of the Securities Act and caused Aladdin’s violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the
Securities Act and Section 206(2) of the Advisers Act (Advisers Act Rel. Nos. 3514 and 3515
(Dec. 17, 2012)).
On February 14, 2013, the Commission issued an Extension Order giving the Division
until July 17, 2013, to submit a proposed Plan of Distribution (Exchange Act Rel. No. 68931
(February 14, 2013)). The Division now states that it will require additional time because of
the novel and complex nature of this analysis.
Accordingly, for good cause shown, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Division’s
request for an extension of time until October 18, 2013, to submit a proposed Plan of
Distribution is granted.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Elizabeth M. Murphy
Secretary
