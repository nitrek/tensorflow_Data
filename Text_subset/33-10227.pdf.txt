In the Matter of
LARRY C. GROSSMAN,
Respondent.

OPINION OF THE COMMISSION
INVESTMENT ADVISER PROCEEDING
CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDING
Grounds for Remedial Action
Antifraud violations
Compliance violations
Investment adviser violated certain antifraud, broker-dealer, and investment adviser
provisions of the federal securities laws by, among other things, making
misrepresentations and omissions of material fact to clients when he advised them to
invest in funds from which he received undisclosed referral fees, consulting fees, and
sales charges. Held, the statute of limitations prohibits us from imposing civil penalties,
but does not apply to the remaining categories of equitable relief; it is in the public

2
interest to impose an industry bar, order respondent to cease and desist from further
violations, and require him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains.
APPEARANCES:
Zachary D. Messa and Michael T. Cronin, Johnson Pope Bokor Ruppel & Burns, LLP,
for Larry C. Grossman.
Patrick R. Costello and Sunny H. Kim, for the Division of Enforcement.
Initial decision filed: December 23, 2014
Petition for review filed: January 13, 2015
Last brief received: April 10, 2015
Respondent Larry C. Grossman appeals from an administrative law judge’s initial
decision finding that he violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Section 15(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and Sections 206(1), (2), (3), and 207 of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940; and that he aided, abetted, and caused violations of Section 206(4) of the
Advisers Act and Advisers Act Rules 204-3 and 206(4)-2. Among other misconduct, Grossman
received undisclosed compensation from hedge funds in which he advised his clients to invest.
Grossman does not contest that he violated the federal securities laws, and we find that he did.
Grossman argues only that a five-year statute of limitations prohibits the relief ordered by
the law judge. The Order Instituting Proceedings in this case was filed on November 20, 2013.
Based on the particular facts of this case, we find that a civil penalty is unavailable because
Grossman’s conduct ended before the five-year limitations period set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 2462.
But Section 2462’s statute of limitations does not apply to equitable remedies. We find that an
industry bar, cease-and-desist order, and disgorgement are equitable remedies not subject to
Section 2462. We also find that an industry bar, cease-and-desist order, and disgorgement are in
the public interest.
I. FINDINGS OF FACT
Grossman did not appeal the ALJ’s findings of liability and has not disputed his liability
before us. He has thus waived any challenge to those findings. 1 Because the initial decision
“ceased to have any force or effect” when we granted Grossman’s petition for review,2 we
review Grossman’s conduct and provide the legal basis for our findings of liability.

fraud are in the law judge’s initial decision. See Larry C. Grossman, Initial Decision Release
No. 727, 2014 WL 7330327, at *2-24, 28-38 (Dec. 23, 2014).

3
Grossman founded, owned, and operated Sovereign International Asset Management,
Inc. (“Sovereign”), a registered investment adviser. During the time he owned Sovereign,
Grossman recommended to clients that they invest in certain offshore hedge funds. In doing so,
Grossman had a significant financial conflict of interest: each time a Sovereign client invested in
the funds, the fund manager deducted a sales charge from their investment, and paid it to a
foreign bank account that Grossman controlled through a foreign company he owned. Certain of
the funds also charged Sovereign clients management and performance fees, and Grossman
received half of the fees charged to Sovereign clients.
Grossman did not disclose these conflicts to his clients, either directly or through the
Forms ADV that registered investment advisers file with the Commission. After the
Commission’s Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (“OCIE”) warned him that
his disclosures were inadequate, Grossman revised the disclosures, but did not inform his clients
about his conflict of interest. In addition to this undisclosed conflict, Grossman misrepresented
to clients the extent to which he had undertaken due diligence on the funds, and the extent to
which he offered individualized investment advice. And, despite a fiduciary duty to Sovereign
clients, he failed to ensure that Sovereign complied with other Advisers Act regulations related
to client disclosures and custody of client assets.
Grossman advised his clients to invest in offshore hedge funds.
Grossman was registered with the Commission as Sovereign’s investment adviser
representative, and was responsible for Sovereign’s activity from its founding in 1998 until he
sold it to his co-respondent, Gregory Adams, on October 1, 2008.3 Grossman also owned several
related entities that played a role in his fraud; we discuss them below as relevant.
Sovereign’s clients were primarily investors who sought to use their self-directed IRAs to
invest in offshore securities. Grossman advised clients to invest in offshore hedge funds and a
managed account run by Nikolai Battoo; we collectively call these the “Battoo Funds” or the
“Funds.”4 Battoo managed the Funds through two related entities that he owned or controlled;
we collectively call these “BC Capital” because their differences are not material.

We accepted Adams’ offer of settlement, in which he consented to entry of an order
finding that he violated or aided and abetted violations of the same securities laws as Grossman.
See Gregory J. Adams, Securities Act Release No. 9572, 2014 WL 1350276 (Apr. 7, 2014).
Adams agreed to additional proceedings to determine the amount of disgorgement and third-tier
civil penalties. In the same initial decision from which Grossman has petitioned for review, the
ALJ ordered Adams to disgorge $1,070,828 plus prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty
of $750,000. Adams did not contest those sanctions, and we issued an order finding that the
initial decision was final as to Adams. See Gregory J. Adams, Securities Act Release No. 9754
(Apr. 22, 2015).

Sovereign investors could invest in certain share classes of Anchor Hedge Fund Ltd.
(“Anchor”), including “Anchor A” and “Anchor C”; certain share classes of FuturesOne
(continued…)

4
Grossman received significant payments from the Battoo Funds when he was
recommending them to clients. He entered into a series of agreements with the Battoo Funds,
which became effective between August 2003 and December 2003, under which he was to be
paid out of his clients’ assets that were invested in the Funds. Under these agreements,
Grossman was paid—through an identically named Anguilla limited liability company he owned,
Sovereign International Asset Management LLC (“Sovereign Anguilla”)—a sales charge (or
load) of between 1% and 4.5% of the principal amount each time a client invested in certain of
the Battoo Funds. Grossman was also paid half of the annual management fees that BC Capital
earned when a Sovereign client invested in PIWM. And, in exchange for serving as a
“consultant,” Grossman was paid half of the management and performance fees charged to
Sovereign clients who invested in Anchor.5 According to the Division’s calculation, which is
undisputed and we accept, Grossman received $3,407,765.66 through a Danish bank account
from entities related to the Battoo Funds between 2004 and October 2008.
While Grossman was recommending to Sovereign clients that they invest in the Battoo
Funds, he concealed from them that he had a significant conflict of interest in doing so.
Grossman had initially told Sovereign clients in January 2003 that he had “taken an active role as
an investment adviser to” the Battoo Funds. He told them, truthfully at the time, that Sovereign
received “no additional compensation” for recommending the Battoo Funds. Grossman never
disclosed to investors, however, that he started receiving compensation from the Battoo Funds in
August 2003. Nor did the Battoo Funds’ private placement memoranda (“PPMs”) disclose that
Grossman received a sales charge. Although certain of the PPMs stated that investors “may”
have to pay “a maximum 4.5% cost of entry fee,” neither the PPMs nor Grossman himself ever
disclosed that Grossman would receive any sales charge or any portion of annual management
and quarterly performance fees.
Grossman did not disclose his arrangement with the Battoo Funds in the firm’s
investment advisory agreements (“IAAs”), or the Forms ADV in effect through 2004 and early
2005. In 2004, OCIE conducted an examination of Sovereign’s books and records. The
examination led OCIE to send Sovereign a deficiency letter in February 2005 noting eleven areas
of concern, including Grossman’s failure to disclose, or untrue statements about, the nature and
extent of Sovereign’s business and relationship with the Battoo Funds, what it sold to clients,
how it was compensated, and whether it or any related entity had custody over client assets.
Grossman responded to the deficiency letter in March 2005 and represented to OCIE that
Sovereign’s IAA and Form ADV had been modified. Sovereign’s revised IAA stated, for
(…continued)
Diversified Fund Ltd. (“FuturesOne”), including “FuturesOne A” and “FuturesOne C”; and a
managed account called Private International Wealth Management (“PIWM”), which invested
primarily—sometimes exclusively—in other Battoo Funds.

The record is unclear as to when Grossman stopped receiving fees under the consulting
agreement, but the Division’s calculation does not include any such fees after October 2008.

5
example, that Sovereign “may receive performance-based compensation from certain investment
companies. Advisor will notify clients in advance of any investments the nature of any and all
fees charged to the client and/or paid to the Advisor.” Grossman also made several revisions to
the Forms ADV, including by amending the Form to reflect the quoted revisions to the IAA.
Those documents still did not accurately reflect Sovereign’s and Grossman’s relationship to the
Battoo Funds. Nor did Grossman make any other disclosures to Sovereign clients, outside the
IAA or Forms ADV, about Sovereign’s and his relationship to the Battoo Funds.
Grossman’s undisclosed conflict of interest—and the misstatements and omissions of
material fact—continued until October 1, 2008, when he sold Sovereign, Sovereign Anguilla,
and two other related entities to Adams.6 In exchange, Adams paid him $3.8 million—with
$500,000 due at closing, another $500,000 due six months later, and the balance due under a
promissory note bearing 8% interest per year. Grossman did not sell Sovereign International
Pension Services, Inc. (“SIPS”), an individual retirement account administrator.
After buying Sovereign, Adams asked Grossman to stay on as a consultant. Grossman
helped Adams with transitioning the business and interacting with Sovereign clients after the
financial crash in late 2008 through early 2009. Grossman was serving in this consulting role
when, on October 13, 2008, Anchor’s manager informed Sovereign that it was suspending
redemptions of Anchor C, supposedly so the fund could switch its portfolio from one bank to
another. Grossman waited until November 2008 to inform Sovereign’s clients that Anchor C
had suspended redemptions. In late November, Battoo proposed—and Adams strongly
recommended to Sovereign clients—a swap of Anchor C shares for PIWM shares.
Grossman was also involved in informing Sovereign clients that “substantially all” of the
funds in which Anchor A invested were exposed to the Bernard Madoff Ponzi scheme. Anchor
A’s administrator sent Grossman and Adams two letters in December 2008 explaining that
because of the Madoff Ponzi scheme it was suspending redemptions and the calculation of net
asset value for Anchor A. Grossman and Adams waited two months to tell Sovereign clients
about Anchor A’s exposure to the Madoff Ponzi scheme and the resulting consequences.
Sovereign clients suffered significant losses,7 and Sovereign filed for Chapter 7
bankruptcy in June 2012.8 The State of Florida administratively dissolved Sovereign in
6

The other two were Anchor Holdings, LLC (Florida) (“Anchor Florida”); and Anchor
Holdings, LLC (Nevis) (“Anchor Nevis”). Despite their similar name, they were not affiliated
with the Anchor hedge fund or its manager. Anchor Florida and Anchor Nevis had a role in
Grossman’s fraud in connection with the accounts through which Sovereign clients wired money
to and held interests in the Anchor hedge funds. See infra text accompanying note 43.
7

As of the hearing, clients had not yet redeemed their investments in Anchor A, Anchor C,
or PIWM. The Sovereign clients who testified at the hearing—a fraction of Sovereign’s clients
during Grossman’s ownership—lost at least $3.23 million from the Battoo Funds. Some testified
that they would not have invested with Grossman had they known about his conflict of interest.

6
September 2012.9 Battoo is a defendant in a case that the Division brought against him in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in September 2012. The court issued a
default judgment against Battoo imposing a permanent injunction, disgorgement of $272.6
million plus prejudgment interest, and a $68 million civil penalty. 10
II. VIOLATIONS
We find that, before Grossman sold Sovereign to Adams, Grossman violated Advisers
Act Sections 206(1), (2), (3), and 207, Securities Act Section 17(a), and Exchange Act Section
15(a). We also find that, before Grossman sold Sovereign to Adams, Grossman aided and
abetted and was a cause of Sovereign’s violations of Advisers Act Section 206(4) and Advisers
Act Rule 206(4)-2 and 204-3.11
A.

Grossman violated Advisers Act Section 206 and Securities Act Section 17(a).

Advisers Act Section 206(1) makes it unlawful for an investment adviser directly or
indirectly “to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud any client or prospective
client.”12 Advisers Act Section 206(2) makes it unlawful for an investment adviser directly or
indirectly “to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates as a fraud
or deceit upon any client or prospective client.”13 Securities Act Section 17(a)(2) makes it
unlawful, in the offer or sale of any securities, for any person to obtain money or property by
means of any untrue statement of a material fact or any material omission. 14 Scienter—intent to

Each of the violations charged requires a nexus to the mails or any means or
instrumentalities of interstate commerce. See 15 U.S.C. §§ 77q(a), 78o(a)(1), 80b-6. Grossman
does not dispute, and we find, that these jurisdictional elements are satisfied because he used
telephone calls, email, wire transfers, and the Internet to communicate with Battoo and with
Sovereign clients. See, e.g., SEC v. Tourre, 2013 WL 2407172, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. June 4, 2013).

deceive, manipulate, or defraud—is necessary for a violation of Advisers Act Section 206(1), but
negligence is sufficient for a violation of Section 206(2) or Securities Act Section 17(a)(2).15
It is undisputed that, before he sold Sovereign, Grossman met the general statutory
definition of an “investment adviser”: one compensated to “advis[e] others . . . as to the value of
securities or as to the advisability of investing in, purchasing or selling securities.”16 Grossman
controlled and owned Sovereign, and was compensated for providing investment advice. 17
We find that Grossman violated the Advisers Act by failing to disclose his referral and
consulting fees, failing to conduct adequate due diligence into the Battoo Funds, failing to
adequately disclose the Funds’ risks, falsely claiming that he offered individualized investment
advice, and falsely stating that Sovereign would not have custody over client funds. We find that
he violated the Securities Act by obtaining money by means of these misstatements and
omissions.
1.

Grossman failed to disclose referral and consulting fees.

As an investment adviser, Grossman was a fiduciary who had an affirmative obligation
not to mislead his clients. This included a duty to disclose all material facts, including conflicts
of interest.18 Grossman failed to disclose, in the IAA and Forms ADV prior to OCIE’s 2004
examination, the referral and consulting agreements between Sovereign Anguilla and the Battoo
Funds, or the fact that he received fees from the Battoo Funds under those agreements.19 This

Details of these failures to disclose are discussed infra in connection with the violations

8
“economic conflict of interest” was material as a matter of law. 20 It could have raised questions
for a reasonable investor about the objectivity of Grossman’s recommendations. 21
Although Grossman revised the IAAs and Form ADV after OCIE’s examination, his
revisions did not cure the deficiencies. Despite statements in Sovereign’s IAA and Forms ADV
stating that it would notify clients of “any and all fees” it was paid, the revised documents did
not disclose receipt of performance-based fees, referral fees, and international consulting fees.
And by stating that Sovereign “may” receive fees or compensation, Grossman misleadingly
suggested that the receipt of fees was uncertain.22 As the Fifth Circuit has held, to “warn that the
untoward may occur when the event is contingent is prudent; to caution that it is only possible
for the unfavorable events to happen when they have already occurred is deceit.”23
Grossman acted with scienter in not disclosing his conflict of interest. Grossman knew
both that he was receiving compensation from the Battoo Funds and that he did not disclose this
fact to his clients. In light of that knowledge, he acted with scienter.
2.

Grossman failed to conduct adequate due diligence.

An investment adviser has a fiduciary duty to independently investigate securities before
recommending them to clients.24 Advisers are charged with knowledge of their fiduciary
duties,25 and Grossman testified that he was in fact well-versed in his duties. Nonetheless,
Grossman recommended the Battoo Funds without a reasonable independent basis for his advice.

Grossman knew little more about the Battoo Funds than what Battoo had told him about
portfolio composition, past returns, and volatility. Grossman determined whether the Battoo
Funds were suitable for clients primarily by reviewing promotional materials and performancetracking documents associated with each fund. These included monthly one-page reports
produced by the Funds’ supposedly independent administrator—which Grossman knew or must
have known was run by Battoo’s associates and therefore was not in fact independent26—and
which reported the Funds’ returns and variance. For a time, Battoo provided Grossman with
information about the Funds’ portfolio composition, but Battoo later became evasive about
portfolio details. Grossman continued recommending the funds even after Battoo stopped
providing him with information about fund composition.
Recklessness, an “extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care, . . . which
presents a danger of misleading [clients] that is either known to the [respondent] or is so obvious
that [he] must have been aware of it,” satisfies the scienter requirement. 27 In recommending the
investments despite Battoo’s evasiveness, the risk that his clients would be misled was either
known to Grossman or so obvious that he must have been aware of it. Grossman therefore acted
with scienter.28
3.

Grossman failed to disclose the risks of investing in the Battoo Funds.

Because Grossman failed to conduct adequate due diligence into the funds he was
recommending, he had no basis for describing the Battoo Funds as “moderately conservative.”
Grossman also received financial records from the Battoo Funds noting their “cross-portfolio
liability”: for example, the assets of Anchor A could be used to satisfy the liabilities of Anchor
C, and vice versa, which increased the risk of loss for any individual fund. This risk of crossportfolio liability, and the fact that Grossman had not performed adequate due diligence to
provide a basis for any assurance about the Funds’ risks, were not disclosed to investors. These
failures to disclose were material because a reasonable investor would have wanted to know
about such risks before deciding whether to invest.
26

Grossman was also a member of the investment advisory board for Anchor. He received
certain documents in this capacity, as well as in his capacity recommending and selling
placements in the funds to his clients, that identified who else was involved with advising
Anchor. For example, Anchor’s PPM said that the fund would be independently administered by
a company called Folio Administrators. But Folio Administrators was not in fact independent;
Grossman knew or must have known from his role with Anchor that some of Folio
Administrators’ directors were also associated with Anchor’s manager, with BC Capital, and
with other entities associated with the Battoo Funds. As with Anchor, FuturesOne’s supposedly
independent administrator was also associated with Battoo entities.

4.

Grossman falsely claimed that he offered individualized investment
advice.

Grossman falsely claimed that he offered individualized investment advice. Sovereign’s
promotional materials represented that it offered “highly personalized and individually tailored
solutions” that “address[ed] client needs.” Contrary to his representations about providing
individualized investment advice, Grossman advised clients to invest heavily in the Battoo
Funds, and fully 75% of assets under Sovereign’s management were invested in the Funds when
Grossman sold Sovereign to Adams. And, as described above, Grossman recommended the
Battoo Funds without a reasonable independent basis for his advice. He therefore could not have
been giving individualized advice in recommending the Battoo Funds to Sovereign clients.
Grossman’s claims were material because a reasonable investor would have wanted to know
whether Grossman recommended the funds because they were appropriate for the investor or
because he was paid to do so. Grossman acted with scienter because he knew, or must have been
aware, that despite his representations he was advising Sovereign clients to invest the vast
majority of their assets in the Battoo Funds without individualizing the advice to the needs of
particular clients.29
5.

Grossman falsely stated that Sovereign would not have custody over client
funds.

Grossman stated falsely (in the IAAs, Form ADV, and other disclosures) that Sovereign
and related entities would not have custody over client funds. But Sovereign structured clients’
investments in the Battoo Funds in such a way that related parties—Sovereign Anguilla before
2005, and Anchor Florida after 2005—had custody over client funds. A reasonable investor
would have wanted to know the risk that funds could be accessed by the investment adviser.
***
With respect to his failure to disclose his referral and consulting fees, failure to conduct
adequate due diligence, and false statements about individualized investment advice, we find that
Grossman violated Advisers Act Sections 206(1) and (2) because he acted with scienter. With
respect to his failure to disclose the risks of investing in the Battoo Funds and false statements
about Sovereign’s custody of client funds, we find that Grossman violated Advisers Act Section
206(2). We also find that Grossman violated Section 17(a)(2) by obtaining money by means of
his false statements and omissions of material fact. During the time he owned Sovereign,
Grossman was the beneficiary of compensation agreements between the Battoo Funds and
Sovereign Anguilla, under which Grossman would receive referral and consulting fees paid out
of Sovereign clients’ invested assets. Grossman’s receipt of these fees, by means of the

29

See id. at 1335-36.

11
undisclosed compensation agreements and the untrue statements and omissions of material fact
to his clients who invested in the Battoo Funds, violated Securities Act Section 17(a)(2). 30
B.

Grossman violated Advisers Act Section 207.

Advisers Act Section 207 forbids “any person willfully to make any untrue statement of a
material fact in any registration application or report filed with the Commission under section
203, or 204, or willfully to omit to state in any such application or report any material fact which
is required to be stated therein.”31 Scienter is not required to find a violation of Advisers Act
Section 207.32 Form ADV is filed with the Commission under Sections 203 and 204.33
Before receiving the 2005 OCIE deficiency letter, Grossman made a series of untrue
statements in Sovereign’s Form ADV regarding the nature and extent of Sovereign’s business, its
relationship with outside companies (such as the Battoo Funds), what it sold or recommended to
clients, how it was compensated, and whether it had custody over client assets. In response to
the deficiency letter, Grossman represented that Sovereign’s IAA and Form ADV were modified
to more accurately reflect the various ways that Sovereign may receive compensation. For
example, Grossman revised Form ADV Part II, Item I.C, to reflect that Sovereign offers
investment advisory fees for “subscription fees.”34 Grossman also disclosed in Schedule F that
“[Sovereign] may receive incentive or subscription fees from certain investment companies,”
“[Sovereign] may receive performance-based compensation from certain investment
companies,” and “[Sovereign] will notify clients in advance of any investments the nature of any
and all fees charged to the client and/or paid to [Sovereign].” As discussed above, however,
Grossman’s use of the word “may” was misleading because it suggested uncertainty about
whether Sovereign would receive fees and other compensation when it was in fact receiving
them at the time.35 Grossman did not address the remaining untrue statements in the Form
30

We find that Grossman made all of these false and misleading statements in the “offer
and sale” of securities, as required by Securities Act Section 17(a)(2). We also find that the
Battoo Funds subscriptions were unregistered foreign securities under the investment contract
test. See SEC v. Howey, 328 U.S. 293, 301 (1946) (looking to “whether the scheme involves an

Grossman contended at the hearing that this was intended to disclose that the Battoo
Funds were paying him. Assuming for the sake of argument that Grossman intended this to
truthfully describe the fees Sovereign received, he made an untrue statement insofar as he did not
include this disclosure on the Form ADV Part II dated March 26, 2008.

ADVs effective after receiving the OCIE letter.36 The undisclosed fee arrangements, relationship
with the Battoo Funds, and custody arrangements were material.37 For these reasons, we find
that Grossman violated Advisers Act Section 207. 38
C.

Grossman aided and abetted, and was a cause of, violations of Advisers Act
Section 206(4) and Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-2 and 204-3.

To conclude that a respondent aided and abetted a securities law violation, we must find
that (1) a violation occurred; (2) the respondent substantially aided the violation; and (3) the
respondent provided that assistance with the requisite scienter. 39 Scienter can be met by
establishing that the respondent rendered such assistance knowingly or recklessly. 40
1.

Grossman aided and abetted and caused violations of Advisers Act Rule
206(4)-2.

Advisers Act Section 206(4) provides that it is unlawful for an investment adviser “to
engage in any act, practice, or course of business which is fraudulent, deceptive, or
manipulative” and that the Commission shall define such conduct by rule.41 Advisers Act Rule
206(4)-2(a) provides that it is a “fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative act, practice, or course of
business” for a registered investment adviser to have custody over client funds or securities
unless the adviser is a qualified custodian and meets certain other obligations. 42 Sovereign had
custody over client assets in that, after 2005, it directed clients to send funds to a bank account

36

We find that Grossman did not properly revise Sovereign’s responses in Form ADV Part
I Items 5.E (means of compensation), 6.B(1) (active engagement in business other than
investment advice), 6.B(3) (products or services other than investment advice), and 9 (custody of
client assets), or in Form ADV Part II Items 8 (material arrangement with investment company),
9 (recommendation of securities or investment products in which Sovereign or related person
had interest), and 13 (written or oral arrangements for additional compensation).
37

See supra text accompanying notes 20-21.

38

We find that Grossman acted willfully, as Section 207 requires. See infra note 160.

held by related entity Anchor Florida.43 Sovereign violated Advisers Act Section 206(4) and
Rule 206(4)-2 because it had custody and failed to: have a qualified custodian maintain those
funds or securities in separate client accounts, or in the adviser’s account as agent or trustee;
notify clients that it had such custody; and have a qualified custodian send quarterly account
statements (or undergo an annual surprise examination if it sent the account statements itself).44
Grossman claimed that he was unaware of the custody rules, but advisers are obligated to know
the custody rules; Grossman’s claimed lack of awareness was at least reckless.45 Grossman
substantially assisted Sovereign’s violation by forming Anchor Florida, instructing Sovereign
clients to wire funds to EverBank, and acting as account signatory. We find that Grossman aided
and abetted and was a cause of Sovereign’s violation of Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-2.
2.

Grossman aided and abetted and caused violations of Advisers Act Rule
204-3.

Sovereign violated Advisers Act Rule 204-3, which requires advisers to provide clients
with brochures “contain[ing] all information required by Part 2 of Form ADV,”46 by not
providing such brochures. Grossman was responsible for ensuring Sovereign’s compliance with
the rule. Sovereign’s violation was known to Grossman or was so obvious that he must have
been aware of it, because at least one client had to request the Form ADV information.47
Grossman substantially assisted the violation because he failed to ensure that clients were given
the adviser brochures and supplements. 48 We find that Grossman aided and abetted and was a
cause of Sovereign’s violation of Advisers Act Rule 204-3.

43

See 17 C.F.R. § 275.206(4)-2(d)(2) (defining custody as “holding, directly or indirectly,
client funds” or the “authority to obtain possession of them,” which would include by a related
person).

requirements at issue were in effect at the relevant times.

Inaction constitutes substantial assistance if the alleged aider and abettor owes a fiduciary
duty directly to the person injured by the primary violation. See Lerner v. Fleet Bank, N.A., 459
F.3d 273, 295 (2d Cir. 2006). As an adviser, Grossman had a fiduciary duty to his clients and
was obligated to ensure that they received the brochures required by Rule 204-3.

14
D.

Grossman violated Exchange Act Section 15(a) by selling subscriptions to the
Battoo Funds as an unregistered broker.

Exchange Act Section 15(a) prohibits a broker or dealer from effecting any transactions
in, or to induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any security unless such broker or
dealer is registered with the Commission (or falls within another exception not relevant here). 49
We find, based on multiple factors, that Grossman met the Exchange Act’s definition of a
broker: one “engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of
others.”50 Grossman regularly participated at key points in the chain of distribution of Battoo
Funds subscriptions. He advised clients about the merits of those investments; he discussed their
risks and returns, and described Anchor A, for example, as suitable for “widows and orphans.”51
He facilitated sales of tens of millions of dollars in subscriptions, and received referral fees as
transaction-based compensation. 52 Finally, he had custody over client funds that clients wired to
bank accounts associated with related entities Sovereign Anguilla before 2005, and Anchor
Florida after 2005.53 Grossman was not registered as a broker, was not associated with a
registered broker or dealer, and was not exempt from registration. Grossman thus violated
Exchange Act Section 15(a). 54
E.

Grossman violated Advisers Act Section 206(3).

Advisers Act Section 206(3) makes it unlawful for any investment adviser, acting as
broker for a person other than the adviser’s own client, to knowingly sell or purchase any
security from that person for the client, without making a written disclosure before the
completion of the transaction about the capacity in which he is acting, and obtaining the client’s

15(a). See SEC v. Montana, 464 F. Supp. 2d 772, 785 (S.D. Ind. 2006).
50

15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(4)(A); see, e.g., SEC v. Coplan, 2014 WL 695393, at *6 (S.D. Fla.
Feb. 24, 2014) (outlining factors relevant in determining whether one meets definition of broker).
51

See Coplan, 2014 WL 695393, at *6 (“advised investors as to the merits of an
investment”).
52

See Persons Deemed Not To Be Brokers, Exchange Act Release No. 22172, 1985 WL
634795, at *4 (June 27, 1985) (“In determining whether an associated person is a ‘broker’, the
receipt of transaction-based compensation often indicates that such a person is engaged in the
business of effecting transactions in securities.”).
53
54

See SEC v. Margolin, 1992 WL 279735, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 1992).

The OIP also charged Grossman with aiding and abetting violations of Exchange Act
Section 15(a). Because we find that Grossman was a primary violator, we do not reach the
question of whether he is also liable as an aider and abettor under that section.

15
consent.55 Grossman acted both as an investment adviser to Sovereign clients, and as a broker to
the Battoo Funds. He effectuated the sale to Sovereign clients of private placements in the
Battoo Funds. He neither disclosed this dual capacity to clients in advance, nor obtained their
consent. We therefore find that Grossman violated Advisers Act Section 206(3).
III. SANCTIONS
Grossman argues that the sanctions the Division seeks are barred by a statute of
limitations. Although the Securities Act and Exchange Act include a statute of limitations for
each of the seven express private claims Congress authorized,56 Congress “deliberate[ly]”
refrained from enacting any express statute of limitations for Commission enforcement actions. 57
Grossman invokes 28 U.S.C. § 2462, a catch-all statute of limitations applicable where Congress
has not otherwise provided a statute of limitations. Section 2462 provides, in relevant part, that
“an action, suit, or proceeding for the enforcement of any civil fine, penalty, or forfeiture,
pecuniary or otherwise, shall not be entertained unless commenced within five years from the
date when the claim first accrued.”58
A claim accrues when the plaintiff has “a complete and present cause of action.”59 And
“[a] cause of action does not become ‘complete and present’ for limitations purposes until the
plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief.”60 This occurs when all the conduct necessary for all the

enactment clearly imposing it”). Congress similarly declined to specify an express statute of
limitations for Commission enforcement actions under Section 206 of the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940, although it also did not authorize any private right of action under that provision.

elements of the claim has occurred. For example, a claim under Advisers Act Section 206(3)
accrued each time Grossman, acting as a broker for the Battoo Funds, sold his investment
advisory clients a subscription to the funds without disclosing his dual capacity or obtaining their
consent to it.
A.

Civil Penalties and the Continuing Violations Doctrine

Grossman contends that we should not impose civil penalties because his conduct
occurred outside the applicable statute of limitations period. The ALJ recognized that a claim for
civil penalties is ordinarily subject to the statute of limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 2462. But
the ALJ brought Grossman’s conduct into Section 2462’s five-year limitations period by
applying the “continuing violations” doctrine and ordered Grossman to pay civil penalties.61
The OIP was filed on November 20, 2013, and therefore the limitations period began on
November 20, 2008. Any claim that accrued prior to that date is outside the limitations period.
We find that none of the Division’s claims under Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section
15(a) of the Exchange Act, Sections 206(3), 206(4), and 207 of the Advisers Act, and Advisers
Act Rules 204-3 and 206(4)-2 accrued after November 20, 2008.
We also find that the Division has not established by a preponderance of the evidence
that Grossman committed any of the charged violations 62 during the five years prior to the filing
of the Order Instituting Proceedings, and therefore the continuing violations doctrine is not
triggered. The Supreme Court has held that in determining whether a claim is time barred, a
“continuing violation … should be treated differently from one discrete act.”63 Although
limitations periods cut off liability for “stale claims,” “the staleness concern disappears” when
the claim challenges an “unlawful practice that continues into the limitations period.”64 Thus,
the doctrine permits a court to impose liability for “a series of separate acts that collectively
constitute one” offense, even when “some of the component acts . . . fall outside the statutory
time period.”65 As long as “an act contributing to the claim occurs within the filing period, the

for filing suit are in place.”).
61

Securities Act Section 8A(g), Exchange Act Section 21B(a) and Advisers Act Section
203(i) authorize the imposition of civil penalties in administrative proceedings. 15 U.S.C. §§
77h-1(g), 78u-2(a)(1)(A), (C), 80b-3(i)(1)(A)(i), (iii).

entire time period of [misconduct] may be considered by a court for the purposes of determining
liability.”66
Under the continuing violations doctrine, Section 2462 would not bar as untimely an
action for a civil penalty premised on a violation of the federal securities laws, as long as a
portion of the misconduct satisfying the elements of the violation occurred within the limitations
period.67
Although the continuing violations doctrine is available in the context of violations of the
federal securities laws,68 we find that it is not triggered with respect to the Division’s claims
because they accrued outside the limitations period. None of the Division’s theories to the
contrary have merit because the Division did not establish that Grossman’s conduct during the
limitations period was connected to the elements of a violation of the securities laws. 69

See Baird v. Gotbaum, 662 F.3d 1246, 1251 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (explaining that timely and
untimely conduct “can qualify” as a continuing violation only if all such conduct is “adequately
linked into a coherent” violation). As Grossman concedes in his brief, the continuing violations
doctrine allows us to treat a claim as “timely so long as the last act evidencing the continuing
practice falls within the limitations period.”

doctrine is not a tolling rule prohibited under Gabelli v. SEC, 133 S. Ct. 1216 (2013). Gabelli
held that the discovery rule does not toll Section 2462’s limitations period for an action for civil
penalties. Id. at 1221. As opposed to the discovery rule at issue in Gabelli, the continuing
violations doctrine does not toll the statute of limitations, but rather recognizes situations in
which a claim accrues when “an act contributing to” the offense occurs. Morgan, 536 U.S. at
117.
69

We address the Division’s arguments notwithstanding its August 10, 2016 filing
providing “notice that it is no longer relying on the continuing violations doctrine the Law Judge
utilized as part of her rationale for imposing a civil penalty on” Grossman. The Division cited
our recent statement in Dennis J. Malouf, Advisers Act Release No. 4463, 2016 WL 4035575, at
*28 n.176 (July 27, 2016), that we were “consider[ing] only the conduct that fell within the fiveyear statute of limitations for the purposes of determining the civil penalty.” But we have made
similar statements repeatedly in past cases. See Guy P. Riordan, Exchange Act Release No.
61153, 2009 WL 4731397, at *18 (Dec. 11, 2009) (basing civil penalty “exclusively on
[respondent’s] conduct occurring during the five-year period preceding the OIP’s issuance”
where five out of the 80 transactions occurred within the limitations period), aff’d, 627 F.3d 1230
(continued…)

18
The record does not support a finding that Grossman continued to violate Securities Act
Section 17(a)(2) during the limitations period. The Division argued in its briefs that after
November 20, 2008, Grossman had continued to receive payments from the Battoo Funds
“filtered” through Sovereign. It is undisputed that, after Grossman sold Sovereign to Adams, the
Battoo Funds continued to pay Sovereign under fee arrangements entered into years earlier—and
that, at least after Grossman returned as a managing director of Sovereign in January 2009,
Sovereign paid him a fixed salary. But the Division conceded at oral argument that Grossman
did not receive payments from the Battoo Funds during the limitations period.70 Consistent with
the Division’s concession, the record does not support a finding that Grossman’s misconduct
during the limitations period satisfied the elements of a violation of Securities Act Section
17(a)(2) such that he continued to violate that provision during the limitations period.
We also conclude that the record does not support a finding that Grossman violated
Advisers Act Section 206(1) or (2) during the limitations period. The Division argued in its
briefs that Grossman violated Section 206(1) and (2) by failing to correct misstatements and
omissions “each time [he] interacted with Sovereign clients” after November 2008 about “their
investments in the Battoo Funds.”71 Despite having sold his advisory firm, Grossman could still

(D.C. Cir. 2011); see also, e.g., Eric J. Brown, Exchange Act Release No. 66469, 2012 WL
625874, at *14 (Feb. 12, 2012) (similar), aff’d sub nom. Collins v. SEC, 736 F.3d 521 (D.C. Cir.
2013); John A. Carley, Securities Act Release No. 8888, 2008 WL 268598, at *21 (Jan. 31,
2008) (similar), aff’d sub nom. Zacharias v. SEC, 569 F.3d 458, 470-71 (D.C. Cir. 2009); Edgar
B. Alacan, Securities Act Release No. 8436, 2004 WL 1496843, at *11 (July 6, 2004) (similar).
And we have made these statements because generally Section 2462 precludes the imposition of
civil penalties for misconduct occurring outside the limitations period. See, e.g., SEC v. Mercury
Interactive, LLC, 2008 WL 4544443, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 30, 2008). Neither Malouf nor any
of those prior cases addressed whether the “continuing violations doctrine” permits imposition of
penalties where conduct occurring outside the limitations period together with conduct occurring
within the limitations period are part of “a series of separate acts that collectively constitute one”
offense, the claim is based “on the cumulative effect of [the] individual acts,” and the claim
accrues within the period because at least a portion of the misconduct necessary to complete the
offense occurs within the period. Morgan, 536 U.S. at 113-14. It is this issue we address in the
text above.
70

The Division represented at oral argument that it was “not contending that he received
any of these kickbacks or anything to that effect during the limitations period, with the exception
of two particular instances where he had specifically recommended the clients swap their
subclasses from Class C of the Anchor funds to [another investment], and [where] there was
remuneration involved.” But Grossman denied any involvement in making these
recommendations, and an employee of SIPS confirmed that he played no role in doing so.
71

We do not address the Division’s argument that a continuing violation can be found
because Grossman failed “to advise SIPS clients of his conflict of interest.” The Division cites
to general authority describing the duties that an investment adviser owes its clients, but the
(continued…)

19
be liable for violations of Advisers Act Section 206(1) and (2) if he continued to act as an
investment adviser: one who, “for compensation, engages in the business of advising others . . .
as to the value of securities or as to the advisability of investing in, purchasing or selling
securities.” 72 The evidence, however, does not establish that Grossman continued to meet the
definition of an investment adviser during the limitations period. Because the Division has not
met its burden of establishing that element by a preponderance of the evidence, we decline to
find a continuing violation of Advisers Act Section 206 within the limitations period.
The Division separately argues that, even if we do not apply the continuing violations
doctrine, we may find that Grossman violated Advisers Act Section 206(1) and (2) during the
limitations period by failing to notify his clients that he sold Sovereign to Adams. Although this
could be a basis for finding Grossman liable if the record supported a finding that he continued
to act as an investment adviser, it cannot serve as the predicate for a violation here. The OIP did
not charge as a violation his failure to notify his clients about the sale,73 the Division did not
assert this as a theory for finding Grossman liable until its post-hearing brief, and the Division
did not assert in its briefs on appeal that this was a potential independent violation during the
limitations period. Grossman lacked notice of this theory, and argues that it was not a proper
basis for the ALJ’s finding of a continuing violation. We decline to rely on it here.
Nor does the record support a finding that Grossman continued to meet the statutory
definition of a broker during the limitations period, as would be necessary to find that he
continued to violate Exchange Act Section 15(a) or Advisers Act Section 206(3). The statute
defines a broker as one “engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the
account of others.” 74 The Division has established that Grossman acted as an unregistered
broker during his ownership of Sovereign, but not that he did so during the limitations period.
(…continued)
Division has not established Grossman acted as an investment adviser with respect to his SIPS
clients.
72

15 U.S.C. § 80b-2(a)(11). There is no merit to Grossman’s contention that he did not
offer investment advice at all after selling Sovereign; in an email he sent two weeks after selling
the firm, Grossman introduced clients to Adams and stated that he would “be advising [Adams]
on both my worldview, as it relates to investments, and in the latest asset protection strategies.”
He also advised clients about the potential “reward[s]” from not selling their hedge fund
investments during the “trying times in the global markets.” Grossman sent that email, however,
on October 14, 2008, which is outside the limitations period.

See Jaffee & Co. v. SEC, 446 F.2d 387, 393-94 (2d Cir. 1971) (declining to find a
violation not charged in the OIP); see also, e.g., Rita J. McConville, Advisers Act Release. No.
2271, 2005 WL 1560276, at *7 n.27 (June 30, 2005) (declining to “base findings as to [the
respondent’s] liability” for violations not charged in the OIP); Russell Ponce, Exchange Act

20
The Division had argued that Grossman “receiv[ed] transaction-based remuneration from the
Battoo Funds,” but its concession at oral argument eliminates this as support for a finding that he
acted as an unregistered broker. In addition, the Division had argued that Grossman “continu[ed]
to advise Sovereign clients to invest and remain invested in the Battoo Funds,” but we have
rejected this argument already. The Division points to no other factors that would support a
finding that Grossman acted as a broker after November 20, 2008.
The Division has also argued that Grossman independently violated Advisers Act Section
207 during the limitations period by making misstatements in Sovereign’s Form ADV dated
December 2008.75 The law judge, in finding that Grossman acted as an investment adviser
during the limitations period, noted that Grossman’s signature was on the Form ADV along with
Adams’ signature. But the law judge made no explicit finding as to Grossman’s role in
preparing the form, and the undisputed testimony at the hearing suggested that Adams prepared
the Form ADV while Grossman had no role in doing so. In our view, the record does not
support a finding that during the limitations period Grossman—as compared to Adams—
“willfully” made any untrue statements of material fact in that filing in violation of Section 207.
In sum, we find that the continuing violations doctrine is inapplicable under the particular
facts and circumstances of this case, and that because all of the Division’s claims therefore
accrued outside of the limitations period, no civil penalties may be imposed. 76
B.

Section 2462’s statute of limitations does not apply to equitable remedies.

In addition to imposing civil penalties, the ALJ barred Grossman from the securities
industry, imposed a cease-and-desist order, and ordered him to disgorge as ill-gotten gains
$3,004,180.65 he received in undisclosed fees, plus prejudgment interest.
Grossman argues that Section 2462’s five-year statute of limitations prohibits us from
ordering these sanctions. The law judge rejected this argument, and so do we.
Section 2462 does not apply to equitable remedies. Courts have routinely held that “the
statute of limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 2462 applies only to claims for legal relief; it does
not apply to equitable remedies.”77 “Traditionally and for good reasons, statutes of limitation are
not controlling measures of equitable relief.”78
75

The Division has not argued that this violation triggered the continuing violations
doctrine.
76

The Division does not argue that Grossman aided and abetted or caused Sovereign’s
violations of Advisers Act Section 206(4) and Advisers Act Rule 206(4)-2 and 204-3 during the
limitations period so as to trigger the continuing violations doctrine.

21
Equitable sanctions are functionally different from punitive sanctions such as civil
penalties. And the Supreme Court has held that the terms “fine, penalty, or forfeiture” in Section
2462 “refer to something imposed in a punitive way.”79 It is an objective question whether a
remedy is punitive; it is therefore not dispositive that in a specific case “the person subjected to
a[n equitable] sanction [may] feel[] pain or find[] the sanction disagreeable.”80 When we impose
equitable remedies to serve the public interest—by protecting the public from future harm—we
are not seeking to impose a “suffering,” which is how the Supreme Court described the category
of punishments covered by Section 2462’s predecessor statute. 81
Applying this standard, we find that Section 2462’s statute of limitations does not apply
to the industry bar, cease-and-desist order, and disgorgement imposed on Grossman.
1.

Industry bar

The law judge imposed industry bars under the Exchange Act and Advisers Act, and an
officer-director bar under the Investment Company Act. In Section 9(b) of the Investment
Company Act, Congress authorized us to impose a suspension or bar from investment-adviser or
investment-company associations if we make certain findings. 82 Likewise, in Section 203(f) of
the Advisers Act and Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act, Congress authorized us to impose a
suspension or bar from other securities industry associations if we make certain findings, and if
the individual was associated with an investment adviser or broker-dealer during the relevant
period.83
These remedies prevent those professionals who have engaged in misconduct from
associating with the securities industry in certain roles. In determining whether to impose a bar,

we do not focus on “past misconduct” alone.84 Rather, because the remedy is intended to
“protect[] the trading public from further harm,” not to punish the respondent,85 the “degree of
risk [that the respondent] poses to the public” and the extent of the respondent’s “unfitness to
serve the investing public” are central considerations to our analysis.86 Addressing the analogous
remedy of banking disbarment sanctions, the Supreme Court has said that such sanctions are not
“punitive” but instead “serve to promote the stability of the banking industry.”87 As Congress
explained in enacting the original version of the Exchange Act’s officer-director bar in the
Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 (the “Remedies Act”),88
“persons who have demonstrated a blatant disregard for the requirements of the Federal
securities laws” may be subject to bars of this sort.89 Courts have recognized that such bars are
not a punishment.90
Because a bar operates to prevent the respondent from engaging in certain behavior, it is
a species of injunctive relief. Injunctions have traditionally been treated as remedial sanctions
rather than punitive ones. 91 Because an injunction against future violations is a type of
“equitable relief,” a claim for such an injunction is “not barred” by Section 2462.92

Grossman contends that an industry bar is a “penalty” under Section 2462 because there
is a low risk that he “would engage in similar harm in the future.” But that misunderstands the
analysis: we cannot impose an industry bar unless we find that Grossman lacks “‘current
competence’” and poses a “‘degree of risk’ . . . to public investors and the securities markets.”93
We address our findings under this standard in our discussion below. 94 As that discussion
demonstrates, we do not justify the relief “solely in view of . . . past misconduct.”95
For these reasons, we conclude that industry and officer-director bars are equitable
remedies, and thus Section 2462 does not apply to them.

committing or causing violations, or future violations, of the provisions of the securities laws that

Johnson, 87 F.3d at 490. In Johnson, the D.C. Circuit held that a bar based “solely in
view of . . . past misconduct” rather than a “showing of the risk [respondent] posed to the public”
could constitute a penalty for purposes of Section 2462. Id. For this reason, we have at times
not expressed the view that Section 2462 is categorically inapplicable to bars. See, e.g., Carley,
2008 WL 268598, at *21; Alacan, 2004 WL 1496843, at *11. But to the extent that we have
acknowledged the applicability of Johnson in certain previous adjudicatory decisions, those
decisions should not be understood as a change from our position expressed above that Section
2462 does not apply to bars based on the risk the respondent poses to the public. Indeed, we
have long held that where “the public interest requires that [a respondent] be barred” due to his
“‘current competence or the degree of risk [he] poses to the public,’” the bar is “remedial, and
therefore not subject to Section 2462.” Vladislav Steven Zubkis, Exchange Act Release No.

the law judge found he violated. 96 Like an injunction, a cease-and-desist order is designed to
prevent harm to the investing public by preventing future violations. The purpose of a ceaseand-desist order is “simply [to] require[] [defendants] not to violate the relevant securities laws
in the future.”97 A cease-and-desist order cannot be entered unless the “person is violating, has
violated, or is about to violate any provision of” the securities laws, rules or regulations,98 and
there is “some risk of future violations.”99 “Congress intended that cease-and-desist orders be
forward-looking, like injunctions,” although cease-and-desist orders require a lower “showing of
risk of future violations” than the showing required for an injunction in federal court
proceedings.100 In sum, a cease and desist order is a species of injunctive relief, in that it seeks to
prevent future violations that would harm investors. 101
Section 2462 does not apply to cease and desist orders. Such an order, intended to
prevent future violations—as the D.C. Circuit in Riordan held—is a “purely remedial and
preventative” remedy, and thus “is not a ‘fine, penalty, or forfeiture’” under Section 2462.102
Separately, because a cease-and-desist order “focuses on a respondent’s future conduct, and is a
prospective remedy . . . Section 2462 is no bar to cease-and-desist relief.” 103

96

Although Grossman contends that “[a]ll of the remedies” are time-barred, he offers no
specific argument as to the cease-and-desist order, and has waived any challenge to the ceaseand-desist order on statute-of-limitations grounds. We nonetheless explain why we find that
Section 2462 does not apply to a cease-and-desist order.

Grossman has offered no arguments for why Section 2462 should apply to a cease-anddesist order.104 We therefore follow our longstanding practice in concluding that a cease-anddesist order is an equitable remedy to which Section 2462 does not apply.
3.

Disgorgement

The law judge rejected Grossman’s argument that Section 2462 applies to disgorgement,
and ordered Grossman to disgorge $3,004,180.65, plus prejudgment interest. Grossman renews
before us his argument that Section 2462 bars disgorgement of ill-gotten gains causally
connected to misconduct occurring outside the five-year statute of limitations period. We
disagree.
In the Remedies Act, Congress expressly authorized us to “enter an order” in an
administrative cease-and-desist proceeding for “accounting and disgorgement.” 105 It also
authorizes the Commission “to adopt . . . orders concerning such . . . matters as it deems
appropriate to implement” its authority to order disgorgement. 106 The Remedies Act, however,
does not define disgorgement. We recognize that there is some divergence among the courts as
to the meaning of the term disgorgement and in particular about whether disgorgement is a
forfeiture subject to Section 2462.107 Exercising our authority to interpret the term

In SEC v. Bartek , 484 F. App’x 949, 956-57 (5th Cir. 2012), an unpublished and
therefore non-precedential decision (see Fifth Cir. R. 47.5.4), the Fifth Circuit determined that
where there was a “minimal likelihood of similar conduct in the future,” an injunction against
future securities law violations was a “penalty” barred by Section 2462. But the absence of such
a likelihood in a particular case is not a reason to conclude that injunctive relief is generally a
punitive sanction; it is a reason to conclude that the justification for relief has not been met. See,
e.g., SEC v. Zale Corp., 650 F.2d 718, 720 (5th Cir. Unit A July 1981) (holding that “the SEC’s
right to injunctive relief” turns on a showing that “the defendant’s prior illegal conduct, viewed
in light of present circumstances, betoken a ‘reasonable likelihood’ of future transgression”);
accord SEC v. Ginsburg, 362 F.3d 1292, 1304 (11th Cir. 2004) (requiring the Commission to
demonstrate “a reasonable likelihood that [defendants] would violate the securities laws in the
future”); Wisc. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (holding that “injunctive
relief in the federal courts” is not available unless the requesting party “provide[s] proof that the
harm has occurred in the past and is likely to occur again, or proof indicating that the harm is
certain to occur in the near future”).

“forfeiture and disgorgement are effectively synonymous”) with, e.g., SEC v. Kokesh, — F.3d
—, 2016 WL 4437585, at *6 (10th Cir. Aug. 23, 2016) (finding that “the disgorgement order in

“disgorgement” that Congress conferred in the Remedies Act, we conclude that disgorgement is
an equitable in personam remedy distinct from and not equivalent to what courts have held to be
the punitive in rem sanction of “forfeiture” to which Section 2462 applies.
The order of “accounting and disgorgement” that the Remedies Act authorizes us to enter
is a form of equitable relief. Courts have observed that accounting and disgorgement are
“essentially the same remedy,” 108 and an “accounting” is a traditional equitable remedy that
“ha[s] compelled wrongdoers to ‘disgorge’—i.e., account for and surrender—their ill-gotten
gains for centuries.” 109 The Supreme Court and the courts of appeals have likewise said that
disgorgement is an equitable remedy that prevents unjust enrichment and restores the status quo
ante.110 Indeed, the Supreme Court has long held that an order of disgorgement is “an equitable
adjunct to an injunction decree.” 111 And before Congress expressly authorized the Commission

to seek disgorgement, courts held that we could seek disgorgement “as ancillary relief in an
injunction action.” 112
We have also described our authority to order disgorgement in administrative
proceedings as “an equitable remedy designed to deprive wrongdoers of their unjust enrichment
and to deter others from similar misconduct.”113 The legislative history of the Remedies Act
supports this interpretation; Congress explained that disgorgement “merely requires the return of
wrongfully obtained profits.”114 And courts have held that disgorgement “establishes a personal
liability”115 that is not “limited to specific assets traced back to a violation.” 116 Accordingly, we
view disgorgement, as does the D.C. Circuit, as “an equitable obligation to return a sum equal to
the amount wrongfully obtained, rather than a requirement to replevy a specific asset.” 117 It is
an equitable remedy that imposes a personal liability on a defendant in the amount of his illgotten gains “regardless whether he retains the self-same proceeds of his wrongdoing.” 118
As discussed above, that disgorgement is an in personam remedy distinguishes it from
the in rem sanction of forfeiture. Indeed, interpreting disgorgement as requiring a defendant “to
disgorge only the actual assets unjustly received”—as in an in rem proceeding—“would lead to
absurd results.” 119 For example, “a defendant who was careful to spend all the proceeds of his
fraudulent scheme, while husbanding his other assets, would be immune from an order of
disgorgement.” 120 We do not believe Congress intended our ability to order disgorgement to be
so limited.121

enjoin violations of the securities laws appears to fit th[e] description” of an “equitable remedy”

the chancellor’s discretion to prevent unjust enrichment”).

Viewed consistently with this understanding, disgorgement is not what courts have held
to be “forfeiture” that is subject to Section 2462. Civil forfeiture is an in rem proceeding
“against the seized property itself.” 122 It arose from admiralty, customs, and criminal law, and
was used to recover contraband (such as smuggled goods) and instrumentalities (such as ships
used for smuggling). 123 Historically, therefore, civil forfeiture was used “to take ‘tangible
property used in criminal activity.’” 124 Indeed, the “legal fiction underlying civil forfeiture” is
that it is a proceeding “against ‘offending inanimate objects’ as defendants.” 125
As used in Section 2462, “forfeiture” is a legal term of art that is to be interpreted “in
light of [its] history” and has the “meaning generally accepted in the legal community at the time
of its enactment.”126 Forfeitures “historically have been understood, at least in part, as
punishment.”127 Indeed, the Supreme Court has held that Congress’s use of forfeiture in Section
2462 refers to a “punitive” sanction. 128 In contrast, disgorgement is “not punitive,”129 and its
purpose is “not to inflict punishment.”130 Disgorgement cannot be a punishment because we lack
discretion to order disgorgement that exceeds the amount obtained through the wrongdoing;
being required to disgorge only the amount by which one has been unjustly enriched is not

Forfeiture is also not limited to the direct proceeds of misconduct but includes unlimited
profits on such unlawful proceeds, i.e., secondary profits or profits on profits. 132 A respondent in
a Commission action cannot be ordered to disgorge any “income earned on ill-gotten profits.”133

Blatt, 583 F.2d at 1335 (distinguishing between “profits and interest wrongfully
obtained” that a defendant can be ordered to disgorge and “income earned on ill-gotten profits”
that he cannot be ordered to disgorge); accord SEC v. MacDonald, 699 F.2d 47, 53-54 (1st Cir.
1983) (en banc); SEC v. Manor Nursing Ctrs, Inc., 458 F.2d 1082, 1104 (2d Cir. 1972); see
generally L. Loss, J. Seligman & T. Paredes, Securities Regulation § 9.a (2014) (discussing Blatt
and Manor Nursing, and explaining that courts can require disgorgement of fraud proceeds and
interest thereon, not “profits earned on these proceeds”). This distinction explains why there is
an express time limit on forfeitures but not disgorgement. It is sensible to impose an express
time limit for seeking forfeiture of not only wrongfully obtained assets but all profits derived
therefrom because such profits from subsequent enterprises could otherwise multiply without
bound. But that rationale does not warrant imposing a time limit on disgorgement, because a
defendant cannot be ordered to disgorge more than the value of the initial proceeds of his
wrongdoing, even if he subsequently obtains profits from those proceeds.
Prejudgment interest on ill-gotten gains does not constitute profits on those ill-gotten
gains. Prejudgment interest is only the “time value of money” that was initially obtained from
the securities law violation. SEC v. Koenig, 557 F.3d 736, 745 (7th Cir. 2009). The Eleventh
Circuit accordingly distinguishes between “profits and interest wrongfully obtained” that a
defendant can be ordered to disgorge and “income earned on ill-gotten profits” that he cannot be
ordered to disgorge. Blatt, 583 F.2d at 1335. And unlike forfeiture, a defendant pays
prejudgment interest at a set rate even if his actual profits on proceeds exceed that rate. In any
event, prejudgment interest is not mandatory; a court has equitable jurisdiction to order
disgorgement without prejudgment interest. See SEC v. First Jersey Sec., Inc., 101 F.3d 1450,
1476-77 (2d Cir. 1996). An award of prejudgment interest is, therefore, not punitive but rather is
compensatory in nature. SEC v. Lauer, 478 F. App’x 550, 557 (11th Cir. 2012). We address the
imposition of prejudgment interest below. See infra notes 189-190.

30
language, but rather serves the broader purposes of equity.” 134 That makes it unlike forfeiture,
which is sometimes mandatory, and always must be carried out in strict accordance with the
terms of the authorizing statute. 135 Indeed, in a case decided soon after the direct predecessors of
Section 2462 were enacted, the Supreme Court distinguished between an “accounting for profits”
and “forfeiture,” holding that a court’s equity powers included ordering the former but not the
latter.136
Ultimately, we conclude disgorgement is not synonymous with forfeiture. As such, our
interpretation of disgorgement “does not fit” within the meaning of forfeiture in Section 2462.137
Consequently, consistent with the longstanding recognition that disgorgement is an equitable and
non-punitive remedy, the clear weight of authority supports our conclusion that Section 2462’s
statute of limitations does not apply to disgorgement. 138
By concluding that disgorgement “is a forfeiture” and thus falls within Section 2462, the
Eleventh Circuit’s conclusion in Graham139 is therefore in tension not only with the decisions of

law by those seeking forfeiture must be required.”).

“forfeiture.” Kaley v. United States, 134 S. Ct. 1090, 1102 n.11 (2014); see also Contorinis, 743
F.3d at 306-07 (distinguishing between disgorgement and forfeiture). And although the Supreme
Court once described forfeiture as resulting in a “disgorgement of the fruits of illegal conduct,”
United States v. Ursery, 518 U.S. 267, 284 (1996), the distinct remedy of disgorgement was not
at issue in Ursery.

numerous courts of appeals but also with our interpretation of disgorgement. 140 It is also in
tension with the Eleventh Circuit’s prior precedent that disgorgement is equitable. 141 Indeed,
Graham itself recognized that “[S]ection 2462 does not apply to equitable remedies.” 142
Moreover, Graham does not address the “statutory context” and “well-established
background principle[s]” that demonstrate why Congress distinguished forfeiture from
disgorgement.143 Rather, it relied on modern dictionary definitions of forfeiture and
disgorgement and rejected potential alternative definitions that did not support its ultimate
conclusion.144 The dictionaries at the time Section 2462 and its antecedents were enacted,
however, include definitions of forfeiture that do not apply to disgorgement. 145 And the
dictionaries Graham cited also defined forfeiture as “the divesting of the ownership of particular
property,”146 which is inconsistent with our interpretation of disgorgement as an obligation to
return a sum equal to the ill-gotten gains rather than a requirement to replevy a specific asset.
Based on our interpretation, we believe that the decisions in Kokesh and Riordan correctly held
that disgorgement is not a “forfeiture” covered by Section 2462147 and respectfully disagree with
Graham’s contrary conclusion and reasoning. 148

See also Saltsman, 2016 WL 4136829, at *25 (disagreeing with Graham because

In addition to relying on Graham, Grossman contends that the Supreme Court’s decision
in Gabelli requires us to hold that disgorgement is subject to Section 2462. 149 But Gabelli held
only that the discovery rule cannot toll an action by the Commission for civil penalties and stated
explicitly that it was not addressing disgorgement. 150 In addition, Gabelli held that Section 2462
reaches only remedies that are “intended to punish”;151 neither disgorgement nor the other
equitable remedies at issue here have that purpose. For these reasons, we do not understand
Gabelli even to suggest, let alone to hold, that Section 2462 applies to disgorgement.
Grossman also cites case law holding that “disgorgement may not be used punitively,”152
and offers arguments as to why he believes it is punitive here. The principle he cites, however, is
(…continued)
Circuit’s interpretation of a statute was not “binding law in this circuit” and could not “trump”
agency’s interpretation because the Ninth Circuit had not held the statute to be unambiguous).
We observe further that although Grossman could seek review of our decision in this case
in the Eleventh Circuit—as the court of appeals for the circuit in which he resides or has his
principal place of business—our administrative orders also may be appealed to the D.C. Circuit.
See 15 U.S.C. §§ 77i(a), 78y(a)(1), 80a-42(a), 80b-13(a). Given this choice of forum, we issue
our administrative orders without knowing in advance which court of appeals will consider any
petition for review that may be filed. See Johnson v. R.R. Ret. Bd., 969 F.2d 1082, 1092 (D.C.
Cir. 1992) (where adverse authority exists in a circuit, still the agency “should have a reasonable
opportunity to persuade other circuits to reach a contrary conclusion”); Samuel Estreicher and
Richard L. Revesz, Nonacquiescence by Federal Administrative Agencies, 98 Yale L. J. 679, 687
(1989) (explaining agency decisions when “the identity of the reviewing court [is] uncertain at
the time the agency makes its decision”); cf. United States v. Mendoza, 464 U.S. 154, 160, 163
(1984) (explaining that relitigation across circuits ensures that a “final decision rendered” by one
circuit does not “freeze[]” “important questions of law”).
149

Grossman also argues that disgorgement is a “penalty” within the meaning of Section
2462. But the Supreme Court long ago foreclosed the position that disgorgement is intrinsically
punitive. Sheldon, 309 U.S. at 399 (holding that disgorgement’s purpose is not to “punish[] but
. . . to prevent an unjust enrichment”); see also Zacharias, 569 F.3d at 471-72 (concluding that
disgorgement is not a “penalty” under Section 2462). And the legislative history of the
Remedies Act stated explicitly that disgorgement “does not result in any actual economic
penalty.” H.R. Rep. No. 101-616, 1990 WL 256464. Disgorgement is therefore also not a “fine”
under Section 2462; the terms “fine” and “penalty” in Section 2462 “mean precisely the same
thing.” In re Landsberg, 14 F. Cas. 1065, 1067 (E.D. Mich. 1870). As we noted above,
however, the amount ordered to be disgorged may not exceed the reasonable approximation of
ill-gotten gains causally linked to the wrongdoing. See supra note 131 and accompanying text.

simply another way of defining disgorgement: we would exceed our authority to impose
“disgorgement” if we ordered Grossman to give up more than a reasonable approximation of illgotten gains causally linked to the wrongdoing. 153 We address such arguments below.154
Even though we conclude that the equitable remedy of disgorgement is not subject to a
statute of limitations, this does not mean that the passage of time is irrelevant to our
consideration of whether to impose this remedy. The Commission “can and should consider the
remoteness of the defendant’s past violations in deciding whether to grant” equitable sanctions,
including disgorgement. 155 As with Grossman’s other arguments about the appropriateness of
disgorgement, we address the passage of time below. 156
C.

An industry bar, a cease-and-desist order, and disgorgement are in the public
interest.

Having concluded that Section 2462 does not prohibit us from imposing an industry bar,
a cease-and-desist order, or disgorgement, we find those remedies are in the public interest here.
1.

Industry Bar

We may suspend or bar Grossman from associating with an investment adviser, broker,
dealer, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized
statistical rating organization under Advisers Act Section 203(f) if we find that: (i) he was
associated with an investment adviser during the relevant period; (ii) he willfully violated, or
willfully aided and abetted the violation of, the Advisers Act or its rules; and (iii) the sanction is
in the public interest.157 In addition, if we find that the latter two elements have been established,
we may also suspend or bar Grossman from associating with a broker or dealer under Section
15(b)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 158 Finally, we may prohibit Grossman from
certain associations with an investment company under Section 9(b) of the Investment Company
Act if (i) he willfully violated or willfully aided and abetted violations of certain other provisions
of the securities laws, and (ii) the sanction is in the public interest. 159 Grossman does not dispute

34
that he associated with an investment adviser, and we have found above that he did so; he also
does not dispute that his violations were willful, and we find that they were.160
In determining whether a bar would serve the public interest, we consider the
egregiousness of Grossman’s actions, the isolated or recurrent nature of the infraction, the degree
of scienter involved, Grossman’s recognition of the wrongful nature of his conduct, the sincerity
of his assurances against future violations, and the likelihood that his occupation will present
opportunities for future violations.161 Our inquiry is flexible, and no one factor is dispositive. 162
Nonetheless, the “degree of risk [that the respondent] poses to the public” and the extent of the
respondent’s “unfitness to serve the investing public” are central considerations to our
analysis.163 Applying this framework, we conclude that an industry bar is in the public interest.
Grossman’s conduct was egregious. Grossman was acting in a fiduciary capacity in
which he had a duty to disclose material facts and not benefit himself “except to the extent
provided for by fees and compensation the client expressly consents to pay.”164 Grossman
breached his duty by repeatedly failing to disclose his receipt of referral and consulting fees paid
out of clients’ investments. He recommended funds that would enrich himself at his clients’
expense. Because “[t]he securities industry presents continual opportunities for dishonesty and
abuse, and depends heavily on the integrity of its participants and on investors’ confidence,” we
have treated fraud as “especially serious and subject to the severest of sanctions under the
securities laws.”165 We conclude that Grossman’s efforts to defraud his clients and abuse their
trust demonstrate that he lacks the competence and requisite professional ethics required for him
to meet these standards and operate as a fiduciary. 166
160

In this context, a person acts willfully if in undertaking the acts that make up the violation
he “knows what he is doing,” even if he does not know “that he is breaking the law.” Wonsover
v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000). One who acts with scienter also acts willfully.

Grossman’s violations were also recurrent. Between 2003 and 2008, he repeatedly
recommended that clients invest in the Battoo Funds without disclosing that those investments
generated referral and consulting fees that would enrich him at the clients’ expense.
Grossman also acted with a high degree of scienter.167 As discussed above, Grossman
intentionally misled clients to enrich himself. And Grossman’s response to OCIE’s deficiency
letter further demonstrates his scienter. That letter notified Grossman that his conduct was
wrongful and gave him an opportunity to cure his misrepresentations. Instead, Grossman failed
to fix some deficient disclosures, made new misleading ones, and falsely told OCIE that he had
fixed the problem. Grossman also could not have reasonably interpreted the letter’s instruction
that he “may also need to amend [the] ADV Part II” as tacitly providing him with permission to
misleadingly disclose that he “may” receive fees, instead of disclosing that he was receiving fees.
Grossman’s response to the letter lacked any rational justification other than an intent to mislead
his clients.
Grossman’s response to OCIE’s letter further demonstrates that he poses a risk to the
public because he “did not feel bound by the law.”168 Nor has Grossman assuaged our concerns,
for he has made no assurances against future misconduct. Grossman says he “is not associated
with Sovereign or the Sovereign Entities and Sovereign has since been dissolved and is no longer
in existence,” but he has not disclaimed any intent to associate with the securities industry.169
Grossman contends that he presents a low degree of risk to the public, but in our view his
current occupation demonstrates a considerable risk. Grossman retains ownership and control
over SIPS, an IRA administrator that handles “paperwork, contributions [and] distributions” for
IRAs. Grossman’s fraud involved receiving undisclosed kickbacks from hedge funds in
exchange for advising investors with offshore retirement accounts to invest in those same funds.
During the time he was committing this fraud, he owned and operated Sovereign and SIPS
together. SIPS was an avenue through which he was able to develop client relationships for his
advisory business. His clients testified that they thought SIPS was the same company as the
investment advisory business. Although Grossman is no longer associated with an adviser, he
continues to interact directly with the investing public through SIPS. Absent a bar, there would
be nothing to prevent Grossman from offering advisory services to his SIPS clients or others in
167

In assessing Grossman’s competence and risk to the public, scienter is “highly relevant to
a determination of whether the defendant has the propensity to commit future violations.” SEC
v. Spectrum, Ltd., 489 F.2d 535, 542 (2d Cir. 1973) (addressing injunctive relief).

First City Fin. Corp., 890 F.2d at 1229 (holding that evidence that a defendant “did not
feel bound by the law” is appropriately considered in determining appropriate relief).
Grossman’s settlement of a client’s arbitration has limited probative value regarding his risk to
the public. Cf. Fisher v. Kelly, 105 F.3d 350, 353 (7th Cir. 1997) (noting that settlements can
occur for reasons “wholly unrelated to the substance and issues involved in the litigation”).

the future—or from seeking to reassociate with the industry in addition to running his IRA
administration business. 170 Imposing an industry bar would therefore prevent Grossman from
expanding his IRA administration business into the advisory business he previously ran in
parallel with SIPS and thus limit his opportunities to defraud investors in the future. 171
The facts demonstrate that barring Grossman from the securities industry is in the public
interest. We therefore bar him from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser,
municipal securities dealer, or transfer agent, and we prohibit him from serving or acting as an
employee, officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser or depositor of, or
principal underwriter for, a registered investment company or affiliated person of such
investment adviser, depositor, or principal underwriter. 172
2.

Cease and Desist Order

We also find that a cease-and-desist order is in the public interest. Section 8A(a) of the
Securities Act, Section 21C(a) of the Exchange Act, and Section 203(k) of the Advisers Act
authorize us to impose a cease-and-desist order for violations of those Acts or the rules or
regulations thereunder. 173 In deciding whether to impose a cease-and-desist order, we consider
the public interest factors discussed above, whether there is a reasonable likelihood of future
violations174 and “‘whether the violation is recent, the degree of harm to investors or the
marketplace resulting from the violation, and the remedial function to be served by the ceaseand-desist order in the context of any other sanctions being sought in the same proceedings.’”175
Each of the relevant public interest factors discussed above establishes that a cease-anddesist order is in the public interest. Grossman’s continued interaction with investors as an IRA

Grossman contends that his case is like those in which suspensions and officer-anddirector bars were found to be “punitive” absent evidence of a risk of future harm. See Bartek,
484 F. App’x at 957; Johnson, 87 F.3d at 489. But we find abundant evidence that Grossman
poses a risk to investors and that a bar is necessary to protect the public and in the public interest.

We decline to bar Grossman from associating with a municipal advisor or nationally
recognized statistical rating organization pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010), because the conduct at
issue all took place prior to July 22, 2010, the effective date of Dodd-Frank. See Koch v. SEC,

administrator compounds the risk of future violations. Grossman’s violations are also recent
enough to justify preventative relief given our assessment of the public interest factors, the
remedial function served by the need to protect the public in the future, and the unquestionable
harm to investors.176

Disgorgement

Securities Act Section 8A(e), Exchange Act Section 21C(e), and Advisers Act Section
203(k)(5) authorize disgorgement, including reasonable interest, in a cease-and-desist
proceeding.177 “[T]he amount of disgorgement should include all gains flowing from the illegal
activities”;178 disgorgement must “be a reasonable approximation of profits causally connected to
the violation.”179
There is a causal connection between Grossman’s receipt of certain ill-gotten fees and his
violations for failing to disclose his receipt of those fees. Between August 2003 and October
2008, Grossman concealed a significant conflict of interest from his advisory clients—his receipt
of referral and consulting fees from the Battoo Funds—in violation of his fiduciary duties and
various antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. During that same time period, he
received $3,407,765.66 in referral and consulting fees. Grossman admitted that he only used his
foreign bank account—from which the Division calculated the $3.4 million figure—for receiving
fees from the Battoo Funds. And he does not contest that the figure includes only those fees that
the Battoo Funds paid to the account.
Equitable considerations nonetheless lead us to find that disgorgement should be offset
by Grossman’s settlement of an arbitration brought by a Sovereign client. Although a
respondent’s settlement of private litigation will not always affect disgorgement, “[a] settlement

176

Some courts have expressed disfavor toward obey-the-law injunctions that specify only
the statutes that the defendant must refrain from violating in the future. See SEC v. Goble, 682
F.3d 934, 950 (11th Cir. 2012); Graham, 2016 WL 3033605, at *3 n.2. We have previously
concluded that the holding in Goble, based on an interpretation of Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 65(d), applies only to district court actions involving “‘injunctions’ and ‘restraining
orders,” and “not cease-and-desist orders issued in Commission administrative proceedings.”

177

15 U.S.C. §§ 77h-1(e), 78u-3(e), 80b-3(k)(5). The OIP also instituted proceedings to
determine whether we should exercise our authority to impose disgorgement as part of a civil
penalty action. Compare id. §§ 78u-2(e), 80a-9(e), 80b-3(j). We do not rely on that authority
here because we have held that a civil penalty is time barred.

payment may . . . be taken into account . . . in calculating the amount to be disgorged.”180
Because the claims at issue in the arbitration overlap with Grossman’s violations, we conclude as
an equitable matter that the amount of disgorgement, if any, should be reduced by $403,585.01,
the amount he paid to settle the arbitration.
We “can and should consider the remoteness of the defendant’s past violations” in
deciding whether to order disgorgement.181 We conclude that Grossman should disgorge his illgotten gains notwithstanding the passage of time between his violations and this proceeding. We
find that, contrary to Grossman’s suggestion, the passage of time has not rendered unreliable, or
resulted in the loss of, evidence relevant to disgorgement. Grossman points to several instances
of supposedly lost or stale evidence, but none of these helps his case:


Grossman complains that Battoo was unavailable because he fled to Switzerland
before the OIP was filed. Yet there is no reason to believe that Battoo would have
helped Grossman’s case. To the contrary, the record demonstrates that Battoo
was evasive with Grossman even toward the end of their fraud.



Grossman argues that the passage of time made him unable to recall certain
details.182 But to the extent that these details play any role in our decision to
impose sanctions, the relevant facts appear elsewhere in the record. And although
Grossman complains of clients’ inconsistent testimony, the record demonstrates
that clients consistently testified that Sovereign did not disclose its fees.



Grossman says that the ALJ should not have relied upon the deposition of client
Stephen Richards or the written testimony of client James Davidson. But
Grossman did not object to the admission of their testimony. 183 In any event, our
de novo review cures any potential evidentiary error, and we are able to reach the
same conclusion about the amount of disgorgement and the connection his
violation even in the absence of this testimony.

(E.D. Pa. 1976) (recognizing that a wrongdoer sued on “the same allegations as those made by
the SEC” may establish that he has “already relinquished [his] ill-gotten gains” in a settlement).

Grossman could not recall the funds’ composition; when he received Anchor’s financial
statements; the circumstances of the investment adviser public disclosure effective through
December 31, 2011, bearing his name; or whether he received a client email in September 2008.
183

See Rule of Practice 321(a), 17 C.F.R. § 201.321(a) (requiring objections to admission of
evidence be made on the record). Grossman reserved objections made during the deposition, but
renews none of them here in arguing that the ALJ should not have relied on the testimony at all.

39
Grossman next invokes Joseph J. Barbato184 in arguing that the amount of disgorgement
ordered by the ALJ must be reduced to reflect only those clients who testified in order to
establish “a causal relationship with the alleged violations.” In Barbato, we limited
disgorgement to amounts traceable to “customers who testified,” because the relevant
violations—making unsuitable recommendations and churning—necessarily involved “specific
and particular facts about” whether the recommendations were appropriate or the clients had
consented to the trades. 185 Unlike in Barbato, Grossman violated his fiduciary duty to each and
every one of his clients by failing to disclose his referral and consulting agreements. Grossman
made no disclosures to any clients, thus establishing the required causal link between all the
undisclosed fees that he received and his Securities Act and Advisers Act violations for failing to
disclose his fee arrangements. 186 Because these violations fully support an order disgorging
those fees, we need not address Grossman’s separate arguments that disgorgement cannot be
independently supported by his other violations of the securities laws.
Finally, Grossman says that disgorgement of all his ill-gotten gains should be reduced by
his payment of $1.37 million in taxes to the IRS on those ill-gotten gains. But it is well settled
that disgorgement will not be reduced because the wrongdoer has paid an ordinary tax
liability.187 Grossman must seek from the IRS, not us, any relief from the taxes he says he paid
on the ill-gotten gains that we are now ordering disgorged. 188

income tax”); see also SEC v. Orr, 2012 WL 1327786, at *8 (D. Kan. Apr. 17, 2012). Because
this is a well-settled feature of the calculation of a reasonable approximation of ill-gotten gains,
Grossman is incorrect that this feature makes disgorgement “punitive” under Section 2462.

For these reasons, we order Grossman to disgorge his net ill-gotten gains of

Internal Revenue Code 189 and compounded quarterly. 190
