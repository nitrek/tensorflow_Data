In the Matter of
JONATHAN WARREN BROOKS,
Respondent.

I.
On November 2, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”)
instituted proceedings pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(“Exchange Act”) and Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”)
against Jonathan Warren Brooks (“Respondent”).
II.
Respondent has submitted an Offer of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has
determined to accept. Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings
brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, Respondent
admits the Commission’s jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of these proceedings, and the
findings contained in paragraphs A.1, B.1 and B.2 below, and consents to the entry of this Order
Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions Pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, (“Order”), as
set forth below.
III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that:

A.

RESPONDENT

1.
Respondent, 43 years old, is currently incarcerated in a state correctional institution
in Kershaw, South Carolina. He was a registered investment adviser representative of J. Brooks
Financial, which was registered as an investment adviser in South Carolina (South Carolina
registration approved in January 2011 and terminated in February 2013) from September 2010 to
February 2013. Respondent was a registered representative associated with High Street Securities,
Inc., which was registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer (SEC registration number 852657 approved in May 2001 and terminated in January 2014) from November 2011 to November
2012 and with Sicor Securities, Inc., which was registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer
(SEC registration number 8-33445 approved in April 1985 and terminated in December 2013) from
September 2009 to November 2011. Thus, for a portion of the time in which he engaged in the
conduct underlying the indictments described below, Respondent was a registered investment
adviser representative associated with a state registered investment adviser; and a registered
representative associated with two broker-dealers that were then registered with the Commission.
Respondent held Series 6, 7, 63, and 65 licenses. During the periods of Brooks’ association with
Sicor Securities, Inc., the broker-dealer was also registered as an investment adviser with several
states.
B.

ENTRY OF RESPONDENT’S CRIMINAL CONVICTION

1.
On September 18, 2014, Respondent pleaded guilty to three felony counts
of securities fraud and two felony counts of forgery in the Court of General Sessions of Aiken
County, South Carolina. The State vs. Jonathan Warren Brooks, South Carolina case numbers:
2013-GS-02-1175; 2013-GS-02-1176; 2013-GS-02-1318; 2013-GS-02-1803; and 2013-GS-021432. On the same day, the court sentenced Respondent to fourteen years in prison followed by
five years of probation and ordered him to pay $6,403,321.07 in restitution. South Carolina’s
prisoner database showed that Respondent’s incarceration began on September 19, 2014.
2.
The counts of the criminal indictments to which Respondent pleaded guilty
alleged, among other things, that from approximately January 2010 to approximately March 2013,
Respondent obtained money by means of willful fraud (including selling investments in a fictional
entity, improperly diverting investor funds, and making false representations to the South Carolina
Securities Commissioner) and forgery (forging signatures to facilitate money transfers).
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to
impose the sanctions agreed to in Respondent’s Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED pursuant to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act and
Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act, that Respondent Brooks be, and hereby is:

2

barred from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities
dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating
organization; and
barred from participating in any offering of a penny stock, including: acting as a promoter,
finder, consultant, agent or other person who engages in activities with a broker, dealer or
issuer for purposes of the issuance or trading in any penny stock, or inducing or attempting
to induce the purchase or sale of any penny stock.
Any reapplication for association by Respondent will be subject to the applicable laws and
regulations governing the reentry process, and reentry may be conditioned upon a number of
factors, including, but not limited to, the satisfaction of any or all of the following: (a) any
disgorgement ordered against Respondent, whether or not the Commission has fully or partially
waived payment of such disgorgement; (b) any arbitration award related to the conduct that served
as the basis for the Commission order; (c) any self-regulatory organization arbitration award to a
customer, whether or not related to the conduct that served as the basis for the Commission order;
and (d) any restitution order by a self-regulatory organization, whether or not related to the conduct
that served as the basis for the Commission order.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Brent J. Fields
Secretary
