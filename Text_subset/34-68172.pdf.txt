In the Matter of

EXTENSION ORDER

The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has requested an extension of time, until
May 15, 2013, to submit a proposed Plan of Distribution under Rule 1101(a) of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans.
In its request, the Division states that since the issuance of the Commission’s
September 10, 2012, Order Instituting Administrative Proceedings pursuant to Section 15(b)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of
1940, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions (“Order”) against JP Turner and
Company, LLC (“JP Turner”) and its former president, William L. Mello, for their failure to
establish policies and procedures designed to prevent and detect the churning of customers’
accounts (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 67808 (September 10, 2012)), the Division
has learned that some of the customers harmed by the violations described in the Order have
entered into private arbitrations with JP Turner. The Division expects that any settlements
reached at the conclusion of these arbitrations will affect the Division’s distribution. The
Division therefore requires an extension of time to submit a proposed Plan of Distribution.

Accordingly, for good cause shown, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Division’s
request for an extension of time until May 15, 2013, to submit a proposed Plan of Distribution
is granted.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Elizabeth M. Murphy
Secretary
