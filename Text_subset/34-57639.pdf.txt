________________________:
On February 15, 2008, the Commission published a “Notice of Proposed
Distribution Plan and Opportunity for Comment” (“Notice”), Securities Exchange Act of
1934 Release No. 57341, in connection with this proceeding pursuant to Rule 1103 of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1103. This
Notice advised interested parties that they could obtain a copy of a proposed plan of
distribution of monies placed into a Fair Fund authorized by the Commission in the above
matter (“Distribution Plan”), by printing a copy of the proposed Distribution Plan from
the Commission’s public website or Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc.’s (“Ameriprise”)
public website or by submitting a written request to Junaid A. Zubairi in the
Commission’s Chicago Regional Office.
The Notice also advised that all persons desiring to comment on the Distribution
Plan could submit their views to the Commission, in writing, no later than March 17,
2008. The Commission has received no comments on the Distribution Plan.
As stated in the Distribution Plan, the Fair Fund will be distributed to investors
according to the pro rata shares determined by the methodology described in the Plan.
Investors eligible to receive a distribution from the Fair Fund are Ameriprise customers
who purchased shares of mutual funds or 529 college savings plans from certain
Preferred Provider or Select Group fund families between January 1, 2001 and August
31, 2004. Customers who have a current and active account with Ameriprise will
receive an electronic credit directly into their existing Ameriprise account. Customers
who no longer have an active account with Ameriprise will receive a physical check
through the mail at the best address found after comparing a customer’s last known
address in Ameriprise’s records with any addresses located through an address validation

system. The Distribution Plan also provides that additional procedures will be applied to
locate current addresses for customers whose checks are returned as “undeliverable” and
for any customers whose checks over $50 have not been cashed within 90 days from the
date the checks were issued.
The Division of Enforcement proposes that the Commission approve the
Distribution Plan submitted by Ameriprise as written, appoint Nelson S. Kibler as the
Fund Administrator of the Distribution Plan, and waive the bond requirement of the Fund
Administrator for the good cause shown in the Plan.
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED pursuant to Rule 1104 of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1104, that
the Distribution Plan is approved.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, pursuant to Rules 1105(a) and (c) of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1105, that
Nelson S. Kibler is appointed as the Fund Administrator of the Distribution Plan in
accordance with the terms of the Distribution Plan, and that the bond is waived for good
cause shown.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Nancy M. Morris
Secretary
