DEFAULT PRACTICE)
AND OPPORTUNITY
FOR COMMENT

Notice is hereby given, pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s (“Commission”) Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 CFR
201.1103, that the Division of Enforcement has submitted to the Commission a proposed plan
for the distribution of monies paid in the above-captioned matter.
On November 16, 2012, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist
Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order
(“Order”) against Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (“Credit Suisse”), DLJ Mortgage
Capital, Inc., Credit Suisse First Boston Mortgage Acceptance Corp., Credit Suisse First
Boston Mortgage Securities Corp., and Asset Backed Securities Corporation (“Asset Backed
Securities”) (collectively, “Respondents”). 1 The Order stated that Credit Suisse and affiliated
entities made omissions of material facts and failed to comply with offering documents in
transactions for which Respondents sponsored and/or underwrote residential mortgage backed
securities. The Commission simultaneously accepted Respondents’ offers of settlement,
whereby Respondents agreed to pay disgorgement of $55,747,769, prejudgment interest of
$13,000,000, and a civil money penalty in the amount of $33,000,000 for violations relating to
the Bulk Settlements Practice, and Credit Suisse and an affiliate, Asset Backed Securities,
agreed to pay disgorgement of $10,056,561, prejudgment interest of $2,200,000, and a civil

Securities Act Rel. No. 9368 (Nov. 16, 2012).

money penalty in the amount of $6,000,000 for violations relating to the First Payment
Default (“FPD”) Practice.
The Order provided that, pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley act of
2002, as amended, two separate fair funds may be created for the disgorgement, interest and
penalties paid by Respondents. This Notice refers solely to the fair fund to be created by an
order of the Commission in conjunction with the request for Commission approval of the
Proposed Plan of Distribution (“Plan”) for the First Payment Default Practice (“Fair Fund”).

OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMENT
Pursuant to this Notice, all interested parties are advised that they may obtain a copy of
the Plan from the Commission’s public website, http://www.sec.gov. Interested parties may

THE DISTRIBUTION PLAN
The Fair Fund will be comprised of the amounts of disgorgement ($10,056,561),
prejudgment interest ($2,200,000), and civil monetary penalty ($6,000,000) paid by
Respondents Credit Suisse and Asset Backed Securities, plus any accumulated interest. The
Plan provides for compensation to investors in residential mortgage backed securities trusts
(“RMBS Trusts”) harmed by Credit Suisse’s misrepresentations and omissions in its offering
materials regarding the FPD Practice. As set forth in the Plan, the proposed methodology
allocates the Fair Fund amongst the RMBS Trusts based on the proportion of mortgage
collateral in each Trust that was originated by a specific Originator. The funds are then
allocated to each Trust’s eligible claimants based on the proportion of their claim to all other
eligible claims for the Trust.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Deputy Secretary
