JEFFREY A. SEIDEL,
and
ROBERT R. KAMISCHKE,
Respondents.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that ceaseand-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act
of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange
Act”), against Ener1, Inc., Charles L. Gassenheimer, Jeffrey A. Seidel, and Robert R. Kamischke
(collectively “Respondents”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondents have submitted Offers
of Settlement (“Offers”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the purpose

of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to
which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as
to the Commission’s jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these proceedings, which are
admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V., Respondents consent to the entry of this
Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of
1933 and Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a
Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.
III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offers, the Commission finds1 that:
Summary
Ener1, Inc. was formerly a NASDAQ-listed U.S. company that designed, manufactured,
and developed lithium ion batteries for transportation, grid energy, and consumer products. Ener1
committed violations of the federal securities laws resulting in materially overstated earnings and
assets for year-end 2010 as well as the first quarter of 2011. It did so by: (1) not impairing at yearend 2010 its investments in the equity of an unconsolidated related-party entity of which it had
48% voting rights; (2) improperly recognizing revenue from sales of batteries to that entity during
the fourth quarter of 2010; and (3) not properly assessing the collectability of its loan and accounts
receivables from that entity to determine whether those assets were impaired at year-end 2010 and
end of the first quarter of 2011. Ener1 materially misstated its financial statements because its
management did not appropriately analyze the impairment issues and because senior management
did not communicate certain facts relevant to an impairment analysis to Ener1’s accounting staff
and external auditor. Ener1 lacked sufficient procedures and staff to determine the relevant U.S.
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) as well as accounting internal controls to
obtain necessary information to apply GAAP. In the course of the foregoing, Respondents
committed various violations of the federal securities law as cited herein.
Respondents
1.
Ener1, Inc. (“Ener1”) was, at all relevant times, headquartered in New York with
offices in Indiana and Florida (was a Florida corporation, founded in 1985) and was a public, USbased company that designed, manufactured and developed lithium ion batteries for transportation,
grid energy, and consumer products. On December 2, 2011, the NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC,
filed a Form 25 notice of delisting of Ener1’s common stock from the NASDAQ market and
terminating its registration obligation under Section 12(b) pursuant to Section 12(d) of the
Exchange Act. On January 26, 2012, Ener1 filed for bankruptcy. On March 30, 2012, Ener1 filed
a Form 15 notice of deregistration of its securities from registration under Section 12(g) and
suspension of duty to file reports under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. As of that day,
it emerged from bankruptcy as a private company.

2.
Charles L. Gassenheimer (“Gassenheimer” or “Respondent”), age 42, of Glen
Head, New York, was at all times relevant the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Board
Chairman of Ener1. He became an Ener1 Director in 2006, Board Chair in 2007, and CEO in
2008. Gassenheimer also became the CEO and Director of Ener1 Group, Inc. As CEO,
Gassenheimer signed the certifications associated with Ener1’s Form 10-K for the year-ended
December 31, 2010 and the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2011.
3.
Jeffrey A. Seidel (“Seidel” or “Respondent”), age 53, of New Canaan,
Connecticut, was Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) of Ener1 from September 2010 to October
2011. Seidel joined Ener1 as Vice President for Corporate Strategy in 2008 and became Ener1’s
Chief Strategy Officer in January 2010. Seidel has never been a CPA. As CFO, Seidel signed the
certifications associated with Ener1’s Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2010 and the
Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2011.
4.
Robert R. Kamischke (“Kamischke” or “Respondent”), age 61, of Fenton,
Michigan, was the Chief Accounting Officer (“CAO”) of Ener1 and CFO of Ener1 subsidiary,

had joined Ener1 in November 2008 as Controller of the Ener1 subsidiary, EnerDel, Inc. and
focused on implementing project controls, budget, planning, and cost systems. As CAO,
Kamischke signed the certifications associated with Ener1’s Form 10-K for the year-ended
December 31, 2010 and the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2011.
Other Relevant Parties
5.
Think Holdings, AS, a private Norwegian limited liability company, was majority
owner of Think Global, AS (which are collectively referred to as “Think”). Think Global was an
electric car manufacturer. Think filed for bankruptcy protection in 2006 and again in 2008. It
emerged from the 2008 bankruptcy in 2009 through a debt settlement entered into by Ener1, a
third-party contract manufacturer for Think, a Norwegian government investment fund, and others.
After its emergence from bankruptcy, Gassenheimer became a Think Holdings, AS, Director in
2009 and Think Holdings Board Chairman in 2010. On June 22, 2011, Think Global again filed
for bankruptcy.
FACTS
A. The Financial Statements Contained in Ener1’s 2010 Form 10-K Did Not Conform with
GAAP
6.
During the period relevant to this Order, January 1, 2010 through June 22, 2011
(“Relevant Period”), Ener1 was a manufacturer of lithium batteries for various purposes including
electric cars. During this time, one of its largest customers was Think, a manufacturer of electric
cars. Ener1 not only supplied batteries to Think but also had voting rights for almost 50% of its
equity and held loan and accounts receivables from Think. In its Form 10-K for the year-ended
December 31, 2010 filed on March 10, 2011, Ener1 reported an equity investment in Think of
$58.6 million, which represented 15 percent of Ener1’s $396.5 million in total assets, and 48%
voting interest in Think; accounts receivable from Think of $13.6 million ($8.5 mm past due),
which represented three percent of Ener1’s assets; loans receivable from Think totaling $14.0
3

million, which represented 3.5 percent of Ener1’s assets; and sales to Think of $18.8 million,
representing 24% of Ener1’s 2010 revenue of $77 million.
7.
At December 31, 2010, as described above, Ener1’s investment in Think was $58.6
million, Ener1’s accounts receivable from Think was $13.6 million, Ener1’s loans receivable from
Think was $14.0 million and sales to Think were $18.8 million. On March 10, 2011, Ener1 filed
its Form 10-K for 2010. Gassenheimer, Seidel, and Kamischke signed the Form 10-K and
provided certifications pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
8.
The financial statements contained in Ener1’s 2010 Form 10-K did not conform
with GAAP in several ways thereby causing material misstatements in the 2010 Form 10-K
concerning Ener1’s financial results. The financial statements did not conform with GAAP
because Respondents did not take into account the deteriorating financial condition of Think as
detailed below when determining whether to impair the assets associated with Think as well as the
revenue derived from sales to Think.
1. Think’s Deteriorating Financial Condition
9.
Ener1 had purchased Think B shares in several tranches at Norwegian Kroner
(“NOK”) 10 per share, the last of which had been purchased by May of 2010. The May 2010
financing was projected to “fully finance” Think until the end of 2010. However, during the third
week of September, 2010, Think informed Gassenheimer, who was serving as Think’s Chairman
and Ener1’s CEO at the time, that the company’s previous estimates regarding cash and inventory
were inaccurate. Instead of $14.3 million in cash projected to be on hand as of September 2010,
Think had negative $2 million, and instead of $13.6 million in inventory, the company had $24.4
million due to accounting errors and mistakes in accounting for inventory.
10.
Due to its cash constraints, Think could not pay creditors. Think sought immediate
funding from prior investors, including Ener1, through two rounds of funding in September and
December of 2010, which ultimately fell short of covering Think’s financial needs. In 2010, Think
had also retained an investment firm “to act as its lead placement agent in connection with the sale
of its equity or equity-linked securities.” Due in part to Think’s cash issues, the investment firm
postponed its efforts to introduce Think to possible investors until January 2011.
11.
On January 12, 2011, Ener1 management emailed Think management (copied to
Kamischke, Seidel, and Gassenheimer) a memo that required Think to present a “thorough and
credible plan” for Think’s immediate operations and cash management. On January 14, 2011, as
the plan Ener1 had requested, the so-called “90 day plan,” was presented to Think’s Board,
including Gassenheimer. The 90 day plan included receiving a $10 million bridge loan from
Ener1, selling more cars, cutting expenses, negotiating supplier payment suspensions, and
“rais[ing] $50-70 million at whatever valuation it [could] get.” At that time Seidel and Kamischke
agreed that Ener1 could not provide the $10 million in additional financing that Think had
requested from Ener1. On February 11, 2011, a representative of the investment firm addressed
Think’s Board at a meeting that both Gassenheimer and Seidel attended, and stated that the
probability of raising $50 million would be greater with a low per-share valuation, describing a
potential capital raise as “valuation sensitive.”
4

12.
By January 20, 2011, Gassenheimer, Seidel, and Kamischke received an interim
report by Think’s auditor (“Think Auditor Report”) that described multiple controls and financial
reporting deficiencies and stated that Think may “risk threats to the going concern assumption” if
management did not continue to “focus on securing the companies’ income, control of expenses
and ensuring adequate liquidity.” On January 21, 2011, Think’s auditor sent a letter to the Think
Board, including Gassenheimer, stating that it was aware that the December fundraising efforts had
been unsuccessful, and warned the directors that if the company could not make payments when
due, and the equity fell to less than half of the capital, the directors had an obligation, with
attendant criminal liability, under Norwegian law, to dissolve the company.
13.
In a January 31, 2011 email drafted by Seidel, Gassenheimer, and the Ener1 COO,
the Ener1 board was informed of the following: 1) existing Think investors had not funded Think
adequately; 2) Ener1 had sent Think $2.8 million in January 2011 in order for Think to cover its
current payroll obligations; and 3) Think had $30 million in payables to Ener1 and other suppliers,
and a maximum of $15.5 million potential gross proceeds in finished and near finished goods.
Ener1 did not include this information in board minutes provided to its auditors.
14.
On February 2, 2011, a party related to an existing Think investor submitted a
preliminary proposal for a term sheet with a target raise of $20 million of Think B shares at NOK 2
per share. Gassenheimer, Seidel, and Kamischke received a copy of the preliminary term sheet
proposal. During the 2010 year-end audit, Ener1’s auditors were never provided with a copy of the
proposal or otherwise made aware of its terms.
15.
Think’s 90-day plan included obtaining a $10 million bridge loan from Ener1.
However, Seidel and Kamischke determined that Ener1 could not provide that additional
financing. During a February 5, 2011 Think Board meeting (a meeting attended by Seidel and
Kamischke), Gassenheimer proposed the additional bridge financing. In response, Seidel
explained in an email to Gassenheimer (copied to Kamischke) that Ener1 was not in a financial
position to fund a $10 million bridge loan to Think, adding that Think sales had not increased and
the car’s bill of materials cost had not decreased.
16.
By early February 2011, Ener1’s budget projections assumed that Ener1 would not
receive payments from Think, and Ener1 would not sell any more batteries to Think in 2011. On
February 15, 2011, the COO and Kamischke presented a revised budget to the Ener1 Board (a
meeting attended by Gassenheimer and Seidel), showing “meager Think sales” and an “inability to
collect” on Think receivables.
17.
Because of Think’s inability to pay the third party that actually manufactured its
cars (“third-party manufacturer”), at the beginning of February 2011, Think and its third-party
manufacturer negotiated a four-week production shut down. On February 20, Think informed its
third-party manufacturer that it was suspending operations and payments to all suppliers for sixty
days. As a result, beginning in early February 2011, although the third-party manufacturer may
have completed some cars already in process, it did not manufacture new cars.

2. Not Applying Properly Impairment Factors as to Ener1’s Equity Investment in Think
Resulted in a $58.6 Million Overstatement.
18.
As described above in the Form 10-K filed on March 10, 2011, Ener1 reported an
equity investment in Think of $58.6 million. Ener1 had purchased Think B shares in several
tranches recorded at NOK 10 per share, the last of which it purchased in May of 2010. Ener1’s
equity investment in Think B shares was recorded at cost because the form of the investment was
not deemed to be equivalent to common stock for accounting purposes. See FASB Accounting
Standards Codification (“ASC”) 325. As part of preparing its financial statements to be included
in its Form 10-K, Ener1’s accounting staff undertook an analysis (“Impairment Memo”) to
determine whether, and if so, to what amount Ener1’s $58.6 million equity investment in Think
was impaired pursuant to ASC 320, Investments – Debt and Equity Securities. The accounting
staff did so because Ener1’s investment in Think was a material part of the balance sheet.
19.
Ener1’s equity investment in Think B shares was recorded at cost because the form
of the investment was not deemed to be equivalent to common stock for accounting purposes. For
investments held at cost, such as Ener1’s investment in Think, GAAP requires that the reporting
entity evaluate whether an event or change in circumstances has occurred in that period that may
have had an adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. GAAP impairment indicators
include, but are not limited to: 1) a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit
rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee; 2) a significant adverse change in the
regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee; 3) a significant adverse change
in the general market condition of either the geographic area or the industry in which the investee
operates; 4) a bona fide offer to purchase (whether solicited or unsolicited), an offer by the investee
to sell, or a completed auction process for the same or similar security for an amount less than the
cost of the investment; and/or 5) factors that raise significant concerns about the investee's ability
to continue as a going concern, such as negative cash flows from operations, working capital
deficiencies, or noncompliance with statutory capital requirements or debt covenants.2
20.
In the Impairment Memo, prepared by Ener1’s accounting department and
reviewed by Seidel and Kamischke, the company concluded that Ener1’s investment in Think was
not impaired as of December 31, 2010 because no impairment factors were present. Ener1’s
accounting staff provided this memorandum to Ener1’s auditors as support of its decision to
continue carrying its investment in Think at cost.
21.
However, contrary to the conclusion in the Impairment Memo, Respondents were
aware of information that should have indicated that a change of circumstances had occurred that
had an adverse effect on the fair value of Ener1’s investment in Think from the time of purchase
such that the equity investment should have been impaired. In fact, by the time that Ener1 filed its
Form 10-K, Think had: 1) softer than expected sales; 2) considered raising funds at “whatever
valuation”; 3) a cessation of production of cars; 4) a lack of cash to pay creditors or maintain
operations; 4) a preliminary going concern from its auditors; 5) a preliminary offer; 6) failed to
pay its loans from Ener1 when due and payable; and 7) failed to pay for batteries shipped to it by

2

See FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 320-10-35-27.

6

Ener1.3 These impairment indicators, should have necessitated Ener1 impairing its $58.6 million
equity investment in Think as of December 31, 2010, instead of Ener1 incorrectly reporting it as an
impairment as of March 31, 2011.4
3. Not Conducting an Impairment Analysis as to Loans Receivable Such that Loans
Receivable Were Overstated by $ 14 Million at Year-End.
22.
In its Form 10-K filed on March 10, 2011, Ener1 reported that its loans receivable
from Think totaled $14.0 million, which represented 3.5 percent of Ener1’s assets. It found that
the loans receivable did not require impairment because Ener1 concluded, based on a minimal
analysis in the Impairment Memo without any citation to the relevant accounting literature, that the
loans receivable were not impaired.
23.
However, under GAAP, a loss from receivables must be recorded when both of the
following conditions are met: 1)”[i]nformation available before the financial statements are issued
or are available to be issued… indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired at the
date of the financial statements,” and 2) “[t]he amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.5”
24.
Ener1 made the following loans in late 2010 when Think was already in significant
financial distress: 1) an October 1, 2010 $5 million loan, due December 31, 2010 that Think never
repaid nor did it make any interest payments required by the terms of the loan; 2) an October €1
million loan paid directly to the third-party manufacturer so it would continue producing cars on
behalf of Think, which was never repaid; and 3) a November 18, 2010, $5 million line of credit to
Think (exhausted by December 2010), due on January 21, 2011 that was never repaid. Despite
Think’s desperate need for cash, and its failure to pay any interest on the outstanding loans
receivable, Ener1 did not conduct any analysis as to the likelihood that the loans receivable was
impaired. In fact, Ener1 did not have specific written procedures by which to assess the
impairment of loans. By not impairing the loans receivable as of December 31, 2010, Ener1
overstated its assets by $14 million or 3.5 percent of its total assets.
4. Not Conducting an Impairment Analysis as to Accounts Receivable Resulted in an
Overstatement of $13.6 million in Accounts Receivable.
25.
For purposes of the 2010 year-end audited financial statements included in Ener1’s
Form 10-K, Ener1’s accounts receivable from Think were recorded at $13.6 million ($8.5 mm past
due), which represented 3.4 percent of Ener1’s assets. Ener1 concluded, based a short analysis in
the Impairment Memo without any citation to the relevant accounting literature, that the accounts
receivable were not impaired as of December 31, 2010.

3

None of these facts were included in the Impairment Memo. Instead, the Impairment Memo represented that
original investment had not deteriorated, car sales were strong, Think continued to sell its shares at NOK 10, and
there was no going concern regarding Think because it would be able to raise additional funds through financing.
4
As discussed below, the company issued a Form 8-K in August 2011, recognizing that it should have impaired its
equity investment in think as of year-end 2010.
5
See ASC 310-10-35-8.

7

26.
Under GAAP, a loss from receivables must be recorded when both of the following
conditions are met: 1)”[i]nformation available before the financial statements are issued or are
available to be issued… indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired at the date of
the financial statements,” and 2) “[t]he amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.6” Think
made its last payment for batteries received from Ener1 in mid-September 2010, although Ener1
continued to ship batteries and record revenue through January 2011. By November 2010, Think
owed Ener1 $4.5 million from batteries already shipped, and Ener1 accounting personnel including
Kamischke were concerned regarding the non-payment. Despite that concern, Ener1’s accounting
staff did not perform any collectability analysis as to whether the accounts receivable might be
impaired. In fact, Ener1 did not have specific written procedures by which to assess the
impairment of accounts receivable. By not impairing the accounts receivable as of December 31,
2010, Ener1 misstated its assets by over 3 percent.
5. Not Determining Whether Fourth Quarter 2010 Think-Related Revenue Should Have
Been Recognized Caused 14% Revenue Overstatement
27.
For purposes of the audited year-end financial statements included in the 2010
Form 10-K, Ener1 recognized $18.8 million in revenue in connection with the shipment of
batteries to Think. Although Ener1 lacked a formal written revenue recognition policy, Ener1
disclosed in its Form 10-K that to recognize revenue it must determine that that there was
reasonable assurance of collectability for revenue to be recognized. 7 Here, because of the
deteriorating condition of Think, as detailed above, Ener1 did not perform the analysis for
sufficient reasonable assurance that it would be able to collect on the revenue recognized from its
shipment of batteries to Think during the fourth quarter of 2010. By recognizing revenue from that
quarter, Ener1’s revenue was overstated by 14% ($77 million reported would become $66 million
as adjusted).
28.
In its year-end 2010 Form 10-K, Ener1 disclosed that as of January 2011, it
“temporarily stopped” sending batteries to Think at its direction “until the company rebalanced its
overall inventory levels.” Gassenheimer reiterated this reason in a March 10, 2010 conference call.
By the time of the filing of the Form 10-K and the conference call, Think was also experiencing a
severe operational and financial deterioration, was undertaking a restructuring plan, and had also
negotiated a shutdown with its third-party manufacturer because it could not pay the manufacturer.
B. Events Subsequent to the Filing of the 2010 Form 10-K
29.
Subsequent to the filing of Form 10-K, Think’s financial condition continued to
deteriorate. By the end of March, Think was unable to pay payroll taxes, its investment banker had
been unable to find any willing investors, and its CFO, after consulting with Seidel, sent an email
to Gassenheimer, among others, recommending that Think seek court-ordered liquidation. By

6

See ASC 310-10-35-8.
ASC 605-10-25-1 provides that revenue may be properly recognized only when it is both a) realized or
recognizable and b) earned. See also Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 13, Revenue Recognition, which provides that
revenue is generally realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: 1) persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists; 2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; 3) the seller’s price to
the buyer is fixed or determinable; and 4) collectability is reasonably assured.
7

8

April, Gassenheimer emailed the Ener1 Board indicating that Think was in need of restructuring
because its past due payables exceeded $50 million.
30.
Throughout March and April 2011, Gassenheimer and Seidel, with the assistance of
the Ener1 accounting staff, formulated various organization and ownership scenarios, all of which
contemplated Ener1 contributing its Think-related assets in exchange for an interest in a joint
venture, that would include Think’s third-party manufacturer and Ener1’s largest shareholder, to
take ownership of Think. None of those scenarios provided for Ener1 to recover 100 percent of its
reported amount of its equity investment and/or receivables in Think. The scenarios also failed to
account for the payment, either in cash or interest in a joint venture, of Think’s other equity
investors or trade creditors other than the third-party manufacturer.
31.
On April 17, 2011, the Think Board considered a liquidation analysis/going
concern analysis performed by Think’s investment banker (“liquidation analysis”). The analysis
concluded that Think would be worth $10-15 million in liquidation and it would require a $135 to
$150 million capital investment to remain as a going concern. Seidel received the liquidation
analysis and an invitation to the Board meeting from Gassenheimer. Seidel sent the liquidation
analysis to Kamischke.
C. Ener1’s Form 10-Q for the First Quarter of 2011 Contained Financial Statements that
Did Not Conform with GAAP
32.
Ener1 did not impair its Think loans or accounts receivable, based upon the
assertion that those amounts would be recovered in the joint venture. On April 29, Seidel, in an
email to Gassenheimer challenged the recoverability of the receivables given the percentages of
ownership in the joint venture, and the amount of financial contribution by other joint venture
partners as compared with the total amount of Ener1 receivables. Gassenheimer replied that the
capital commitments from the joint venture partners still needed to be negotiated.
33.
On May 10, 2011, Ener1 filed its Form 10-Q for the First Quarter of 2011.
Gassenheimer, Seidel, and Kamischke each signed and certified the filing. In its Form 10-Q,
although Ener1 disclosed that the Think investment was impaired, and recorded an impairment loss
of approximately $59.4 million (100%) during the three months ended March 31, 2011, “primarily
due to the uncertainty of when or if Think Global will recommence operations…” it did not impair
the accounts receivable or loans receivable. In the filing, Ener1 stated that impairment was
unnecessary because management believed it would realize full value, “which may include our
receipt of equity or other value in connection with a potential equity restructuring of Think
Holdings.”
34.
Think filed for bankruptcy on June 22, 2011, and on the same day, Ener1
announced that it would take a material charge for the Think receivables. In a Form 8-K filed on
August 10, 2011, Ener1 stated that its year-end 2010 Form 10-K and first quarter 2011 Form 10-Q
should not be relied upon, and that Ener1 would restate its filings. Specifically, the Company
stated that it would amend its 2010 year-end Form 10-K and its first quarter 2011 Form 10-Q for
the quarter ended March 31, 2011 to restate its financial statements to reflect, as of December 31,
2010, the impairments of its investment in Think (which had previously been recorded in the first
quarter of 2011), its Think accounts receivable and its Think loans receivable including accrued
9

interest, as well as reflect the corrected accounting for revenue recognized in connection with
transactions with Think during the year ended December 31, 2010 and the three months ended
March 31, 2011. Ultimately, Ener1 did not file a restatement, and in January 2012, it filed for
bankruptcy protection.
D. Accounting and Internal Accounting Controls Environment at Ener1
35.
It was of central importance for those responsible for financial reporting and
internal controls at Ener1 to have a command of GAAP. It was also important that the accounting
staff received the requisite information to determine that Think-related assets and revenue were
properly stated in accordance with GAAP given the significance of Think to the financial
statements of Ener1.
36.
Ener1 had numerous deficiencies throughout its system of internal accounting
controls that were attributable, in part, to its failure to understand and assess the risks in its control
environment. First, Ener1 lacked procedures to ensure that the geographically dispersed
accounting personnel received necessary information generally and specifically, as it related to
Ener1’s relationship with Think.8 Second, it did not maintain a sufficient complement of personnel
with the requisite level of accounting knowledge, experience, and training in the application of
GAAP. Finally, Ener1 did not have specific documented accounting procedures as to: 1) when and
how to conduct an impairment analysis as to any equity held by the company; 2) determining the
collectability of loans receivable; 3) determining the collectability of accounts receivable; and 4)
the recognition of revenue. Gassenheimer, Seidel, and Kamischke did not ensure that Ener1 had
these requisite procedures in place to ensure that the books and records were properly maintained,
and ultimately that the financial statements disclosed in public filings would be in accordance with
GAAP.
37.
Ener1 lacked any specific procedures regarding information distribution to the
accounting staff. Instead, the accounting staff shared information through weekly telephone calls,
and some members of the accounting staff routinely received Ener1 board minutes while others did
not. Specifically, as to Think, while Gassenheimer, Seidel and Kamischke received significant
information regarding Think such as Think board minutes and Think board presentations, they did
not have a specific documented procedure so that the accounting staff responsible for financial
reporting received necessary information. Respondents did not ensure that pertinent information
with respect to Ener1’s investment in and transactions with Think were identified, captured, and
communicated in a form and time frame sufficient to enable finance and accounting personnel to
carry out their responsibilities.
38.
Respondents Seidel and Kamischke lacked expertise in accounting to assess the
information obtained regarding Ener1’s exposure to Think. Neither Seidel nor Kamischke was a
CPA. Furthermore, Seidel and Kamischke were new to their roles and had never been responsible
for a public company’s financial reporting. Gassenheimer, Seidel, and Kamischke did not ensure

Ener1’s accounting function was dispersed among three locations located in New York, Florida, and Indiana.
Seidel worked in the NY corporate office with Gassenheimer while Kamischke and the Controller worked at a
manufacturing and research facility in Indianapolis. Meanwhile, the Director for Financial Reporting worked in the
Florida office and only worked full time during the reporting season. Also located in the Florida office was the
Director of Internal Controls.

that Ener1 had a sufficient complement of personnel with the requisite level of accounting
knowledge, experience, and training.
E. Sales of Ener1 Treasury Securities
39.
Ener1 sold 2,858,357 shares of Ener1 treasury securities on the open market
between January 25, 2011 through June 3, 2011, for gross proceeds of $9,452,577 at a time when
Ener1’s financial statements were materially inaccurate, and Think’s operational and financial
deterioration had not been disclosed.9 The shares were sold to provide funding for Ener1’s
operations and to pay quarterly interest on senior unsecured notes.
Violations
40.
Section 17(a)(2) makes it unlawful to obtain money or property through
misstatements or omissions about material facts; and Section 17(a)(3) proscribes any transaction or
course of business that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon a purchaser of
securities. SEC v. Softpoint, Inc., 958 F. Supp. 846, 861 (S.D.N.Y. 1997), aff’d, 159 F.3d 1348 (2d
Cir. 1998). Only negligence is required for liability under Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3). Aaron v.
SEC, 446 U.S. 680, 697 (1980).
41.
Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to file such periodic and other
reports as the Commission may prescribe and in conformity with such rules as the Commission
may promulgate. Exchange Act Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 require the filing of annual and quarterly
reports, respectively. In addition to the information expressly required to be included in such
reports, Rule 12b-20 of the Exchange Act requires issuers to add such further material information,
if any, as may be necessary to make the required statements, in the light of the circumstances under
which they are made not misleading. “The reporting provisions of the Exchange Act are clear and
unequivocal, and they are satisfied only by the filing of complete, accurate, and timely reports.”
SEC v. Savoy Industries, 587 F.2d 1149, 1165 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (citing SEC v. IMC Int’l, Inc., 384
F. Supp. 889, 893 (N.D. Tex. 1974)). A violation of the reporting provisions is established if a
report is shown to contain materially false or misleading information. SEC v. Kalvex, Inc., 425 F.
Supp. 310, 316 (S.D.N.Y. 1975). No showing of scienter is necessary to establish an issuer’s
violation of Section 13(a). SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250, 1268 (D.D.C. 1978).
42.
Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to “make and keep books,
records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the issuer.” Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act requires issuers
to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances that transactions are recorded to permit the preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. No showing of scienter is necessary to
establish violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B). SEC v. World-Wide Coin
Investments, 567 F. Supp. 724, 749-51 (N.D. Ga. 1983).

The sales took place pursuant to a Form S-3 shelf registration that Ener1 filed (Gassenheimer signed) and that
became effective on February 5, 2009. Shares were taken off the shelf, and the S-3 was updated with a Form 424
filed on January 25, 2010 in connection with an Open Market Sale Agreement with Jefferies & Company, Inc.
(“Jefferies”) to sell up to $60 million of treasury securities. The agreement with Jefferies prohibited sales during
blackouts and in the event of material adverse changes based on Ener1’s insider trading policies.

43.
Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 prohibits a person from, directly or indirectly, falsifying
or causing to be falsified any book, record, or account subject to Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the
Exchange Act. Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2(a)(2) provides that no director or officer of an issuer
shall, directly or indirectly, omit to state, or cause another person to omit to state, any material fact
necessary in order to make statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such
statements were made, not misleading, to an accountant in connection with financial-statement
audits, reviews, or examinations or the preparation or filing of any document or report required to
be filed with the Commission. No showing of scienter is required to establish a violation of Rules
13b2-1 or 13b2-2. World-Wide Coin, 567 F. Supp. at 749; Promotion of the Reliability of
Financial Information and Prevention of the Concealment of Questionable or Illegal Corporate
Payments and Practices, Exch. Act Rel. No. 15570, 16 SEC Docket 1143 (Feb. 15, 1979).
44.
Exchange Act Rule 13a-14, Certification of Disclosure in Annual and Quarterly
Reports, requires each Form 10-Q and 10-K to include certifications signed by each principal
executive and principal financial officer of the issuer (or persons performing similar functions).
Among other things, the certifying officers must confirm that the report does not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements
made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with
respect to the period covered by the report.

Securities Act Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) and Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and
13(b)(2)(B) and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13.

Exchange Act Rule 13a-14; (2) Respondents Seidel and Kamischke violated Exchange Act Rule
13b2-1 and Rule 13b2-2; and (3) Respondents Gassenheimer, Seidel, and Kamischke caused
Ener1’s violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B), and Exchange
Act Rules12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondents’ Offer.
A. Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities
Act and Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondents Ener1, Gassenheimer, Seidel and
Kamischke shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future
violations of Securities Act Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) and Exchange Act Sections 13(a),
13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. Respondents
Gassenheimer, Seidel, and Kamischke shall cease and desist from committing or causing
any violations and any future violations of Rule 13a-14. Respondents Seidel and
Kamischke shall cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future
violations of Exchange Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2.
12

B. Respondent Gassenheimer shall, within ten (10) days of the entry of this Order, pay
a civil money penalty in the amount of $100,000 to the Securities and Exchange
Commission for transfer to the general fund of the United States Treasury, subject to
Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3). If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall
accrue pursuant to 31 U.S.C. §3717.
C. Respondent Seidel shall, within ten (10) days of the entry of this Order, pay a civil
money penalty in the amount of $50,000 to the Securities and Exchange Commission for
transfer to the general fund of the United States Treasury, subject to Exchange Act Section
21F(g)(3). If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to 31
U.S.C. §3717.
D. Respondent Kamischke shall, within ten (10) days of the entry of this Order, pay a
civil money penalty in the amount of $30,000 to the Securities and Exchange Commission

Section 21F(g)(3). If timely payment is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant
to 31 U.S.C. §3717.
E. All payment must be made in one of the following ways:
(1) Respondent may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which will
provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;
(2) Respondent may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov through the
SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or
(3) Respondent may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s check, or United States

Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying
Respondent as a Respondent in these proceedings, and the file number of these

Hodgkins, Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F St.,
NE, Washington, DC 20549.
F. Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be
treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondents Gassenheimer, Seidel, and
Kamischke agree that in any Related Investor Action, they shall not argue that they are
13

entitled to, nor shall they benefit by, offset or reduction of any award of compensatory
damages by the amount of any part of Respondent Gassenheimer’s, Seidel’s or
Kamischke’s payment of a civil penalty in this action ("Penalty Offset"). If the court in any
Related Investor Action grants such a Penalty Offset, Respondents Gassenheimer, Seidel,
and Kamischke agree that they shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting the
Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount of the
Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be
deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the
civil penalty imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a "Related
Investor Action" means a private damages action brought against Respondents
Gassenheimer, Seidel and Kamischke by or on behalf of one or more investors based on
substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the Commission in this
proceeding.
V.
It is further Ordered that for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in Section 523 of
the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523, the findings in this Order are true and admitted by
Respondents Gassenheimer, Seidel and Kamischke and further, any debt for disgorgement,
prejudgment interest, civil penalty or other amounts due by Respondents Gassenheimer, Seidel,
and Kamischke under this Order or any other judgment, order, consent order, decree or settlement
agreement entered in connection with this proceeding, is a debt for the violation by Respondents
Gassenheimer, Seidel, and/or Kamischke of the federal securities laws or any regulation or order
issued under such laws, as set forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C.
§523(a)(19).
By the Commission.
