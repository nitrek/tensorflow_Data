ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-17077

CORRECTED ORDER UNDER RULE
506(d) OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF
1933 GRANTING A WAIVER OF THE
RULE 506(d)(1)(iv)(B)
DISQUALIFICATION PROVISION

In the Matter of
Barclays Capital Inc.
Respondent.

I.
Barclays Capital Inc. (“BCI”) submitted a letter dated January 27, 2016 requesting that
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) grant a waiver of disqualification
under Rule 506(d)(2)(ii) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”).
II.
On January 31, 2016 the Commission instituted administrative and cease-and-desist
proceedings pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act and Sections 15(b) and 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) against BCI imposing certain remedial
sanctions set forth in the Commission’s Order (“the Order”).
III.
Rule 506(d)(2)(ii) of Regulation D provides that disqualification “shall not apply. . . upon
a showing of good cause and without prejudice to any other action by the Commission, if the
Commission determines that it is not necessary under the circumstances that an exemption be
denied.”
IV.
Based on the foregoing and the facts and representations in the request for a waiver of
disqualification for BCI, and assuming that BCI complies with the Order, the Commission has
determined that BCI has made a showing of good cause under Rule 506(d)(2)(ii) that it is not
necessary under the circumstances to deny reliance on Rule 506 of Regulation D by reason of the

entry of the Order against BCI. Any different facts from those represented or failure to comply
with the terms of the Order would require us to revisit our determination that good cause has
been shown and could constitute grounds to revoke or further condition the waiver. The
Commission reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to revoke or further condition the waiver
under those circumstances.
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Rule 506(d) of Regulation D under the
Securities Act, that a waiver from the application of the disqualification provision of
Rule 506(d)(1)(iv)(B) under the Securities Act resulting from the entry of the Order is hereby
granted to BCI.
By the Commission.
