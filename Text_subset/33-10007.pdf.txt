In three transactions from January to March 2011, ARRG, controlled by Spiegel, purchased
and converted approximately $193,000 of MusclePharm Corporation’s (“MSLP”) aged debt into
7.7 million MSLP securities and, in violation of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act,
immediately resold the securities into the public market, realizing unlawful profits of
approximately $338,000.

place of business in Huntington, New York. ARRG participated in offerings of MSLP stock,

markets sports nutrition products. From 2010 to present, MSLP’s common stock was registered

Background
4.
Spiegel created ARRG in 1999 as a private company. Spiegel is the sole person
associated with ARRG.
5.
From January to March 2011, Spiegel, through ARRG, participated in three
transactions with MSLP, in which it purchased and converted approximately $193,000 of MSLP’s

in effect for any of the MSLP securities ARRG received and sold. Spiegel signed all documents
related to the MSLP transactions as President of ARRG.

1

The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondents’ Offer of Settlement and are not binding
on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

6.
On January 25, 2011, ARRG entered into a debt settlement agreement with an
MSLP vendor whereby ARRG purchased $82,811 of MSLP’s outstanding debt, which was
evidenced by an invoice. On January 26, 2011, ARRG entered into a debt settlement agreement
with MSLP that contained a conversion feature (at a discount to the market price), which did not
exist in the original debt. That same day, ARRG submitted a notice of conversion. ARRG received
3,312,435 MSLP shares as a result of this transaction and sold all shares within approximately one
month.
7.
On February 28, 2011, ARRG entered into a debt settlement agreement with a
MSLP debt holder whereby ARRG purchased $62,500 of MSLP’s outstanding debt, which was
evidenced by a non-convertible promissory note. On February 28, 2011, ARRG entered into a debt
settlement agreement with MSLP that contained a conversion feature (at a discount to the market
price), which did not exist in the original debt. That same day, ARRG submitted a notice of
conversion. ARRG received 2,500,000 MSLP shares as a result of this transaction and sold all
shares within approximately one month.
8.
On March 29, 2011, ARRG entered into a debt settlement agreement with a MSLP
vendor whereby ARRG purchased $47,627 of MSLP’s outstanding debt, which was evidenced by
an invoice. On March 29, 2011, ARRG entered into a debt settlement agreement with MSLP that
contained a conversion feature (at a discount to the market price), which did not exist in the
original debt. That same day, ARRG submitted a notice of conversion. ARRG received 1,905,096
MSLP shares as a result of this transaction and sold all shares within approximately one month.
9.
ARRG, as a result of its immediate resale of the MSLP securities, was a statutory
underwriter and no exemption to the registration requirements was applicable to ARRG’s resales of
the MSLP securities.
10.
Spiegel had sole control over ARRG’s brokerage accounts and made all decisions
regarding selling the MSLP securities. Spiegel and ARRG used means of interstate commerce in
connection with the unregistered offers and sales. ARRG received $337,601 in profits from the
sales of the MSLP securities received in the three transactions.
11.
As a result of the conduct described above, Respondents willfully2 violated Sections
5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. Section 5(a) of the Securities Act prohibits the direct or indirect
sale of securities through the mail or interstate commerce unless a registration statement is in
effect. Section 5(c) prohibits the direct or indirect offer for sale of securities through the mail or
interstate commerce unless a registration statement has been filed.
IV.

2

A willful violation of the securities laws means merely “‘that the person charged with the duty knows what he is
doing.’” Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 414 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting Hughes v. SEC, 174 F.2d 969, 977 (D.C.
Cir. 1949)). There is no requirement that the actor “‘also be aware that he is violating one of the Rules or Acts.’” Id.
(quoting Gearhart & Otis, Inc. v. SEC, 348 F.2d 798, 803 (D.C. Cir. 1965)).

after five (5) years to the appropriate self-regulatory organization, or if there
