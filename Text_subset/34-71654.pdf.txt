established pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the $200,000,000 civil
money penalty collected from JPMorgan for distribution to injured investors.
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 308(a) of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a Fair Fund is established for JPMorgan’s civil money penalty payment.
By the Commission.
