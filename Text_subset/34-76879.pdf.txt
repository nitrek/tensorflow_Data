SUMMARY

This matter involves insider trading by Reid A. Hackney, Chief Financial Officer and Senior
Vice President of the Dress Barn subsidiary of Ascena Retail Group, Inc. (“Ascena”), in advance of
two public announcements on the basis of material nonpublic information he obtained from his
employer. In January 2012, Hackney became aware of Ascena’s positive holiday sales results. In
breach of his duty to Ascena’s shareholders, he traded Ascena securities in advance of the public
release of this information and realized ill-gotten gains of $3,300. In March 2012, Hackney became
aware of Ascena’s plans to acquire Charming Shoppes, Inc. (“Charming Shoppes”). In breach of
his duty to Ascena, he traded Charming Shoppes securities before the public announcement of the
transaction and realized ill-gotten gains of $44,750. By engaging in this conduct, Hackney violated
Sections 10(b) and 14(e) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5 and 14e-3 thereunder.

2

Rule 102(e)(1)(iii) provides, in pertinent part, that:
The Commission may . . . deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of
appearing or practicing before it . . . to any person who is found…to have
willfully violated, or willfully aided and abetted the violation of any provision of
the Federal securities laws or the rules and regulations thereunder.

FACTS
Hackney Was Subject to His Employer’s Insider Trading Policies

1.
As Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President of the Dress Barn subsidiary
of Ascena, Hackney was subject to the company’s code of business conduct, which prohibited
employees from “profit[ing] in the stock market(s) from the improper use of material non-public
information that [employees] learn during [their] employment.” The code required employees to
“keep any material non-public information confidential” and further provided that “examples of
material information include financial information that has not been released to the public such
as Ascena’s or a specific brand’s monthly, quarterly or annual sales, comp store sales, earnings
and trends, news of a planned acquisition or disposition, [etc.] …” Hackney signed
acknowledgements that he received, read and agreed to comply with this code.
2.
Ascena also designated Hackney as a “Key Officer,” meaning that he was subject
to additional Ascena policies that prohibited him from, among other things: (i) trading in Ascena
securities while aware of material nonpublic information regarding Ascena; (ii) trading in the
securities of any other company while aware of material nonpublic information regarding that
company; (iii) trading for one full business day following the public release of material and
previously nonpublic information; (iv) trading in options on Ascena’s common stock; and (v)
engaging in short swing transactions such as the purchase and sale of Ascena equity securities
within any period of six months.

Hackney’s Insider Trading in the Securities of Ascena Retail Group, Inc.
3.
In his role as Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, Hackney
received notice of Ascena’s comparable store sales figures before they were released to the
public. Specifically, on January 1, 2012, Hackney received an internal Ascena weekly sales
flash email which provided weekly and monthly sales figures for Ascena and its subsidiary retail
companies, including Dress Barn. Among other upbeat sales statistics, the email provided that
Ascena’s comparable store sales for the month of December had increased 14% over the prior
year and that Dress Barn’s had increased 12%.
4.
Based on this material nonpublic information, and in violation of Ascena’s
policies, on January 3, 2012, Hackney purchased 15 Ascena call option contracts with a strike
price of $29.00 and an expiration date of January 21, 2012.3
5.
By purchasing Ascena securities on the basis of material nonpublic information
concerning Ascena’s sales results, Hackney breached the duty he owed to Ascena’s shareholders.
6.
Hackney knew that these securities transactions were in breach of the duty he
owed to Ascena’s shareholders.
7.
On the morning of January 5, 2012, Ascena issued a press release announcing its
“strong holiday sales” and raising its earnings per share guidance. The press release highlighted
Ascena’s 14% increase in comparable store sales for the fiscal month of December 2011 versus
December 2010, including a 12% increase at the Dress Barn subsidiary. Ascena’s stock price
closed at $32.60 that day, an increase of $1.74 or 5.64% above the prior trading day’s closing
price.
8.
On January 5, 2012, just after Ascena’s favorable press release had been issued,
Hackney sold his 15 Ascena call option contracts, realizing profits of $3,300.
Hackney’s Insider Trading in the Securities of Charming Shoppes, Inc.
9.
By March 27, 2012, Ascena had taken substantial steps in furtherance of a cash
tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of Charming Shoppes common stock. For instance,
Ascena had entered into a confidentiality agreement with Charming Shoppes, retained lawyers
and financial advisors, conducted significant due diligence related to the transaction, and notified
A stock option, commonly referred to as an “option,” gives its purchaser-holder the
option to buy or sell shares of an underlying stock at a specified price (the “strike” price) prior to
the expiration date. Options generally are sold in “contracts,” which give the option holder the
opportunity to buy or sell 100 shares of an underlying stock. A “call” option gives the
purchaser-holder of the option the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a specified amount of
an underlying security at a specified strike price within a specific time period. Generally, the
buyer of a call option anticipates that the price of the underlying security will increase during a
specified amount of time.

purchase price of $6.25 per share.
10.
On or before March 27, 2012, during the course of his employment at Ascena,
Hackney became aware of confidential information concerning Ascena’s plans to acquire
Charming Shoppes that convinced him the transaction was imminent.
11.
Between March 27 and March 30, 2012, on the basis of material nonpublic
information concerning Ascena’s plans to acquire Charming Shoppes, and in violation of
Ascena’s policies, Hackney purchased 350 Charming Shoppes call option contracts with a strike
price of $5.00 and an expiration date of May 19, 2012.
12.
Hackney knew that these securities transactions were in breach of the duty of trust
or confidence he owed to Ascena.
13.
On the morning of May 2, 2012, Ascena announced its entry into an agreement to
acquire Charming Shoppes via a tender offer for $7.35 per share of Charming Shoppes common
stock. That day, the price of Charming Shoppes common stock closed at $7.31 per share, an
increase of $1.41 or 24% above the prior trading day’s closing price.
14.
After the May 2, 2012 public announcement of the tender offer, Hackney sold all
350 of his Charming Shoppes call option contracts, realizing profits of $44,750.
15.
On May 15, 2012, Ascena, through an affiliate, commenced a tender offer for all
outstanding shares of Charming Shoppes common stock.
16.
Hackney knew that the information he learned through his employment
concerning the impending acquisition was material and nonpublic. By purchasing Charming
Shoppes securities on the basis of that information, and in violation of Ascena’s policies,
Hackney misappropriated the information and breached a duty of trust or confidence that he
owed to Ascena.
E.

Respondent of the federal securities laws or any regulation or order issued under such laws, as set
forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(19).

By the Commission.
