Notice is hereby given, pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s (“Commission”) Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.1103, that the Division of Enforcement has submitted to the Commission a proposed
plan (the “Plan”) for the distribution of monies paid in the above-captioned matter.
On August 16, 2013, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative and
Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section
21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Sections 203(f) and 203(k) of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, and Section 9(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, Making
Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”) against
North East Capital, LLC and Anthony T. Vicidomine (collectively, “Respondents”).1 The
Order found that Vicidomine was the founder and sole principal of North East Capital, LLC,
an unregistered investment adviser and general partner of the North East Capital Fund LP.
The Order further found, among other things, that from November 2011 through March 2012,
Vicidomine misappropriated $189,415 of the North East Fund’s assets in the form of unearned
“incentive fees.” Respondents were ordered to pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement of
$189,415, prejudgment interest of $6,717.04, and a civil money penalty of $150,000, and have
paid $345,911 to the Commission.
The Order created a fund pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, as amended, for the funds paid by the Respondents (the “Fair Fund”). The Fair Fund is
subject to the continuing jurisdiction and control of the Commission and the Fair Fund has
been deposited in an account at the United States Department of Treasury.
