In the Matter of

EXTENSION ORDER

The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has requested a second extension of
time, until July 7, 2014, to submit a Proposed Plan of Distribution under Rule 1101(a)
of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans.
In the Division’s first request, the Division stated that since the issuance of the
Commission’s November 16, 2012, Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings
Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order
(“Order”) (Securities Act Rel. No. 9368 (Nov. 16, 2012)) that authorized the creation
of two separate Fair Funds for violations relating to the Bulk Settlements Practice and
First Default Payment Provision discussed in the Order, the Division has engaged in
consultations with Commission staff regarding the analysis of distribution
administration for each of the Fair Funds. Given the highly complex nature of this
matter, the Division requires additional time to continue the process for appointing a

Fund Administrator and working with that Administrator to address a myriad of issues
related to the economic analysis, distribution methodology and allocation calculations
appropriate for 77 highly complex residential mortgage-backed securitization trusts.
Accordingly, for good cause shown, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the
Division’s request for an extension of time until July 7, 2014, to submit a Proposed
Plan of Distribution is granted.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Elizabeth M. Murphy
Secretary
