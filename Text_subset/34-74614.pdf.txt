EXTENSION ORDER

The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has requested a fourth extension of time
until May 26, 2015 for entry of an order approving or disapproving the Proposed Plan of
Distribution that was noticed for public comment on May 9, 2014.
On December 18, 2013, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative
and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 203(e) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Making
Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”) against
G-Trade Services LLC (“G-Trade”), ConvergEx Global Markets Limited (“CGM”), and
ConvergEx Execution Solutions LLC (“CES”)1 (collectively, “Respondents”). The Order
required Respondents to pay a total of $107,424,429 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest,
and civil money penalties into an escrow account and created a Fair Fund pursuant to Section
308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended. In two related proceedings, the
Commission ordered that the disgorgement and prejudgment interest paid in those

proceedings, totaling $1,228,592, may be combined with the funds paid in this matter for
distribution to harmed customers.2 Payment was made into the escrow as required by the
Order on December 17, 2013.
On May 9, 2014, pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and
Disgorgement Plans,3 the Commission published a Notice of Proposed Plan of Distribution
and Opportunity for Comment (“Notice”) for the distribution of monies placed into the Fair
Fund.4 The Notice provided all interested parties thirty (30) days from the date of the Notice
to submit a comment on the Proposed Plan of Distribution. The Commission received
comments on the Proposed Plan of Distribution. On June 27, 2014, the Commission issued an
order granting an extension until August 8, 2014 for entry of an order approving or
disapproving the Proposed Plan of Distribution.5 On August 8, 2014, the Commission issued
an order granting a second extension until December 8, 2014 for entry of an order approving
or disapproving the Proposed Plan of Distribution.6 On December 9, 2014, the Commission
issued an order granting a third extension until March 27, 2015 for entry of an order approving
or disapproving the Proposed Plan of Distribution.7 On December 17, 2014, the Commission
issued an order appointing The Garden City Group as the fund plan administrator and setting
the fund plan administrator’s bond amount at $108,653,021.8
In its request for a fourth extension of time, the Division states that additional time is
needed to evaluate the five comments received and prepare responsive recommendations for
the Proposed Plan of Distribution.
