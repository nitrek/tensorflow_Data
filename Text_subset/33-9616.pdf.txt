Money Market Fund Reform; Amendments to Form PF
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Final rule.
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission” or “SEC”) is adopting
amendments to the rules that govern money market mutual funds (or “money market funds”)
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“Investment Company Act” or “Act”). The
amendments are designed to address money market funds’ susceptibility to heavy redemptions in
times of stress, improve their ability to manage and mitigate potential contagion from such
redemptions, and increase the transparency of their risks, while preserving, as much as possible,
their benefits. The SEC is removing the valuation exemption that permitted institutional nongovernment money market funds (whose investors historically have made the heaviest
redemptions in times of stress) to maintain a stable net asset value per share (“NAV”), and is
requiring those funds to sell and redeem shares based on the current market-based value of the
securities in their underlying portfolios rounded to the fourth decimal place (e.g., $1.0000), i.e.,
transact at a “floating” NAV. The SEC also is adopting amendments that will give the boards of
directors of money market funds new tools to stem heavy redemptions by giving them discretion
to impose a liquidity fee if a fund’s weekly liquidity level falls below the required regulatory
threshold, and giving them discretion to suspend redemptions temporarily, i.e., to “gate” funds,

2

under the same circumstances. These amendments will require all non-government money
market funds to impose a liquidity fee if the fund’s weekly liquidity level falls below a
designated threshold, unless the fund’s board determines that imposing such a fee is not in the
best interests of the fund. In addition, the SEC is adopting amendments designed to make money
market funds more resilient by increasing the diversification of their portfolios, enhancing their
stress testing, and improving transparency by requiring money market funds to report additional
information to the SEC and to investors. Finally, the amendments require investment advisers to
certain large unregistered liquidity funds, which can have many of the same economic features as
money market funds, to provide additional information about those funds to the SEC.

INTRODUCTION
Money market funds are a type of mutual fund registered under the Investment Company

Act and regulated pursuant to rule 2a-7 under the Act. 2 Money market funds generally pay
dividends that reflect prevailing short-term interest rates, are redeemable on demand, and, unlike
2

Money market funds are also sometimes called “money market mutual funds” or “money funds.”

7

other investment companies, seek to maintain a stable NAV, typically $1.00. 3 This combination
of principal stability, liquidity, and payment of short-term yields has made money market funds
popular cash management vehicles for both retail and institutional investors. As of February 28,
2014, there were approximately 559 money market funds registered with the Commission, and
these funds collectively held over $3.0 trillion of assets. 4
Absent an exemption, as required by the Investment Company Act, all registered mutual
funds must price and transact in their shares at the current NAV, calculated by valuing portfolio
instruments at market value or, if market quotations are not readily available, at fair value as
determined in good faith by the fund’s board of directors (i.e., use a floating NAV). 5 In 1983,
the Commission codified an exemption to this requirement allowing money market funds to
value their portfolio securities using the “amortized cost” method of valuation and to use the
“penny-rounding” method of pricing. 6 Under the amortized cost method, a money market fund’s

Open-End Investment Companies (Money Market Funds), Investment Company Act Release No. 13380
(July 11, 1983) [48 FR 32555 (July 18, 1983)] (“1983 Adopting Release”). Most money market funds seek
to maintain a stable NAV of $1.00, but a few seek to maintain a stable NAV of a different amount, e.g.,
$10.00. For convenience, throughout this Release, the discussion will simply refer to the stable NAV of
$1.00 per share.

Based on Form N-MFP data. SEC regulations require that money market funds report certain portfolio
information on a monthly basis to the SEC on Form N-MFP. See rule 30b1-7.

5

See section 2(a)(41)(B) of the Act and rules 2a-4 and 22c-1. The Commission, however, has stated that it
would not object if a mutual fund board of directors determines, in good faith, that the value of debt
securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less is their amortized cost, unless the particular
circumstances warrant otherwise. See Accounting Series Release No. 219, Valuation of Debt Instruments
by Money Market Funds and Certain Other Open- End Investment Companies, Financial Reporting
Codification (CCH) section 404.05.a and .b (May 31, 1977) (“ASR 219”). We further discuss the use of
amortized cost valuation by mutual funds in section III.B.5 below.

6

See 1983 Adopting Release, supra note 3. Section 6(c) of the Investment Company Act provides the
Commission with broad authority to exempt persons, securities or transactions from any provision of the
Investment Company Act, or the regulations thereunder, if, and to the extent that such exemption is in the
public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the Investment Company Act. See Commission Policy and Guidelines for Filing of

8

portfolio securities generally are valued at cost plus any amortization of premium or
accumulation of discount, rather than at their value based on current market factors. 7 The penny
rounding method of pricing permits a money market fund when pricing its shares to round the
fund’s NAV to the nearest one percent (i.e., the nearest penny). 8 Together, these valuation and
pricing techniques create a “rounding convention” that permits a money market fund to sell and
redeem shares at a stable share price without regard to small variations in the value of the
securities in its portfolio. 9 Other types of mutual funds not regulated by rule 2a-7 generally must
calculate their daily NAVs using market-based factors and cannot use penny rounding.
When the Commission initially established the regulatory framework allowing money
market funds to maintain a stable share price through use of the amortized cost method of
valuation and/or the penny rounding method of pricing (so long as they abided by certain risklimiting conditions), it did so understanding the benefits that stable value money market funds
provided as a cash management vehicle, particularly for smaller investors, and focused on
minimizing dilution of assets and returns for shareholders. 10 At that time, the Commission was

See current rule 2a-7(a)(2). See also supra note 5. Throughout this Release when we refer to a rule as it
exists prior to any amendments we are making today it is described as a “current rule” while references to a
rule as amended (or one that is not being amended today) are to “rule.”

8

See current rule 2a-7(a)(20).

9

Today, money market funds use a combination of the two methods so that, under normal circumstances,
they can use the penny rounding method to maintain a price of $1.00 per share without pricing to the third
decimal place like other mutual funds, and use the amortized cost method so that they need not strike a
daily market-based NAV to facilitate intra-day transactions. See infra section III.A.1.a.

See Proceedings before the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Matter of InterCapital Liquid Asset
Fund, Inc. et al., 3-5431, Dec. 28, 1978, at 1533 (Statement of Martin Lybecker, Division of Investment
Management at the Securities and Exchange Commission) (stating that Commission staff had learned over
the course of the hearings the strong preference of money market fund investors to have a stable share price
and that with the right risk-limiting conditions, the Commission could limit the likelihood of a deviation

9

persuaded that deviations of a magnitude that would cause material dilution generally would not
occur given the risk-limiting conditions of the exemptive rule. 11 As discussed throughout this
Release, our historical experience with these funds, and the events of the 2007-2009 financial
crisis 12, has led us to re-evaluate the exemptive relief provided under rule 2a-7, including the
exemption from the statutory floating NAV for some money market funds.
Under rule 2a-7, money market funds seek to maintain a stable share price by limiting
their investments to short-term, high-quality debt securities that fluctuate very little in value
under normal market conditions. In exchange for the ability to rely on the exemptions provided
by rule 2a-7, money market funds are subject to conditions designed to limit deviations between
the fund’s $1.00 stable share price and the market-based NAV of the fund’s portfolio. 13 Rule 2a7 requires that money market funds maintain a significant amount of liquid assets and invest in
securities that meet the rule’s credit quality, maturity, and diversification requirements. 14 For
example, a money market fund’s portfolio securities must meet certain credit quality standards,

from that stable value, addressing Commission concerns about dilution); 1983 Adopting Release, supra
note 3, at nn.42-43 and accompanying text (“[T]he provisions of the rule impose obligations on the board
of directors to assess the fairness of the valuation or pricing method and take appropriate steps to ensure
that shareholders always receive their proportionate interest in the money market fund.”).
11

See id., at nn.41-42 and accompanying text (noting that witnesses from the original money market fund
exemptive order hearings testified that the risk-limiting conditions, short of extraordinarily adverse
conditions in the market, should ensure that a properly managed money market fund should be able to
maintain a stable price per share and that rule 2a-7 is based on that representation).

12

Throughout this release, unless indicated otherwise, when we use the term “financial crisis” we are
referring to the financial crisis that took place between 2007 and 2009.

13

Throughout this Release, we generally use the term “stable share price” to refer to the stable share price
that money market funds seek to maintain and compute for purposes of distribution, redemption, and
repurchases of fund shares.

14

See current rule 2a-7(c)(2), (3), (4), and (5).

10

such as posing minimal credit risks. 15 The rule also places restrictions on the remaining maturity
of securities in the fund’s portfolio to limit the interest rate and credit spread risk to which a
money market fund may be exposed. A money market fund generally may not acquire any
security with a remaining maturity greater than 397 days, the dollar-weighted average maturity
of the securities owned by the fund may not exceed 60 days, and the fund’s dollar-weighted
average life to maturity may not exceed 120 days. 16 Money market funds also must maintain
sufficient liquidity to meet reasonably foreseeable redemptions, generally must invest at least
10% of their portfolios in assets that can provide daily liquidity, and invest at least 30% of their
portfolios in assets that can provide weekly liquidity, as defined under the rule. 17 Finally, rule
2a-7 also requires money market funds to diversify their portfolios by generally limiting the
funds to investing no more than 5% of their portfolios in any one issuer and no more than 10% of
their portfolios in securities issued by, or subject to guarantees or demand features (i.e., puts)
from, any one institution. 18
Rule 2a-7 also includes certain procedural standards overseen by the fund’s board of
directors. These include the requirement that the fund periodically calculate the market-based
value of the portfolio (“shadow price”) 19 and compare it to the fund’s stable share price; if the

See current rule 2a-7(a)(12), (c)(3)(i).

16

Current Rule 2a-7(c)(2).

17

See current rule 2a-7(c)(5). As we discussed when we amended rule 2a-7 in 2010, the 10% daily liquid
asset requirement does not apply to tax-exempt funds. See Money Market Fund Reform, Investment
Company Act Release No. 29132 (Feb. 23, 2010) [75 FR 10060 (Mar. 4, 2010)] (“2010 Adopting
Release”). See infra section III.E.3.

18

See current rule 2a-7(c)(4). Because of limited availability of the securities in which they invest,
tax-exempt funds have different diversification requirements under rule 2a-7 than other money market
funds.

19

See current rule 2a-7(c)(8)(ii)(A).

11

deviation between these two values exceeds ½ of 1 percent (50 basis points), the fund’s board of
directors must consider what action, if any, should be taken by the board, including whether to
re-price the fund’s securities above or below the fund’s $1.00 share price (an event colloquially
known as “breaking the buck”). 20
Different types of money market funds have been introduced to meet the different needs
of money market fund investors. Historically, most investors have invested in “prime money
market funds,” which generally hold a variety of taxable short-term obligations issued by
corporations and banks, as well as repurchase agreements and asset-backed commercial paper. 21
“Government money market funds” principally hold obligations of the U.S. government,
including obligations of the U.S. Treasury and federal agencies and instrumentalities, as well as
repurchase agreements collateralized by government securities. Some government money
market funds limit their holdings to only U.S. Treasury obligations or repurchase agreements
collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities and are called “Treasury money market funds.”
Compared to prime funds, government and Treasury money market funds generally offer greater
safety of principal but historically have paid lower yields. “Tax-exempt money market funds”
primarily hold obligations of state and local governments and their instrumentalities, and pay

20

See current rule 2a-7(c)(8)(ii)(A) and (B). Regardless of the extent of the deviation, rule 2a-7 imposes on
the board of a money market fund a duty to take appropriate action whenever the board believes the extent
of any deviation may result in material dilution or other unfair results to investors or current shareholders.
Current rule 2a-7(c)(8)(ii)(C). In addition, the money market fund can use the amortized cost or pennyrounding methods only as long as the board of directors believes that they fairly reflect the market-based
NAV. See rule 2a-7(c)(1).

interest that is generally exempt from federal income tax. 22
We first begin by reviewing the role of money market funds and the benefits they provide
investors. We then review the economics of money market funds. This includes a discussion of
several features of money market funds that, when combined, can create incentives for fund
shareholders to redeem shares during periods of stress, as well as the potential impact that such
redemptions can have on the fund and the markets that provide short-term financing. 23 We then
discuss money market funds’ experience during the financial crisis against this backdrop. We
next analyze our 2010 reforms and their impact on the heightened redemption activity during the
2011 Eurozone sovereign debt crisis and 2011 and 2013 U.S. debt ceiling impasses.
We used the analyses available to us, including the critically important analyses
contained in the report responding to certain questions posed by Commissioners Aguilar,
Paredes, and Gallagher (“DERA Study”) 24, in designing the reform proposals that we issued in
2013 for additional regulation of money market funds. 25 The 2013 proposal sought to address
certain features in money market funds that can make them susceptible to heavy redemptions, by
providing money market funds with better tools to manage and mitigate potential contagion from
22

Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to “prime funds” throughout this Release include funds
that are often referred to as “tax-exempt” or “municipal” funds. We discuss the particular features of such
tax-exempt funds and why they are included in our reforms in detail in section III.C.3.

23

Throughout this Release, we generally refer to “short-term financing markets” to describe the markets for
short-term financing of corporations, banks, and governments.

See Response to Questions Posed by Commissioners Aguilar, Paredes, and Gallagher, a report by staff of
the Division of Risk, Strategy, and Financial Innovation (Nov. 30, 2012), available at

Strategy, and Financial Innovation (“RSFI”) is now known as the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis
(“DERA”), and accordingly we are no longer referring to this study as the “RSFI Study” as we did in the
Proposing Release, but instead as the “DERA Study.”

high levels of redemptions, increasing the transparency of their risks, and improving risk sharing
among investors, and also to preserve the ability of money market funds to function as an
effective and efficient cash management tool for investors,. 26
We received over 1,400 comments 27 on the proposal from a variety of interested parties
including money market funds, investors, banks, investment advisers, government
representatives, academics, and others. 28 As discussed in greater detail in each section of this
Release below, these commenters expressed a diversity of views. Many commenters expressed
concern about the consequences of requiring a floating NAV for certain money market funds,
suggesting, among other reasons, that it was a significant reform that would remove one of the
most desirable features of these funds, and would impose numerous costs and operational
burdens. However, others expressed support, noting that it was a targeted solution aimed at
curbing the risks associated with the money market funds most susceptible to destabilizing runs.
Most commenters supported requiring the imposition of liquidity fees and redemption gates in
certain circumstances, suggesting that they would prevent runs at a minimal cost. However,
commenters also noted that fees and gates alone would not resolve certain of the features of
money market funds that can incentivize heavy redemptions. Many commenters opposed
combining the two alternatives into a single package, arguing that requiring money market funds
to implement both reforms could decrease the utility of money market funds to investors.
26

The 2013 proposal also included amendments that would apply under each alternative, with additional
changes to money market fund disclosure, diversification limits, and stress testing, among other reforms.
See Proposing Release, supra note 25. We discuss these amendments below.

27

Of these, more than 230 were individualized letters, and the rest were one of several types of form letters.

28

Unless otherwise stated, all references to comment letters in this Release are to letters submitted on the
Proposing Release in File No. S7-03-13 and are available at http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-0313/s70313.shtml.

Commenters generally supported many of the other reforms we proposed, such as enhanced
disclosure, new portfolio reporting requirements for large unregistered liquidity funds, and
amendments to fund diversification requirements.
Today, after consideration of the comments received, we are removing the valuation
exemption that permits institutional non-government money market funds (whose investors have
historically made the heaviest redemptions in times of market stress) to maintain a stable NAV,
and are requiring those funds to sell and redeem their shares based on the current market-based
value of the securities in their underlying portfolios rounded to the fourth decimal place (e.g.,
$1.0000), i.e., transact at a “floating” NAV. We also are adopting amendments that will give the
boards of directors of money market funds new tools to stem heavy redemptions by giving them
discretion to impose a liquidity fee of no more than 2% if a fund’s weekly liquidity level falls
below the required regulatory amount, and are giving them discretion to suspend redemptions
temporarily, i.e., to “gate” funds, under the same circumstances. These amendments will require
all non-government money market funds to impose a liquidity fee of 1% if the fund’s weekly
liquidity level falls below 10% of total assets, unless the fund’s board determines that imposing
such a fee is not in the best interests of the fund (or that a higher fee up to 2% or a lower fee is in
the best interests of the fund). In addition, we are adopting amendments designed to make
money market funds more resilient by increasing the diversification of their portfolios,
enhancing their stress testing, and increasing transparency by requiring them to report additional
information to us and to investors. Finally, the amendments require investment advisers to
certain large unregistered liquidity funds, which can have similar economic features as money

15

market funds, to provide additional information about those funds to us. 29

BACKGROUND
A.

Role of Money Market Funds

As we discussed in the Proposing Release, the combination of principal stability,
liquidity, and short-term yields offered by money market funds, which is unlike that offered by
other types of mutual funds, has made money market funds popular cash management vehicles
for both retail and institutional investors. 30 Money market funds’ ability to maintain a stable
share price contributes to their popularity. The funds’ stable share price facilitates their role as a
cash management vehicle, provides tax and administrative convenience to both money market
funds and their shareholders, and enhances money market funds’ attractiveness as an investment
option. 31 Due to their popularity with investors, money market fund assets have grown over
time, providing them with substantial amounts of cash to invest. As a result, money market
funds have become an important source of financing in certain segments of the short-term
financing markets. As a result, rule 2a-7, in addition to facilitating money market funds’
maintenance of stable share prices, also benefits investors by making available an investment
29

We note that we have consulted and coordinated with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regarding
this final rulemaking in accordance with section 1027(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act.

30

See Proposing Release supra note 25, at section II.A. Retail investors use money market funds for a variety
of reasons, including, for example, to hold cash for short or long periods of time or to take a temporary
“defensive position” in anticipation of declining equity markets. Institutional investors commonly use
money market funds for cash management in part because, as discussed later in this Release, money market
funds provide efficient diversified cash management due both to the scale of their operations and money
market fund managers’ expertise. See infra notes 63-64 and accompanying text.

31

See, e.g., Comment Letter of UBS Global Asset Management (Sept. 16, 2013) (“UBS Comment Letter”)
(“Historically, money funds have offered both retail and institutional investors a means of achieving a
market rate of return on short-term investment without having to sacrifice stability of principal. The stable
NAV per share also allows investors the convenience of not having to track immaterial gains and losses,
and helps facilitate investment processes, such as sweep account arrangements…”).

16

option that provides an efficient and diversified means for investors to participate in the shortterm financing markets through a portfolio of short-term, high-quality debt securities. 32
In order for money market funds to use techniques to value and price their shares
generally not permitted to other mutual funds, rule 2a-7 imposes additional protective conditions
on money market funds. 33 As discussed in the Proposing Release, these additional conditions are
designed to make money market funds’ use of the valuation and pricing techniques permitted by
rule 2a-7 consistent with the protection of investors, and more generally, to make available an
investment option for investors that seek an efficient way to obtain short-term yields.
We understand, and considered when developing the final amendments we are adopting
today, that money market funds are a popular investment product and that they provide many
benefits to investors and to the short-term financing markets. Indeed, it is for these reasons that
we designed these amendments to make the funds more resilient, as discussed throughout this
Release, while preserving, to the extent possible, the benefits of money market funds. But as
discussed in section III.K.1 below, we recognize that these reforms may make certain money
market funds less attractive to some investors.
B.

Certain Economic Features of Money Market Funds

As discussed in detail in the Proposing Release, the combination of several features of
money market funds can create an incentive for their shareholders to redeem shares heavily in
32

See, e.g., Comment Letter of the Investment Company Institute (Sept. 17, 2013) (“ICI Comment Letter”)
(“Today over 61 million retail investors, as well as corporations, municipalities, and institutional investors
rely on the $2.6 trillion money market fund industry as a low cost, efficient cash management tool that
provides a high degree of liquidity, stability of principal value, and a market based yield.”).

33

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter (“Money market funds owe their success, in large part to the stringent
regulatory requirements to which they are subject under federal securities laws, including most notably
Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act.”).

17

periods of market stress. We discuss these factors below, as well as the harm that can result from
such heavy redemptions in money market funds.
1.

Money Market Fund Investors’ Desire to Avoid Loss

Investors in money market funds have varying investment goals and tolerances for risk.
Many investors use money market funds for principal preservation and as a cash management
tool, and, consequently, these funds can attract investors who are less tolerant of incurring even
small losses, even at the cost of forgoing higher expected returns. 34 Such investors may be loss
averse for many reasons, including general risk tolerance, legal or investment restrictions, or
short-term cash needs. These overarching considerations may create incentives for money
market fund investors to redeem and would be expected to persist, even if the other incentives
discussed below, such as those created by money market fund valuation and pricing, are
addressed.
The desire to avoid loss may cause investors to redeem from money market funds in
times of stress in a “flight to quality.” For example, as discussed in the DERA Study, one
explanation for the heavy redemptions from prime money market funds and purchases in
government money market fund shares during the financial crisis may be a flight to quality,
given that most of the assets held by government money market funds have a lower default risk
than the assets of prime money market funds. 35
34

See, e.g., PWG Comment Letter of Investment Company Institute (Apr. 19, 2012) (available in File No.
4-619) (“ICI Apr. 2012 PWG Comment Letter”) (enclosing a survey commissioned by the Investment
Company Institute and conducted by Treasury Strategies, Inc. finding, among other things, that 94% of
respondents rated safety of principal as an “extremely important” factor in their money market fund
investment decisions and 64% ranked safety of principal as the “primary driver” of their money market
fund investment).

35

One study documented that investors redirected assets from prime money market funds into government

18

2.

Liquidity Risks

When investors begin to redeem a substantial amount of shares, a fund can experience a
loss of liquidity. Money market funds, which offer investors the ability to redeem shares upon
demand, often will first use internal liquidity to satisfy substantial redemptions. A money market
fund has three sources of internal liquidity to meet redemption requests: cash on hand, cash from
investors purchasing shares, and cash from maturing securities. If these internal sources of
liquidity are insufficient to satisfy redemption requests on any particular day, money market
funds may be forced to sell portfolio securities to raise additional cash. 36 And because the
secondary market for many portfolio securities is not deeply liquid, funds may have to sell
securities at a discount from their amortized cost value, or even at fire-sale prices, 37 thereby
incurring additional losses that may have been avoided if the funds had sufficient internal
money market funds during September 2008. See Russ Wermers, et al., Runs on Money Market Funds
(Jan. 2, 2013), available at
http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/files/Documents/Centers/CFP/WermersMoneyFundRuns.pdf (“Wermers
Study”). Another study found that redemption activity in money market funds during the financial crisis
was higher for riskier money market funds. See Patrick E. McCabe, The Cross Section of Money Market
Fund Risks and Financial Crises, Federal Reserve Board Finance and Economic Discussion Series Paper
No. 2010-51 (2010) (“Cross Section”).
36

See, e.g., Comment Letter of Goldman Sachs Asset Management L.P. (Sept. 17, 2013) (“Goldman Sachs
Comment Letter”) (“A money fund faced with heavy redemptions could suffer a loss of liquidity that
would force the untimely sale of portfolio securities at losses.”). We note that, although the Investment
Company Act permits a money market fund to borrow money from a bank, see section 18(f) of the
Investment Company Act, such loans, assuming the proceeds of which are paid out to meet redemptions,
create liabilities that must be reflected in the fund’s shadow price, and thus will contribute to the stresses
that may force the fund to “break the buck.”

37

Money market funds normally meet redemptions by disposing of their more liquid assets, rather than
selling a pro rata slice of all their holdings. See, e.g., Jonathan Witmer, Does the Buck Stop Here? A
Comparison of Withdrawals from Money Market Mutual Funds with Floating and Constant Share Prices,
Bank of Canada Working Paper 2012-25 (Aug. 2012) (“Witmer”), available at
http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wp2012-25.pdf. “Fire sales” refer to situations
when securities deviate from their information-efficient values typically as a result of sale price pressure.
For an overview of the theoretical and empirical research on asset “fire sales,” see Andrei Shleifer &
Robert Vishny, Fire Sales in Finance and Macroeconomics, 25 JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,
Winter 2011, at 29-48 (“Fire Sales”).

19

liquidity. 38 This alone can cause a fund’s portfolio to lose value. In addition, redemptions that
deplete a fund’s most liquid assets can have incremental adverse effects because the fund is left
with fewer liquid assets, necessitating the sale of less liquid assets, potentially at a discount, to
meet further redemption requests. 39 Knowing that such liquidity costs may occur, money market
fund investors may have an incentive to redeem quickly in times of stress to avoid realizing these
potential liquidity costs, leaving remaining shareholders to bear these costs.
3.

Valuation and Pricing Methods

Money market funds are unique among mutual funds in that rule 2a-7 permits them to use
the amortized cost method of valuation and the penny-rounding method of pricing for their entire
portfolios. As discussed above, these valuation and pricing techniques allow a money market
fund to sell and redeem shares at a stable share price without regard to small variations in the
value of the securities in its portfolio, and thus to maintain a stable $1.00 share price under most
market conditions.
Although the stable $1.00 share price calculated using these methods provides a close
approximation to market value under normal market conditions, differences may exist when
market conditions shift due to changes in interest rates, credit risk, and liquidity. 40 The market

38

The DERA Study examined whether money market funds are more resilient to redemptions following the
2010 reforms and notes that, “As expected, the results show that funds with a 30 percent [weekly liquid
asset requirement] are more resilient to both portfolio losses and investor redemptions” than those funds
without a 30 percent weekly liquid asset requirement. DERA Study, supra note 24, at 37.

39

See, e.g., Comment Letter of MSCI Inc. (Sept. 17, 2013) (“MSCI Comment Letter”) (“The need to provide
liquidity provides another set of incentives, as early redeemers may exhaust the fund’s internal sources of
liquidity (cash on hand, cash from maturing securities, etc.), leaving possibly distressed security sales as the
only source of liquidity for late redeemers.”).

40

We note that the vast majority of money market fund portfolio securities are not valued based on market
prices obtained through secondary market trading because most portfolio securities such as commercial
paper, repos, and certificates of deposit are not actively traded in a secondary market. Accordingly, most

20

value of a money market fund’s portfolio securities also may experience relatively large changes
if a portfolio asset defaults or its credit profile deteriorates. 41 Today, unless the fund “breaks the
buck,” market value differences are reflected only in a fund’s shadow price, and not the share
price at which the fund satisfies purchase and redemption transactions.
Deviations that arise from changes in interest rates and credit risk are temporary as long
as securities are held to maturity, because amortized cost values and market-based values
converge at maturity. But if a portfolio asset defaults or an asset sale results in a realized capital
gain or loss, deviations between the stable $1.00 share price and the shadow price become
permanent. For example, if a portfolio experiences a 25 basis point loss because an issuer
defaults, the fund’s shadow price falls from $1.0000 to $0.9975. Even though the fund has not
broken the buck, this reduction is permanent and can only be reversed internally in the event that
the fund realizes a capital gain elsewhere in the portfolio, which generally is unlikely given the
types of securities in which money market funds typically invest and the tax requirements for
these funds. 42
If a money market fund’s shadow price deviates far enough from its stable $1.00 share
price, investors may have an economic incentive to redeem their shares. For example, investors

money market fund portfolio securities are valued largely through “mark-to-model” or “matrix pricing”
estimates, which often use market inputs, as well as other factors in their pricing models. See Proposing
Release, supra note 25, at n.27. See also infra section III.D.2.
41

The credit quality standards in rule 2a-7 are designed to minimize the likelihood of such a default or credit
deterioration.

42

In practice, a money market fund cannot use future portfolio earnings to restore its shadow price because
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code requires money market funds to distribute virtually all of their
earnings to investors. These tax requirements can cause permanent reductions in shadow prices to persist
over time, even if a fund’s other portfolio securities are otherwise unimpaired.

21

may have an incentive to redeem shares when a fund’s shadow price is less than $1.00. 43 If
investors redeem shares when the shadow price is less than $1.00, the fund’s shadow price will
decline even further because portfolio losses are spread across the remaining, smaller asset base.
If enough shares are redeemed, a fund can “break the buck” due, in part, to heavy investor
redemptions and the concentration of losses across a shrinking asset base. 44 In times of stress,
this alone provides an incentive for investors to redeem shares ahead of other investors: early
redeemers get $1.00 per share, whereas later redeemers may get less than $1.00 per share even if
the fund experiences no further losses. 45
We note that although defaults in assets held by money market funds are low probability
events, the resulting losses can lead to a fund breaking the buck if the default occurs in a position
that is greater than 0.5% of the fund’s assets, as was the case in the Reserve Primary Fund’s
investment in Lehman Brothers commercial paper in September 2008. 46 And as discussed
further in section III.C.2.a of this Release, money market funds hold significant numbers of such
larger positions. 47

43

See, e.g., Comment Letter of the Systemic Risk Council (Sept. 16, 2013) (“Systemic Risk Council
Comment Letter”) (“If the fund’s assets are worth less than a $1.00- and you can redeem at $1.00- the
remaining shareholders are effectively paying first movers to run. This embeds permanent losses in the
fund for the remaining holders.”).

44

See, e.g., MSCI Comment Letter (“[W]hen a fund’s market-based NAV falls significantly below its stable
NAV, an early redeemer not only benefits from this price discrepancy, but also puts downward pressure on
the market-based NAV for the remaining investors (as the realized losses on the fund’s assets must be
shared across a smaller investor base).”).

45

For an example illustrating this incentive, see Proposing Release, supra note 25, at text following n.31.

recommendations, solicited and received comments from the public (FSOC Comment File, File No. FSOC2012-0003, available at http://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=FSOC-2012-0003), some of which
have made similar observations about the concentration and size of money market fund holdings. See, e.g.,

4.

Investors’ Misunderstanding about the Actual Risk of Investing in Money
Market Funds

Lack of investor understanding and lack of complete transparency concerning the risks
posed by particular money market funds can contribute to heavy redemptions during periods of
stress. This lack of investor understanding and complete transparency can come from several
different sources.
First, if investors do not know a fund’s shadow price and/or its underlying portfolio
holdings (or if previous disclosures of this information are no longer accurate), investors may not
be able to fully understand the degree of risk in the underlying portfolio. 48 In such an
environment, a default of a large-scale commercial paper issuer, such as a bank holding
company, could accelerate redemption activity across many funds because investors may not
know which funds (if any) hold defaulted securities. Investors may respond by initiating
redemptions to avoid potential rather than actual losses in a “flight to transparency.” 49 Because

Comment Letter of Harvard Business School Professors Samuel Hanson, David Scharfstein, & Adi
Sunderam (Jan. 8, 2013) (“Harvard Business School FSOC Comment Letter”) (noting that “prime MMFs
mainly invest in money-market instruments issued by large, global banks” and providing information about
the size of the holdings of “the 50 largest non-government issuers of money market instruments held by
prime MMFs as of May 2012”).
48

See, e.g., DERA Study, supra note 24, at 31 (stating that although disclosures on Form N-MFP have
improved fund transparency, “it must be remembered that funds file the form on a monthly basis with no
interim updates,” and that “[t]he Commission also makes the information public with a 60-day lag, which
may cause it to be stale”). As discussed in section III.E.9.c, a number of money market funds have begun
voluntarily disclosing information about their portfolio assets, liquidity, and shadow NAV on a more
frequent basis than required, in part to address investor concerns regarding the staleness of information
about fund holdings. The final amendments we are adopting today include a number of regulatory
requirements designed to enhance transparency of money market risks, including daily disclosure of liquid
assets, shareholder flows, current NAV and shadow NAV on fund websites, and elimination of the 60 day
lag on public disclosure of Form N-MFP data. See infra section III.G.1.

See Nicola Gennaioli, Andrei Shleifer & Robert Vishny, Neglected Risks, Financial Innovation, and
Financial Fragility, 104 J. FIN. ECON. 453 (2012) (“A small piece of news that brings to investors’ minds

23

many money market funds hold securities from the same issuer, investors may respond to a lack
of transparency about specific fund holdings by redeeming assets from funds that are believed to
be holding the same or highly correlated positions. 50
Second, money market funds’ sponsors on a number of occasions have voluntarily
chosen to provide financial support for their money market funds. 51 The reasons that sponsors
have done so include keeping a fund from re-pricing below its stable value, protecting the
sponsors’ reputations or brands, and increasing a fund’s shadow price if its sponsor believes
investors avoid funds that have low shadow prices. Prior to the changes that we are adopting
today, funds were not required to disclose instances of sponsor support outside of financial
statements; as a result, sponsor support has not been fully transparent to investors and this, in
turn, may have lessened some investors’ understanding of the risk in money market funds. 52

substitutes for the traditional ones, they fly to safety, dumping these securities on the market and buying the
truly safe ones.”).

See Comment Letter of Federal Reserve of Boston (Sept. 12, 2013) (“Boston Federal Reserve Comment
Letter”) (“Investors in other MMMFs may in turn run if they perceive that their funds are similar (e.g.
similar portfolio composition, similar maturity profile, similar investor concentration) to the fund that
experienced the initial run.”); see infra notes 58-59 and accompanying text. Based on Form N-MFP data as
of February 28, 2014, there were 27 different issuers whose securities were held by more than 100 prime
money market funds.

51

In the Proposing Release we requested comment on amending rule 17a-9 (which allows for discretionary
support of money market funds by their sponsors and other affiliates) to potentially restrict the practice of
sponsor support, but did not propose any specific changes. Most commenters who addressed our request
for comment on amending rule 17a-9 opposed making any changes to rule 17a-9, arguing that the
transactions facilitated by the rule are in the best interests of the shareholders. See Comment Letter of the
Investment Company Institute (Sept. 17, 2013) (“ICI Comment Letter”); Comment Letter of the Dreyfus
Corporation (Sept. 17, 2013) (“Dreyfus Comment Letter”); Comment Letter of American Bar Association
Business Law Section (Sept. 30, 2013) (“ABA Business Law Comment Letter”). One commenter
supported amending rule 17a-9, arguing that these transactions can result in shareholders having unjustified
expectations of future support being provided by sponsors. Comment Letter of HSBC Global Asset
Management (Sept. 17, 2013) (“HSBC Comment Letter”). In light of these comments, we are not
amending rule 17a-9 at this time. See also infra section III.E.7.a.

52

See, e.g., HSBC Comment Letter (“[A] level of ambiguity about who owns the risk when investing in a
MMF has developed amongst some investors. Some investors have been encouraged to expect sponsors to

24

Instances of discretionary sponsor support were relatively common during the financial
crisis. For example, during the period from September 16, 2008 to October 1, 2008, a number of
money market fund sponsors purchased large amounts of portfolio securities from their money
market funds or provided capital support to the funds (or received staff no-action assurances in
order to provide support). 53 But the financial crisis is not the only instance in which some money
market funds have come under strain, although it is unique in the number of money market funds
that requested or received sponsor support. 54 As noted in the Proposing Release, since 1989, 11
other financial events have been sufficiently adverse that certain fund sponsors chose to provide
support or to seek staff no-action assurances in order to provide support, potentially affecting
158 different money market funds. 55
Finally, the government assistance provided to money market funds during the financial

support their MMFs. Such expectations cannot be enforced, since managers are under no obligation to
support their funds, and consequently leads some investors to misunderstand and misprice the risks they are
subject to.”) (emphasis in original).
53

Our staff estimated that during the period from August 2007 to December 31, 2008, almost 20% of all
money market funds received some support (or staff no-action assurances concerning support) from their
money managers or their affiliates. We note that not all such support required no-action assurances from
Commission staff (for example, fund affiliates were able to purchase defaulted Lehman Brothers securities
from fund portfolios under rule 17a-9 under the Investment Company Act without the need for any noaction assurances). See, e.g., http://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/im-noaction.shtml#money.
Commission staff provided no-action assurances to 100 money market funds in 18 different fund groups so
that the fund groups could enter into such arrangements. Although a number of advisers to money market
funds obtained staff no-action assurances in order to provide sponsor support, several did not subsequently
provide the support because it was not necessary. See, e.g., Comment Letter of the Dreyfus Corporation
(Aug. 7, 2012) (available in File No. 4 619) (“Dreyfus III Comment Letter”) (stating that no-action relief to
provide sponsor support “was sought by many money funds as a precautionary measure”).

54

See Moody’s Investors Service Special Comment, Sponsor Support Key to Money Market Funds (Aug. 9,
2010) (“Moody’s Sponsor Support Report”). Interest rate changes, issuer defaults, and credit rating
downgrades can lead to significant valuation losses for individual funds.

55

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at section II.B.3. We note, as discussed more fully in the Proposing
Release, that although these events affected money market funds and their sponsors, there is no evidence
that these events caused systemic problems, most likely because the events were isolated either to a single
entity or class of security and because sponsor support prevented any funds from breaking the buck.

25

crisis may have contributed to investors’ perceptions that the risk of loss in money market funds
is low. 56 If investors perceive that money market funds have an implicit government guarantee,
they may believe that money market funds are safer investments than they in fact are and may
underestimate the potential risk of loss. 57
C.

Effects on Other Money Market Funds, Investors, and the Short-Term
Financing Markets

In this section, we discuss how stress at one money market fund can be positively
correlated across money market funds in at least two ways. Some market observers have noted
that if a money market fund suffers a loss on one of its portfolio securities—whether because of
a deterioration in credit quality, for example, or because the fund sold the security at a discount
to its amortized-cost value—other money market funds holding the same security may have to
reflect the resultant discounts in their shadow prices. 58 Any resulting decline in the shadow
prices of other funds could, in turn, lead to a contagion effect that could spread even further as
investors run from money market funds in general. For example, some commenters have
observed that many money market fund holdings tend to be highly correlated, making it more
likely that multiple money market funds will experience contemporaneous decreases in shadow
prices. 59

perception, see Proposing Release, supra note 25, at nn.60-61 and accompanying text.

funds holdings, and noting that as of the end of June 2013, the 20 largest corporate issuers accounted for

26

As discussed above, in times of stress, if investors do not wish to be exposed to a
distressed issuer (or correlated issuers) but do not know which money market funds own these
distressed securities at any given time, investors may redeem from any money market fund that
could own the security (e.g., redeeming from all prime funds). 60 A fund that did not own the
security and was not otherwise under stress could nonetheless experience heavy redemptions
which, as discussed above, could themselves ultimately cause the fund to experience losses if it
does not have adequate liquidity.
As was experienced by money market funds during the financial crisis, liquidity-induced
contagion may have negative effects on investors and the markets for short-term financing of
corporations, banks, and governments. This is in large part because of the significance of money
market funds’ role in the short-term financing markets. 61 Indeed, money market funds had
experienced steady growth before the financial crisis, driven in part by growth in the size of
institutional cash pools, which grew from under $100 billion in 1990 to almost $4 trillion just
before the financial crisis. 62 Money market funds’ suitability for cash management operations

funds seem to have been driven both by strategic externalities…and information.”).

also has made them popular among corporate treasurers, municipalities, and other institutional
investors, some of which rely on money market funds for their cash management operations
because the funds provide diversified cash management more efficiently due both to the scale of
their operations and the expertise of money market fund managers. 63 For example, according to
one survey, approximately 16% of organizations’ short-term investments were allocated to
money market funds (and, according to this survey, this figure is down from almost 40% in 2008
due in part to the reallocation of cash investments to bank deposits following temporary
unlimited Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation deposit insurance for non-interest bearing bank
transaction accounts, which expired at the end of 2012). 64
Money market funds’ size and significance in the short-term markets, together with their
features that can create an incentive to redeem as discussed above, have led to concerns that

Risk, unofficial transcript (May 10, 2011), available at http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/mmf-risk/mmf-risktranscript-051011.htm (“Roundtable Transcript”) (Kathryn L. Hewitt, Government Finance Officers
Association) (“Most of us don’t have the time, the energy, or the resources at our fingertips to analyze the
credit quality of every security ourselves. So we’re in essence, by going into a pooled fund, hiring that
expertise for us…it gives us diversification, it gives us immediate cash management needs where we can
move money into and out of it, and it satisfies much of our operating cash investment opportunities.”); see

See 2013 Association for Financial Professionals Liquidity Survey, at 15, available at
http://www.afponline.org/liquidity (subscription required) (“2013 AFP Liquidity Survey”). The size of this
allocation to money market funds is down substantially from prior years. For example, prior AFP Liquidity
Surveys show higher allocations of organizations’ short-term investments to money market funds: almost
40% in the 2008 survey, approximately 25% in the 2009 and 2010 surveys, almost 30% in the 2011 survey,
and 16% in the 2012 survey. This shift has largely reflected a re-allocation of cash investments to bank
deposits, which rose from representing 25% of organizations’ short-term investment allocations in the 2008
Association for Financial Professionals Liquidity Survey, available at
http://www.afponline.org/pub/pdf/2008_Liquidity_Survey.pdf (“2008 AFP Liquidity Survey”), to 50% of
organizations’ short-term investment allocations in the 2013 survey. The 2012 survey noted that some of
this shift has been driven by the temporary unlimited FDIC deposit insurance coverage for non-interest
bearing bank transaction accounts (which expired at the end of 2012) and in which assets have remained
despite the expiration of the insurance. See 2013 AFP Liquidity Survey. As of February 28, 2014,
approximately 67% of money market fund assets were held in money market funds or share classes
intended to be sold to institutional investors according to iMoneyNet data. All of the AFP Liquidity
Surveys are available at http://www.afponline.org.

money market funds may contribute to systemic risk. Heavy redemptions from money market
funds during periods of financial stress can remove liquidity from the financial system,
potentially disrupting other markets. Issuers may have difficulty obtaining capital in the shortterm markets during these periods because money market funds are focused on meeting
redemption requests through internal liquidity generated either from maturing securities or cash
from subscriptions, and thus may be purchasing fewer short-term debt obligations. 65 To the
extent that multiple money market funds experience heavy redemptions, the negative effects on
the short-term markets can be magnified. Money market funds’ experience during the financial
crisis illustrates the impact of heavy redemptions, as we discuss in more detail below.
Heavy redemptions in money market funds may disproportionately affect slow-moving
shareholders because, as discussed further below, redemption data from the financial crisis show
that some institutional investors are likely to redeem from distressed money market funds far
more quickly than other investors and to redeem a greater percentage of their prime fund
holdings. 66 This likely is because some institutional investors generally have more capital at
stake, along with sophisticated tools and professional staffs to monitor risk. Because of their
proportionally larger investments, just a few institutional investors submitting redemption
requests may have a significant effect on a money market fund’s liquidity, while it may take
many more retail investors, with their typically smaller investments sizes, to cause similar
65

See supra text preceding and accompanying note 36. Although money market funds also can build
liquidity internally by retaining (rather than investing) cash from investors purchasing shares, this is not
likely to be a material source of liquidity for a distressed money market fund experiencing heavy
redemptions as a stressed fund may be unlikely to be receiving significant investor purchases during such a
time.

negative consequences. Slower-to-redeem shareholders may be harmed because, as discussed
above, redemptions at a money market fund can concentrate existing losses in the fund or create
new losses if the fund must sell assets at a discount to obtain liquidity to satisfy redemption
requests. In both cases, redemptions leave the fund’s portfolio more likely to lose value, to the
detriment of slower-to-redeem investors. 67 Retail investors—who tend to be slower moving—
also could be harmed if market stress begins at an institutional money market fund and spreads to
other funds, including funds composed solely or primarily of retail investors. 68
D.

The Financial Crisis

The financial crisis in many respects demonstrates the various considerations discussed
above in sections B and C, including the potential implications and harm associated with heavy
redemption from money market funds. 69 On September 16, 2008, the day after Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. announced its bankruptcy, The Reserve Fund announced that its Primary Fund—
which held a $785 million (or 1.2% of the fund’s assets) position in Lehman Brothers
commercial paper—would “break the buck” and price its securities at $0.97 per share. 70 At the

67

See, e.g., DERA Study, supra note 24, at 10 (“Investor redemptions during the financial crisis, particularly
after Lehman’s failure, were heaviest in institutional share classes of prime money market funds, which
typically hold securities that are illiquid relative to government funds. It is possible that sophisticated
investors took advantage of the opportunity to redeem shares to avoid losses, leaving less sophisticated
investors (if co-mingled) to bear the losses.”).

68

As discussed further below, retail money market funds experienced a lower level of redemptions in 2008
than institutional money market funds, although the full predictive power of this empirical evidence is
tempered by the introduction of the Department of Treasury’s (“Treasury Department”) temporary
guarantee program for money market funds, which may have prevented heavier shareholder redemptions
among generally slower-to-redeem retail investors. See infra note 80.

same time, there was turbulence in the market for financial sector securities as a result of other
financial company stresses, including, for example, the near failure of American International
Group (“AIG”), whose commercial paper was held by many prime money market funds. 71
Heavy redemptions in the Reserve Primary Fund were followed by heavy redemptions
from other Reserve money market funds, 72 and soon other institutional prime money market
funds also began to experience heavy redemptions. 73 During the week of September 15, 2008
(the week that Lehman Brothers announced it was filing for bankruptcy), investors withdrew
approximately $300 billion from prime money market funds or 14% of the assets in those
funds. 74 During that time, fearing further redemptions, money market fund managers began to
retain cash rather than invest in commercial paper, certificates of deposit, or other short-term
instruments. 75 Short-term financing markets froze, impairing access to credit, and those who

market funds. Some money market funds had redemptions well in excess of 14% of their assets. Based on

money market fund during the financial crisis was over 64% of the fund’s assets.

Figure 1, below, provides context for the redemptions that occurred during the financial
crisis. Specifically, it shows daily total net assets over time, where the vertical line indicates the
date that Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, September 15, 2008. Investor redemptions
during the financial crisis, particularly after Lehman’s failure, were heaviest in institutional share
classes of prime money market funds, which typically hold securities that are less liquid and of
lower credit quality than those typically held by government money market funds. The figure
shows that institutional share classes of government money market funds, which include
Treasury and government funds, experienced heavy inflows. 77 The aggregate level of retail
investor redemption activity, in contrast, was not particularly high during September and October
2008, as shown in Figure 1. 78

of the Federal Open Market Committee, news articles, Federal Reserve Board data on commercial paper
spreads over Treasury bills, and books and academic articles on the financial crisis). Commenters have
stated that money market funds were not the only investors in the short-term financing markets that reduced
or halted investment in commercial paper and other riskier short-term debt securities during the financial
crisis. See, e.g., Comment Letter of Investment Company Institute (Jan. 24, 2013) (available in File No.
FSOC-2012-0003) (“ICI Jan. 24 FSOC Comment Letter”).

77

As discussed in section III.C.1 government money market funds historically have faced different
redemption pressures in times of stress and have different risk characteristics than other money market
funds because of their unique portfolio composition, which typically have lower credit default risk and
greater liquidity than non-government portfolio securities typically held by money market funds.

78

We understand that iMoneyNet differentiates retail and institutional money market funds based on factors
such as minimum initial investment amount and how the fund provider self-categorizes the fund, which
does not necessarily correlate with how we define retail funds in this Release.

On September 19, 2008, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“Treasury Department”)
announced a temporary guarantee program (“Temporary Guarantee Program”), which would use
the $50 billion Exchange Stabilization Fund to support more than $3 trillion in shares of money
market funds, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System authorized the
temporary extension of credit to banks to finance their purchase of high-quality asset-backed
commercial paper from money market funds. 79 These programs successfully slowed
redemptions in prime money market funds and provided additional liquidity to money market
funds. As discussed in the Proposing Release, the disruptions to the short-term markets detailed
above could have continued for a longer period of time but for these programs. 80

E.

Examination of Money Market Fund Regulation since the Financial Crisis
1.

The 2010 Amendments

After the events of the financial crisis, in March 2010, we adopted a number of
amendments to rule 2a-7. 81 These amendments were designed to make money market funds
more resilient by reducing the interest rate, credit, and liquidity risks of fund asset portfolios. 82
More specifically, the amendments decreased money market funds’ credit risk exposure by
further restricting the amount of lower quality securities that funds can hold. 83 The amendments,
for the first time, also required that money market funds maintain liquidity buffers in the form of
specified levels of daily and weekly liquid assets. 84 These liquidity buffers provide a source of
internal liquidity and are intended to help funds withstand high levels of redemptions during
times of market illiquidity. The amendments also reduce money market funds’ exposure to
81

2010 Adopting Release, supra note 17.

82

Commenters have noted the importance of the 2010 reforms in enhancing the resiliency of money market
funds. See, e.g., Comment Letter of Invesco Ltd. (Sept. 17, 2013) (“Invesco Comment Letter”) (“In
evaluating the reforms contained in the Proposed Rule it is also important to take into account the
significant impact of the reforms implemented by the Commission in 2010, which amounted to a
comprehensive overhaul of the regulatory framework governing MMFs.”).

83

Specifically, the amendments placed tighter limits on a money market fund’s ability to acquire “second
tier” securities by (1) restricting a money market fund from investing more than 3% of its assets in second
tier securities (rather than the previous limit of 5%), (2) restricting a money market fund from investing
more than ½ of 1% of its assets in second tier securities issued by any single issuer (rather than the previous
limit of the greater of 1% or $1 million), and (3) restricting a money market fund from buying second tier
securities that mature in more than 45 days (rather than the previous limit of 397 days). See rule
2a-7(c)(3)(ii) and (c)(4)(i)(C). Second tier securities are eligible securities that, if rated, have received
other than the highest short-term term debt rating from the requisite NRSROs or, if unrated, have been
determined by the fund’s board of directors to be of comparable quality. See current rule 2a-7(a)(24)
(defining “second tier security”); current rule 2a-7(a)(12) (defining “eligible security”); current rule 2a7(a)(23) (defining “requisite NRSROs”). Today, in a companion release, we are also re-proposing to
remove NRSRO rating references from rule 2a-7 and Form N-MFP.

84

The requirements are that, for all taxable money market funds, at least 10% of assets must be in cash, U.S.
Treasury securities, or securities that convert into cash (e.g., mature) within one day and, for all money
market funds, at least 30% of assets must be in cash, U.S. Treasury securities, certain other Government
securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less, or securities that convert into cash within one week.
See current rule 2a-7(c)(5)(ii) and (iii).

34

interest rate risk by decreasing the maximum weighted average maturities of fund portfolios
from 90 to 60 days. 85
In addition to reducing the risk profile of the underlying money market fund portfolios,
the reforms increased the amount of information that money market funds are required to report
to the Commission and the public. Money market funds are now required to submit to the
Commission monthly information on their portfolio holdings using Form N-MFP. 86 This
information allows the Commission, investors, and third parties to monitor compliance with rule
2a-7 and to better understand and monitor the underlying risks of money market fund portfolios.
Money market funds also are now required to post portfolio information on their websites each
month, providing investors with important information to help them make better-informed
investment decisions. 87
Finally, the 2010 amendments require money market funds to undergo stress tests under
the direction of the board of directors on a periodic basis. 88 Under this stress testing requirement,
each fund must periodically test its ability to maintain a stable NAV per share based upon certain
hypothetical events, including an increase in short-term interest rates, an increase in shareholder
redemptions, a downgrade of or default on portfolio securities, and widening or narrowing of
spreads between yields on an appropriate benchmark selected by the fund for overnight interest
rates and commercial paper and other types of securities held by the fund. This reform was
85

The 2010 amendments also introduced a weighted average life requirement of 120 days, which limits the
money market fund’s ability to invest in longer-term floating rate securities. See current rule 2a-7(c)(2)(ii)
and (iii).

intended to provide money market fund boards and the Commission a better understanding of the
risks to which the fund is exposed and give fund managers a tool to better manage those risks. 89
2.

The Eurozone Debt Crisis and U.S. Debt Ceiling Impasses of 2011 and
2013

Several significant market events since our 2010 reforms have permitted us to evaluate
the efficacy of those reforms. Specifically, in the summer of 2011, the Eurozone sovereign debt
crisis and an impasse over the U.S. Government’s debt ceiling unfolded, and during the fall of
2013 another U.S. Government debt ceiling impasse occurred.
While it is difficult to isolate the effects of the 2010 amendments, these events highlight
the potential increased resilience of money market funds after the reforms were adopted. Most
significantly, no money market fund needed to re-price below its stable $1.00 share price. As
discussed in greater detail in the Proposing Release, as a result of concerns about exposure to
European financial institutions, in the summer of 2011, prime money market funds began
experiencing substantial redemptions. 90 But unlike September 2008, money market funds did not
experience meaningful capital losses in the summer of 2011 (or as discussed below, in the fall of
2013), and the funds’ shadow prices did not deviate significantly from the funds’ stable share
prices. Also unlike in 2008, money market funds had sufficient liquidity to satisfy investors’
89

See 2009 Proposing Release, supra note 66, at section II.C.3.

90

See Proposing Release supra note 25, at section II.D.2; DERA Study, supra note 24, at 32. Assets held by
prime money market funds declined by approximately $100 billion (or 6%) during a three-week period
beginning June 14, 2011. Some prime money market funds had redemptions of almost 20% of their assets
in each of June, July, and August 2011, and one fund had redemptions of 23% of its assets during that
period after articles began to appear in the financial press that warned of indirect exposure of money
market funds to Greece. Investors purchased shares of government money market funds in late June and
early July in response to these concerns, but then began redeeming government money market fund shares
in late July and early August, likely as a result of concerns about the U.S. debt ceiling impasse and possible
ratings downgrades of government securities. See Proposing Release supra note 25, at section II.D.2.

36

redemption requests, which were submitted at a lower rate and over a longer period than in 2008,
suggesting that the 2010 amendments acted as intended to enhance the resiliency of money
market funds. 91
In 2013, another debt ceiling impasse took place, 92 although over a longer time period
and without the Eurozone crisis as a backdrop. During the worst two-week period of the 2013
crisis, October 3rd through October 16th, government and treasury money market funds
experienced combined outflows of $54.4 billion, which was 6.1% of total assets, with
approximately 1.5% of assets flowing out of these funds on October 11th, the single worst day
for outflows of the 2013 impasse. Importantly, despite these outflows, fund shadow prices were
largely unaffected during this time period. Once the impasse was resolved, assets flowed back
into these funds, returning government and treasury money market funds to a pre-crisis asset
level before the end of the year, indicating their resiliency. 93
Although money market funds’ experiences differed in 2008 and in the Eurozone crisis,
the heavy redemptions money market funds experienced in both periods appear to have
negatively affected the markets for short-term financing in similar ways. Academics researching
these issues have found, as detailed in the DERA Study, that “creditworthy issuers may
encounter financing difficulties because of risk taking by the funds from which they raise
91

DERA Study, supra note 24, at 33-34. We note that the redemptions in the summer of 2011 also did not
take place against the backdrop of a broader financial crisis, and therefore may have reflected more targeted
concerns by investors (concern about exposure to the Eurozone and U.S. government securities as the debt
ceiling impasse unfolded). Money market funds’ experience in 2008, in contrast, may have reflected a
broader range of concerns as reflected in the DERA Study, which discusses a number of possible
explanations for redemptions during the financial crisis. Id. at 7-13.

financing”; “local branches of foreign banks reduced lending to U.S. entities in 2011”; and that
“European banks that were more reliant on money funds experienced bigger declines in dollar
lending.” 94 Thus, while such redemptions often exemplify rational risk management by money
market fund investors, they can also have certain contagion effects on the short-term financing
markets. Again, despite these similar effects, the 2010 reforms demonstrated that money market
funds are potentially more resilient today than in 2008.
3.

Continuing Consideration of the Need for Additional Reforms

As discussed in greater detail in the Proposing Release, when we adopted the 2010
amendments, we acknowledged that money market funds’ experience during the financial crisis
raised questions of whether more fundamental changes to money market funds might be
warranted. 95 The DERA Study, discussed throughout this Release, has informed our
consideration of the risks that may be posed by money market funds and our formulation of
today’s final rules and rule amendments. The DERA Study contains, among other things, a
detailed analysis of our 2010 amendments to rule 2a-7 and some of the amendments’ effects to
date, including changes in some of the characteristics of money market funds, the likelihood that

effect on short-term funding liquidity in the U.S. commercial paper market. Chernenko and Sunderam

funds from which they raise financing.’ Similarly, Correa, Sapriza, and Zlate (2012) finds U.S. branches of

a fund with the maximum permitted weighted average maturity (“WAM”) would “break the
buck” before and after the 2010 reforms, money market funds’ experience during the 2011
Eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the 2011 U.S. debt-ceiling impasse, and how money market
funds would have performed during September 2008 had the 2010 reforms been in place at that
time. 96
In particular, the DERA Study found that under certain assumptions the expected
probability of a money market fund breaking the buck was lower with the additional liquidity
required by the 2010 reforms. 97 For example, funds in 2011 had sufficient liquidity to withstand
investors’ redemptions during the summer of 2011. 98 The fact that no fund experienced a credit
event during that time also contributed to the evidence that funds were able to withstand
relatively heavy redemptions while maintaining a stable $1.00 share price. Finally, using actual
portfolio holdings from September 2008, the DERA Study analyzed how funds would have
performed during the financial crisis had the 2010 reforms been in place at that time. While
funds holding 30% weekly liquid assets are more resilient to portfolio losses, funds will “break
the buck” with near certainty if capital losses of the fund's non-weekly liquid assets exceed
1%. 99 The DERA Study concludes that the 2010 reforms would have been unlikely to prevent a
fund from breaking the buck when faced with large credit losses like the ones experienced in

2008. 100 Based on the DERA Study, we believe that, although the 2010 reforms were an
important step in making money market funds better able to withstand heavy redemptions when
there are no portfolio losses (as was the case in the summer of 2011 and the fall of 2013), these
reforms do not sufficiently address the potential future situations when credit losses may cause a
fund’s portfolio to lose value or when the short-term financing markets more generally come
under stress.
After consideration of this data, as well as the comments we received on the proposal, we
believe that the reforms we are adopting today should further help lessen money market funds’
susceptibility to heavy redemptions, improve their ability to manage and mitigate potential
contagion from high levels of redemptions, and increase the transparency of their risks, while
preserving, as much as possible, the benefits of money market funds.
III.
A.

DISCUSSION
Liquidity Fees and Redemption Gates

Today, we are adopting amendments to rule 2a-7 that will authorize new tools for money
market funds to use in times of stress to stem heavy redemptions and avoid the type of contagion
that occurred during the financial crisis. These amendments provide money market funds with
the ability to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates (generally referred to herein as “fees
and gates”) in certain circumstances. 101 Today’s amendments will allow a money market fund to
impose a liquidity fee of up to 2%, or temporarily suspend redemptions (also known as “gate”)

100

To further illustrate the point, the DERA Study noted that the Reserve Primary Fund “would have broken
the buck even in the presence of the 2010 liquidity requirements.” Id. at 37.

101

Under the amendments we are adopting today, government funds are permitted, but not required, to impose
fees and gates, as discussed below. See infra section III.C.1 of this Release.

40

for up to 10 business days in a 90-day period, if the fund’s weekly liquid assets fall below 30%
of its total assets and the fund’s board of directors (including a majority of its independent
directors) determines that imposing a fee or gate is in the fund’s best interests. 102 Additionally,
under today’s amendments, a money market fund will be required to impose a liquidity fee of
1% on all redemptions if its weekly liquid assets fall below 10% of its total assets, unless the
board of directors of the fund (including a majority of its independent directors) determines that
imposing such a fee would not be in the best interests of the fund. 103
These amendments differ in some respects from the fees and gates that we proposed,
which would have required funds to impose a 2% liquidity fee on all redemptions, and would
have permitted the imposition of redemption gates for up to 30 days in a 90-day period, after a
fund’s weekly liquid assets fell below 15% of its total assets. In addition, under our proposal, a
fund’s board (including a majority of independent directors) could have determined not to
impose the liquidity fee or to impose a lower fee. A large number of commenters supported, to
varying degrees and with varying caveats, our fees and gates proposal. 104 Many other
commenters, on the other hand, expressed their opposition to fees and gates. 105 Comments on the

If, at the end of a business day, a fund has invested 30% or more of its total assets in weekly liquid assets,
the fund must cease charging the liquidity fee or imposing the redemption gate, effective as of the
beginning of the next business day. See rule 2a-7(c)(2)(i)(A) and (B), and (ii)(B).

The board also may determine that a lower or higher fee would be in the best interests of the fund. See rule

Analysis of Certain Effects of Fees and Gates 106
a.

Background

As discussed previously, shareholders redeem money market fund shares for a number of
reasons. 107 Shareholders may redeem shares because the current rounding convention in money
market fund valuation and pricing can create incentives for shareholders to redeem shares ahead
of other investors when the market-based NAV per share of a fund is lower than $1.00 per
share. 108 Shareholders also may flee to quality, liquidity, or transparency (or combinations
thereof) during adverse economic events or financial market conditions. 109 Furthermore, in times
of stress, shareholders may simply need or want to withdraw funds for unrelated reasons. In any
case, money market funds may have to absorb quickly high levels of redemptions that exceed
internal sources of liquidity. In these instances, funds will need to sell portfolio securities,
perhaps at a loss either because they incur transitory liquidity costs or they must sell assets at
“fire sale” prices. 110 If fund managers deplete their funds’ most liquid assets first, this may
impose future liquidity costs (that are not reflected in a $1.00 share price based on current
amortized cost valuation) on the non-redeeming shareholders because later redemption requests
must be met by selling less liquid assets. These effects may be heightened if many funds sell
assets at the same time, lowering asset prices. During the financial crisis, for example, securities

108

As discussed in section III.B, the floating NAV amendments help mitigate this incentive for institutional
prime funds by causing redeeming shareholders to receive the market value of redeemed shares.

sales to meet heavy redemptions in money market funds and sales of assets by other investors
created downward price pressure in the market. 111
Liquidity fees and redemption gates have been used successfully in the past by certain
non-money market fund cash management pools to stem redemptions during times of stress. 112
Liquidity fees provide investors continued access to their liquidity (albeit at a cost) while also
reducing the incentives for shareholders to redeem shares. Liquidity fees, however, will not
outright stop redemptions. In contrast to fees, redemption gates stop redemptions altogether, but
do not offer the flexibility of fees. 113 Because redemption gates prevent investors from accessing
their investments for a period of time, a fund may choose to first impose a liquidity fee and then,
if needed, impose a redemption gate.
The fees and gates amendments we are adopting today are designed to address certain

A Florida local government investment pool experienced heavy redemptions in 2007 due to its holdings in
SIV securities. The pool suspended redemptions and ultimately reopened but only after the pool (and each
shareholder’s interest) had been split into two separate pools: one holding the more illiquid securities
previously held by the pool (“Fund B”) and one holding the remaining securities of the pool (“Fund A”).
Fund A reopened, but limited redemptions to up to 15% of an investor’s holdings or $2 million without
penalty, and imposed a 2% redemption fee on any additional redemptions. Fund B remained closed. When
Fund A reopened, it experienced withdrawals, but according to state officials, the withdrawals were
manageable. See Dealbook, NY TIMES, Florida Fund Reopens, and $1.1 Billion is Withdrawn; David
Evans and Darrell Preston, Florida Investment Chief Quits; Fund Rescue Approved, BLOOMBERG (Dec. 4,

Liquidity Fees, available at http://www.immfa.org/publications/policy-positions.html (“Redemption gates
and/or a liquidity fee are methods by which a fund manager, if experiencing difficulty due to extreme
market circumstances, can control redemptions in order to ensure that all investors are treated fairly and
that no ‘first-mover’ advantage exists.”); cf. G.W. Schwert & P. J. Seguin, Securities Transaction Taxes:

issues highlighted by the financial crisis. In particular, the amendments should allow funds to
moderate redemption requests by allocating liquidity costs to those shareholders who impose
such costs on funds through their redemptions and, in certain cases, stop heavy redemptions in
times of market stress by providing fund boards with additional tools to manage heavy
redemptions and improve risk transparency. We understand that based on the level of
redemption activity that occurred during the financial crisis, many money market funds would
have faced liquidity pressures sufficient to cross the liquidity thresholds we are adopting today
that would allow the use of fees and gates. Although no one can predict with certainty what
would have happened if money market funds had operated with fees and gates during the
financial crisis, we believe that money market funds would have been better able to manage the
heavy redemptions that occurred and limit contagion, regardless of the reason for the
redemptions. 114
Fees and gates are just one aspect of the overall package of reforms we are adopting
today. We recognize that fees and gates do not address all of the factors that may lead to heavy
redemptions in money market funds. For example, fees and gates do not fully eliminate the

114

See, e.g., Comment Letter of Mutual Fund Directors Forum (Sept. 16, 2013) (“MFDF Comment Letter”)
(stating, with respect to the proposed fee and gates amendments, “we concur that this approach has the
potential to reduce runs during times of stress or crisis”); UBS Comment Letter (“We agree that liquidity
fees and gates would help money funds address heavy redemptions in an effective manner and limit the
spread of contagion ….”); Form Letter Type D. We also note that some European enhanced cash funds
successfully used fees or gates during the financial crisis to stem redemptions. See Elias Bengtsson,

incentive to redeem ahead of other investors in times of stress 115 or fully prevent investors from
redeeming shares (except during the duration of a temporary gate) to invest in securities with
higher quality, better liquidity, or increased transparency. 116 Fees and gates also do not address
the shareholder dilution that results when a shareholder is able to redeem at a stable NAV that is
higher than the market value of the fund’s underlying portfolio securities. 117 Nonetheless, for the
reasons discussed in this Release, fees and gates provide funds and their boards with additional
tools to stem heavy redemptions and avoid the type of contagion that occurred during the
financial crisis by allocating liquidity costs to those shareholders who impose such costs on
funds and by stopping runs.
i.

Liquidity Fees

During the financial crisis, some funds experienced heavy redemptions. Shareholders
who redeemed shares early bore none of the economic consequences of their redemptions.
Shareholders who remained in the funds, however, faced a declining NAV and an increased
probability that their funds would “break the buck.” As discussed in the Proposing Release and
suggested by commenters, investors may have re-assessed their redemption decisions during the
crisis if money market funds had imposed liquidity fees because they would have been required

115

However, as discussed in section III.B herein, under today’s amendments, institutional prime funds will be
required to float their NAV. This reform is designed, in part, to address the incentive to redeem ahead of
other investors in certain money market funds because of current money market fund valuation and pricing
methods.

116

Fees and gates lessen but do not fully eliminate the incentive for investors to redeem quickly in times of
stress because redeeming shareholders will retain an economic advantage over shareholders who remain in
a fund when liquidity costs are high, but before the fund has imposed fees or gates.

117

In contrast, the floating NAV requirement for institutional prime funds will address this issue. See infra
section III.B.1.

45

to pay at least some of the costs of their redemptions. 118 It is possible that some investors would
have made the economic decision not to redeem because the liquidity fees imposed by the fund
and incurred by an investor would have been certain, whereas potential future losses would have
been uncertain. 119
In addition, liquidity fees would have helped offset the costs of the liquidity provided to
redeeming shareholders and potentially protected the funds’ NAVs because the cash raised from
liquidity fees would create new liquidity for the funds. 120 Additionally, to the extent that
liquidity fees imposed during the crisis could have reduced redemption requests at the margin,
they would have allowed funds to generate liquidity internally as assets matured. By imposing
liquidity costs on redeeming shareholders, liquidity fees, as noted by commenters, also treat
holding and redeeming shareholders more equitably. 121

118

See, e.g., Comment Letter of U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness
(Sept. 17, 2013) (“Chamber II Comment Letter”) (“[I]f shareholders were to be charged a fee when a
MMF’s liquidity costs are at a premium, they may be discouraged from redeeming their shares at that time,
which would have the effect of slowing redemptions in the MMF.”); Comment Letter of Charles Schwab
Investment Management, Inc. (Sept. 12, 2013) (“Schwab Comment Letter”) (“[W]e agree that the proposed
liquidity fee of 2% would be a strong disincentive to redeem during a crisis ….”).

119

See HSBC Comment Letter; see also infra note 152-153 and accompanying text. We acknowledge (as we
did in the Proposing Release) that liquidity fees may not always effectively stave off high levels of
redemptions in a crisis; however, liquidity fees, once imposed, should help reduce the incentive to redeem
shares because investors will pay a fee in connection with their redemptions. See Proposing Release, supra
note 25, at 161.

120

Fees paid by investors that redeem shares should help prevent a fund’s NAV from becoming impaired
based on liquidity costs, as long as the liquidity fee imposed reflects the liquidity cost of redeeming shares.
Fees should also generate additional liquidity to help funds meet redemption requests.

121

See, e.g., Invesco Comment Letter (“Liquidity fees would provide an appropriate and effective means to
ensure that the extra costs associated with raising liquidity to meet fund redemptions during times of
market stress are borne by those responsible for them.”); Comment Letter of J.P. Morgan Asset
Management (Sept. 17, 2013) (“J.P. Morgan Comment Letter”); UBS Comment Letter; but see, e.g.,
Comment Letter of U.S. Bancorp Asset Management, Inc. (Sept. 16, 2013) (“U.S. Bancorp Comment
Letter”) (suggesting that liquidity fees harm those that redeem after the fees are imposed and that gates
harm those that remain in the fund after the gate is in place).

46

Liquidity fees, which we believe would rarely be imposed under normal market
conditions, are designed to preserve the current benefits of principal stability, liquidity, and a
market yield, but reduce the likelihood that, in times of market stress, costs that ought to be
attributed to a redeeming shareholder are externalized on remaining shareholders and on the
wider market. 122 Even if a liquidity fee is imposed, fund investors continue to have the flexibility
to access liquidity (albeit at a cost). The Commission believes, and commenters suggested, that
if funds could have imposed liquidity fees during the crisis, they would likely have been better
able to manage redemptions, thereby ameliorating their impact and reducing contagion effects. 123
ii.

Redemption Gates

We believe that funds also could have benefitted from the ability to impose redemption
gates during the crisis. 124 Like liquidity fees, gates are designed to preserve the current benefits

Management, LLC (Sept. 16, 2013) (“Wells Fargo Comment Letter”) (“Prime money market fund
investors, the short-term markets and businesses that rely on funds for financing would each benefit from
the ability of [f]ees and [g]ates, during distressed market conditions, to reduce the susceptibility of subject
funds to runs and blunt the spread of deleterious contagion effects.”); but see, e.g., U.S. Bancorp Comment
Letter (suggesting that liquidity fees would not deter redemptions in times of market stress or prevent
contagion because “investors will choose to pay the [fee] now rather than wait for the wind-down of a fund
to be completed.”).

124

See Comment Letter of Arnold & Porter LLP on behalf of Federated Investors [Overview] (Sept. 11, 2013)

liquidity fees and gates would “stop the run” in crisis scenarios.”); see also supra note 114 (noting that

withdrawals….”); The Age of Asset Management?, Andrew Haldane (Apr. 4, 2014), available at

may be a “suitable” tool to “tackle market failures”); but see, e.g., Comment Letter of Deutsche Investment
Management Americas (Sept. 17, 2013) (“Deutsche Comment Letter”) (suggesting that gates can

47

of money market funds under most market conditions; however, if approved and monitored by
their boards, funds can use gates to respond to a run by directly halting redemptions. If funds
had been able to impose redemption gates during the crisis, they would have had available to
them a tool to stop temporarily mounting redemptions, 125 which if used could have generated
additional internal liquidity while gates were in place. 126 In addition, gates may have allowed
funds to invest the proceeds of maturing assets in short-term securities for the duration of the
gate, protecting the short-term financing market, and supporting capital formation for issuers.
Gates also would have allowed funds to directly and fully control redemptions during the crisis,
providing time for funds to better communicate the nature of any stresses to shareholders and
thereby possibly mitigating incentives to redeem shares. 127
b.

Benefits of Fees and Gates
i.

Fees and Gates Address Concerns Related to Heavy
Redemptions

As noted above, a large number of commenters supported our fees and gates proposal. 128
The primary benefit cited by commenters in favor of fees and/or gates is that they would address
125

See, e.g., U.S. Bancorp Comment Letter (suggesting that redemption gates would be the “most effective
option in addressing run risk”); Chamber II Comment Letter (stating that “a redemption gate would stop a
‘run’ in [its] tracks”).

126

See, e.g., Chamber II Comment Letter (“[A] redemption gate also gives [a money market fund] time for
issues in the market to subside and for securities in the portfolio to mature, which would increase the
[money market fund’s] liquidity levels.”); Form Letter Type D (suggesting that redemption gates “would
give funds time to stabilize”). Internal liquidity generated while a gate is in place could prevent funds from
having to immediately sell assets at fire sale prices.

127

See, e.g., Invesco Comment Letter (“Redemption gates have been proven to be an effective means of
preventing runs and providing a ‘cooling off’ period to mitigate the effects of short-term investor panic.”)

128

We note that many participants in the money market fund industry have previously expressed support for
imposing some form of a liquidity fee or redemption gate when a fund comes under stress as a way of
reducing, in a targeted fashion, the fund’s susceptibility to heavy redemptions. See Proposing Release,
supra note 25, at n.358.

48

run risk and/or systemic contagion risk. 129 Commenters also argued that fees and gates would
protect the interests of all fund shareholders, particularly non- or late-redeeming shareholders,
treating them more equitably. 130 Commenters supported our view that redemption restrictions
could provide a “cooling off” period to temper the effects of short-term investor panic, 131 and that
fees or gates could preserve and help restore the liquidity levels of a money market fund that has
come under stress. 132 Commenters also echoed our view that fees and/or gates could reduce or
eliminate the likelihood that funds would be forced to sell otherwise desirable assets and engage
in “fire sales.” 133 Additionally, commenters noted that gates would provide boards and advisers

129

See, e.g., Form Letter Type A; U.S. Bancorp Comment Letter; Comment Letter of Davenport & Company
LLC (Sept. 13, 2013) (“Davenport Comment Letter”); MFDF Comment Letter; Comment Letter of
Treasury Strategies, Inc. (Mar. 31, 2014) (“Treasury Strategies III Comment Letter”) (“We found that
[f]ees and [g]ates can stop and prevent runs…. We find that highly effective run prevention is attainable
within the approaches contemplated by the [Proposing] Release, while requiring that fund boards be given
discretion to take protective action. This is the mechanism by which [f]ees/[g]ates cause [money market
funds] to internalize the cost of investor protection, while preserving the utility of current CNAV
vehicles.”); see also The Need to Focus a Light on Shadow Banking is Nigh, Mark Carney, Financial Times
(June 15, 2014), available at http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/3a1c5cbc-f088-11e3-8f3d00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=intl#axzz35rCMZLTy (“By establishing common policy standards and
arrangements for co-operation, the reforms [including temporary gates] will help to avoid a fragmentation
of the global financial system.”); but see, e.g., Boston Federal Reserve Comment Letter (suggesting fees or
gates do not address run risk); Systemic Risk Council Comment Letter; Comment Letter of American
Bankers Association (Sept. 17, 2013) (“American Bankers Ass’n Comment Letter”).

130

See, e.g., Form Letter Type D (noting that gates would “give funds time to stabilize or, in the event a fund
cannot resume redemptions without breaking the buck, ensure that the funds [sic] shareholders are treated
equally in a distribution of the funds [sic] assets upon dissolution”); Invesco Comment Letter (“Liquidity
fees would provide an appropriate and effective means to ensure that the extra costs associated with raising
liquidity to meet fund redemptions during times of market stress are borne by those responsible for them.”);
Comment Letter of Independent Directors Council (Sept. 17, 2013) (“IDC Comment Letter”); J.P. Morgan
Comment Letter. We recognize, however, that our fees and gates reform does not address other
shareholder equity concerns, including shareholder dilution, that arise as a result of the structural features in
current rule 2a-7 that promote a first-mover advantage. Our floating NAV reform is designed to address
this concern for institutional prime money market funds. See infra section III.B.

131

See, e.g., Form Letter Type D; Invesco Comment Letter; Comment Letter of Reich & Tang Asset
Management, LLC (Sept. 17, 2013) (“Reich & Tang Comment Letter”).

See, e.g., MSCI Comment Letter; Federated V Comment Letter; Comment Letter of Treasury Strategies,

49

with crucial additional time to find the best solution in a crisis, instead of being forced to make
decisions in haste. 134
We are adopting reforms that will give a fund the ability to impose either a liquidity fee
or a redemption gate because we believe, and some commenters suggested, that fees and gates,
while both aimed at helping funds to better and more systematically manage high levels of
redemptions, do so in different ways and thus with somewhat different tradeoffs. 135
Accordingly, we believe that both fees and gates should be available to funds and their boards to
provide maximum flexibility for funds to manage heavy redemptions. 136 Liquidity fees are
designed to reduce shareholders’ incentives to redeem shares when it is abnormally costly for
funds to provide liquidity by requiring redeeming shareholders to bear at least some of the
liquidity costs associated with their redemption (rather than transferring all of those costs to
remaining shareholders). 137 Liquidity fees increase the cost of redeeming shares, which may

the likelihood of fire sales would in turn help protect other market participants that need to sell assets in the
market or perhaps mark asset values to market.
134

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter; UBS Comment Letter; IDC Comment Letter; Federated V Comment Letter.

135

See, e.g., Invesco Comment Letter (suggesting that gates provide “the most direct, simple and effective
method” to prevent runs and contagion as well as “a ‘cooling off’ period to mitigate the effects of shortterm investor panic,” while fees “mitigate the ‘first-mover advantage’” and “provide an appropriate and
effective means to ensure that the extra costs associated with raising liquidity to meet fund redemptions
during times of market stress are borne by those responsible for them.”)

136

See Treasury Strategies III Comment Letter (“Fees enable investors to access their liquidity, but at a
price…, but that is the cost of being able to assure that a stable NAV product will not cause contagion or
fire sales during such periods. Gates do not impose an extra [f]ee on shareholders, which is appealing to
many shareholders, but have the undesirable effect of restricting access to liquidity during critical periods.
Together, [f]ees and [g]ates provide fund boards with powerful tools to prevent a run from materializing, to
stop a run in progress, and to assure that a stress event does not cause contagion or fire sales.”).

137

See, e.g., Dreyfus Comment Letter (“We also agree that liquidity fees can deter net redemption activity
while also providing an appropriate “cost of liquidity” for investors choosing to exercise the option to
redeem over the option to hold….); see also Comment Letter of Wells Fargo Funds Management, LLC
(Jan. 17, 2013) (available in File No. FSOC–2012–0003) (“Wells Fargo FSOC Comment Letter”) (stating
that a liquidity fee would “provide an affirmative reason for investors to avoid redeeming from a distressed

50

reduce investors’ incentives to sell them. Likewise, fees help reduce investors’ incentives to
redeem shares ahead of other investors, especially if fund managers deplete their funds’ most
liquid assets first to meet redemptions, leaving later redemption requests to be met by selling less
liquid assets.
Several commenters noted that liquidity fees could “re-mutualize” risk-taking among
investors and provide a way to recover costs of liquidity in times of stress. 138 This is because
liquidity fees allocate at least some of the costs of providing liquidity to redeeming rather than
non-redeeming shareholders and protect fund liquidity by requiring redeeming shareholders to
repay funds for liquidity costs incurred. 139 To the extent liquidity fees exceed such costs, they
also can help increase the fund’s net asset value for remaining shareholders which would have a
restorative effect if the fund has suffered a loss. As one commenter has said, a liquidity fee can
“provide a strong disincentive for investors to make further redemptions by causing them to
choose between paying a premium for current liquidity or delaying liquidity and benefitting from
the fees paid by redeeming investors.” 140 This explicit pricing of liquidity costs in money market
funds should offer significant benefits to funds and the broader short-term financing market in
times of potential stress because it should lessen both the frequency and effect of shareholder

fund” and “those who choose to redeem in spite of the liquidity fee will help to support the fund’s marketbased NAV and thus reduce or eliminate the potential harm associated with the timing of their redemptions
to other remaining investors”).
138

See, e.g., HSBC Comment Letter; Invesco Comment Letter; IDC Comment Letter.

139

We note that investors owning securities directly – as opposed to through a money market fund – naturally
bear liquidity costs. They bear these costs both because they bear any losses if they have to sell a security
at a discount to obtain their needed liquidity and because they directly bear the risk of a less liquid
investment portfolio if they sell their most liquid holdings first to obtain needed liquidity.

140

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at 160 n.352 (citing ICI Jan. 24 FSOC Comment Letter).

51

redemptions, which might otherwise result in the sale of fund securities at “fire sale” prices. 141
In contrast, redemption gates will provide fund boards with a direct and immediate tool
for stopping heavy redemptions in times of stress. 142 Unlike liquidity fees, gates are designed to
directly stop a run by delaying redemptions long enough to allow (1) fund managers time to
assess the condition of the fund and determine the appropriate strategy to meet redemptions, (2)
liquidity buffers to grow organically as securities in the portfolio (many of which are very shortterm) mature and produce cash, and (3) shareholders to assess the liquidity and value of portfolio
holdings in the fund and for any shareholder or market panic to subside. 143 As contemplated by
today’s amendments, gates definitively stop runs for funds that impose them by blocking all
redemptions for their duration.
We recognize that redemption gates, if they are ever imposed, will inhibit the full,
unfettered redeemability of money market fund shares, a principle embodied in section 22(e) of
the Investment Company Act. 144 However, as discussed in section III.A.3 below, section 22(e) of
the Investment Company Act is aimed at preventing funds and their advisers from interfering
with shareholders’ redemption rights for improper purposes, such as preservation of management
fees. Consistent with that aim, redemption gates under today’s amendments are designed to
benefit the fund and its shareholders and may be imposed only when a fund’s board determines

141

See Chamber II Comment Letter (“[I]f shareholders were to be charged a fee when an MMF’s liquidity
costs are at a premium, they may be discouraged from redeeming their shares at that time, which would
have the effect of slowing redemptions in the MMF.”).

142

See, e.g., Chamber II Comment Letter (“[A] redemption gate would stop a ‘run’ in [its] tracks, because
shareholders would be prohibited from redeeming their shares while the gate is in place.”)

143

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.348.

144

See section 22(e).

52

that doing so is in the best interests of the fund. 145 We also note that, in response to commenter
concerns regarding investor access to their investments and the proposed duration of redemption
gates, under today’s amendments, gates will be limited to up to 10 business days in any 90-day
period (rather than 30 days in a 90-day period as proposed). 146 As such, the extent to which
today’s amendments inhibit the redeemability of money market fund shares is limited.
In fact, we note that money market funds are currently permitted to delay payments on
redemptions for up to seven days. 147 In addition, money market funds currently may suspend
redemptions after obtaining an exemptive order from the Commission,148 or in accordance with
rule 22e-3, which requires a fund’s board of directors to determine that the fund is about to
“break the buck” (specifically, that the extent of deviation between the fund’s amortized cost
price per share and its current market-based NAV per share may result in material dilution or
other unfair results to investors). 149 Under today’s amendments, money market fund boards will
be able to temporarily suspend redemptions after a fund falls below the same threshold that funds

See section 22(e).

148

There are limited exceptions specified in section 22(e) of the Act in which a money market fund (and any
other mutual fund) may suspend redemptions or delay payment on redemptions for more than seven days,
such as (i) for any period (A) during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed other than customary
week-end and holiday closings or (B) during which trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted,
or (ii) during any period in which an emergency exists (as the Commission determines by rule or
regulation) as a result of which (A) disposal by the fund of securities owned by it is not reasonably practical
or (B) it is not reasonably practical for the fund to determine the value of its net assets. The Commission
also has granted orders in the past allowing funds to suspend redemptions. See, e.g., In the Matter of The
Reserve Fund, Investment Company Act Release No. 28386 (Sept. 22, 2008) [73 FR 55572 (Sept. 25,
2008)] (order); Reserve Municipal Money-Market Trust, et al., Investment Company Act Release No.

149

Rule 22e-3(a)(1). Unlike under today’s amendments, a fund that imposes redemptions gates pursuant to
rule 22e-3 must do so permanently and in anticipation of liquidation.

53

must cross for boards to impose liquidity fees. 150 Accordingly, we believe that the gating allowed
by today’s amendments extends and formalizes the existing gating framework, clarifying for
investors when a money market fund potentially may use a gate as a tool to manage heavy
redemptions and thus prevents any investor confusion on when gating may apply.
Fees and gates also may have different levels of effectiveness under different stress
scenarios. 151 For example, we expect that the imposition of liquidity fees when a fund faces
heavy redemptions should be able to reduce the harm to non-redeeming shareholders and thus
the likelihood of additional redemptions that might have been made in response to that harm. To
the extent that a fund does not need to engage in fire sales and depress prices because of the
imposition of fees, the possibility of broader market contagion is reduced. We also note that
research in behavioral economics suggests that liquidity fees may be particularly effective in
dampening a run because, when faced with two negative options, investors tend to prefer the
option that involves only possible losses rather than the option that involves certain losses, even
when the amount of possible loss is significantly higher than the certain loss. 152 Unlike gates,
which temporarily prevent shareholders from redeeming shares altogether, once imposed,
liquidity fees will present investors with an economic decision as to whether to redeem or remain

150

See rule 2a-7(c)(2)(i).

151

We note that under today’s amendments, a fund’s board may determine that it is in the best interests of a
fund to impose a fee and then later determine to lift the fee and impose a gate, or vice versa, subject to the
limitations on the duration of fees and gates. See rule 2a-7(c)(2)(i) and (ii).

152

See, e.g., Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.355 (citing DANIEL KAHNEMAN, THINKING, FAST AND
SLOW (2011), at 278-288); see also HSBC Comment Letter; Schwab Comment Letter (“A liquidity fee
would force early redeemers to pay for the costs of their redemption, without knowing whether the fund
was actually going to experience losses or not. This is a powerful disincentive.”); but see Comment Letter
of Melanie L. Fein Law Offices (Sept. 10, 2013) (“Fein Comment Letter”) (suggesting liquidity fees are
unlikely to “prevent institutional [money market fund] investors from reallocating their assets in a crisis”).

in a fund. Investors fearing that a money market fund may suffer losses may prefer to stay in the
fund and avoid paying a liquidity fee (despite the possibility that the fund might suffer a future
loss) rather than redeem and lock in payment of the liquidity fee. 153
It is possible, however, that liquidity fees might not be fully effective during a
market-wide crisis because, for example, shareholders might redeem shares irrespective of the
level of their fund’s true liquidity costs and the imposition of a liquidity fee. 154 In those cases,
gates will be able to function as circuit breakers, creating time for funds to rebuild their own
internal liquidity and shareholders to reconsider whether redemptions are still desired or
warranted. 155
ii.

Management-Related Advantages

We are also mindful that permitting fund boards to impose fees and/or gates after a fund
has fallen below a particular threshold, and requiring funds to impose liquidity fees at a lower
designated threshold (absent a board finding that the fee is not in the best interests of the fund),
may offer certain benefits to funds with respect to management of liquidity and redemption
activity. Some commenters suggested that, even during non-stress periods, fees and gates could
provide fund managers with an incentive to carefully monitor shareholder concentration and
shareholder flow to lessen the chance that the fund might have to impose fees or gates (because

SLOW (2011), at 278-288); see also HSBC Comment Letter; Schwab Comment Letter.

154

See DERA Study, supra note 24, at 7-14 (discussing different possible explanations for why shareholders
may redeem from money market funds in times of stress).

(“Va. Treasury Comment Letter”); Chamber II Comment Letter; Dreyfus Comment Letter.

55

larger redemptions are more likely to cause the fund to breach the threshold). 156 The fees and
gates amendments also may have the additional effect of encouraging portfolio managers to
more closely monitor fund liquidity and hold more liquid securities to increase the level of daily
and weekly liquid assets in the fund, as it would tend to lessen the likelihood of a fee or gate
being imposed. 157 Such an approach could also lead to greater investor participation in money
market funds to the extent investors seek to invest in a product with low liquidity risk, thereby
increasing the supply of capital available to invest in commercial paper. We recognize, however,
that such an approach could perhaps shrink the market for riskier or longer-term commercial
paper, or have a negative effect on yield. 158
We also note that funds may take alternate approaches to managing liquidity and
imposing fees and gates, which may differentially affect the short-term funding markets. For
example, a fund that imposes a fee or gate may decide to immediately build liquidity by
investing all maturing securities in highly liquid assets, particularly if the fund wants to remove

156

See, e.g., Comment Letter of Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (Sept. 17, 2013)
(“SIFMA Comment Letter”) (stating that some members “believe the existence of the liquidity trigger for
the fee and gate will motivate fund managers to maintain fund liquidity well in excess of the trigger level,
to avoid triggering the fee or gate. That is to say, the mere existence of the potential for the fee or gate will
result in enhanced liquidity in money market funds.”); BlackRock II Comment Letter; Comment Letter of
Hester Peirce and Robert Greene (Sept. 17, 2013) (“Peirce & Greene Comment Letter”); see also HSBC
Global Asset Management, Liquidity Fees; a proposal to reform money market funds (Nov. 3, 2011)
(“HSBC 2011 Liquidity Fees Letter”) (a liquidity fee “will result in more effective pricing of risk (in this
case, liquidity risk)…[and] act as a market-based mechanism for improving the robustness and fairness” of
money market funds); Comment Letter of BlackRock, Inc. (Dec. 13, 2012) (available in File No. FSOC–
2012–0003) (“BlackRock FSOC Comment Letter”) (“A fund manager will focus on managing both assets
and liabilities to avoid triggering a gate. On the liability side, a fund manager will be incented to know the
underlying clients and model their behavior to anticipate cash flow needs under various scenarios. In the
event a fund manager sees increased redemption behavior or sees reduced liquidity in the markets, the fund
manager will be incented to address potential problems as early as possible.”).

the fee or gate as soon as possible. Another fund may plan to impose a fee or gate for a set
period of time, in which case, there would be no reason to stop investing in less liquid short-term
commercial paper provided it matured while the fee or gate was in place. The first strategy
would likely have the capital formation effect of lowering participation in short-term funding
markets, whereas the second strategy may defer the impact until a later time, possibly after
market conditions have improved.
iii.

Transparency

We recognize, and certain commenters noted, 159 that the prospect of fees and gates being
implemented when a fund is under stress should help make the risk of investing in money market
funds more salient and transparent to investors, which may help sensitize them to the risks of
investing in money market funds. On the other hand, we note that other commenters argued that
fees and gates would not improve transparency of risk for investors. 160 Having considered these
comments, however, we believe that there will be an appreciable increase in transparency as a
result of our fees and gates amendments. The disclosure amendments we are adopting today will
require funds to provide disclosure to investors regarding the possibility of fees and gates being
imposed if a fund’s liquidity is impaired. We believe such disclosure will benefit investors by
159

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter; Comment Letter of Myra Page (July 19, 2013) (“Page Comment Letter”).

160

See, e.g., Comment Letter of Thrivent Financial for Lutherans (Sept. 17, 2013) (“Thrivent Comment Letter)
(“The imposition of a liquidity fee or gate will always be a surprise to the investors that do not redeem
quickly enough to avoid it. The need to impose such a fee or gate will not be transparent to the investor
unless redemption activity is disclosed in a timely manner providing sufficient time for investors to
react.”); Capital Advisors Comment Letter. Two commenters also expressed concern that the ability to
impose fees and gates would perpetuate shareholder reliance on sponsor support. See Capital Advisors
Comment Letter; Thrivent Comment Letter. As discussed herein, we believe fees and gates and the
disclosure associated with fees and gates will provide investors certain benefits, including informing
investors further of the risks associated with money market funds. We further believe that the disclosure
requirements adopted today regarding sponsor support should help ameliorate concerns regarding
shareholder reliance on sponsor support. See infra sections III.E.7, III.E.9.g and III.F.3.

57

informing them further of the risks associated with money market funds, particularly that money
market funds’ liquidity may, at times, be impaired. 161 In addition, as noted above, fees and gates
also could encourage shareholders to monitor funds’ liquidity levels and exert market discipline
over the fund to reduce the likelihood that the imposition of fees or gates will become necessary
in that fund. 162
c.

Concerns Regarding Fees and Gates
i.

Pre-Emptive Runs and Broader Market Concerns

We acknowledge the possibility that, in market stress scenarios, shareholders might
pre-emptively redeem shares if they fear the imminent imposition of fees or gates (either because
of the fund’s situation or because other money market funds have imposed redemption
restrictions). 163 A number of commenters suggested investors would do so. 164 Some commenters

161

We recognize that the level of board discretion in the fees and gates amendments may make it more
difficult for investors to predict when fees and/or gates will imposed; however, we are adopting certain
thresholds and maximums that we believe will provide investors with notice as to the possible imposition
of fees and gates. Additionally, today we are adopting a requirement that funds disclose their percentage of
weekly liquid assets on a daily basis on their websites and, thus, shareholders should be aware when a fund
is approaching these thresholds. See rule 2a-7(h)(10)(ii)(B).

162

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.366. The disclosure of fees and gates also could advantage
larger funds and fund groups if the ability to provide financial support reduces or eliminates the need to
impose fees and/or gates (whose imposition may be perceived to be a competitive detriment).

163

See, e.g., Proposing Release, supra note 25, at 163-167, n.361.

164

See, e.g., Comment Letter of Novelis (July, 16, 2013) (“Novelis Comment Letter”); Comment Letter of
State Investment Commission, Commonwealth of Kentucky (Sept. 9, 2013) (“Ky. Inv. Comm’n Comment
Letter”); Boston Federal Reserve Comment Letter; Comment Letter of Hester Peirce and Robert Greene,
Working Paper: Opening the Gate to Money Market Fund Reform (Apr. 8, 2014) (“Peirce & Greene II
Comment Letter”). Some commenters were concerned that news of one money market fund imposing a
redemption restriction could trigger a system-wide run by investors in other money market funds. See, e.g.,
Samuel Hanson, David Scharfstein, and Adi Sunderam (Sept. 16, 2013) (“Hanson et al. Comment Letter”);
Deutsche Comment Letter; Boston Federal Reserve Comment Letter (suggesting further that “because of
the relative homogeneity in many [money market funds’ holdings], the imposition of a liquidity fee or
redemption gate on one fund may incite runs on other funds which are not subject to such measures”)
(citation omitted). In addition, one commenter, drawing an analogy to banks prior to the adoption of
federally insured deposits, noted that although withdrawal suspensions were commonly used by banks in

58

also suggested that sophisticated investors in particular might be able to predict that fees and
gates may be imposed and may redeem shares before this occurs. 165
While we recognize that there is risk of pre-emptive redemptions, the benefits of having
effective tools in place to address runs and contagion risk leads us to adopt the proposed fees and
gates reforms, with some modifications. We believe several of the changes we are making in our
final reforms will mitigate this risk and dampen the effects on other money market funds and the
broader markets if pre-emptive redemptions do occur.
As discussed below, the shorter maximum time period for the imposition of gates and the
smaller size of the default liquidity fee that we are adopting in these final amendments, as
compared to what we proposed, are expected to lessen further the risk of pre-emptive runs. 166
We understand that the potential for a longer gate or higher liquidity fee before a restriction is in
place may increase the incentive for investors to redeem at the first sign of any potential stress at
a fund or in the markets. 167 We believe that by limiting the maximum time period that gates may
be imposed to 10 business days in any 90-day period (down from the proposed 30 days), investor
concerns regarding an extended loss of access to cash from their investment should be mitigated.
Indeed, some money market funds today retain the right to delay payment on redemption
response to fleeing depositors, the specter of suspensions themselves were often the cause of such investor
flight. See, e.g., Comment Letter of Committee on Capital Markets Regulation (Sept. 17, 2013) (“Comm.
Cap. Mkt. Reg. Comment Letter”).
165

See, e.g., MFDF Comment Letter; Va. Treasury Comment Letter; Goldman Sachs Comment Letter.

See Comment Letter of Federated Investors, Inc. (Apr. 25. 2014) (“Federated XI Comment Letter”).

167

See J.P. Morgan Comment Letter (“The potential of total loss of access to liquidity for up to thirty (30)
days will be a concern for investors, and could exacerbate a pre-emptive run.”); Federated V Comment
Letter (“Shareholders will find it increasingly difficult to compensate for their loss of liquidity the longer
the suspension of redemptions continues. It is therefore important for Alternative 2 to limit the suspension
of redemptions to a period in which the potential benefits to shareholders of delaying redemptions outweigh
the potential disruptions caused by the delay.”).

59

requests for up to seven days, as all registered investment companies are permitted to do under
the Investment Company Act, and we are not aware that this possibility has led to any preemptive runs historically. 168 In addition, we note that under section 22(e), the Commission also
has the authority to, by order, suspend the right of redemption or allow the postponement of
payment of redemption requests for more than seven days. The Commission used this authority,
for example, with respect to the Reserve Primary Fund. To our knowledge, this authority also
has not historically led to pre-emptive redemptions. We believe that the gating allowed by
today’s amendments extends and formalizes this existing gating framework, clarifying for
investors when a money market fund potentially may use a gate as a tool to manage heavy
redemptions and thus prevents any investor confusion on when gating may apply.
We believe that the maximum 10 business day gating period we are adopting today is a
similarly short enough period of time (as compared to the seven days a fund may delay payment
on redemption requests) that many investors may not be unduly burdened by such a temporary
loss of liquidity. 169 Thus, these investors may have less incentive to redeem their investments
pre-emptively before the imposition of a gate. For similar reasons, the reduction in the default
liquidity fee to 1% (down from the proposed 2%), discussed further below, may also lessen
shareholders’ incentives to redeem pre-emptively as fewer investors may consider it likely that a

168

See section 22(e).

169

See, e.g., Federated V Comment Letter (stating that 10 calendar days “would be a significantly shorter
period than proposed by the Commission, while still allowing prime [money market funds] more than a
week to address whatever problem led to the suspension of redemptions. This would also be consistent
with the comments of some of the investors who indicated to Federated that they probably could not go
more than two weeks without access to the cash held in their [money market fund].”); see also infra section
III.A.2.d (discussing the maximum duration of temporary redemption gates under today’s amendments).

60

liquidity fee will result in an unacceptable loss on their investment. 170
In addition, we expect that the additional discretion we are granting fund boards to
impose a fee or gate at any time after a fund’s weekly liquid assets have fallen below the 30%
required minimum, a much higher level of remaining weekly liquid assets than proposed, should
mitigate the risk of pre-emptive redemptions. This board discretion should reduce the incentive
of shareholders from trying to pre-emptively redeem because they will be able to less accurately
predict specifically when, and under what circumstances, fees and gates will be imposed. 171
Board discretion also should allow boards to act decisively if they become concerned liquidity
may become impaired and to react to expected, as well as actual, declines in liquidity levels,
given their funds’ investor base and other characteristics.
Likewise, increased board discretion should lessen the likelihood that sophisticated
investors can preferentially predict when a fee or gate is going to be imposed because
sophisticated investors, like any other investor, will not know what specific circumstances a fund
board will deem appropriate for the imposition of fees or gates. 172 We recognize that

170

We note that under our final amendments, the 1% default liquidity may be raised by a fund’s board (up to
2%) if it is in the best interests of the fund. See rule 2a-7(c)(2)(ii)(A). However, given the empirical
information regarding liquidity costs in money market fund eligible securities in the financial crisis, as
discussed in the DERA Liquidity Fee Memo, which supported the reduction in the size of the default
liquidity fee to 1%, money market fund shareholders may estimate that a fee as high as 2% will be unlikely
and that depending on the circumstances, a fee of less than 1% could be appropriately determined by the
board of directors. See DERA Liquidity Fee Memo, supra note 111.

171

See Wells Fargo Comment Letter (“The ability for fund investors to frequently and aggressively ‘game’
and avoid the potential imposition of Fees or Gates is undermined by the element of uncertainty inherent in
a fund board’s discretion to impose a Fee or a Gate.”); see also Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.362.
Additionally, we believe that requiring investors in institutional prime funds to redeem their shares at
floating NAV should lower the incentive to run pre-emptively when investors anticipate that a gate will be
imposed as a result of a credit event. See infra section III.B for a discussion of the floating NAV
requirement.

172

Although funds’ website disclosure will indicate when a fund is approaching the weekly liquid asset

61

sophisticated investors may monitor the weekly liquid assets of funds and seek to redeem before
a fund drops below the 30% weekly liquid asset threshold. We believe, however, that a
sophisticated investor may be dissuaded from redeeming in these circumstances because the fund
still has a substantial amount of internal liquidity. In addition, redemptions when the fund still
has this much internal liquidity would not lead to fire sales or other such adverse effects.
We also believe that increased board flexibility will reduce the occurrence of pre-emptive
redemptions by shareholders who seek to redeem because another money market fund has
imposed a fee or gate. Increased board flexibility will likely result in different funds imposing
different redemption restrictions at different times, particularly considering that after crossing the
30% threshold each fund’s board will be required to make a best interests determination with
respect to the imposition of a fee or gate. 173 As such, it will be less likely that investors can
predict whether any particular fund will impose a fee or gate, even if another fund has done so,
and thus perhaps less likely they will redeem assuming that one fund imposing such a restriction
means other funds may soon do so.
Moreover, we believe that funds’ ability to impose fees and gates once weekly liquid
assets drop below 30% will substantially mitigate the broader effects of pre-emptive runs, should
they occur. A money market fund that imposes a fee or gate with substantial remaining internal
liquidity is in a better position to bear those redemptions without a broader market impact
because it can satisfy those redemption requests through existing or internally generated cash and
thresholds for imposing a fee or gate, investors will not know the circumstances under which a board will
deem such a restriction to be in the best interests of the fund. See rule 2a-7(h)(10)(ii)(B).
173

Boards will also be required to make a best interests determination if they determine to change the level of
the default liquidity fee or to not impose the default fee. See rule 2a-7(c)(2)(ii).

62

not through asset sales (other than perhaps sales of government securities that tend to increase in
value and liquidity in times of stress). Thus, pre-emptive runs, if they were to occur, under these
circumstances are less likely to generate adverse contagion effects on other money market funds
or the short-term financing markets.
We note some commenters suggested that concerns about pre-emptive run risks from fees
and gates are likely overstated. 174 One commenter noted that the “element of uncertainty
inherent in a board’s discretion to impose a fee or gate” would diminish any possible gaming by
investors. 175 Another commenter further noted that “appropriate portfolio construction and daily
transparency” would reduce the likelihood of anticipatory redemptions. 176 For example, as
discussed below, our amendments require that each money market fund disclose daily on its
website its level of weekly liquid assets. This means that if one money market fund imposes a
fee or gate, investors in other money market funds will have the benefit of full transparency on
whether the money market fund in which they are invested is similarly experiencing liquidity
stress and thus is likely to impose a fee or gate. Pre-emptive redemptions and contagion effects
due to a lack of transparency (which may have occurred in the crisis) may therefore be reduced.
Some commenters also have previously indicated that a liquidity fee or gate should not
accelerate a run, stating that such redemptions would likely trigger the fee or gate and that, once
174

See, e.g., SIFMA Comment Letter; Wells Fargo Comment Letter; Dreyfus Comment Letter; see also
Chamber II Comment Letter (stating that “unlike with the current conditions of [r]ule 22e-3 under the
[Investment Company Act], a redemption gate would allow the MMF to remain in operation after the gate
is lifted. This, in turn, will provide MMF investors with comfort regarding the ultimate redemption of their
investment and make any large-scale redemptions less likely.”); Comment Letter of Artie Green (Aug. 29,
2013) (“Green Comment Letter”) (“Fund shareholders would be less likely to panic if they know they will
have access to their assets when the fund reopens after a short suspension of redemptions.”).

63

triggered, the fee or gate would then lessen or halt redemptions. 177
Additionally, we note that while many European money market funds are able to suspend
redemptions and/or impose fees on redemptions, we are not aware that their ability to do so has
historically led to pre-emptive runs. Most European money market funds are subject to
legislation governing Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities
(“UCITS”), which also covers other collective investments, and which permits them to suspend
temporarily redemptions of units. 178 For example, in Ireland, UCITS are permitted to
temporarily suspend redemptions “in exceptional cases where circumstances so require and
suspension is justified having regard to the interest of the unit-holders.” 179 Similarly, many
money market funds in Europe are also permitted to impose fees on redemptions. 180
We also note that a commenter discussed a paper by the staff of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York (“FRBNY”) entitled “Gates, Fees, and Preemptive Runs.” 181 The FRBNY
staff paper constructs a theoretical model of fees or gates used by a financial intermediary and
finds “that rather than being part of the solution, redemption fees and gates can be part of the

177

See, e.g., Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.364.

178

See, e.g., UCITS IV Directive, Article 84 (permitting a UCITS to, in accordance with applicable national
law and its instruments of incorporation, temporarily suspend redemption of its units); Articles L. 214-19
and L. 214-30 of the French Monetary and Financial Code (providing that under exceptional circumstances
and if the interests of the UCITS units holders so demand, UCITs may temporarily suspend redemptions);
see also Coll. 7.2R United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority Handbook (allowing the temporary
suspension of redemptions “where due to exceptional circumstances it is in the interest of all the
unitholders in the authorized fund”).

179

See Regulation 104(2)(a) of S.I. No. 352 of 2011.

180

See, e.g., HSBC Comment Letter (“We are in the process of rolling out the ability for the Board of
Directors to impose trigger based liquidity fees in our [money market funds] where current regulation
allows. At this time we are working on implementation in our flagship “Global Liquidity Fund” range
domiciled in Dublin.”).

64

problem.” 182 This commenter argued that this paper fails to consider numerous restrictions in
bank products similar to fees and gates that do not appear to have triggered pre-emptive runs on
banks. 183 In particular, the commenter noted that all banks are required “to retain contractual
authority as to most deposits to postpone withdrawals (gating) or impose early redemption fees
and to reserve the right to impose restrictions – either gates or fees or both – on redemptions of
all bank deposits other than demand deposit accounts….” 184
We note that the model of fees or gates in the FRBNY staff paper has a number of
features and assumptions different than the reforms we are adopting today. For example, the
paper’s model assumes the fees or gates are imposed only when liquid assets are fully depleted.
In contrast, under our reforms fees or gates may be imposed while the fund still has substantial
liquid assets and, as discussed above, we believe investors may be dissuaded from pre-emptively
redeeming from funds with substantial internal liquidity because the fund is more likely to be
able to readily satisfy redemptions without adversely impacting the fund’s pricing. 185 Moreover,
under our reforms (unlike the model), a fund board has discretion in the decision of when to
impose fees or gates, which as discussed above should reduce the incentive for investors to run,
because they will be able to less accurately predict specifically when, and under what

See id. (citations omitted). The commenter states that, other than with respect to demand deposit accounts,
“banks (1) are required … to reserve the right to require seven days’ advance notice of a withdrawal from
[money market deposit accounts], NOW accounts and other savings accounts; (2) are not required to allow
early withdrawal from [certificates of deposit] and other time deposits; and (3) are allowed to impose early
withdrawal fees on time deposits if they choose to permit an early withdrawal from a time deposit.”

65

circumstances, fees or gates will be imposed. 186 Another significant difference is that our
reforms include a floating NAV for institutional prime money market funds, which constitute a
sizeable portion of all money market funds, but the model assumes a stable NAV. As discussed
below, we believe the floating NAV requirement may encourage those investors who are least
able to bear risk of loss to redirect their investments to other investment opportunities (e.g.,
government money market funds), and this may have the secondary effect of removing from the
funds those investors most prone to redeem should a liquidity event occur for which fees or gates
could be imposed. Furthermore, the paper also assumes that no investor could foresee the
possibility of a shock to a money market fund that reduces the fund’s value or liquidity despite
the events of 2008 that should have informed investors that fund NAVs can change over time
and that liquidity levels may fluctuate. In addition, under our floating NAV reforms, price levels
of institutional prime money market funds likely will fluctuate, and today’s reforms will also
require additional disclosures that will convey important information to investors about the
fund’s value which in turn may help prevent run behavior to the extent it is based on uninformed
decision-making.
These differences in our reforms as compared to the model in the FRBNY staff paper,
along with the additional disclosures that we are adopting today that will convey important
information to investors about the fund’s value, should in our view significantly mitigate any
potential for substantial investor runs before fees and gates are imposed. Accordingly, the
FRBNY staff paper’s findings regarding the risks of pre-emptive redemptions, because they rely

186

See supra notes 171-173 and accompanying text.

66

on different facts and assumptions than are being implemented in today’s reforms, are not likely
to apply to money market funds following today’s reforms.
As noted above, the new daily transparency to shareholders on funds’ levels of weekly
liquid assets should provide additional benefits, including helping shareholders to understand if
their fund’s liquidity is at risk and thus a fee or gate more likely and, therefore, should lessen the
chance of contagion from shareholders redeeming indiscriminately in response to another fund
imposing a fee or gate. Investors will be able to benefit from this disclosure when assessing each
fund’s circumstances, rather than having to infer information from, or react to, the problems
observed at other funds. Nevertheless, investors might mimic other investors’ redemption
strategies even when those other investors’ decisions are not necessarily based on superior
information. 187 General stress in the short-term markets or fear of stress at a particular fund
could trigger redemptions as shareholders try to avoid a fee or gate. As noted above, however,
even if investors redeem, their redemptions eventually could cause a fee or gate to come down,
thereby lessening or halting redemptions and mitigating contagion risk. 188 In sum, we are
persuaded that fees and gates are important tools that can be used to halt redemptions and
prevent contagion during periods of market stress.

which are not subject to such measures” (citation omitted)).

ii.

Impact on a Fund after Imposing a Fee or Gate

Commenters have suggested that once fees and gates are imposed, they may not be easily
lifted without triggering a run. 189 Similarly, other commenters warned that imposing a fee or gate
would not help a fund recover from a crisis but rather force it into liquidation because investors
would lose trust in the fund and seek to invest in a money market fund that has not imposed a fee
or gate. 190 We acknowledge that there is a risk that investors may redeem from a fund after a fee
or gate is lifted. We believe this is less likely following the imposition of a fee, however,
because investors will continue to have the ability to redeem while a fee is in place and,
therefore, may experience less disruption and potentially less loss in trust. In any event, we
believe that it is important that money market funds have these tools to give funds the ability to
obtain additional liquidity in an orderly fashion if a liquidity crisis occurs, notwithstanding the
risk that the imposition of a fee or gate may cause some subsequent loss in trust in a fund or may
lead to a resumption in heavy redemptions once a fee or gate is lifted. Further, we think it is
important to observe that whenever a fee or gate is imposed, the fund may already be under
stress from heavy redemptions that are draining liquidity, and the purpose of the fees and gates
amendments is to give the fund’s board additional tools to address this external threat when the
board determines that using one or both of the tools is in the fund’s best interests.
Further, to the extent that commenters’ concerns about potential loss in trust or risk of a
run when a fee or gate is lifted is tied to investor concerns about the sufficiency of the fund’s

Letter”).

See, e.g., Schwab Comment Letter (“[W]e have a hard time seeing how any fund that actually imposed fees

68

liquidity levels, we note that, under today’s amendments, funds will be required to disclose
information regarding their liquidity (e.g., daily and weekly liquid assets) on a daily basis. Such
disclosure, assuming adequate liquidity, may help ameliorate concerns that investors will run or
shift their investment elsewhere after a fund lifts its redemption restrictions because investors
will be able to see that a fund is sufficiently liquid. To the extent heavy redemptions resume
after a fund lifts a fee or gate, we also note that a fund board may again impose a fee, or gate if
the fund has not yet exceeded the 10 business day maximum gating period, if it is in the best
interests of the fund. 191 Additionally, while we recognize that fees and gates may cause some
investors to leave a fund once it has lifted a fee or gate (or, in the case of a fee, while the fee is in
place), which may affect efficiency, competition, and capital formation, we believe it is possible
that some investors, particularly those that were not seeking to redeem during the imposition of
the fee or gate, may choose to stay in the fund. In this regard, we note that, as discussed above, a
liquidity fee would benefit those investors who were not seeking to redeem while a fund’s
liquidity was under stress by more equitably allocating liquidity costs among redeeming and
non-redeeming shareholders. 192 In addition, to the extent a fund’s drop in weekly liquid assets
was the result of an external event, if such event resolves while a fee or gate is place, some
investors may choose to stay in the fund after the fee or gate is lifted.
In addition, we recognize that a fund board may determine to close a fund and liquidate
after the fund has imposed a fee or temporary gate (or instead of imposing a fee or temporary

191

See rule 2a-7(c)(2)(i)(B) (limiting the imposition of gates to 10 business days in any 90-day period).

69

gate) pursuant to amended rule 22e-3. 193 We note, however, that even if a fund ultimately
liquidates, its disposition is likely to be more orderly and efficient if it previously imposed a fee
or gate. In fact, imposing a fee or gate should give a fund more time to generate greater liquidity
so that it will be able to liquidate with less harm to shareholders. Additionally, to the extent a
fund’s board determines to close the fund and liquidate after the fund has imposed a fee or
temporary gate, we anticipate that this would more commonly occur because the imposition of
the fee or gate was the result of idiosyncratic stresses on the fund. 194 In this regard, we note that
at least one commenter who suggested that a money market fund would likely be forced to
liquidate after imposing a fee or gate, also noted that “in a systemic crisis” where many funds
may be faced with heavy redemptions and thus the possibility of imposing fees and gates, money
market funds “may have a greater likelihood of avoiding liquidation after the systemic crisis
[has] subsided.” 195
iii.

Investors’ Liquidity Needs

A number of commenters expressed concern that fees or gates could impair money
market funds’ use as liquid investments, in particular because redemption restrictions (especially
gates) would limit or deny shareholders ready access to their funds. 196 Commenters noted such a
lack of liquidity could have detrimental consequences for investors, including, for example,

193

See infra section III.A.4 herein discussing amendments to rule 22e-3 that will allow a board to close and
liquidate a fund if the fund’s weekly liquid assets have dropped below 10%.

70

corporations and institutions using liquidity accounts for cash management, 197 retail investors
needing immediate access to cash such as in a medical emergency or when purchasing a home, 198
and state and local governments that need to make payroll or service bond payments when due. 199
We recognize that liquidity fees and redemption gates could affect shareholders by
potentially limiting, partially or fully (as applicable), the redeemability of money market fund
shares under certain conditions, a principle embodied in the Investment Company Act. 200 In our
view, however, these reforms should not unreasonably impede the use of money market funds as
liquid investments. First, under normal circumstances, when a fund’s liquidity is not under
stress, the fees and gates amendments will not affect money market funds or their shareholders.
Fees and gates are tools for funds to use in times of severe market or internal stress. Second,
even when a fund experiences stress, the fees and gates amendments we are adopting today do
not require money market funds to impose fees and gates when it is not in the best interests of
the fund. Accordingly, we believe these tools can assist funds facing liquidity shortages during
periods of unusual stress, while preserving the benefits of money market funds for investors and
the short-term funding markets by not affecting the day-to-day operations of a fund in periods
without stress. In fact, a number of commenters observed that fees and gates would be the most

71

effective option of achieving the Commission’s reform goals, 201 and would preserve as much as
possible the current benefits of money market funds and/or be less onerous day-to-day on funds
and investors. 202
With respect to liquidity fees, we also note that investors will not be prohibited from
redeeming their investments; rather, they may access their investments at any time, but their
redemptions will be subject to a fee that is designed to make them bear at least some of the costs
associated with their access to liquidity rather than externalizing those costs to the remaining
fund shareholders. With respect to gates, we recognize that they will temporarily prevent
investors from redeeming their investments when imposed. However, we believe gates (as well
as fees) will rarely be imposed in normal market conditions. In our view, in those likely rare
situations where a gate would be imposed, investors would (in the absence of the gating
mechanism) potentially be left in worse shape if the fund were, for example, forced to engage in
the sale of assets and thus incur permanent losses; or worse, if the fund were forced to liquidate
because of a severe liquidity crisis. Thus, we believe that allowing fund boards to impose gates
should not be viewed as detrimental to funds, but rather should be viewed as an interim measure
boards can employ in worse case scenarios where the alternative would likely be a result
potentially more detrimental to investors’ overall interests. To the extent that some investors
may be sufficiently concerned about their ability to access their investment to meet certain
obligations, such as payroll or bills, we believe they may choose to manage their money market

Letter”); IDC Comment Letter; HSBC Comment Letter.

72

fund investments so as to be able to meet these obligations if a redemption gate should be
imposed. 203
While we recognize these commenter concerns regarding liquidity, we believe that the
overall benefits and protections that are provided by the fees and gates amendments to all
investors in these money market funds outweigh these concerns. Furthermore, we note that the
final amendments have been modified and tailored to mitigate some potentially disruptive
consequences of fees and gates. For example, under the final amendments, gates cannot be
imposed for more than 10 business days in any 90-day period, so, to the extent an investor’s
access to his/her money is inhibited, it is for a limited period of time, which may allow an
investor to better prepare for and withstand a possible gate. We also note, as discussed above,
that funds are currently permitted to impose permanent redemption gates in certain
circumstances. 204 Therefore, we believe that the gating allowed by today’s amendments extends
and formalizes the existing gating framework, clarifying for investors when a money market
fund potentially may use a gate as a tool to manage heavy redemptions and thus prevents any
investor confusion on when gating may apply. While we recognize that the permanent
redemption gates allowed under rule 22e-3 have not yet been used by money market funds, we
note that investors have widely utilized money market funds as cash management vehicles even
with the possibility of these permanent gates under an existing rule. Moreover, to the extent an
investor wants to invest in a money market fund without the possibility of fees and/or gates, it
203

We recognize that some investors may choose to move their money out of affected money market funds
due to concern that a fee or gate may be imposed in the future. For a discussion of investor movement out
of money market funds, see infra section III.K.

may choose to invest in a government money market fund, which is not subject to the fees and
gates requirements. 205
iv.

Investor Movement out of Money Market Funds

Some commenters expressed concern that the possibility of fees and gates being imposed
could result in diminished investor appeal and/or utility of affected money market funds, and
could cause investors to either abandon or severely restrict use of affected money market
funds. 206 For example, commenters suggested that fees and gates would drive sweep account
money out of money market funds. 207 Commenters warned that fees and gates may cause
investors to shift investments into other assets, government money market funds, FDIC-insured
accounts and other bank products, riskier and/or less regulated investments, or other alternative
stable value products. 208 Conversely, other commenters predicted only minor effects on investor
demand and/or that investor demand would decrease less under the proposed fees and gates
alternative than under the proposed floating NAV alternative. 209

We recognize that, as suggested by certain commenters, our amendments could cause
some shareholders to redeem their prime money market fund shares and move their assets to
alternative products that do not have the ability to impose fees or gates because the potential
imposition of a fee or gate could make investment in a money market fund less attractive due to
less certain liquidity. 210 As noted above, this could affect efficiency, competition, and capital
formation. We agree with one commenter that suggested it is difficult to estimate the extent to
which assets might shift from prime funds to government funds or other alternatives. 211 As
discussed above, some investors may determine they are comfortable investing in money market
funds that may impose fees and gates, because fees and gates will likely be imposed only during
times of stress and should not affect the daily operations of money market funds during normal

market conditions. 212 Other investors, however, may reallocate their assets to investment
alternatives that are not subject to fees and gates, such as government money market funds. 213
One potential issue related to market efficiency that several commenters raised was a
potential shortage of eligible government securities if investors reallocate assets from funds that
are subject to fees and gates into government funds. 214 We anticipate that any increase in
demand for eligible government securities because of the fees and gates requirement would
likely be accompanied by an additional increase in demand arising from investors that reallocate
assets from institutional prime funds because of the floating NAV requirement. As such, we
discuss the reforms’ joint impact on the demand for eligible government securities and possible
repercussions on the economy and capital formation in section III.K below.
In addition, a number of commenters noted that a possible shift out of affected money
market funds could ultimately lead to a decrease in the funding of, or other adverse effects on,

212

See, e.g., Invesco Comment Letter (“[W]e believe that additional education about the purpose and
operation of the proposed liquidity fees and redemptions gates and the circumstances in which they might

Comment Letter (“[S]ome of our investors have told us that they could accept the prospect of liquidity fees
and gates ….”); Comment Letter of Tom Garst (Aug. 30, 2013) (“Garst Comment Letter”) (suggesting that
gates would be the “most acceptable alternative” out of those proposed); Capital Advisors Comment Letter
(“[W]e think shareholders may accept a cost of liquidity in a stressful situation ….”). We note that, under
today’s amendments, institutional prime funds will be subject to the fees and gates requirements as well as
a floating NAV requirement, and that investor acceptance of fees and gates for these funds may be
different. See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter (suggesting a fund that is subject to fees and gates and a floating
NAV will be “a fund which nobody will want”); see also infra section III.B for a discussion of the floating
NAV requirement and any investor movement out of money market funds as result of such requirement.

213

Government money market funds also will not be subject to the floating NAV requirement adopted today.
See infra section III.C.1. In addition, as noted above, all money market funds today have the option to
impose a permanent redemption gate and liquidate under rule 22e-3 under the Investment Company Act.
While we recognize that these permanent redemption gates have not yet been used by money market funds,
we note that they have not led to the migration of investors away from money market funds.

the short-term financing markets. 215 The Commission recognizes the expected benefits from
today’s amendments may be accompanied by adverse effects on issuers that access the shortterm financing markets with consequent effects on competition and capital formation. As
discussed in greater detail in section III.K below, the magnitude of these effects, including any
effects on competition, efficiency, and capital formation, will depend on the extent to which
investors reallocate their investments within or outside the money market fund industry and
which alternatives investors choose.
Some commenters also suggested that fees and gates could motivate money market funds
to hold securities of even shorter-term duration, which could encourage issuers to fund
themselves with shorter-term debt. 216 Shortening debt maturity would increase the frequency at
which issuers would need to refinance, leaving both issuers and the broad financial system more
vulnerable to refinancing risk. 217 One such commenter further noted that basing the threshold for
fees and gates on weekly liquid assets will “discourage[e] prime money market funds from
drawing down on their buffers of liquid assets [due to fear of crossing below the fees and gates
thresholds] precisely when they should do so from a system-wide perspective, i.e., in a systemwide liquidity and funding crisis.” 218 In addition, some commenters were concerned about a loss
of funding or other adverse impacts on state and local governments as a result of the fees and

Terms of Fees and Gates

As discussed above, we are adopting provisions that, unlike the proposal, will allow a
money market fund the flexibility to impose fees (up to 2%) 220 and/or gates (up to 10 business
days in a 90-day period) 221 after the fund’s weekly liquid assets have crossed below 30% of its
total assets, if the fund’s board of directors (including a majority of its independent directors)
determines that doing so is in the best interests of the fund. 222 We are also adopting amendments
that will require a money market fund, if its weekly liquid assets fall below 10% of its total
assets, to impose a 1% liquidity fee on each shareholder’s redemption, unless the fund’s board of
directors (including a majority of its independent directors) determines that such a fee would not
be in the best interests of the fund, or determines that a lower or higher fee (not to exceed 2%)
would be in the best interests of the fund. 223 The proposal would have required funds (absent a
board determination otherwise) to impose a 2% liquidity fee on all redemptions, and would have
permitted the imposition of redemption gates for up to 30 days in a 90-day period, after a fund’s

today’s amendments will allow a fund to impose a fee or gate at any point throughout the day
after a fund’s weekly liquid assets have dropped below 30%. 224
As in the proposal, any fee or gate imposed under today’s amendments must be lifted
automatically after the money market fund’s level of weekly liquid assets rises to or above 30%,
and it can be lifted at any time by the board of directors (including a majority of independent
directors) if the board determines to impose a different redemption restriction (or, with respect to
a liquidity fee, a different fee) or if it determines that imposing a redemption restriction is no
longer in the best interests of the fund. 225 As amended, rule 22e-3 also will permit the permanent
suspension of redemptions and liquidation of a money market fund if the fund’s level of weekly
liquid assets falls below 10% of its total assets. 226

Thresholds for Fees and Gates

Discretionary Versus Mandatory Thresholds

As proposed, a fund would have been required (unless the board determined otherwise) to
impose a default liquidity fee, and would have been permitted to impose a gate, after the fund’s
weekly liquid assets dropped below 15% of its total assets. In addition, a fund would have had to
wait to impose a fee or gate until the next business day after it crossed below the 15% threshold.
Commenters ranged widely over whether and to what extent the trigger for fees and gates

See rule 22e-3(a)(1). To mirror the proposed fees and gates amendments to rule 2a-7, the proposed
amendments to rule 22e-3 would have set a threshold of below 15% weekly liquid assets for a fund to

should be an objective test or left to the discretion of fund boards. On one hand, a group of
commenters expressed concern about giving money market fund boards discretion to impose fees
and gates. 227 For example, some commenters noted that board discretion could create uncertainty
among investors, 228 and that boards might be reticent, due to the possible impact of the decision,
to act in a time of crisis. 229
On the other hand, a large group of commenters generally argued in favor of giving
boards more discretion over whether to impose a fee or gate. 230 For example, a number of
commenters expressly noted that fees should be at the discretion of fund boards instead of being
automatically triggered at a particular liquidity threshold. 231 A number of other commenters
argued more generally that, when heavy redemptions are already underway or clearly
foreseeable, boards should be able to impose fees and gates even before a set liquidity threshold
or some other objective threshold has been crossed. 232
We continue to believe that a hybrid approach that at some point imposes a default fee

Commission should have the ability to impose a fee on prime money market funds when a fund’s weekly
liquid assets fall below 15%).

that boards can opt out of or change best ensures that fees and gates will be imposed when it is
appropriate. Based on commenter feedback, however, we believe that such a hybrid approach
could benefit from the default fee acting more as a floor for board consideration when liquidity
has been significantly depleted and from additional board discretion to impose fees and gates in
advance of that point. 233 Thus, our final approach – while still a hybrid approach – is
significantly more discretionary than under our proposal. As we indicated in the Proposing
Release, we believe a hybrid approach offers the possibility of achieving many of the benefits of
both a purely discretionary trigger and a fully automatic trigger. We recognize that a
discretionary trigger allows a fund board the flexibility to determine when a restriction is
necessary, and thus allows the board to trigger the fee or gate based on current market conditions
and the specific circumstances of the fund.
A purely discretionary trigger, however, creates the risk that a fund board may be
reluctant to impose restrictions, even when they would benefit the fund and the short-term
financing markets. As commenters indicated, 234 a board may choose not to impose a fee or gate
for commercial reasons – for example, out of fear that doing so would signal trouble for the
individual fund or fund complex (and thus may incur significant negative business and
reputational effects) or could incite redemptions in other money market funds in the fund
complex in anticipation that fees may be imposed in those funds as well. We are also concerned
that purely discretionary triggers could cause some funds to use fees and gates when they are not

81

under stress and in contravention of the principles underlying the Investment Company Act. If,
for example, a fund’s NAV began to fall due to losses incurred in the portfolio, a board with full
discretion to impose fees on fund redemptions could impose a fee solely to recover those losses
and repair the fund’s NAV, even if that fund’s liquidity is not being stressed.
As discussed in the Proposing Release, we recognize that although an automatic trigger
set by the Commission may mitigate some of the potential concerns associated with a fully
discretionary trigger, it also may create the risk of imposing costs on shareholders, such as those
related to board meetings or liquidity fees themselves, when funds are not truly distressed or
when liquidity is not abnormally costly. As indicated by a number of commenters and discussed
above, an automatic trigger also could result in shareholders pre-emptively redeeming their
shares to avoid a fee or gate. 235 In addition, commenters suggested that a fund’s liquidity could
quickly evaporate once heavy redemptions begin and that a fund board should not have to wait
until the fund’s weekly liquid assets breach the default liquidity fee threshold or until the next
business day in order to act. 236
In light of these risks and in response to the comments discussed above, we have
determined to increase the amount of board discretion under the fees and gates amendments so
that funds may impose fees or gates before the default liquidity fee threshold is reached and so
they can better tailor the redemption restrictions to their particular circumstances. Additionally,
the amendments will allow fund boards to impose fees and gates the same day that a fund
experiences or foresees heavy redemptions and, thus, funds will not have to wait until the next

82

day to act. 237 This increased flexibility should better allow fund boards to prevent or stem heavy
redemptions before they occur, or as soon as possible after they begin or are anticipated. 238
ii.

Threshold Levels

As discussed above, funds will be permitted to impose fees and gates after a fund’s
weekly liquid assets have dropped below 30%, and will be required to impose a liquidity fee
after a fund’s weekly liquid assets drop below 10%, unless the fund’s board determines such fee
is not in the best interests of the fund. As proposed, the threshold for the imposition of fees and
gates would have been a drop below 15% weekly liquid assets and a fund’s board could have
determined that a fee would not be in the best interests of the fund.
Various commenters proposed modifications or substitutes to the proposed 15% weekly
liquid assets threshold. For example, one commenter, citing a survey of its members, suggested
fund boards be given discretion to impose a liquidity fee when weekly liquid assets fall below a
specified threshold, and that a default liquidity fee could be imposed at a specified lower level of
weekly liquid assets (unless the board determines otherwise). 239 Another commenter proposed a
blended trigger for the imposition of gates at 30% weekly liquid assets or a drop in NAV below

237

Although funds will have to wait until a fund’s weekly liquid assets drop below 30% in order to impose a
fee or gate, we believe the higher threshold of 30% for discretionary fees and gates should assuage
concerns about having to wait to impose redemption restrictions until a fund’s weekly liquid assets breach
the default liquidity fee threshold.

238

See, e.g., Treasury Strategies III Comment Letter (“We found that [f]ees and [g]ates can stop and prevent
runs, provided that they are implemented effectively through policy and preemptive action by fund
boards.”). For example, if a fund board believes that a fund’s weekly liquid assets are likely to fall below
the 10% weekly liquid asset threshold for a default liquidity fee, it could choose to impose a liquidity fee
prior to the fund breaching this threshold.

$0.995, whichever comes first. 240
As discussed in this section, we have been persuaded by commenters that boards should
be allowed some flexibility to impose a fee or gate when heavy redemptions are underway or
clearly foreseeable. As was suggested by a commenter, 241 we are adopting a tiered threshold for
the imposition of fees and gates, with a higher threshold for discretionary fees and gates and a
lower threshold for default liquidity fees. We believe this tiered approach will allow boards to
determine with greater flexibility the best line of defense against heavy redemptions and to tailor
that defense to the specific circumstances of the fund. We also believe this tiered approach will
allow boards to act quickly to stem heavy redemptions. This approach also recognizes, however,
that at a certain point (under the amended rule, a drop below 10% weekly liquid assets), boards
should be required to consider what, if any, action should be taken to address a fund’s liquidity.
We are adopting a threshold of less than 30% weekly liquid assets at which fund boards
will be able to impose discretionary fees and gates, as was suggested by a commenter. 242 As 30%
weekly liquid assets is the minimum required under rule 2a-7, we believe it is an appropriate
threshold at which fund boards should be able to consider fees and gates as measures to stop
heavy redemption activity that may be building in a fund. 243 A drop in weekly liquid assets

See SIFMA Comment Letter; but see, e.g., Peirce & Greene Comment Letter (suggesting the Commission
should adopt entirely discretionary gates).

242

See Capital Advisors Comment Letter. As discussed below, we have not included an NAV trigger along
with the weekly liquid assets trigger (as suggested by the commenter) because we do not believe that a
fund’s NAV is an appropriate trigger for liquidity fees and redemption gates. See infra note 253 and
accompanying text.

243

As was discussed in the Proposing Release, we considered a threshold based on the level of daily liquid
assets rather than weekly liquid assets. We noted in the Proposing Release that we expect that a money
market fund would meet heightened shareholder redemptions first by depleting the fund’s daily liquid

84

below the regulatory minimum could indicate current or future liquidity problems or forecast
impending heavy redemptions, or it could be the result of idiosyncratic stresses that may be
resolved without intervention – in either case, the money market fund’s board, in consultation
with the fund’s investment adviser, is best suited to determine whether fees and gates can address
the situation. 244
Some commenters recommended that the default liquidity fee threshold be lowered to
10% weekly liquid assets. 245 These commenters generally argued that a 10% threshold, rather
than a 15% threshold, would produce fewer “false positives” – instances when a money market
fund is, in fact, not experiencing stress on its liquidity but is nonetheless required (absent a board
finding) to impose a liquidity fee – which should prevent unnecessary board meetings that would
not be in the interest of shareholders or market stability. 246 As was discussed in the Proposing
Release, the threshold for a default liquidity fee should indicate distress in a fund and be a
threshold few funds would cross in the ordinary course of business. Commission staff analysis
shows that from March 2011 through October 2012, there was only one month that any funds
reported weekly liquid assets below 15% and only one month that a fund reported weekly liquid
assets and next by depleting its weekly liquid assets, as daily liquid assets tend to be the most liquid. Thus,
we believe that basing the threshold on weekly liquid assets rather than daily liquid assets provides a better
picture of the fund’s overall liquidity position. In addition, a fund’s levels of daily liquid assets may be
more volatile because they are typically used first to satisfy day-to-day shareholder redemptions, and thus
more difficult to use as a gauge of fund distress. Commenters did not specifically suggest a threshold based
on daily liquid assets.

gates, see infra section III.A.2.b herein. For a discussion of the factors a board may wish to consider in
determining the level of a liquidity fee, see infra section III.A.2.c herein.

assets below 10%. 247
In light of commenters’ concerns and the Commission staff analysis, and in recognition
of the increased board discretion to impose fees and gates that we are adopting in today’s
amendments, we have determined that a threshold of 10% weekly liquid assets (down from the
proposed 15%) is an appropriate threshold for the imposition of a default liquidity fee. We
believe that the flexibility in today’s amendments justifies a decrease in the default liquidity fee
threshold, particularly because fund boards will be allowed to impose discretionary fees and
gates, if it is in the best interests of a fund, at any time after a fund’s weekly liquid assets drop
below 30% – i.e., before the default liquidity fee threshold is reached. 248 Our proposal, which, as
noted above, set a higher threshold for the default liquidity fee or the imposition of a gate, did
not include board discretion to use these tools prior to reaching this threshold. Under today’s
amendments, however, the 10% default liquidity fee threshold is designed effectively as a floor
to require fund boards to focus on a fund’s liquidity and to consider what action to take, if any,
before liquidity is further depleted. Additionally, Commission staff analysis shows that a 10%
threshold for the default liquidity fee is also a threshold few funds would cross in the ordinary
course of business. 249
247

See Proposing Release supra note 25, at 177. Our staff conducted an analysis of Form N-MFP data that
showed that if the default fee triggering threshold was between 25-30% weekly liquid assets, funds would
have crossed this threshold every month except one during the period, and if it was set at between 20-25%
weekly liquid assets, some funds would have crossed it nearly every other month. The analysis further
showed that during the period, there was one month in which funds reported weekly liquid assets below
15% (four funds in June 2011) and one month in which a fund reported weekly liquid assets below 10%
(one fund in May 2011). Based on this data and industry comment, we proposed a default fee threshold of
15% weekly liquid assets.

248

See rule 2a-7(c)(2)(i); cf. Treasury Strategies III Comment Letter (suggesting that fees and gates will better
prevent a run if they are imposed intraday).

86

Some commenters on the fees and gates threshold suggested moving away from weekly
liquid asset levels as the triggering mechanism. 250 One commenter noted that the most
appropriate rules-based threshold would be if the shadow price fell to $0.9975 or below. 251
Another commenter also suggested that, to the extent the Commission moved forward with a
rules-based threshold, “defaults, acts of insolvency, significant downgrades or determinations
that a portfolio security no longer presents minimum credit risk” should be added to the
situations in which a board could impose a fee or gate. 252
We do not believe a drop in a fund’s NAV (or shadow price, to the extent the money
market fund is a stable value fund), or a default, act of insolvency, significant downgrade or
determination that a portfolio security no longer presents minimum credit risk, would be the
appropriate threshold for the imposition of fees and gates. First, as we discussed in the
Proposing Release, we are concerned that a money market fund being able to impose a fee only
October 2012, there was only one month that any funds reported weekly liquid assets below 15% and only
one month that a fund reported weekly liquid assets below 10%). Because liquidity data reported to the
Commission is as of month end, it could be the case that more than one money market fund’s level of
weekly liquid assets fell below 10% on other days of the month during our period of study. However, this
number may overestimate the percentage of funds that are expected to impose a default liquidity fee
because funds may increase their risk management around their level of weekly liquid assets in response to
the default liquidity fee to avoid breaching the default liquidity fee threshold, or that many funds may
impose fees and/or gates after they cross the 30% threshold, allowing them to repair their liquidity prior to
reaching the 10% threshold.
250

But see Fidelity Comment Letter (“We also favor using the weekly liquid asset level as the measure
because it is the best indicator of liquidity and is less susceptible to extraneous factors. In addition, the
weekly liquidity structure reflects daily liquidity within its calculation.”). As noted in section III.A.2.a.i, a
number of commenters argued for giving boards the discretion to impose redemption restrictions. See
supra note 230.

251

See HSBC Comment Letter; see also Comment Letter of HSBC Global Asset Management Ltd (Feb. 15,
2013) (available in File No. FSOC–2012–0003) (“HSBC FSOC Comment Letter”) (suggesting setting the
market-based NAV trigger at $0.9975). This commenter asserted that such a trigger would ensure that
shareholders only pay a fee when redemptions would actually cause the fund to suffer a loss and thus
redemptions clearly disadvantage remaining shareholders.

252

See Federated II Comment Letter.

87

when the fund’s NAV or shadow price has fallen by some amount may in certain cases come too
late to mitigate the potential consequences of heavy redemptions on a fund’s liquidity and to
fully protect investors. 253 Heavy redemptions can impose adverse economic consequences on a
money market fund even before the fund actually suffers a loss. They can deplete the fund’s
most liquid assets so that the fund is in a substantially weaker position to absorb further
redemptions or losses. Second, the thresholds we are adopting today are just that – thresholds. If
it is not in the best interests of a fund, a board is not required to impose a liquidity fee or
redemption gate when the fund’s weekly liquid assets have fallen below 30% or 10%,
respectively. Moreover, once a fund has crossed below a weekly liquid asset threshold, a board
is not prevented from taking into account whether the fund’s NAV or shadow price has
deteriorated in considering whether to impose fees or gates. Finally, the fees and gates
amendments are intended to address the liquidity of the fund and its ability to meet redemptions,
not to address every possible circumstance that may adversely affect a money market fund and
its holdings. However, if a particular circumstance, such as a default, act of insolvency,
significant downgrade, or increased credit risk, affects the liquidity of a fund such that its weekly
liquid assets drop below the 30% threshold for imposition of fees and gates, a fund could then
impose a fee or gate.
Another commenter suggested basing the threshold for redemption gates on the level at
253

As we also discussed in the Proposing Release, a threshold based on shadow price raises questions about
whether and to what extent shareholders differentiate between realized (such as those from security
defaults) and market-based losses (such as those from market interest rate changes) when considering a
money market fund’s shadow price. If shareholders do not redeem in response to market-based losses (as
opposed to realized losses), it may be inappropriate to base a fee on a fall in the fund’s shadow price if such
a fall is only temporary. On the other hand, a temporary decline in the shadow price using market-based
factors can lead to realized losses from a shareholder’s perspective if redemptions cause a fund with an
impaired NAV to “break the buck.” See Proposing Release supra note 25, at 179-180.

88

which a money market fund’s liquidity would force it to sell assets. 254 This particular commenter
was concerned that a threshold based on 15% weekly liquid assets might otherwise cause funds
close to the threshold to start selling assets to avoid crossing the threshold, which could have a
larger destabilizing effect on the markets. 255 We appreciate the commenter’s concerns and
believe that the higher weekly liquid asset threshold for the imposition of fees and gates and the
increased board flexibility included in today’s amendments should lessen such a risk. In
particular, as discussed above in section III.A.1.c.i, we believe that the 30% weekly liquid assets
threshold will allow a money market fund to impose a fee or gate while it still has substantial
remaining internal liquidity, thus putting it in better position to bear redemptions without a
broader market impact because it can satisfy redemption requests through internally generated
cash and not through asset sales (other than perhaps sales of government securities that tend to
increase in value and liquidity in times of stress). In addition, the board flexibility in today’s
amendments could result in funds imposing gates at different times and, thus, to the extent funds
determine to dispose of their assets to raise liquidity, it could also result in funds disposing assets
at different times, lessening any potential strain on the markets.
b.

Board Determinations

In the Proposing Release, we discussed a number of factors that a fund’s board of
directors may want to consider in determining whether to impose a liquidity fee or redemption
gate. 256 We received a variety of comments related to these factors and, more generally, about

board determinations regarding fees and gates. Some commenters suggested that the
Commission provide additional guidance on the nature and scope of the findings that boards can
make. 257 A commenter asked the Commission to provide an expanded list of examples and a
non-exclusive list of factors to be considered by boards with respect to imposing a fee or gate. 258
The commenter added that the Commission should clarify that boards need to consider only
those factors they reasonably believe to be relevant, not all factors or examples that the
Commission might generally suggest. 259
In contrast, another commenter, an industry group representing fund directors, supported
the Commission providing only minimal guidance on what factors boards might consider. 260
This commenter argued that “providing any guidance on what factors boards should consider
(beyond the very general and non-exclusive examples in the Proposing Release) is likely to be
counter-productive.” 261 The commenter also suggested that the Commission clarify that a “best
interests of the fund” standard would not demand that boards place significant emphasis on the
broader systemic effects of their decision. 262
The “best interests” standard in today’s amendments recognizes that each fund is
different and that, once a fund’s weekly liquid assets have dropped below the minimum required

by rule 2a-7, a fund’s board is best suited, in consultation with the fund’s adviser, to determine
when and if a fee or gate is in the best interests of the fund. 263 The factors we set forth in the
Proposing Release were intended only as possible factors a board may consider when making a
best interests determination. They were not meant to be a one-size-fits-all or exhaustive list of
factors. We agree with the commenter who suggested an exclusive list of factors could be
counter-productive. We recognize that there are differences among funds and that the markets
are dynamic, particularly in a crisis situation. Accordingly, an exhaustive list of factors may not
address each fund’s particular circumstances and could quickly become outdated. Instead, we
believe a fund board should consider any factors it deems appropriate when determining whether
fees and/or gates are in the best interests of a fund. We note that these factors may include the
broader systemic effects of a board’s decision, but point out that the applicable standard for a
board’s determination under the amended rule is whether a fee or gate is in the fund’s best
interests.
Nonetheless, we believe it is appropriate to provide certain guideposts that boards may
want to keep in mind, as applicable and appropriate, when determining whether a fund should
impose fees or gates and are providing such guidance in this Release. As recognized in the
Proposing Release, there are a number of factors a board may want to consider. These may
include, but are not limited to: relevant indicators of liquidity stress in the markets and why the
fund’s weekly liquid assets have fallen (e.g., Have weekly liquid assets fallen because the fund is
experiencing mounting redemptions during a time of market stress or because a few large

shareholders unexpectedly redeemed shares for idiosyncratic reasons unrelated to current market
conditions or the fund?); the liquidity profile of the fund and expectations as to how the profile
might change in the immediate future, including any expectations as to how quickly a fund’s
liquidity may decline and whether the drop in weekly liquid assets is likely to be very short-term
(e.g., Will the decline in weekly liquid assets be cured in the next day or two when securities
currently held in the fund’s portfolio qualify as weekly liquid assets?); 264 for retail and
government money market funds, whether the fall in weekly liquid assets has been accompanied
by a decline in the fund’s shadow price; 265 the make-up of the fund’s shareholder base and
previous shareholder redemption patterns; and/or the fund’s experience, if any, with the
imposition of fees and/or gates in the past.
Some commenters urged the Commission to affirm that a board’s deliberations would be
protected by the business judgment rule. 266 One commenter was particularly concerned about the
threat of litigation if boards were not protected by the rule, as it could “chill the board’s ability to
act in a manner that would be highly counterproductive in times of market stress.” 267 While
sensitive to this commenter’s concerns, we do not believe it would be appropriate for us to
address the application of the business judgment rule because the business judgment rule is a
construct of state law and not the federal securities laws.

264

As discussed in the Proposing Release, many money market funds “ladder” the maturities of their portfolio
securities, and thus it could be the case that a fall in weekly liquid assets will be rapidly cured by the
portfolio’s maturity structure. See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at 179.

265

Likewise, a floating NAV fund’s board may wish to consider any drops in the fund’s NAV.

266

See, e.g., Dreyfus Comment Letter; Chamber II Comment Letter; MFDF Comment Letter; IDC Comment
Letter.

267

See MFDF Comment Letter.

92

Other commenters proposed that boards should be permitted to reasonably determine and
commit themselves in advance to a policy to not allow a fee or gate to ever be imposed on a
fund. 268 We disagree. A blanket decision on the part of a fund board to not impose fees or gates,
without any knowledge or consideration of the particular circumstances of a fund at a given time,
would be flatly inconsistent with the fees and gates amendments we are adopting today, which,
at a minimum, require a fund to impose a liquidity fee when its weekly liquid assets have
dropped below 10%, unless the fund’s board affirmatively finds that such fee is not in the best
interests of the fund. As discussed above, we believe that when a fund falls below 10% weekly
liquid assets, its liquidity is sufficiently stressed that its board should be required to consider,
based on the facts and circumstances at that time, what, if any, action should be taken to address
a fund’s liquidity. We regard fees and gates as additional tools for boards to employ when
necessary and appropriate to protect the fund and its shareholders. We note, however, that our
amendments do not require funds to impose fees and gates when it is not in a fund’s best
interests.
Certain commenters cited operational challenges with respect to fees and gates and board
quorum requirements, given that in a crisis a board’s independent board members may not be
readily available on short notice. 269 Commenters thus proposed that the quorum requirement be
relaxed to require only the approval of a majority of independent directors available rather than

268

See Goldman Sachs Comment Letter; ABA Business Law Section Comment Letter. These commenters
were concerned that uncertainties over a fee or gate could lead to pre-emptive runs. We discuss preemptive runs in section III.A.1.c.i of this Release.

Letter”); ABA Business Law Section Comment Letter; Comment Letter of Ropes & Gray LLP (Sept. 17,

93

of all independent directors. 270
We have not made the requested change. The requirement that a majority of independent
directors make a determination with respect to a fund matter is not unique to today’s
amendments. This requirement is widely used in the Investment Company Act and its rules,
including a number of other exemptive rules. 271 As we have emphasized, independent directors
are the “independent watchdogs” of a fund, and the Investment Company Act and its rules rely
on them to protect investor interests. 272 A determination with respect to fees and gates by less
than a majority of independent directors would not provide the level of independent oversight we
are seeking in today’s amendments, or in carrying out the purposes of the Investment Company
Act. The decision to impose redemption restrictions on a fund’s investors has significant
ramifications for shareholders, and it is one that we believe should be entrusted only to a fund’s
board, including its independent directors. We note, however, that today’s amendments do not
require a best interests determination to be made at an in-person meeting and, thus, fund boards,
including their independent directors, could hold meetings telephonically or through any other
technological means by which all directors could be heard. 273
Some commenters asserted that a fund’s adviser or sponsor should have greater input

272

See Role of Independent Directors of Investment Companies, Investment Company Act Release No. 24082
(Oct. 15, 1999).

273

The Commission has previously recognized that fund boards can hold meetings telephonically or through
other technological means by which all directors can be heard simultaneously. See, e.g., rule 15a-4
(permitting the approval of an interim advisory contract by a fund board at a meeting in which directors
may participate by any means of communication that allows all directors participating to hear each other
simultaneously during the meeting).

94

regarding the imposition of a fee or gate. 274 For example, one commenter urged the Commission
to recognize that “the primary role of the board is oversight” and acknowledge “both the ability
and practical necessity of delegating day-to-day decision-making functions to a fund’s officers
and investment adviser/administrator pursuant to procedures approved by the board.” 275 A few
other commenters suggested that the Commission provide guidance that an adviser must provide
the board certain information, guidance or a recommendation on whether to impose a fee or
gate. 276
We believe that a fund’s board, and not its adviser, is the appropriate entity to determine
(within the constructs of the rule) when and how a fund will impose liquidity fees and/or
redemption gates. As discussed above, given the role of independent directors, a fund’s board is
in the best position to determine whether a fee or gate is in the best interests of the fund. 277 The
Investment Company Act and its rules require many other fund fees and important matters to be
approved by a fund’s board, including a majority of independent directors, and we do not believe
that liquidity fees and redemption gates should be treated differently. 278
We note that although the final rule amendments contemplate that information from a

Comment Letter.

Funds (Sept. 17, 2013) (“Wilmington Trustees Comment Letter”); ABA Business Law Section Comment
Letter.

277

If a fund’s adviser was charged with determining when to impose fees and gates, it could choose,
irrespective of its fiduciary duty, to act in its own interests rather than the interests of fund shareholders by,
for example, not imposing a fee or gate for fear that it would negatively impact the adviser’s reputation.
We note that the role of independent directors on a fund board should counteract any similar concerns on
the part of interested directors.

278

See, e.g., section 15(a)-(c); rule 12b-1 and rule 22c-2.

95

fund’s adviser will inform the board’s determination involving a fee or gate, 279 we are not
charging a fund’s adviser with specific duties under today’s amendments. As the board is the
entity charged with overseeing the fund and determining whether a fee or gate is in the fund’s
best interests, we believe the board should dictate the information and analysis it needs from the
adviser in order to inform its decision. Nonetheless, as a matter of course and in light of its
fiduciary duty to the fund, an adviser should provide the board with necessary and relevant
information to enable the board to make the determinations under the rule.
c.

Size of Liquidity Fee

Today’s amendments will permit a money market fund to impose a discretionary liquidity
fee of up to 2% after its weekly liquid assets drop below 30% of its total assets. We are also
adopting a default liquidity fee of 1% that must be imposed if a fund drops below 10% weekly
liquid assets, unless a fund’s board determines not to impose such a fee, or to impose a lower or
higher fee (not to exceed 2%) because it is in the best interests of the fund. 280 As proposed, the
amendments would have required funds to impose a default liquidity fee of 2% after a fund’s
weekly liquid assets dropped below 15% of its total assets, although (as under our final
amendments) fund boards could have determined not to impose the fee or to lower the fee.
We received a wide range of comments on the size and structure of the proposed liquidity
fee. 281 A few commenters expressly supported a default fee of 2%. 282 One commenter expressed

279

Because a fund’s adviser is responsible for managing the portfolio, it is the entity that will have direct
access to information on the fund’s liquidity. As noted below, a fund’s adviser should provide the board
with all necessary and relevant information to make the determinations under the rule.

280

See rule 2a-7(c)(2)(ii)(A).

281

We note that prior to issuing the proposal, commenters had suggested liquidity fee levels ranging from 1%
to 3% could be effective. See, e.g., Comment Letter of Vanguard (Jan. 15, 2013) (available in File No.

96

concern that a maximum 2% fee may be insufficient in times of crisis and urged the Commission
to permit greater flexibility in setting an even higher fee if necessary. 283
Other commenters explicitly argued against a default fee of 2%. 284 One commenter noted
that 2% would be excessive “since it is far higher than the actual cost of liquidity paid by money
market funds even at the height of the financial crisis.” 285 Other commenters described a 2% fee
as punitive 286 and arbitrary. 287 A number of commenters favored instead a default fee of 1%
while also allowing boards discretion to set a higher or lower fee. 288
As suggested by commenters, the amendments we are adopting today will impose a
default liquidity fee of 1%, that may be raised or lowered (or not imposed at all) by a fund’s
board. As discussed below, we are persuaded by commenters that 2% may be higher than most
liquidity costs experienced when selling money market securities in a crisis, and may thus result
in a penalty for redeeming shareholders over and above paying for the costs of their liquidity. 289

See, e.g., SIFMA Comment Letter (“Our members’ consensus is that a redemption fee of 100 basis points

times of market stress, and avoid imposing a punitive charge on shareholders.”); Fidelity Comment Letter

We are also persuaded by commenters that fund boards may be reluctant to impose a fee that is
lower than the default liquidity fee for fear of being second-guessed – by the market, the
Commission, or otherwise. 290 Accordingly, commenters supporting the 1% default fee have
persuaded us that 1% is the correct default fee level.
Furthermore, analysis by Commission staff of liquidity costs of certain corporate bonds
during the financial crisis further confirms that a reduced default fee of 1% is appropriate. 291
DERA staff estimated increases in transaction spreads for certain corporate bonds that occurred
during the financial crisis. 292 Relative to transaction spreads observed during the pre-crisis
period from January 2, 2008 to September 11, 2008, average transaction spreads increased by
54.1 bps for Tier 1 eligible securities and by 104.4 bps for Tier 2 eligible securities during the
period from September 12, 2008 to October 20, 2008. These estimates indicate that market
stress increases the average cost of obtaining liquidity by an amount closer to 1% than 2%. 293

immediately following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and determined that the highest liquidation cost
was less than 50 basis points of face value. Recognizing that liquidation costs in a future market stress
scenario may be greater, we think it is reasonable to set a liquidation fee at 100 basis points or one
percent.”).

DERA obtained information on trades in Tier 1 and Tier 2 eligible securities, as defined in rule 2a-7 from
TRACE (Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine) between January 2, 2008 through December 31, 2009,
and formed a Tier 1 and a Tier 2 sample. TRACE provides transaction records for TRACE eligible
securities that have a maturity of more than a year at issuance. Money market instruments, sovereign debt,
and debt securities that have a maturity of less than a year at issuance are not reported in TRACE and hence
DERA’s sample differs from what money market funds hold. Nevertheless, the samples constructed from
TRACE provide estimates for costs of liquidity during market stress since the selected securities have
similar time-to-maturity and credit risk characteristics as those permitted under rule 2a-7. DERA included
in the samples only trades of bonds with fewer than 120 days to maturity and with a trade size of at least
$100,000. DERA classified bonds with credit ratings equal to AAA, AA+, AA, or AA- as Tier 1 eligible
securities. The average days to maturity for Tier 1 securities in the sample is 67 days, which roughly
reflects the 60-day weighted average maturity limit specified in rule 2a-7. Bonds with credit ratings equal

We received a number of comments on DERA’s analysis of liquidity costs. 294 Some
commenters agreed that DERA’s analysis supports a default liquidity fee of 1% and that 1% is
the appropriate level for the fee. 295 Other commenters, however, took issue with DERA’s
methodology in examining liquidity costs and, one commenter suggested a default fee “as low
as” 0.50% may be appropriate. 296
As discussed in the Proposing Release, we have attempted to set the default liquidity fee
high enough to deter shareholder redemptions so that funds can recoup costs of providing
liquidity to redeeming shareholders in a crisis and so that the fund’s liquidity is not depleted, but
low enough to permit investors who wish to redeem despite the cost to receive their proceeds
to A+, A, or A- represent Tier 2 eligible securities. The average days to maturity for Tier 2 securities in the
sample is 28 days, which is somewhat lower than the 45-day weighted average maturity limit required by
rule 2a-7.

See SIFMA II Comment Letter (“Data in the [DERA] Liquidity [Fee Memo] support that a lower default
level [from the level proposed] will effectively compensate money market funds for the cost of liquidity
during market turmoil…. A 100 basis point (1%) default level for the liquidity fee will more closely
approximate the fund’s cost of providing liquidity during a crisis period for a portfolio comprised largely of
Tier 1 securities.”); Dreyfus DERA Comment Letter (“We read [DERA’s analysis] and interpret the
average spread calculations contained [in the DERA Liquidity Fee Memo] to support a [default liquidity
fee] of 1% and not 2%, as proposed.”); Fidelity DERA Comment Letter (supporting a 1% liquidity fee and
suggesting the empirical market data examined by DERA in its Liquidity Fee Memo is “critical in order for
the SEC to determine the size of a liquidity fee,” but noting that the methodology in DERA’s analysis
“overstates the estimates of absolute spreads.”)

See Invesco DERA Comment Letter (suggesting concerns with the data and methodology used in DERA’s

TRACE data); Comment Letter of Federated Investors Inc. (Liquidity Fee) (Apr. 23, 2014) (“Federated
DERA II Comment Letter”) (suggesting it generally agrees with DERA’s methodology, but believes that a
more appropriate default liquidity fee may be “as low as” 0.50% because “use of [TRACE] bond data as
the basis for spread analysis led DERA to find significantly larger spreads than it would have found had it
based its analysis on the short-term instruments in which MMFs actually invest”); see also Fidelity DERA
Comment Letter (supporting a 1% default liquidity fee, but suggesting that the spreads cited in DERA’s
analysis are higher than those it has seen it its experience and that its independent analysis reflects average

bankruptcy).

without bearing disproportionate costs. 297 Based on the comments we received on the proposal,
we believe that a default fee of 1% strikes this balance. Although we have looked to the DERA
study as confirming our decision based on comments we received supporting the 1% fee, we
recognize commenters’ critiques of the methodology used in the DERA analysis. We also note,
however, that DERA acknowledged in its memorandum that its samples were not perfectly
analogous to money market fund holdings, but that the samples nevertheless “provide estimates
for costs of liquidity during market stress since the selected securities have similar time-tomaturity and credit risk characteristics as those permitted under Rule 2a-7.” 298 Moreover, at least
one commenter who took issue with DERA’s samples agreed, based on its own independent
analysis, that a default liquidity fee of 1% is appropriate. 299 Furthermore, because we recognize
that establishing any fixed fee level may not precisely address the circumstances of a particular
fund in a crisis, we are permitting (as in the proposal) fund boards to alter the level of the default
liquidity fee and to tailor it to the specific circumstances of a fund. As amended, rule 2a-7 will
permit fund boards to increase (up to 2%), decrease (to, for example, 0.50% as suggested by a
commenter), or not impose the default 1% liquidity fee if it is in the best interests of the fund.

a 2% fee would be punitive); see also supra note 281.

information is not publicly available, and we note that only one commenter on the DERA Liquidity Fee
Memo provided specific information in this area. See BlackRock DERA Comment Letter; Fidelity DERA
Comment Letter (providing specific information on spreads during the financial crisis and stating that a 1%
default liquidity fee is appropriate). We believe one data point is not adequate for us to draw conclusions
on liquidity costs in money market funds during the crisis.

100

As proposed and supported by commenters, 300 we are limiting the maximum liquidity fee
that may be imposed by a fund to 2%. As with the default fee, we seek to balance the need for
liquidity costs to be allocated to redemptions with shareholders’ need to redeem absent
disproportionate costs. We also believe setting a limit on the level of a liquidity fee provides
notice to investors about the extent to which a liquidity fee could impact their investment. In
addition, as recognized by at least one commenter, 301 the staff has noted in the past that fees
greater than 2% raise questions regarding whether a fund’s securities remain “redeemable.” 302
We note that if a fund continues to be under stress even with a 2% liquidity fee, the fund board
may consider imposing a temporary redemption gate under amended rule 2a-7 or liquidating the
fund pursuant to amended rule 22e-3.
As recognized in the Proposing Release, there are a number of factors a board may want
to consider in determining the level of a liquidity fee. These may include, but are not limited to:
changes in spreads for portfolio securities (whether based on actual sales, dealer quotes, pricing
vendor mark-to-model or matrix pricing, or otherwise); the maturity of the fund’s portfolio
securities; changes in the liquidity profile of the fund in response to redemptions and
expectations regarding that profile in the immediate future; whether the fund and its

302

Section 2(a)(32) defines the term “redeemable security” as a security that entitles the holder to receive
approximately his proportionate share of the fund's net asset value. The Division of Investment
Management informally took the position that a fund may impose a redemption fee of up to 2% to cover the
administrative costs associated with redemption, “but if that charge should exceed 2 percent, its shares may
not be considered redeemable and it may not be able to hold itself out as a mutual fund.” See John P.
Reilly & Associates, SEC Staff No-Action Letter (July 12, 1979). This position is currently reflected in
rule 23c-3(b)(1), which permits a maximum 2% repurchase fee for interval funds and rule 22c2(a)(1)(i),which similarly permits a maximum 2% redemption fee to deter frequent trading in mutual funds.

101

intermediaries are capable of rapidly putting in place a fee of a different amount from a
previously set liquidity fee or the default liquidity fee; if the fund is a floating NAV fund, the
extent to which liquidity costs are already built into the NAV of the fund; and the fund’s
experience, if any, with the imposition of fees in the past. We note that fund boards should not
consider our 1% default liquidity fee as creating the presumption that a liquidity fee should be
1%. If a fund board believes based on market liquidity costs at the time or otherwise that a
liquidity fee is more appropriately set at a lower or higher (up to 2%) level, it should consider
doing so. Once a liquidity fee has been imposed, the fund’s board would likely need to monitor
the imposition of such fee, including the size of the fee, and whether it continues to be in the best
interests of the fund. 303
Other commenters argued for even more flexible approaches and/or entirely different
standards for setting a fee. 304 For example, a commenter argued against having any default fee
and instead supported allowing the board to tailor the fee to encompass the cost of liquidity to
the fund. 305 Different commenters similarly argued that liquidity fees should be carefully
calibrated in relation to a fund’s actual cost of liquidity. 306 A commenter noted this calibration
could be achieved by, rather than setting a fixed fee in advance, delaying redemptions for up to
seven days to allow the fund to determine the size of the fee based on actual transaction costs

303

A board may change the level of a liquidity fee at any time if it determines it is in the best interests of the
fund to do so. Similarly, once a gate is imposed, the fund’s board would likely monitor the imposition of
the gate and whether it remains in the best interests of the fund to continue imposing the gate.

incurred on each day’s redemptions. 307 Finally, a commenter proposed a flexible redemption fee
whereby redemptions would occur at basis point NAV (i.e., NAV to the fourth decimal place)
plus 1%. 308
As discussed above, the amendments we are adopting today incorporate substantial
flexibility for a fund board to determine when and how it imposes liquidity fees. We believe that
including in the amended rule a 1% default fee that may be modified by the board is the best
means of directing fund boards to a liquidity fee that may be appropriate in stressed market
conditions, while at the same time providing flexibility to boards to lower or raise the liquidity
fee if a board determines that a different fee would better and more fairly allocate liquidity costs
to redeeming shareholders. We would encourage a fund board, if practicable given any timing
concerns, to consider the actual cost of providing liquidity when determining if the default
liquidity fee is in the fund’s best interests. In addition, we note that under today’s amendments, a
fund board also could, as suggested by a commenter, determine that the default fee is not in the
best interests of the fund and instead gate the fund for a period of time, possibly later imposing a
liquidity fee.
Furthermore, we have determined not to explicitly tie the default liquidity fee to market
indicators. As discussed in the Proposing Release, we believe there are certain drawbacks to
such a “market-sized” liquidity fee. 309 First, it may be difficult for money market funds to
307

See Ropes & Gray Comment Letter.

308

See Capital Advisors Comment Letter.

309

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at 183; see also HSBC FSOC Comment Letter (suggesting that the
amount of the liquidity fee charged could be based on the anticipated change in the market-based NAV of
the fund’s portfolio from the redemption, assuming a horizontal slice of the fund’s portfolio was sold to
meet the redemption request).

103

rapidly determine precise liquidity costs in times of stress when the short-term financing markets
may generally be illiquid. 310 Similarly, the additional burdens associated with computing a
market-sized liquidity fee could make it more difficult for funds and their boards to act quickly
and proactively to stem heavy redemptions. Second, a market-sized liquidity fee does not signal
in advance the size of the liquidity fee shareholders may have to pay if the fund’s liquidity is
significantly stressed. 311 This lack of transparency may hinder shareholders’ ability to make
well-informed investment decisions because investors may invest funds without realizing the
extent of the costs they could incur on their redemptions.
Finally, commenters proposed various potential exemptions from the default liquidity fee.
For example, a commenter suggested an exemption for all shareholders to redeem up to $1
million for incidental expenditures without a fee. 312 Other commenters argued that a fee should
not be imposed on newly purchased shares. 313 For several independent reasons, we do not
currently believe that there should be exemptions to the default liquidity fee. First, because the
circumstances under which liquidity becomes expensive historically have been infrequent, we
310

Our staff gave no-action assurances to money market funds relating to valuation during the financial crisis
because determining pricing in the then-illiquid markets was so difficult. See Investment Company
Institute, SEC Staff No-Action Letter (Oct. 10, 2008) (not recommending enforcement action through
January 12, 2009, if money market funds used amortized cost to shadow price portfolio securities with
maturities of 60 days or less in accordance with Commission interpretive guidance and noting: “You state
that under current market conditions, the shadow pricing provisions of rule 2a-7 are not working as
intended. You believe that the markets for short-term securities, including commercial paper, may not
necessarily result in discovery of prices that reflect the fair value of securities the issuers of which are
reasonably likely to be in a position to pay upon maturity. You further assert that pricing vendors
customarily used by money market funds are at times not able to provide meaningful prices because inputs
used to derive those prices have become less reliable indicators of price.”).

311

A liquidity fee based on market indicators would not provide notice to shareholders of the potential level of
a liquidity fee like our maximum 2% fee and default fee level of 1% provide.

312

313

Comment Letter.

104

believe the imposition of fees and gates will also be infrequent. As long as funds’ weekly liquid
assets are above the regulatory threshold (i.e. 30%), fund shareholders should continue to enjoy
unfettered liquidity for money market fund shares. 314 The likely limited and infrequent use of
liquidity fees leads us to believe exemptions are generally unnecessary. Second, liquidity fees
are meant to impose at least some of the cost of liquidity on those investors who are seeking
liquidity by redeeming their shares. Allowing exemptions to the default liquidity fee would run
counter to this purpose and permit some investors to avoid bearing at least some of their own
costs of obtaining liquidity and could serve to further harm the liquidity of the fund, potentially
requiring the imposition of a liquidity fee for longer than would otherwise be necessary. Third,
as suggested by commenters and discussed in section III.C.7.a below, exemptions to the default
liquidity fee would increase the cost and complexity of the amendments for funds and
intermediaries because funds would have to develop the systems and policies to track, for
example, the amount of each shareholder’s redemption, and could facilitate gaming on the part of
investors because investors could attempt to fit their redemptions within the scope of an
exemption. 315

314

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.342.

315

See, e.g., Federated V Comment Letter (“Any attempt to create exceptions, such as allowing redemptions
free of any liquidity fee up to a set dollar amount or percentage of the shareholder’s account balance, would
add significant operational hurdles to the proposed reform. In order to be applied equitably, prime [money
market funds] would have to take steps to assure that intermediaries were implementing the exceptions on a
consistent basis.”); Fidelity Comment Letter (urging the Commission not to adopt partial gates, which like
an exception to a liquidity fee, would, for example, except a certain amount of redemptions (e.g., up to
$250,000 per shareholder) from a gate that has been imposed). The commenter stated “that the challenges
and costs associated with [partial gates] outweigh the benefits. The systems enhancements necessary to
track holdings for purposes of determining each shareholder’s redemption limit would be more
complicated, cumbersome, and costly than the changes required to implement the full gate, [and] that this
complicated structure lends itself to arbitrary or inconsistent application across the industry and potential
inequitable treatment among shareholders.” Id.

Duration of Fees and Gates

We are adopting, as proposed, a requirement that any fee or gate be lifted automatically
once the fund’s weekly liquid assets have risen to or above 30% of the fund’s total assets. We
are also adopting, with certain modifications from the proposal as discussed below, a
requirement that a money market fund must lift any gate it imposes within 10 business days and
that a fund cannot impose a gate for more than 10 business days in any 90-day period. As
proposed, the amendments would have allowed funds to impose a gate for up to 30 days in any
90-day period.
Several commenters noted positive aspects of the Commission’s proposed duration for
fees and gates. 316 Some commenters, however, suggested that the duration of liquidity fees, like
the duration of redemption gates, should be limited to a number of days. 317 We continue to
believe that the appropriate duration limit on a liquidity fee is the point at which a fund’s assets
rise to or above 30% weekly liquid assets. Thirty percent weekly liquid assets is the minimum
required under rule 2a-7 and thus a fee (or gate) would appear to no longer be justified once a
fund’s level of weekly liquid assets has risen to this level. If we were to limit the imposition of
liquidity fees to a number of days, a fund might have to remove a liquidity fee while it is still
under stress and thus it would not gain the full benefits of imposing the fee. 318 Additionally, if a

Letter.

317

See BlackRock II Comment Letter (“We would also recommend that a MMF not be open with a liquidity
fee for more than 30 days.”); Federated V Comment Letter (suggesting that liquidity fees should be subject
to the same duration limits as redemption gates and proposing a limit of 10 calendar days); J.P. Morgan
Comment Letter; see also UBS Comment Letter (noting that “there should be a maximum time period
during which the liquidity fee … could be imposed”).

318

We note that, unlike a redemption gate, a liquidity fee does not prohibit a shareholder from accessing its

106

fund was required to remove the fee while it was still under stress, it may have to re-impose the
fee shortly thereafter, which could cause investor confusion. 319 We note that a fund’s board can
always determine that it is in the best interests of the fund to lift a fee before the fund’s level of
weekly liquid assets is restored to 30% of its total assets.
We also received a number of comments on the duration of redemption gates. 320 For
example, some commenters described the maximum 30-day term for gating as reasonable, 321
including a commenter that noted it would not be in favor of a shorter time period. 322 Another
commenter stated its support for the Commission’s proposed 30-day time limit for redemption
gates. 323 In addition, an industry group commented that although its members had varying views,
some stressed the importance of the maximum 30-day period to allow the fund adequate time to
replenish its liquidity as securities mature. 324
On the other hand, in response to our request for comment on the appropriate duration of
redemption gates, including our request for comment on a 10-day maximum gating period, some
investment; this distinction, in our view, justifies imposing a limited duration on the imposition of a gate
while not doing so for the imposition of fees. We also note that, once a fund’s weekly liquid assets drop
below the regulatory minimum (30%), it is limited to purchasing only weekly liquid assets, which should
increase the fund’s liquidity and potentially bring it back above the weekly liquid asset threshold. See rule
2a-7(d)(4)(iii).
319

As discussed in the Proposing Release, we considered whether a fee or gate should be lifted automatically
before a fund’s weekly liquid assets were completely restored to their required minimum – for example,
after they had risen to 25%. However, we believe that such a requirement would be inappropriate for the
same reasons we are not limiting the length of time the fee is imposed.

reopen or liquidate thereafter).

107

commenters raised concerns with the proposed 30-day maximum gating period. 325 For example,
one commenter noted that “denying investors access to their cash for more than a brief period”
would “create serious hardships.” 326 This commenter expressed doubt that it would take boards
“much more than a week to resolve what course of action would best serve the interest of their
shareholders” and suggested an alternate maximum gating period of up to 10 calendar days. 327 A
second commenter added that the potential total loss of liquidity for up to 30 days could further
exacerbate pre-emptive runs and even be destabilizing to the short-term liquidity markets, and
suggested an alternative maximum gating period of up to 10 calendar days. 328 Additionally,
some members of an industry group suggested that gating for a shorter period of time would be
more consistent with investors’ liquidity needs and the requirements of the Investment Company
Act. 329
We have carefully considered the comments we received, both on the duration of gates
and on the possibility of pre-emptive runs as a result of potential gates, and have been persuaded
that gates should be limited to a shorter time period of up to 10 business days. 330 As discussed in

325

Comment Letter.

326

See Federated II Comment Letter; Federated V Comment Letter.

327

See Federated II Comment Letter (“Federated had previously proposed limiting any suspension of
redemptions to five or ten business days. Alternative 2, on the other hand, would set the limit in terms of
calendar days. Federated therefore recommends limiting a temporary suspension of redemptions to not
more than ten calendar days.”); Federated V Comment Letter; Federated X Comment Letter; see also
Federated Funds Trustees Comment Letter; J.P. Morgan Comment Letter (suggesting a 10-day gating
period).

328

See J.P. Morgan Comment Letter.

329

See SIFMA Comment Letter.

330

In a change from the proposal, the maximum gating period in the final amendments uses business days
rather than calendar days to better reflect typical fund operations and to mitigate potential gaming of the
application of gates during weekends or periods during which a fund might not already typically accept

108

the Proposing Release and reiterated by commenters, 331 we recognize the strong preference
embodied in the Investment Company Act for the redeemability of open-end investment
company shares. 332 Additionally, as was echoed by a number of commenters, 333 we understand
that investors use money market funds for cash management and a lack of access to their
investment for a long period of time can impose substantial costs and hardships. Indeed, many
shareholders in the Reserve Primary Fund informed us about these costs and hardships during
that fund’s lengthy liquidation. 334 As discussed above, it remains one of our goals to preserve the
benefits of money market funds for investors. Accordingly, upon consideration of the comments
received, we have modified the final rules to limit the redeemability of money market fund

redemption requests. If a fund imposes a gate, it is not required to impose the gate for 10 business days.
Rather, a fund can lift a gate before 10 business days have passed and we would expect a board would
promptly do so if it determines that it is in the best interests of the fund. We note that a money market fund
board would likely meet regularly during any period in which a redemption gate is in place. See supra note
303. Additionally, a fund’s board may also consider permanently suspending redemptions in preparation
for fund liquidation under rule 22e-3 if the fund approaches the 10 business day gating limit.

hardships faced by Reserve Primary Fund shareholders due to having their shareholdings frozen, including

way to trade their portfolios at a time of historic market volatility. No way to make minimum required
distributions from retirement plans. No way to pay property taxes. No way to pay college tuition. It meant
bounced checks and, for retirees, interruption of the cash flow distributions they were counting on to pay
their day-to-day living expenses.”).

shares for a shorter period of time. 335
Some commenters suggested that the longer a potential redemption gate may be imposed,
the greater the possibility that investors may try to pre-emptively redeem from a fund before the
gate is in place. 336 We recognize this concern and believe that if gates are limited to 10 business
days, investors may be less inclined to try to redeem before a gate is imposed because 10
business days is a relatively short period of time and after that time investors will have access to
their investment. 337
We also believe that by limiting gates to 10 business days, investors may be better able to
account for the possibility of redemption gates when determining their investment allocations
and cash management policies. For example, an employer may determine that money market
funds continue to be a viable cash management tool because even if a fund imposes a gate, the
employer could potentially still meet its payroll obligations, depending on its payroll cycle.
Similarly, a retail investor may determine to invest in a money market fund for cash management
purposes because a money market fund’s potential for yield as compared to the interest on a
savings or checking account outweighs the possibility of a money market fund imposing a gate
and delaying payment of the investor’s bills for up to 10 business days.
While we believe temporary gates should be limited to a short period of time, we also

335

We recognize that rule 22e-3 does not limit gates to a short period of time, but under that rule, a gate is
permanent and a fund must liquidate thereafter. See rule 22e-3.

See, e.g., J.P. Morgan Comment Letter; Federated XI Comment Letter.

337

See, e.g., Federated V Comment Letter (“[A 10-day maximum gating period] would also be consistent with
the comments of some of the investors who indicated to Federated that they probably could not go more
than two weeks without access to the cash held in their [money market fund].”) In addition, we note that
10 business days is not significantly longer than funds are statutorily permitted to delay payment on
redemptions. See section 22(e).

110

recognize that gates may be the most effective, and probably only, way for a fund to stop a run
for the duration of the gating period. As one commenter stated, “[s]uspending redemptions
would allow a [b]oard to deal with large-scale redemptions directly, by effectively calling a ‘time
out’ until the [b]oard can decide how to deal with the circumstances prompting the
redemptions.” 338 Accordingly, we believe gates, even those that are limited to up to 10 business
days, will be a valuable tool for funds to limit heavy redemptions in times of stressed liquidity. 339
We also recognize, as suggested by some commenters, 340 that temporary gates should
provide a period of time for funds to gain internal liquidity. In this regard, we note that weekly
liquid assets generally consist of government securities, cash, and assets that will mature in five
business days, 341 and that once a fund has dropped below 30% weekly liquid assets (the required
regulatory minimum, and the threshold for the imposition of gates), the fund can purchase only
weekly liquid assets. 342 Accordingly, because the securities a fund may purchase once it has
imposed a gate will mature, in large part, in five business days, we believe a limit of 10 business
days for the imposition of a gate should provide a fund with an adequate period of time in which
to generate internal liquidity. 343
338

See Federated V Comment Letter.

339

As discussed in supra note 148, as necessary, the Commission also has previously granted orders allowing
funds to suspend redemptions to address exigent circumstances. See, e.g., In the Matter of: Centurion
Growth Fund, Inc., Investment Company Act Release Nos. 20204 (Apr. 7, 1994) (notice) and 20210 (Apr.
11, 1994) (order); In the Matter of Suspension of Redemption of Open-End Investment Company Shares
Because of the Current Weather Emergency, Investment Company Act Release No. 10113 (Feb. 7, 1978).

See rule 2a-7(d)(4)(iii).

343

See J.P. Morgan Comment Letter (“Ten (10) calendar days should provide [money market funds] an
opportunity to rebuild significant amounts of liquidity since the 2010 amendments to Rule 2a-7 require
[money market funds] to invest at least 30% of their portfolios in assets that can provide weekly

111

We further recognize that 10 business days is not significantly longer than the seven days
funds are already permitted to delay payment of redemption proceeds under section 22(e) of the
Investment Company Act. We note, however, that while section 22(e) allows funds to delay
payment on redemption requests, it does not prevent shareholders from redeeming shares. Even
if a fund delays payment on redemptions pursuant to section 22(e), redemptions can continue to
mount at the fund. 344 Unlike payment delays under section 22(e), the temporary gates we are
adopting today will allow a fund a cooling off period during which redemption pressures do not
continue to mount while the fund builds additional liquidity, and the fund’s board can continue to
evaluate the best path forward. Additionally, temporary gates may also provide a cooling off
period for shareholders during which they may gather more information about a fund, allowing
them to make more well-informed investment decisions after a gate is lifted.
Finally, one commenter asked the Commission to clarify that the time limit for
redemption gates may “occur in multiple separate periods within any ninety-day period (as well
as consecutively), and if so, whether the ninety-day period is a rolling period which is
recalculated on a daily basis.” 345 As indicated in the Proposing Release, the intent of the 90-day
limit on redemption gates is to ensure that funds do not circumvent the time limit on redemption

liquidity.”).
344

For example, if on day one, fifty shareholders place redemptions requests with a fund, there is nothing to
stop another fifty shareholders from placing redemption requests on day two. The fund’s liquidity may
continue to be strained because it is required to pay out redemption proceeds to all fifty shareholders from
day one within seven days (and the next day, to all fifty shareholders from day two) and it must do so at
day one’s NAV (and the next day, at day two’s NAV).

Comment Letter”).

112

gates 346 – for example, by reopening on the 9th business day for one business day before reimposing a gate for potentially another 10 business day period. Accordingly, when determining
whether a fund has been gated for more than 10 business days in a 90-day period, the fund
should account for any multiple separate gating periods and assess compliance with the 90-day
limit on rolling basis, calculated daily.
3.

Exemptions to Permit Fees and Gates

The Commission is adopting, as proposed, exemptions from various provisions of the
Investment Company Act to permit a fund to institute liquidity fees and redemption gates. 347 In
the absence of an exemption, imposing gates could violate section 22(e) of the Act, which
generally prohibits a mutual fund from suspending the right of redemption or postponing the
payment of redemption proceeds for more than seven days, and imposing liquidity fees could
violate rule 22c-1, which (together with section 22(c) and other provisions of the Act) requires
that each redeeming shareholder receive his or her pro rata portion of the fund’s net assets. The
Commission is exercising its authority under section 6(c) of the Act to provide exemptions from
these and related provisions of the Act to permit a money market fund to institute liquidity fees
and redemption gates notwithstanding these restrictions. 348 As discussed in the Proposing
346

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at 189.

347

See rule 2a-7(c)(2).

348

Section 6(c). To clarify the application of liquidity fees and redemption gates to variable contracts, we are
also amending rule 2a-7 to provide that, notwithstanding section 27(i) of the Act, a variable insurance
contract issued by a registered separate account funding variable insurance contracts or the sponsoring
insurance company of such separate account may apply a liquidity fee or redemption gate to contract
owners who allocate all or a portion of their contract value to a subaccount of the separate account that is
either a money market fund or that invests all of its assets in shares of a money market fund. See rule 2a7(c)(2)(iv). Section 27(i)(2)(A) makes it unlawful for any registered separate account funding variable
insurance contracts or the sponsoring insurance company of such account to sell a variable contract that is
not a “redeemable security.”

113

Release and in more detail below, we believe that such exemptions do not implicate the concerns
that Congress intended to address in enacting these provisions, and thus they are necessary and
appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes
fairly intended by the Act.
We do not believe that the temporary gates we are allowing in today’s amendments will
conflict with the purposes underlying section 22(e), which was designed to prevent funds and
their investment advisers from interfering with the redemption rights of shareholders for
improper purposes, such as the preservation of management fees. 349 Rather, under today’s
amendments, the board of a money market fund can impose gates to benefit the fund and its
shareholders by making the fund better able to protect against redemption activity that would
harm remaining shareholders, and to allow time for any market distress to subside and liquidity
to build organically.
In addition, gates will be limited in that they can be imposed only for limited periods of
time and only when a fund’s weekly liquid assets are stressed. This aspect of gates, therefore, is
akin to rule 22e-3, which also provides an exemption from section 22(e) to permit money market
fund boards to suspend redemptions of fund shares to protect the fund and its shareholders from
the harmful effects of a run on the fund, and to minimize the potential for disruption to the
securities markets. 350
We are also providing exemptions from rule 22c-1 to permit a money market fund to
impose liquidity fees because such fees can benefit the fund and its shareholders by providing a
349

See 2009 Proposing Release, supra note 66, at n.281 and accompanying text.

350

See 2010 Adopting Release, supra note 17, at text following n.379.

114

more systematic and equitable allocation of liquidity costs. 351 In addition, based on the level of
the liquidity fee imposed, a fee may secondarily benefit a fund by helping to repair its marketbased NAV.
We are permitting money market funds to impose fees and gates in limited situations
because they may provide substantial benefits to money market funds, the short-term financing
markets for issuers, and the financial system, as discussed above. However, we are adopting
limitations on when and for how long money market funds can impose these restrictions because
we recognize that fees and gates may impose hardships on investors who rely on their ability to
freely redeem shares (or to redeem shares without paying a fee). 352 We did not receive comments
suggesting changes to the proposed exemptions and, thus, we are adopting them as proposed. 353
4.

Amendments to Rule 22e-3

Currently, rule 22e-3 allows a money market fund to permanently suspend redemptions
and liquidate if the fund’s board determines that the deviation between the fund’s amortized cost
price per share and its market-based NAV per share may result in material dilution or unfair
results to investors or existing shareholders. 354 Today, we are amending rule 22e-3 to also permit
(but not require) the permanent suspension of redemptions and liquidation of a money market

351

See rule 2a-7(c)(2) (providing that, notwithstanding rule 22c-1, among other provisions, a money market
fund may impose a liquidity fee under the circumstances specified in the rule).

352

See rule 2a-7(c)(2)(i) and (ii); cf. 2010 Adopting Release, supra note 17, at text following n.379 (“Because
the suspension of redemptions may impose hardships on investors who rely on their ability to redeem
shares, the conditions of [rule 22e-3] limit the fund’s ability to suspend redemptions to circumstances that
present a significant risk of a run on the fund and potential harm to shareholders.”)

353

But see NYC Bar Committee Comment Letter (discussing section 22(e) and the Commission’s authority to
allow gates under that section). As discussed above, we are adopting the proposed amendments to rule
22e-3 pursuant to section 6(c).

See rule 22e-3(a)(1).

115

fund if the fund’s level of weekly liquid assets falls below 10% of its total assets. 355 As
proposed, the amendments would have allowed for permanent suspension of redemptions and
liquidation after a money market fund’s level of weekly liquid assets fell below 15%. 356
Commenters generally supported our proposed retention of rule 22e-3 357 and did not
suggest changes to our proposed amendments. We are making a conforming change in the
proposed weekly liquid asset threshold below which a fund may permanently gate and liquidate,
however, in order to correspond to other changes in the proposal related to weekly liquid asset
thresholds for fees and gates. For the reasons discussed above, we have determined to raise the
initial threshold below which a fund board may impose fees and gates, but lower the threshold
for imposition of a default liquidity fee. Due to the absolute and significant nature of a
permanent suspension of redemptions and liquidation, we believe the lower default fee threshold
would also be the appropriate threshold for board action under rule 22e-3. 358 A permanent
suspension of redemptions could be considered more draconian because there is no prospect that
the fund will re-open – instead the fund will simply liquidate and return money to shareholders.
Therefore, we do not believe that the 30% weekly liquid asset threshold for discretionary fees
and gates, which is designed to provide boards with significant flexibility to restore a fund’s

355

See id.

356

The proposed weekly liquid asset threshold corresponded with the proposed threshold for the imposition of
a default fee and/or redemption gates.

357

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter (supporting the retention of rule 22e-3); Stradley Ronon Comment Letter,
(discussing rule 22e-3 and master/feeder funds); Dreyfus Comment Letter; but see Peirce & Green
Comment Letter (suggesting that the requirement in rule 22e-3 that “a fund’s board have made an
irrevocable decision to liquidate the fund … unnecessarily dissuades boards from using redemption
suspensions”).

358

Cf. Proposing Release supra note 25, at 195-196.

116

liquidity in times of stress, would be an appropriate threshold under which fund boards could
permanently close a fund.
Amended rule 22e-3 will allow all money market funds, not just those that maintain a
stable NAV as currently contemplated by rule 22e-3, to rely on the rule when the fund’s liquidity
is significantly stressed. A money market fund whose weekly liquid assets have fallen below
10% of its total assets (whether that fund has previously imposed a fee or gate, or not) may rely
on the rule to permanently suspend redemptions and liquidate. 359 Under amended rule 22e-3,
stable value funds also will continue to be able to suspend redemptions and liquidate if the board
determines that the deviation between its amortized cost price per share and its market-based
NAV per share may result in material dilution or other unfair results to investors or existing
shareholders. 360 Thus, a stable value money market fund that suffers a default will still be able to
suspend redemptions and liquidate before a credit loss leads to redemptions and a fall in its
weekly liquid assets.
5.

Operational Considerations Relating to Fees and Gates
a.

Operational Costs

As discussed in the Proposing Release, we recognize that money market funds and others
in the distribution chain (depending on the structure) will incur some operational costs in
establishing or modifying systems to administer a liquidity fee or temporary gate. 361 These costs

359

We note that a money market fund would not have to impose a fee or a gate before relying on rule 22e-3.
For example, if the fund drops below the 10% weekly liquid asset threshold, its board may determine that a
liquidity fee is not in the best interests of the fund and instead decide to suspend redemptions and liquidate.

360

See rule 22e-3(a)(1).

361

Some commenters also suggested that affected money market funds may have to examine whether
shareholder approval is required to amend organizational documents, investment objectives or policies.

117

may relate to the development of procedures and controls for the imposition of liquidity fees or
updating systems for confirmations and account statements to reflect the deduction of a liquidity
fee from redemption proceeds. 362 Additionally, these costs may relate to the establishment of
new or modified systems or procedures that will allow funds to administer temporary gates. 363
We also recognize that money market funds may incur costs in connection with board meetings
held to determine if fees and/or gates are in the best interests of a fund.
In addition, operational costs may be incurred by, or spread among, a fund’s transfer
agents, sub-transfer agents, recordkeepers, accountants, portfolio accounting departments, and
custodian. 364 Funds also may seek to modify contracts with financial intermediaries or seek
certifications from intermediaries that they will apply a liquidity fee on underlying investors’
redemptions. Money market fund shareholders also may be required to modify their own
systems to prepare for possible future liquidity fees, or to manage gates, although we expect that
only some shareholders will be required to make these changes. 365
A number of commenters suggested that the operational costs and burdens of

See, e.g., Ropes & Gray Comment Letter; Fidelity Comment Letter.
362

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter (“[T]he nature of the liquidity fee would entail changes to support a separate
fee type, appropriate tax treatment, and investor reporting, including transaction confirmation statements
that reference fees charged and applicable tax information for customers.”).

363

See ICI Comment Letter (“Temporary gating also would require fund transfer agent and intermediary
system providers to ensure that their systems can suppress redemption activity while supporting all other
transaction types.”).

364

See ICI Comment Letter; see also Comment Letter of State Street Corporation (Sept. 17, 2013) (“State
Street Comment Letter”) (suggesting that transfer agents and intermediaries will need to modify their
systems to accommodate fees and gates).

365

Many shareholders use common third party-created systems and thus would not each need to modify their
systems.

118

implementing and administrating fees and gates would be manageable. 366 Some commenters
noted that liquidity fees and redemption gates would be more practicable, and less costly and
burdensome to implement and maintain than the other proposed reform alternative (floating
NAV). 367 Another commenter added that the systems modifications for fees and gates, especially
absent a requirement to net each shareholder’s redemptions each day, would be “far less costly
and onerous” than the operational challenges posed by the floating NAV reform alternative. 368
One commenter estimated that implementing fees and gates would require only “minimal
enhancements” to its core custody/fund accounting systems at “minimal costs.” 369 This
commenter further noted that most systems enhancements would likely be required with respect
to the systems of transfer agents and intermediaries, although their systems would likely already
include “basic functionality to accommodate liquidity fees and gates.” 370 Similarly, another
commenter noted that the operational issues of fees and gates could be solved if the industry and
all its stakeholders were given sufficient implementation time. 371 This commenter cited its
ongoing efforts to implement liquidity fees at its Dublin-domiciled money market fund complex

366

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter; HSBC Comment Letter, Federated X Comment Letter; Invesco Comment
Letter.

367

See, e.g., SunTrust Comment Letter; Federated X Comment Letter; Angel Comment Letter. One
commenter argued that for investors, intermediaries and fund complexes alike, the estimated costs of fees
and gates “are dramatically lower” than under the proposed floating NAV alternative. See Federated X
Comment Letter.

368

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter (“System modifications for liquidity fees and gates, especially absent the net
redemption requirement, are far less onerous and costly, however, than the extensive programming and
other system changes necessary to implement a floating NAV as contemplated by the SEC’s proposal.”)

369

See State Street Comment Letter.

370

See id.

See HSBC Comment Letter. The commenter also noted that a variable liquidity fee, if available in a timely
manner, should not create any operational impediments.

119

as an example that the operational challenges and costs would not be prohibitive. 372
Conversely, a number of commenters expressed concern over the operational burdens and
related administrative costs with the fees and gates requirements. 373 Some commenters argued
that the implementation and administration of fees and gates would present significant
operational challenges, in particular with respect to omnibus accounts, sweep accounts,
intermediaries and the investors that use them. 374 One commenter argued that, to reduce
operational burdens, a liquidity fee should be applied to each redemption separately – rather than
net redemptions – in an affected money market fund. 375 This commenter also expressed concern
that intermediaries would not know whether their sweeps would be subject to a liquidity fee or
temporary gate until after the daily investment is made. 376 For example, the possibility of a
liquidity fee would require intermediaries to develop trading systems to ensure that for each
transaction “the investor has sufficient funds to cover the trade itself plus the possibility of a
liquidity fee.” 377 Commenters also suggested that a fee or gate could not be uniformly applied
within omnibus accounts, 378 and certain commenters expressed concern over transparency with

120

respect to fees and gates for shareholders investing through omnibus accounts. 379
We understand that the implementation of fees and gates (as with any new regulatory
requirement) is not without its operational challenges; however, we have sought to minimize
those challenges in the amendments we are adopting today. Based on the comments discussed
above, we now recognize that a liquidity fee could either be applied to each redemption
separately or on a net basis. As indicated by the relevant commenter, our proposal contemplated
net redemptions as an investor-friendly manner of applying a liquidity fee. 380 However, in light
of the comments, we are persuaded that such an approach may be too operationally difficult and
costly for funds to apply and, thus, we are not requiring funds to apply a liquidity fee on a net
basis. 381
We also recognize commenters’ concerns regarding the application of fees and gates in
the context of sweep accounts. We note that during normal market conditions, fees and gates
should not impact sweep accounts’ (or any other investor’s) investment in a money market
fund. 382 We also note that, unlike our proposal, the amendments we are adopting today will

379

See Coal. of Mutual Fund Invs. Comment Letter; Goldman Sachs Comment Letter.

380

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.373 (discussing the application of a liquidity fee and stating that
“[i]f the shareholder of record making the redemption was a direct shareholder (and not a financial
intermediary), we would expect the fee to apply to that shareholder’s net redemption for the day.”); see also
ICI Comment Letter (“Currently, systems used to process money market fund transactions do not have the
ability to assess a fee by netting one or more purchases against one or more redemptions. This process
would be highly complex and require a significant and costly redesign of the processing functionality used
by funds and intermediaries today.” (footnote omitted)).

381

See ICI Comment Letter (noting that “[a]bsent further definition, it would be challenging for funds (and
intermediaries assessing the fee) to determine how a shareholder of record requirement applies to multiple
accounts of a given beneficial owner….”).

382

As discussed herein, however, we recognize that sweep accounts may be unwilling to invest in a money
market fund that could impose a gate. See supra section III.A.1.c.iv and infra note 641.

121

allow fund boards to institute a fee or gate at any time during the day. 383 To the extent a sweep
account’s daily investment is made at the end of the day, we believe this change should reduce
concerns that the sweep account holder will find out about a redemption restriction only after it
has made its daily investment and may lessen the difficulty and costs related to developing a
trading system that can ensure an account has sufficient funds to cover the trade itself plus the
possibility of a liquidity fee.
With respect to omnibus accounts, we continue to believe that liquidity fees should be
handled in a manner similar to redemption fees, which currently may be imposed to deter market
timing of mutual fund shares. 384 As discussed in the Proposing Release, we understand that
financial intermediaries themselves generally impose redemption fees to record or beneficial
owners holding through that intermediary. 385 We recognize commenters’ concerns regarding the
uniform application of liquidity fees through omnibus accounts. We believe, however, that the
benefits and protections afforded to funds and their investors by the fees and gates amendments
justify the application of these amendments in the context of omnibus accounts. In this regard,
we note, as we did in the Proposing Release, that funds or their transfer agents may contract with
intermediaries to have them impose liquidity fees. As we also noted in the Proposing Release,
we understand that some money market fund sponsors may want to review their contractual
arrangements with their funds’ financial intermediaries and service providers to determine
whether any contractual modifications are necessary or advisable to ensure that liquidity fees are
383

See rule 2a-7(c)(2)(i).

384

See rule 22c-2. Our understanding of how financial intermediaries handle redemption fees in mutual funds
is based on Commission staff discussions with industry participants and service providers.

385

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at 191.

122

appropriately applied to beneficial owners of money market fund shares. We further understand
that some money market fund sponsors may seek certifications or other assurances that these
intermediaries and service providers will apply any liquidity fees to the beneficial owners of
money market fund shares. We also recognize that money market funds and their transfer agents
and intermediaries may need to engage in certain communications regarding a liquidity fee.
With respect to those commenters who expressed concern over the transparency of fees
and gates for omnibus investors, we note that fees and gates will be equally transparent for all
investors. Investors, both those that invest directly and those that invest through omnibus
accounts, should have access to information about a fund’s weekly liquid assets, which will be
posted on the fund’s website. All money market fund investors also should receive copies of a
fund’s prospectus, which will include disclosure on fees and gates.
We note that some commenters expressed concern about the costs and burdens associated
with the combination of fees and gates and a floating NAV requirement for institutional prime
funds. 386 As we stated in the Proposing Release, we do not expect that there will be any
significant additional costs from combining the two approaches that are not otherwise discussed
separately with respect to each of the fees and gates and floating NAV reforms. 387 As we
discussed in the Proposing Release, it is likely that implementing a combined approach will save
386

See, e.g., Dreyfus Comment Letter (suggesting the combination of both proposed reform options would be
“excessive and unduly harmful to the utility of [money market funds] without offering any additional
benefit”); Northern Trust Comment Letter (suggesting the combination of both proposed reform options
would “be very costly to implement”). For a discussion of the possible movement out of money market
funds as result of today’s reforms, see infra section III.K. But see State Street Comment Letter (“State
Street does not believe there would be any new costs other than those listed by the staff from a fund
accounting, custody or fund administrator point of view by combining the two alternatives.”).

387

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at 249; see also infra section III.B.8 for a discussion of the costs
associated with the floating NAV requirement.

123

some percentage over the costs of implementing each alterative separately as a result of
synergies and the ability to make a variety of changes to systems at a single time. We do not
expect that combining the approaches will create any new costs as a result of the combination
itself. 388 Accordingly, we estimate, as we did in the proposal, that the costs of implementing a
combined approach would at most be the sum of the costs of each alternative, but may likely be
less.
b.

Cost Estimates

As we indicated in the Proposing Release, the costs associated with the fees and gates
amendments will vary depending on how a fee or gate is structured, including its triggering event
and the level of a fee, as well as on the capabilities, functions and sophistication of the systems
and operations of the funds and others involved in the distribution chain, including transfer
agents, accountants, custodians and intermediaries. These costs relate to the development of
procedures and controls, systems’ modifications, training programs and shareholder
communications and may vary among funds, shareholders and their service providers.
In the Proposing Release, we estimated a range of hours and costs that may be required to
perform activities typically involved in making systems modifications, such as those described
above. We estimated that a money market fund (or others in the distribution chain) would incur
one-time systems modification costs that range from $1,100,000 to $2,200,000. 389 We further

388

See State Street Comment Letter.

389

We estimated that these costs would be attributable to the following activities: (i) project planning and
systems design; (ii) systems modification, integration, testing, installation, and deployment; (iii) drafting,
integrating, implementing procedures and controls; and (iv) preparation of training materials. See also
Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.245 (discussing the bases of our estimates of operational and related
costs in Proposing Release).

124

estimated that the one-time costs for entities to communicate with shareholders about the
liquidity fee or gate would range from $200,500 to $340,000. 390 In addition, we estimated that
the costs for a shareholder mailing would range between $1.00 and $3.00 per shareholder. 391
We also recognized in our proposal that depending on how a liquidity fee or gate is
structured, mutual fund groups and other affected entities already may have systems that can be
adapted to administer a fee or gate at minimal cost, in which case the costs may be less than the
range we estimated above. For example, some money market funds may be part of mutual fund
groups in which one or more funds impose deferred sales loads under rule 6c-10 or redemption
fees under rule 22c-2, both of which require the capacity to administer a fee upon redemptions
and may involve systems that could be adapted to administer a liquidity fee. We estimated that a
money market fund shareholder whose systems required modifications to account for a liquidity
fee or gate would incur one-time costs ranging from $220,000 to $450,000. 392
Some of the comments we received regarding the costs of fees and gates included
alternate estimates of implementation costs. 393 For example, one commenter indicated that its

390

We estimated that these costs would be attributable to the following activities: (i) modifying the website to
provide online account information and (ii) written and telephone communications with investors. See also
Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.245 (discussing the bases of our estimates of operational and related
costs in Proposing Release).

391

Total costs of the mailing for individual funds would vary significantly depending on the number of
shareholders who receive information from the fund by mail (as opposed to electronically).

392

We estimated that these costs would be attributable to the following activities: (i) project planning and
systems design; (ii) systems modification, integration, testing, installation; and (iii) drafting, integrating,
implementing procedures and controls. See also Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.245 (discussing the
bases of our estimates of operational and related costs in Proposing Release).

393

We note that some commenters provided industry-wide estimates of approximately $800 million to $1.75
billion for initial implementation of fees and gates, and estimates of approximately $80 to $350 million for
annual ongoing costs. See ICI Comment Letter; Invesco Comment Letter. As discussed herein, we have
analyzed a variety of commenter estimates and provided cost estimates on a per-fund basis (including a
fund’s distribution chain). We are unable, however, to verify the accuracy or make a relevant comparison

125

costs for implementing fees and gates would likely be in the range of $400,000 to $500,000. 394
This commenter further explained that cost of the fees and gates alternative “reflects the ability
of the affected entity to custom-design its own approach to implementation, as well as the fact
that the necessary changes would not be for use in day-to-day operations, but only for rare
occasions.” 395
A number of other commenters, however, expressed concern that the fees and gates
amendments would impose significant costs and burdens, higher than those estimated in the
Proposing Release. 396 For example, one commenter estimated that it would cost it a total of
approximately $11 million in largely one-time costs, reflecting costs of $9 million to implement
fees and gates as well as $2 million for the related modifications in disclosure. 397 Another
commenter indicated that the implementation costs of fees and gates would be an estimated
$1,697,000. 398 Similarly, an industry group conducting a survey of its members found that the
implementation costs relating to liquidity fees would likely be $2 million or more, according to
between our per-fund cost estimates and the broad range of costs provided by these commenters that apply
to all U.S. prime money market fund investors and/or the entire industry because we are unable to estimate
how many intermediaries will be affected by the fees and gates amendments.

395

See id. As discussed above, another commenter indicated that implementing fees and gates would only
require “minimal enhancements” to its core custody/fund accounting systems at “minimal costs,” and that
most transfer agency and intermediary systems would likely already include “basic functionality to
accommodate liquidity fees and gates.” See State Street Comment Letter. Also as discussed above, an
additional commenter noted that, with respect to its Dublin-domiciled money market fund complex that is
currently implementing the ability to impose liquidity fees, the implementation process has created costs
but that these costs have not been prohibitive. See HSBC Comment Letter.

36% of survey respondents. 399 The group also noted that initial costs would be particularly
significant for distributors and intermediaries, with 60% of respondents estimating initial costs at
$2 million or more. 400 In addition, the survey found initial costs associated with gates to range
from $1 million to $10 million.401
Based on the information provided by commenters, as well as the operational changes in
the final rule, we are increasing our estimates for implementation costs for fees and gates. Three
of the four commenters who provided estimates suggested that the implementation costs would
be around $2,000,000 or more. 402 In addition, we estimate that a fund’s ability to impose a fee or
gate intra-day (as opposed to the end of the day, as contemplated by the proposal) may result in
increased operational costs related to the implementation of fees and gates. Accordingly, we
have increased our original estimate of $1,100,000 to $2,200,000 403 for one-time systems
modification costs to a higher estimate of $1,750,000 to $3,000,000. 404 We continue to estimate
that the one-time costs for entities to communicate with shareholders (including systems costs

See supra notes 394 - 401 and accompanying text.

403

We note that, in the Proposing Release, our estimate was based on a money market fund that determined it
would only impose a flat liquidity fee of a fixed percentage known in advance and have the ability to
impose a gate. This estimate was based on our proposal, which included less flexibility than today’s
amendments. Accordingly, our revised estimates account for a money market fund that has the ability to
vary the level of a fee at imposition or thereafter, or impose a gate.

404

As with our estimate in the Proposing Release, these amounts reflect the costs of one-time systems
modifications for a money market fund and/or others in its distribution chain.

related to communications) about fees and gates would range from $200,500 to $340,000. In
addition, we are increasing the estimated cost for a shareholder mailing from between $1.00 and
$3.00 per shareholder to between $2.00 and $3.00 per shareholder, recognizing that it is unlikely
such a mailing would cost $1.00. We continue to estimate one-time costs of $220,000 to
$450,000 for a money market fund shareholder whose systems (including related procedures and
controls) required modifications to account for a liquidity fee or redemption gate.
We recognized in our proposal that adding new capabilities or capacity to a system will
entail ongoing annual maintenance costs and understand these costs generally are estimated as a
percentage of initial costs of building or expanding a system. We also recognized that ongoing
costs related to fees and gates may include training costs. In the proposal, we estimated that the
costs to maintain and modify the systems required to administer a fee or gate (to accommodate
future programming changes), to provide ongoing training, and to administer the fee or gate on
an ongoing basis would range from 5% to 15% of the one-time costs. We understand that funds
may impose varying liquidity fees and that the cost of varying liquidity fees could exceed this
range, but because such costs depend on to what extent the fees might vary, we do not have the
information necessary to provide a reasonable estimate of how much more (if any) varying fees
might cost to implement.
One commenter indicated a lower estimate of approximately $164,000 for annual
ongoing costs. 405 Another commenter, an industry group that surveyed its members, indicated
that ongoing annual costs of implementing a liquidity fee are likely to range from 10% to 20% of

405

See Federated X Comment Letter.

128

initial costs. 406 The same commenter indicated that ongoing annual costs related to redemption
gates were estimated as 10% to 20% of initial cost by 33% of survey respondents. 407 Based on
these estimates, which are largely similar to our estimates of 5-15% in the Proposing Release, we
continue to believe our estimates in the Proposing Release are appropriate.
We also recognize that funds may incur costs in connection with board meetings held to
determine if fees and/or gates are in the best interests of the fund. In the Proposing Release, we
estimated an average annual time cost of approximately $9,895 per fund in connection with each
such board meeting. 408 We did not receive comments on this estimate. As discussed in section
IV.A.3 herein, we are revising our estimate from $9,895 per fund to $10,700 as result of updated
industry data. 409
Although we have estimated the costs that a single affected entity would incur, we
anticipate that many money market funds, transfer agents, and other affected entities may not
bear the estimated costs on an individual basis. Instead, the costs of systems modifications likely
would be allocated among the multiple users of the systems, such as money market fund
406

See SIFMA Comment Letter. The survey indicated 10% to 15% of initial costs for 17% of respondents,
15% to 20% of initial costs for 12% of respondents, and 20+% of initial costs for 8% of respondents. With
respect to distributor/intermediary respondents, the commenter indicated that ongoing annual costs for a
liquidity fee are estimated as 10% to 20% of initial costs by 29% of distributor/intermediary respondents
(evenly split between those who estimate 10% to 15% of initial cost and those who estimate 15% to 20%).
For asset managers, the commenter indicated that ongoing annual costs for a liquidity fee are estimated to
be 10% to 15% of initial costs by 20% of respondents, 15% to 20% of initial costs by 10% of respondents
and 20+% of initial costs by 20% of respondents.

407

See SIFMA Comment Letter. The commenter note that the 33% of survey respondents were evenly split
between those who estimated 10% to 15% of initial cost and those who estimated 15% to 20% of initial
cost.

members of a fund group, money market funds that use the same transfer agent or custodian, and
intermediaries that use systems purchased from the same third party. Accordingly, we expect
that the cost for many individual entities may be less than the estimated costs due to economies
of scale in allocating costs among this group of users.
6.

Tax Implications of Liquidity Fees

As discussed in the Proposing Release, we understand that liquidity fees may have certain
tax implications for money market funds and their shareholders. 410 We understand that for
federal income tax purposes, shareholders of mutual funds that impose a redemption fee pursuant
to rule 22c-2 under the Investment Company Act generally treat the redemption fee as offsetting
the shareholder’s amount realized on the redemption (decreasing the shareholder’s gain, or
increasing the shareholder’s loss, on redemption). 411 Consistent with this characterization, funds
generally treat the redemption fee as having no associated tax effect for the fund. 412 We
understand that a liquidity fee will be treated for federal income tax purposes consistently with
the way that funds and shareholders treat redemption fees under rule 22c-2.
If, as described above, a liquidity fee has no direct federal income tax consequences for
the money market fund, that tax treatment will allow the fund to use 100% of the fee to help
410

As discussed above, the liquidity fee we are adopting today is analogous to a redemption fee under rule
22c-2, which allows mutual funds to recover costs associated with frequent mutual fund share trading by
imposing a redemption fee on shareholders who redeem shares within seven days of purchase.

411

Cf. 26 CFR 1.263(a)–2(e) (commissions paid in sales of securities by persons who are not dealers are
treated as offsets against the selling price); see also Investment Income and Expenses (Including Capital
Gains and Losses), IRS Publication 550, at 44 (fees and charges you pay to acquire or redeem shares of a
mutual fund are not deductible. You can usually add acquisition fees and charges to your cost of the shares
and thereby increase your basis. A fee paid to redeem the shares is usually a reduction in the redemption
price (sales price).), available at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p550.pdf.

repair a market-based NAV per share that was below $1.00. If redemptions involving liquidity
fees cause a stable value money market fund’s shadow price to reach $1.0050, however, the fund
may need to distribute to the remaining shareholders sufficient value to prevent the fund from
breaking the buck on the upside (i.e., by rounding up to $1.01 in pricing its shares). 413 We
understand that any such distribution would be treated as a dividend to the extent that the money
market fund has sufficient earnings and profits. Both the fund and its shareholders would treat
these additional dividends the same as they treat the fund’s routine dividend distributions. That
is, the additional dividends would be taxable as ordinary income to shareholders and would be
eligible for deduction by the funds.
In the absence of sufficient earnings and profits, however, some or all of these additional
distributions would be treated as a return of capital. Receipt of a return of capital would reduce
the recipient shareholders’ basis (and thus could decrease a loss, or create or increase a gain for
the shareholder in the future when the shareholder redeems the affected shares). Thus, in the
event of any return of capital distributions, as we noted in the Proposing Release, there is a
possibility that the fund, other intermediaries, and the shareholders might become subject to
tax-reporting or tax-payment obligations that do not affect stable value money market funds
currently operating under rule 2a-7. 414

413

See rule 2a-7(g)(2).

414

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at 207. Funds that strive to maintain a stable NAV per share
currently are not subject to these transaction reporting requirements. We have been informed that, today,
the Department of the Treasury and the IRS are proposing new regulations to exempt all money market
funds from transaction reporting obligations. As we describe below, funds and brokers may rely on this
exemption immediately. We note that at least one commenter indicated that funds and intermediaries may
want to provide certain tax information to their investors even if it is not required. See ICI Comment
Letter.

131

Commenters were concerned with this possibility – that investors may have to recognize
capital gains or reduced losses if a fund makes a distribution to shareholders in order to avoid
“breaking the buck” on the upside as a result of excessive fees. 415 Commenters noted that such
distributions and the resulting capital gains or losses upon disposition of investors’ shares would
require funds and intermediaries to start tracking investors’ basis in shares of a fund. 416 In order
to avoid such basis tracking, commenters suggested that the Treasury Department and the
Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) issue guidance stating that when a money market fund is
required to make a payment of excess fees in order to avoid breaking the buck, the fund should
be deemed to have sufficient earnings and profits to treat the distribution as a taxable dividend. 417
Although these events are hypothetically possible, the scenario that would lead to a
payment of excess fees to fund shareholders without sufficient earnings and profits is subject to
many contingencies that make it unlikely to occur. First, as we discussed above, under normal
market conditions, we believe funds will rarely impose liquidity fees. Second, we believe it is
highly unlikely that shareholders would redeem with such speed and in such volume that the
redemptions would create a danger of breaking the buck on the upside before a fund could
remove a fee. Third, the distributions to avoid breaking the buck might not exceed the fund’s
earnings and profits. For this purpose, we understand that the fund’s earnings and profits take
into account the fund’s income through the end of the taxable year. Thus, unless the additional

416

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter; Fidelity Comment Letter; BlackRock II Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment
Letter; but see, e.g., State Street [Appendix 4] (suggesting that a liquidity fee causing the shadow price to
exceed $1.0049 would not result in special distribution to shareholders but most likely be recorded as
income to the fund and paid out to shareholders as an ordinary income distribution).

417

See, e.g., BlackRock II Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter; Wells Fargo Comment Letter.

132

distribution occurs very close to the end of the taxable year, some of the money market fund’s
subsequent income during the year will operate to qualify these distributions as dividends. 418
Finally, as discussed in the Proposing Release, we understand that the tax treatment of a
liquidity fee may impose certain operational costs on money market funds and their financial
intermediaries and on shareholders. However, we have been informed that the Treasury
Department and the IRS today will propose new regulations exempting all money market funds
from certain transaction reporting requirements. 419 This exemption is to be formally applicable
for calendar years beginning on or after the date of publication in the Federal Register of a
Treasury Decision adopting those proposed regulations as final regulations. The Treasury
Department and the IRS have informed us, however, that the text of the proposed regulations
will state that persons subject to transaction reporting may rely on the proposed exemption for all
calendar years prior to the final regulations’ formal date of applicability. Therefore, the Treasury
Department and IRS relief described above is available immediately.
Thus, even in the unlikely event that some shareholders’ bases in their shares change due
to non-dividend distributions, neither fund groups nor their intermediaries will need to track the
tax bases of money market fund shares. On the other hand, if there are any non-dividend
distributions by money market funds, the affected shareholders will need to report in their annual
tax filings any resulting gains 420 or reduced losses upon the sale of affected money market fund

418

A portion of this subsequent income may also have to be distributed to avoid breaking the buck on the
upside. However, if the fund attracts new shareholders, we understand that some of the subsequent income
can be retained, with its associated earnings and profits qualifying the earlier distributions as dividends.

419

See infra section III.B.6.a.

420

Redemptions subject to a liquidity fee would almost always result in losses, but gains are possible in the
unlikely event that a shareholder received a return of capital distribution with respect to some shares.

133

shares. We are unable to quantify with any specificity the tax and operational costs discussed in
this section because we are unable to predict how often liquidity fees will be imposed by money
market funds and how often redemptions subject to liquidity fees would cause the funds to make
returns of capital distributions to the remaining shareholders (although, as noted above, we
believe such returns of capital distributions are unlikely). Commenters did not provide any such
estimates.
7.

Accounting Implications

A number of commenters questioned whether an investment in a money market fund
subject to a possible fee or gate, or in a money market fund that in fact imposes a fee or gate,
would continue to qualify as a “cash equivalent” for purposes of U.S. Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”). 421 We understand that classifying money market fund
investments as cash equivalents is important because, among other things, investors may have
debt covenants that mandate certain levels of cash and cash equivalents. 422 To remove any
uncertainty, several commenters requested that the Commission, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) and/or Government Accounting Standards Board (“GASB”) issue
Because a later redemption of the shares by the shareholder would be for $1.00 each, there would be small
gains with respect to those redemptions. If the money market fund making such a non-dividend
distribution is a floating NAV money market fund and if a shareholder uses the simplified aggregate
method discussed below in section III.B.6.a, then the shareholder would be able to report the gain or loss
without having to track the basis of individual shares.
421

See, e.g., Invesco Comment Letter; BlackRock II Comment Letter; Wells Fargo Comment Letter; see also
Proposing Release, supra note 25, at 246 (stated that “we expect the value of floating NAV funds with
liquidity fees and gates would be substantially stable and should continue to be treated as a cash equivalent
under GAAP.”); ICI Comment Letter (suggesting that any such Commission guidance should also “discuss
whether a money market fund that imposes a liquidity fee and/or gate would continue to be considered a
cash equivalent investment and whether the amount of the fee or the length of the gate would affect the
analysis.”)

In addition, some corporate investors may perceive cash and cash equivalents on a company’s balance
sheet as a measure of financial strength.

134

guidance to clarify whether investments in money market funds will continue to qualify as cash
equivalents under U.S. GAAP. 423 Various commenters on our proposal, including the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) and each of the “Big Four” accounting
firms, stated that a money market fund’s ability to impose fees and gates should not preclude an
investment in the fund from being classified as a “cash equivalent” under U.S. GAAP. 424
Current U.S. GAAP defines cash equivalents as “short-term, highly liquid investments
that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and that are so near their maturity that they
present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates.” 425 U.S.
GAAP includes an investment in a money market fund as an example of a cash equivalent. 426
The Commission’s position continues to be that, under normal circumstances, an investment in a
money market fund that has the ability to impose a fee or gate under rule 2a-7(c)(2) qualifies as a
“cash equivalent” for purposes of U.S. GAAP. 427 However, as is currently the case, events may
occur that give rise to credit and liquidity issues for money market funds. If such events occur,
including the imposition of a fee or gate by a money market fund under rule 2a-7(c)(2),
shareholders would need to reassess if their investments in that money market fund continue to

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter; Fidelity Comment Letter; Fin. Svcs. Roundtable Comment Letter; see also
Proposing Release, supra note 25, at 246 (suggesting that funds with the ability to impose fees and gates
should still be considered cash equivalents). As discussed in section III.C.4 herein, we do not have
authority over the actions that GASB may or may not take with respect to LGIPs.

meet the definition of a cash equivalent. A more formal pronouncement (as requested by some
commenters) to confirm this position is not required because the federal securities laws provide
the Commission with plenary authority to set accounting standards, and we are doing so here. 428
If events occur that cause shareholders to determine that their money market fund shares
are not cash equivalents, the shares would need to be classified as investments, and shareholders
would have to treat them either as trading securities or available-for-sale securities. 429 For
example, during the financial crisis, certain money market funds experienced unexpected
declines in the fair value of their investments due to deterioration in the creditworthiness of their
assets and, as a result, portfolios of money market funds became less liquid. Investors in these
money market funds would have needed to determine whether their investments continued to
meet the definition of a cash equivalent.

Floating Net Asset Value

Introduction

As discussed earlier in this Release, absent an exemption specifically provided by the
Commission from various provisions of the Investment Company Act, all registered mutual
funds must price and transact in their shares at the current NAV, calculated by valuing portfolio
instruments at market value, in the case of securities for which market quotations are readily
available, or, at fair value, as determined in good faith by the fund’s board of directors, in the

428

The federal securities laws provide the Commission with authority to set accounting and reporting
standards for public companies and other entities that file financial statements with the Commission. See,
e.g., 15 U.S.C. 77g, 77s, 77aa(25) and (26); 15 U.S.C. 78c(b), 78l(b) and 78m(b); section 8, section 30(e),
section 31, and section 38(a) of the Investment Company Act.

136

case of other securities and assets (i.e., use a floating NAV). 430 Under rule 2a-7, the Commission
has exempted money market funds from this floating NAV requirement, allowing them to price
and transact at a stable NAV per share (using the amortized cost and penny rounding methods),
provided that they follow certain risk-limiting conditions. 431 In doing so, the Commission was
statutorily required to find that such an exemption was in the public interest and consistent with
the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the
Investment Company Act. 432 Accordingly, when providing this exemption in 1983, the
Commission considered the benefits of a stable value product as a cash management vehicle for
investors, but also imposed a number of conditions designed to minimize the risk inherent in a
stable value fund that some shareholders may redeem and receive more than their shares are
actually worth, thus diluting the holdings of remaining shareholders. 433 At the time, the
Commission was persuaded that deviations in value that could cause material dilution to
investors generally would not occur, given the risk-limiting conditions of the rule. 434 Experience,
however, has shown that deviations in value do occur, and at times, can be significant.
As discussed above, money market funds’ sponsors on a number of occasions have

432

Section 6(c) of the Investment Company Act provides the Commission with broad authority to exempt
persons, securities or transactions from any provision of the Investment Company Act, or the regulations
thereunder, if and to the extent that such exemption is in the public interest and consistent with the
protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Investment
Company Act. See Commission Policy and Guidelines for Filing of Applications for Exemption, SEC
Release No. IC-14492 (Apr. 30, 1985).

433

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.9. The Commission was similarly concerned with the risk that
redeeming shareholders may receive less than their shares were worth and that purchasing shareholders
may pay too little for their shares, diluting remaining shareholders.

Id.

137

voluntarily chosen to provide financial support for their money market funds for various reasons,
including to keep a fund from re-pricing below its stable value, suggesting that material
deviations in the value in money market funds have not been a rare occurrence. 435 This historical
experience, combined with the events of the financial crisis, has caused us to reconsider the
exemption from the statutory floating NAV requirement for money market funds in light of our
responsibilities under the Act in providing this exemption. In doing so, we again took into
account the benefits of money market funds as a stable value cash management product for
investors, but also considered all of the historical and empirical information discussed in section
I above, the Investment Company Act’s general obligation for funds to price and transact in their
shares at the current NAV, and developments since 1983.
We considered the many reasons shareholders may engage in heavy redemptions from
money market funds—potentially resulting in the dilution of share value that the Investment
Company Act’s provisions are designed to avoid—and have tailored today’s final rules
accordingly. In particular, while many investors may redeem because of concerns about
liquidity, quality, or lack of transparency—and our fees and gates, disclosure, and reporting
reforms are primarily intended to address those incentives—an incremental incentive to redeem
is created by money market funds’ current valuation and pricing methods. As discussed below,
this incremental incentive to redeem exacerbates shareholder dilution in a stable NAV product
because non-redeeming shareholders are forced to absorb losses equal to the difference between
the market-based value of the fund’s shares and the price at which redeeming shareholders

435

See supra section II.B.4

138

transact. For the reasons discussed below, we believe that this incentive exists largely in prime
money market funds because these funds exhibit higher credit risk that make declines in value
more likely (compared to government money market funds). 436 We further believe history shows
that, to date, institutional investors have been significantly more likely than retail investors to act
on this incentive. 437 Thus, given the tradeoffs involved in requiring that any money market fund
transact at a floating NAV, we are limiting this reform (and thus the repeal of the special
exemptive relief allowing these funds to price other than as required under the Investment
Company Act) to institutional prime funds.
As discussed previously, the first investors to redeem from a stable value money market
fund that is experiencing a decline in its NAV benefit from a “first mover advantage” as a result
of rule 2a-7’s current valuation and pricing methods, which allows them to receive the full stable
value of their shares even if the fund’s portfolio value is less. 438 One possible reason that
institutional prime funds may be more susceptible to rapid heavy redemptions than retail funds is
that their investors are often more sophisticated, have more significant money at stake, and may
have a lower risk tolerance due to legal or other restrictions on their investment practices. 439
Institutional investors may also have more resources to carefully monitor their investments in
money market funds. Accordingly, when they become aware of potential problems with a fund,
436

See infra section III.C.1; see also, e.g., Fidelity Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter; Comm. Cap. Mkt.
Reg. Comment Letter.

437

See infra section III.C.2 and DERA Study, supra note 24; see also, e.g., Schwab Comment Letter; Fin.
Svcs. Roundtable Comment Letter; Vanguard Comment Letter.

438

See supra section II.B.3. This first mover advantage does not have the same degree of value in other
mutual funds that do not have a stable value because investors receive the market value of their shares
when redeeming from a floating NAV fund.

439

See, e.g., Systemic Risk Council Comment Letter.

139

institutional investors may quickly redeem their shares among other reasons, to benefit from the
first mover advantage. 440 When many investors try to redeem quickly, whether to benefit from
the first mover advantage or otherwise, money market funds may experience significant stress.
As discussed above, even a few high-dollar redemptions by institutional investors (because of
their greater capital at stake) may have a significant adverse effect on a fund as compared with
retail investors whose investments are typically smaller and would therefore require a greater
number of redemptions to have a similar effect. 441 This can lead to the very dilution of fund
shares that we were concerned about when we first provided the exemptions in rule 2a-7
permitting funds to use different valuation and pricing methods than other mutual funds to
facilitate maintaining a stable value. 442
As discussed in the previous section, our fee and gate reform is designed to address some
of the risks associated with money market funds that we have identified in this Release, but does
not address them all. In particular, fees and gates are intended to enhance money market funds’
ability to manage and mitigate potential contagion from high levels of redemptions and make
redeeming investors pay their share of the costs of the liquidity that they receive. But those
reforms do not address the incremental incentive to redeem from a fund with a shadow price
below $1.00 that is at risk of breaking the buck. As a result of their sophistication, risk tolerance,
and large investments, institutional investors are more likely to redeem at least in part due to this

first mover advantage. 443
This has led to us re-evaluate our decision to provide an exemption allowing amortized
cost valuation and penny rounding pricing for money market funds with these specific kinds of
investors. 444 As discussed above, this exemption was originally premised on our expectation that
funds that followed the requirements of rule 2a-7 would be unlikely to experience material
deviations from their stable value. With respect to prime funds in particular, this expectation has
proven inaccurate with enough regularity to cause concern, especially given the potentially
serious consequences to investors and the markets that can and has resulted at times.
Accordingly, for the reasons discussed above and in other sections of this Release, 445 we no
longer believe that exempting institutional prime money market funds under section 6(c) of the
Act is appropriate—i.e., we find that such an exemption is no longer in the public interest and
consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and
provisions of the Investment Company Act . 446 As discussed in detail in the sections that follow,
we are now rescinding the exemption that allows institutional prime funds to maintain a stable
NAV and are requiring them to price and transact in their shares at market-based value, like all

but see, e.g., HSBC Comment Letter (arguing that first mover advantage that results from the valuation and
pricing methods in rule 2a-7 is overstated in light of the real world issues with information and time to act,
and that other motivations are the primary driver of redemptions); Dreyfus Comment Letter.

444

A number of commenters agreed with our proposed approach of only targeting the funds most susceptible
to runs (institutional prime) with the floating NAV requirement. See, e.g., Fin. Svcs. Roundtable Comment
Letter (“… a floating NAV confined to institutional prime funds represents a reasonable targeting of reform
efforts at the segment of the market that has shown the most proclivity to runs.”); Vanguard Comment
Letter.

other mutual funds. 447
This reform is intended to work in concert with the liquidity fees and gates reforms
discussed above (as well as other reforms discussed in section III.K.3). The floating NAV
requirement, applicable only to institutional prime funds, balances concerns about the risks of
heavy redemptions from these funds in times of stress and the resulting negative impacts on
short-term funding markets and potential dilution of investor shares, with the desire to preserve,
as much as possible, the benefits of money market funds for investors. 448 Consistent with a core
objective of the Investment Company Act, the floating NAV reform may also lessen the risk of
unfairness and potential wealth transfers between holding and redeeming shareholders by
mutualizing any potential losses among all investors, including redeeming shareholders. We do
not intend, and the floating NAV reform does not seek, to deter redemptions that constitute
rational risk management by shareholders or that reflect a general incentive to avoid loss. 449
Instead, as discussed below, the requirement is designed to achieve two independent objectives:
(1) to reduce the first mover advantage inherent in a stable NAV fund due to rule 2a-7’s current
valuation and pricing methods by dis-incentivizing redemption activity that can result from
investors attempting to exploit the possibility of redeeming shares at the stable share price even
if the portfolio has suffered a loss; and (2) to reduce the chance of unfair investor dilution, which
would be inconsistent with a core principle of the Investment Company Act. An additional

regulatory framework that applies to all other mutual funds…”).

449

A number of commenters agreed with this goal. See, e.g., Schwab Comment Letter; Systemic Risk Council
Comment Letter.

142

motivation for this reform is that the floating NAV may make it more transparent to certain of
the impacted investors that they, not the fund sponsors or the federal government, bear the risk of
loss. Many commenters suggested that, among the reform alternatives proposed, the floating
NAV reform is the most meaningful. 450

Summary of the Floating NAV Reform

The liquidity fees and gates amendments apply to all money market funds (with the
exception of government money market funds). Today we are also adopting a targeted reform
designed to address the specific risks associated with institutional prime money market funds. 451
We are doing so by amending rule 2a-7 to rescind certain exemptions that have permitted these
funds to maintain a stable price by use of amortized cost valuation and/or penny-rounding
pricing—as a result, institutional prime money market funds will transact at a floating NAV. 452
Under our reform, institutional prime money market funds will value their portfolio
securities using market-based factors and will sell and redeem shares based on a floating NAV. 453
450

See, e.g., Boston Federal Reserve Comment Letter; Systemic Risk Council Comment Letter; Thrivent
Comment Letter.

451

The floating NAV reform will not apply to government and retail money market funds. See rule 2a7(a)(16) (defining “government money market fund”); rule 2a-7(a)(25) (defining “retail money market
fund”). Government and retail money market funds are discussed infra in sections III.C.1 and III.C.2.

452

Rule 2a-7(c)(1) (Share price calculation). As discussed below, an institutional prime money market fund
may continue to call itself a “money market fund” provided that it follows the other conditions in rule 2a-7.
But it may not use the amortized cost and penny rounding methods to maintain a stable NAV. See rule 2a7(b); infra note 629 and accompanying text (discussing rule 35d-1, the “names rule”).

453

See rule 2a-7(c)(1). We discuss floating NAV money market fund share pricing in section III.B.4. A
money market fund that currently chooses to use amortized cost valuation typically also uses a pennyrounding convention to price fund shares. See 1983 Adopting Release, supra note 3. Although not
generally used, a money market fund may also currently choose to maintain a stable NAV solely by using
penny-rounding pricing. As discussed below, these money market funds would be able to use amortized
cost valuation only to the same extent other mutual funds are able to do so—where the fund’s board of
directors determines, in good faith, that the fair value of debt securities with remaining maturities of 60
days or less is their amortized cost, unless the particular circumstances warrant otherwise. See ASR 219,
supra note 5; we discuss the use of amortized cost below. See infra section III.B.5.

143

Under the final rules, and as we proposed, institutional prime funds will round prices and
transact in fund shares to four decimal places in the case of a fund with a $1.00 target share price
(i.e., $1.0000) or an equivalent or more precise level of accuracy for money market funds with a
different share price (e.g., a money market fund with a $10 target share price could price its
shares at $10.000). Institutional prime money market funds will still be subject to the risklimiting conditions of rule 2a-7. 454 Accordingly, they will continue to be limited to investing in
short-term, high-quality, dollar-denominated instruments, but will not be able to use the
amortized cost or penny rounding methods to maintain a stable value. Finally, funds subject to
the floating NAV reform will be subject to the other reforms discussed in this Release.
As discussed in section III.B.9 below, institutional prime money market funds will have
two years to comply with the floating NAV reform. Although some commenters, including
some sponsors of money market funds, expressed general support for the floating NAV reform
as it was proposed, 455 the majority of commenters generally opposed requiring institutional prime
money market funds to implement a floating NAV. 456 Below, we address the principal
considerations and requirements of the floating NAV reform, discuss comments received, and
how if applicable, the amendments have been revised to address commenter concerns.

Certain Considerations Relating to the Floating NAV Reform
a.

A Reduction in the Incentive to Redeem Shares

When a money market fund’s shadow price is less than the fund’s $1.00 share price,
shareholders have an economic incentive to redeem shares ahead of other investors. In the
Proposing Release, we noted that the size of institutional investors’ holdings and their resources
for monitoring funds provide the motivation and means to act on this incentive, and observed
that institutional investors redeemed shares at a much higher rate than retail investors from prime
money market funds in both September 2008 and June 2011. 457 We also noted, as some market
observers had suggested, that the valuation and pricing techniques currently permitted by rule
2a-7 may underlie this incentive to redeem ahead of other shareholders and to obtain $1.00 per
share when investors become aware (or expect) that the actual value of the fund’s shares is below
(or will fall below) $1.00. 458 As discussed below, to address this incentive, the floating NAV
reform mandates that institutional prime funds transact at share prices that reflect current marketbased factors (not amortized cost or penny rounding, as currently permitted) and therefore
remove investors’ incentives to redeem early to take advantage of transacting at a stable value.
Some commenters agreed that a floating NAV mitigates the first mover incentive to
redeem ahead of other shareholders that results from current rule 2a-7’s valuation and pricing
methods. 459 Two commenters also noted that requiring institutional prime funds to adopt a
floating NAV would force investors who cannot tolerate any share price movement into other

products that better match their risk tolerances. 460 According to these commenters, investors who
remain in floating NAV funds may have a greater tolerance for loss and may be less likely to
redeem quickly in times of market stress. 461
Several commenters generally objected to our reasoning that our floating NAV reform
(by addressing the economic incentive inherent in rule 2a-7) would reduce the incentive for
shareholders to redeem ahead of other investors in times of market stress, observing that a
floating NAV may not eliminate investors’ incentive to redeem to the extent that it results from
the desire to move to investments of higher quality or greater liquidity. 462 Both the DERA Study
and Proposing Release discussed this concern. 463 As the DERA Study noted, the incentive for
investors to redeem ahead of other investors may be heightened by liquidity concerns–when cash
levels are insufficient to meet redemption requests, funds may be forced to sell portfolio
securities into illiquid secondary markets at discounted or even fire-sale prices. 464 The floating
NAV reform may not fully address the incentive to redeem because market-based pricing may
not capture the likely increasing illiquidity of a fund’s portfolio as it sells its more liquid assets
first during a period of market stress to defer liquidity pressures as long as possible. 465
We acknowledge that a floating NAV does not eliminate the incentive to redeem in

pursuit of higher quality or greater liquidity—indeed, we intend to address the risks associated
with these incentives primarily through our fees and gates reform. However, we continue to
believe that a floating NAV should mitigate the incentive to redeem due to the mismatch
between the stable NAV price and the actual value of fund shares because shareholders will
receive a market value for their shares rather than a fixed price when they redeem. Importantly,
the complementary liquidity fees and gates aspect of our money market reforms would also
apply to institutional prime funds that are subject to a floating NAV. As discussed previously,
while not intended to stem investors’ desire to move to more liquid or higher quality
investments, liquidity fees are specifically designed to ensure that redeeming investors pay the
costs of the liquidity they receive, and redemption gates are designed as a tool to allow funds to
manage heavy redemptions in times of stress and thus reduce the chance of harm to the fund and
investors. In this way, we believe that the totality of our money market fund reforms addresses
comprehensively many features of money market funds, including the characteristics of their
investor base that can make them susceptible to heavy redemptions, and gives fund boards new
tools for addressing a loss of liquidity that may develop in funds. 466
One commenter submitted a white paper concluding that (i) liquidity fees and gates, if
implemented effectively, could stop and prevent runs; and (ii) although a variable NAV would
not stop a run, it could mitigate the first mover advantage associated with the motivation to run

466

Some commenters agreed that a floating NAV alone is not enough to address these incentives. See, e.g.,
Americans for Fin. Reform Comment Letter (“[w]hile the floating NAV has clear benefits in making clear
that investor assets are at risk of loss, we are concerned that a floating NAV alone will not create a
sufficient disincentive for investors to engage in ‘runs’ on MMFs.”).

147

that results from small shadow price departures from $1.00. 467 The authors of the paper
concluded further that the ability of a variable NAV to mitigate this first mover advantage is
overstated when viewed in light of the real-world costs of moving between investments that
investors will face and, in a significant stress event, such effect is a minor determinant of
behavior. 468 We acknowledge this view and agree, as discussed above, that a floating NAV
cannot stop redemptions when (as assumed in the paper) investors are redeeming in a flight to
quality due to a continuing deterioration of the credit risk in a fund’s portfolio. However, the
floating NAV reform reduces the benefit from redeeming ahead of others to at most one half of a
hundredth of a cent per share 469–100 times less than it is currently–which investors would weigh
against the cost of switching to an alternative investment. 470 As we discuss above, the floating
NAV reform is designed to supplement the fees and gates reform only for those funds that are
more vulnerable to credit events (compared to government funds) and that have an investor base
more likely to engage in heavy redemptions (compared to retail investors) because of, among
other reasons, the first mover advantage created by the funds’ current valuation and pricing
practices. Specifically, compared to the current stable NAV environment, a variable NAV will
significantly limit the value of the first mover advantage. Although this first mover advantage

See Treasury Strategies III Comment Letter (submitting a white paper: Carfang, et al., Proposed Money
Market Mutual Fund Regulations: A Game Theory Assessment (using “game theory” analysis to evaluate
whether a variable NAV and/or a constant NAV, with or without the ability to impose a liquidity fee or
gate, can prevent or stop a run on money market fund assets).

468

Id.

469

For example, the floating NAV at 4 decimals will adjust from $1.0000 to $0.9999 as soon as the value
reaches $0.99995. Hence, the most an investor can benefit from redeeming ahead of others and switching
to an alternative investment is $1.0000 – $0.99995 = $0.00005.

470

We discuss the costs associated with institutional investors transferring between investment alternatives in
section III.K.3.

148

may not be the main driver of investor decisions to redeem, it strengthens the incentive to
redeem for those investors with the most at stake from a decline in a fund’s value, which
increases the chance of unfair investor dilution in contravention of a core principle of the
Investment Company Act. We continue to believe that a floating NAV will, for institutional
prime funds, reduce the impact of the first mover advantage associated with money market
funds’ current valuation and pricing practices and thus is consistent with our obligation to seek to
prevent investor dilution of fund shares (as discussed in more detail in the section below).
A few commenters also suggested that shareholders in a floating NAV fund would have
the same incentive to redeem if a floating NAV fund deviates far enough from the typical
historical range for market-based pricing, particularly if they believe the fund may continue to
drop in value. 471 We note, however, that the floating NAV reform, one part of our broader
reforms to money market funds, is designed to address a particular structural incentive that exists
as a result of existing valuation and pricing methodologies under rule 2a-7. As we stated in our
proposal and in this Release, the floating NAV reform is not intended to deter redemptions that
constitute rational risk management by shareholders or that reflect a general incentive to avoid
loss.
Several commenters argued that shareholders may choose not to redeem from a stable
NAV money market fund during times of stress to avoid contributing to the likelihood that their
fund breaks the buck. 472 Although this may be the case for some shareholders, as shown during
471

See, e.g., Federated IV Comment Letter (arguing that, unlike a stable NAV fund, shareholders may have a
greater incentive to redeem from a declining floating NAV fund because shareholders would “realize” the
small declines in value); Chamber II Comment Letter.

472

See, e.g., Wells Fargo Comment Letter; Ropes & Gray Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter.

149

the financial crisis, other shareholders do redeem from stable value money market funds,
regardless of the impact on the fund. 473 It is the actions of those shareholders that have led to our
re-evaluation of the appropriateness of exempting all money market funds from the valuation and
pricing provisions that apply to all other mutual funds.
One commenter also argued that rule 2a-7 already places a number of detailed remedial
obligations on the board of a money market fund, in the event a credit event occurs, that are
designed to prevent any first mover advantage related to money market funds’ current valuation
and pricing methods. 474 This commenter discussed, for example, the existing requirement that
fund boards periodically calculate the fund’s shadow price and take action in the event it deviates
from the market-based NAV per share by more than 50 basis points. We note, however, that the
floating NAV reform is designed to proactively address a structural feature of money market
funds that may incentivize heavy redemptions in times of market stress (and the resulting
shareholder inequities) before a significant credit event occurs or the fund re-prices its shares
using market-based values (i.e., breaks the buck). Under current rule 2a-7, there remains a first
mover advantage until the fund breaks the buck and re-prices its shares using market-based
valuations. One commenter also noted that any reduction in the incentive to redeem early from
the fund’s stable pricing would be marginal and contingent upon the type of stress
experienced. 475 We note that the floating NAV reform is targeted towards the funds that have
been most susceptible to heavy redemptions in the past. We believe that the risks associated

473

See supra section II.

474

See Federated IV Comment Letter.

475

See ABA Business Law Section Comment Letter.

150

with these funds have shown that the first mover advantage that results from current rule 2a-7’s
valuation and pricing methods needs to be addressed. This is particularly true in light of the
Investment Company Act mandate to ensure that investors are treated fairly and the impact that
the first mover advantage has on investor dilution.
Finally, a number of commenters suggested that the evidence of heavy redemptions in
European floating NAV money market funds and U.S. ultra-short bond funds during 2008, taken
together, may be the best means available to predict whether a floating NAV will reduce
shareholder incentives to redeem shares in times of stress. 476 These commenters suggest,
therefore, that a floating NAV alone likely would not stop investors from redeeming shares. 477
We recognize that many European floating NAV money market funds and U.S. ultra short bond
funds experienced heavy redemptions during the financial crisis. 478 We note that, as discussed
above, the floating NAV reform is not intended to wholly prevent heightened redemptions or
deter redemptions that constitute rational risk management by shareholders or that reflect a
general incentive to avoid loss. Instead, our floating NAV reform is intended to address the
incremental incentive to redeem created by money market funds’ current valuation and pricing
476

See, e.g., Federated IV Comment Letter; HSBC Comment Letter.

477

See supra note 475 and accompanying text.

478

As we discussed in the Proposing Release, we understand that many European floating NAV money market
funds are priced and managed differently than floating NAV funds (as we proposed, and as adopted today).
We also noted that Europe has several different types of money market funds, all of which can take on
more risk than U.S. money market funds as they are not currently subject to regulatory restrictions on their
credit quality, liquidity, maturity, and diversification as stringent as those imposed under rule 2a-7. Finally,
we noted in the Proposing Release that empirical analysis yields different opinions on whether floating
NAV funds, as compared with stable NAV funds, are less susceptible to run-like behavior. See Proposing
Release, supra note 25, at section III.A.1.d. Accordingly, we note that the fact that some ultra-short bond
funds and European floating NAV funds experienced heavy redemptions during the financial crisis does
not necessarily suggest that investors in floating NAV money market funds (as adopted today) also would
redeem heavily in a financial crisis.

151

methods (and not incentives to redeem that relate to flights to quality and liquidity) and that
exacerbates shareholder dilution.
b.

Risks of Investor Dilution

As discussed earlier, one of the Commission’s most significant concerns when originally
providing the exemption permitting the use of amortized cost valuation and penny rounding
pricing for money market funds was to minimize the risks of investor dilution. 479 A primary
principle underlying the Investment Company Act is that sales and redemptions of redeemable
securities should be effected at prices that are fair and do not result in dilution of shareholder
interests or other harm to shareholders. 480 Absent an exemption, a mutual fund must sell and
redeem its redeemable securities only at a price based on its current net asset value, which equals
the value of the fund’s total assets minus the amount of the fund’s total liabilities. 481 A mutual
fund generally must value its assets at their market value, in the case of securities for which
market quotations are readily available, or at fair value, as determined in good faith by the fund’s
board of directors, in the case of other securities and assets. 482
479

See Proposing Release, supra note 25.

480

See Investment Trusts and Investment Companies: Hearings on S.3580 before a Subcommittee of the
Senate Committee on Banking and Currency, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 136-38 (1940) (hearings that preceded
the enactment of the Company Act). In addition, all funds must accurately calculate their net asset values
to ensure the accuracy of their payment of asset-based fees, such as investment advisory fees, as well as the
accuracy of their reported performance. Statement Regarding “Restricted Securities,” Investment
Company Act Release No. 5847 (Oct. 21, 1969).

481

Rule 22c-1. When calculating its net asset value for purposes of rule 22c-1: (i) an open-end fund adds up
the current values of all of its assets (using their market values or fair values, as appropriate), which reflect
any unrealized gains; and (ii) subtracts all of its liabilities, which include any federal income tax liability on
any unrealized gains. If the open-end fund understates a liability, among other consequences, the price at
which the fund’s redeemable securities are redeemed will be higher, so that redeeming shareholders will
receive too much for their shares while the net asset value of shares held by the remaining shareholders
may be reduced correspondingly when the full amount of the liability must be paid.

482

Rule 2a-4; see also section 2(a)(41) defining the term “value.”

152

A fund that prices and transacts in fund shares valued at amortized cost value and
rounded to the nearest penny poses a risk of dilution of investor shares because investors may
redeem for the stable value of their shares even where the underlying market value of the fund’s
portfolio may be less. If such a redemption occurs, the value of the remaining shareholders’
shares can be diluted, as remaining shareholders effectively end up paying redeeming
shareholders the difference between the stable value and the underlying market value of the
fund’s assets. 483 This result is illustrated in the example provided in the Proposing Release,
where we discussed how redeeming shareholders can concentrate losses in a money market
fund. 484
This risk of dilution is magnified by the “cliff effect” that can occur if a stable value fund
is required to re-price its shares. If, due to heavy redemptions, losses embedded in a fund’s
portfolio cause it to re-price its shares from its stable value, remaining money market fund
investors will receive at most 99 cents for every share remaining, while redeeming investors
received the full $1.00, even if the market value of the fund’s portfolio had not changed. In a
mutual fund that transacts using a floating NAV, this cliff effect is minimized because (assuming
pricing to four decimal places) the “cliff” is a 1/100th the size compared to when a money
market fund is priced using penny rounding. In other words, in a floating NAV fund the risk of
investor dilution is far less, in part, because the cliff occurs earlier and is significantly smaller (at
$0.9999 cents, or one hundred times sooner and smaller than a stable value fund that drops from
483

See TIAA-CREF Comment Letter (“Allowing investors to transact at daily using amortized pricing in
times of stress could lead to dilution of the remaining investors’ shares as the first redeemers in a run on a
money market fund would get a higher valuation for their shares based on amortized cost than would
subsequent redeemers.”).

484

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at section II.B.1.

153

$1.00 to 99 cents). Thus, the “cliff effect” is significantly mitigated in a floating NAV fund that
prices and rounds share prices to four decimal places.
As we discuss in more detail below, applying a floating NAV only to institutional
investors investing in prime funds and allowing retail investors to continue to invest in a stable
value product recognizes the historical differences between these types of investors, and cordons
off some of the risks, reducing the chance that heavy redemptions by institutions will result in
disruption or material dilution of retail investors’ shares. 485 We also recognize that institutional
investors are not always similarly situated, with some institutions having more or less investment
at risk, resources to monitor their investments, tolerance for losses, or proclivity to redeem,
which makes certain institutional investors less likely to be among the first movers. 486 A floating
NAV should also help reduce the risks of material dilution to this subset of institutional
investors, as it will reduce the first mover advantage associated with current rule 2a-7’s valuation
and pricing methods, which can prompt heavy redemptions and can have the effect of diluting
the shares of slower-to-redeem institutional investors. 487
A floating NAV might also prompt investors who are the least tolerant of losses, and thus
the most likely to redeem early to avoid a decline in a fund’s NAV per share, to shift into other
investment products, such as government money market funds or other stable value products that

485

See infra section III.C.2; see also Schwab Comment Letter (agreeing that segregating institutional investors
from retail investors would “reduce the chance that retail investors, who tend to be slower to react to
market events, will absorb a disproportionate share of the losses if a fund breaks the buck.”).

486

See, e.g., ABA Business Law Comment Letter (“It is more likely, however, that larger institutions have
greater analytical resources than other institutional investors, such as small pension plans and companies.”).

487

Several commenters supported our belief that a floating NAV treats shareholders more equitably than under
current rule 2a-7. See, e.g., Deutsche Comment Letter; TIAA-CREF Comment Letter; Systemic Risk
Council Comment Letter.

154

may more appropriately match their risk profile. Such a shift would further reduce the risks of
dilution for the remaining investors, mitigating the chances that rapid heavy redemptions will
result in negative outcomes for these funds and their investors.
We recognize that our liquidity fees and gates reforms also address the risks of dilution to
some extent. However, fees and gates may not address the incentives that cause rapid heavy
redemptions to occur in certain money market funds in the first place (although they should help
manage the results). They also are not primarily designed to address the risks associated with
deviations in a fund’s NAV caused by portfolio losses or other credit events; rather, they are
designed to ensure that investors pay the costs of their liquidity and allow funds time to manage
heavy redemptions. A floating NAV requires redeeming investors to receive only their fair share
of the fund when there are embedded losses in the portfolio (avoiding dilution of remaining
shareholders), even in cases where the fund has sufficient liquidity such that fees or gates would
not be permitted. We believe that the risks associated with institutional prime money market
funds–including the incentives associated with the first mover advantage that results from current
rule 2a-7’s valuation and pricing methods, and associated heavy redemptions that can worsen a
decline in a fund’s stable NAV–are significant enough that they need to be addressed through the
targeted reform of a floating NAV.
c.

Enhanced Allocation of Principal Volatility Risk

Today, the risks associated with the principal volatility of a money market fund’s
portfolio securities can be obscured by the pricing and valuation methods that allow these funds
to maintain a stable NAV. In non-money market funds, investors may look to historical
principal volatility as an indicator of fund risk because changes in the principal may be the

155

dominant source of the total return. 488 Historical principal volatility in money market funds may
not have been as fully appreciated by investors, because they do not experience any principal
volatility unless the fund breaks the buck (even if such volatility has in fact occurred). 489
Some commenters suggested, and we agree, that transacting at prices based on current
market values means that institutional investors who invest in floating NAV funds will be more
aware of, and willing to tolerate, occasional fluctuations in fund share prices (largely resulting
from volatility in principal that had been previously obscured). 490 This may result in more
efficient allocation of risk through a “sorting effect” whereby institutional investors in prime
funds either remain in a floating NAV money market fund and accept the risks of regular
principal volatility491 or move their assets into alternative investment products better suited to
their actual risk tolerance. 492 Accordingly, the shareholders who remain in institutional prime
488

Mutual funds earn money through dividend payments, capital gains distributions (increases in the price of
the fund’s portfolio securities), and increased NAV. See SEC Office of Investor Education and Advocacy,
Mutual Funds, A Guide for Investors (Aug. 2007), available at http://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/sec-guideto-mutual-funds.pdf. Money market fund investors may be more likely to focus on the other components
of total return in a fund, such as interest or dividends.

489

Such principal volatility may be even less apparent if the fund’s sponsor provides support for the fund. See
supra section II.B.4.

490

See, e.g. Vanguard Comment Letter.

491

We acknowledge, however, that although we expect money market fund shares priced to four decimal
places likely will fluctuate on a somewhat regular basis, they are not likely to fluctuate daily primarily due
to the high quality and short duration of the fund’s underlying portfolio securities. A few commenters
argued that a floating NAV will not necessarily inform investors because NAVs may not fluctuate much.
See, e.g., Federated IV Comment Letter; HSBC Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter. Our staff estimates,
based on a historical analysis of money market fund shadow prices, that money market funds would have
floated just over 50% of the time if priced to four decimal places. See infra note 502 and accompanying
text.

492

See, e.g. Vanguard Comment Letter (“The reason the floating NAV would mitigate the risk of disruptive
shareholder redemptions in institutional prime MMFs is that the process of moving from a stable NAV to a
floating NAV will force the shareholders of those funds, which tend to be concentrated with professional
investors who cannot withstand any share price movement, into different investment vehicles. The
shareholders who remain will have a greater tolerance for loss, making them less likely to flee at the first
sign of stress.”).

156

money market funds must be prepared to experience gains and losses in principal on a regular
basis, which may result in those remaining investors being less likely to redeem at the first sign
that a money market fund may experience such principal volatility.
Some commenters recognized that making principal gains and losses more apparent to
investors could recalibrate investors’ perceptions of the risks inherent in money market funds. 493
A number of commenters argued, however, that institutional investors who invest in money
market funds that will be subject to a floating NAV are well aware of the risks of money market
funds and that money market fund shares may fluctuate in value. 494 But contrary to institutional
investors’ purported existing knowledge of those risks, when the reality of potential principal
losses became more apparent during the financial crisis, many of them redeemed heavily from
money market funds. 495 Our floating NAV reform, by requiring that investors experience any
gains or losses in principal when they transact in money market fund shares, will more fully
reveal the risk from changes in the fund’s principal value to shareholders.
Finally, some commenters also suggested that enhanced disclosure (including daily
website reporting of shadow NAVs), rather than a floating NAV, would be a more efficient and

Comment Letter.

494

See, e.g., Federated IV Comment Letter (citing to comments submitted on the FSOC Proposed
Recommendations); Hanson et al. Comment Letter. Commenters also noted that investors already
understand that money market funds can “break the buck.” See, e.g., Comment Letter of OFI Global Asset
Management, Inc. (Sept. 17, 2013) (“Oppenheimer Comment Letter”); Dreyfus Comment Letter; UBS
Comment Letter; Wells Fargo Comment Letter; Comment Letter of Key Bank, NA (Sept. 16, 2013) (“Key
Bank Comment Letter”).

495

Some commenters agreed with this view. See, e.g., American Bankers Ass’n Comment Letter; Angel
Comment Letter.

157

less costly way to achieve the same goal. 496 We agree that daily disclosure of funds’ shadow
NAVs does improve visibility of risk to some degree, by making the information about NAV
fluctuations available to investors should they choose to seek it out. But the mere availability of
this information cannot provide the same effect that is provided by institutions experiencing
actual fluctuations in the value of their investments (or acknowledging, through their investment
in a fully disclosed floating NAV investment product, their willingness to accept daily
fluctuations in share price value), which will be provided by a floating NAV.
4.

Money Market Fund Pricing

Having determined to adopt the floating NAV reform for institutional prime funds, there
is a separate (albeit related) issue of how to price the shares for transactions. Today, for the
reasons discussed previously in this section, we are amending rule 2a-7 to eliminate the
exemption that currently permits institutional prime funds to maintain a stable NAV through
amortized cost valuation and/or penny rounding pricing. 497 We are also adopting, as proposed,
an additional requirement that these money market funds value their portfolio assets and price
fund shares by rounding the fund’s current NAV to four decimal places in the case of a fund with
a $1.0000 share price or an equivalent or more precise level of accuracy for money market funds
with a different share price (e.g., a money market fund with a $10 target share price could price
496

See, e.g., Federated IV Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter; J.P. Morgan Comment Letter; SIFMA
Comment Letter; Chamber II Comment Letter. A few commenters suggested that money market funds be
required to transact in fund shares to the same level of precision as disclosed on fund websites, which is the
approach that we are adopting today. See, e.g., Fidelity Comment Letter (stating that money market funds
should disclose (on fund websites) the NAV to the same precision as it prices its shares for transactions in
order to avoid arbitrage opportunities based on asymmetry of information).

497

As discussed further below, under our final rule amendments, government and retail money market funds
will be permitted to use the amortized cost method and/or penny-rounding method to maintain a stable
price per share as they do today.

158

its shares at $10.000). 498 Accordingly, the final amendments change the rounding convention for
money market funds that are required to adopt a floating NAV—from penny rounding (i.e., to
the nearest one percent) to “basis point” rounding (i.e., to the nearest 1/100th of one percent),
which is a more precise standard than other mutual funds use today.
We proposed to require that institutional prime funds use basis point rounding and we
noted that basis point rounding appeared to be the level of sensitivity that would be required if
gains and losses were to be regularly reflected in the share price of money market funds in all
market environments, including relatively stable market conditions. We also noted that this level
of precision may help more effectively inform investor expectations regarding the floating nature
of their shares. 499 In money market funds today, there is no principal volatility unless the fund
breaks the buck, and thus this indicator of risk may not have always been readily apparent. 500
As discussed in the Proposing Release, we considered, as an alternative to the basis point
rounding requirement that we are adopting today (which is a condition for relying on rule 2a-7
for institutional prime money market funds), requiring institutional prime funds to price and
transact in fund shares at a precision of 1/10th of one percent (which is typically the equivalent of
three decimal places at $10.00 share price) (“10 basis point rounding”), like other mutual funds.
But in the Proposing Release, we noted our concern that 10 basis point rounding may not be
sufficient to ensure that investors can regularly observe the investment risks that are present in
498

See rule 2a-7(c)(1)(ii). Mutual funds that are not relying on the exemptions provided by rule 2a-7 today are
required to price and transact in fund shares rounded to a minimum of 1/10th of 1 percent, or three decimal
places. See ASR 219, supra note 5.

499

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at section III.A.2.

500

Some commenters recognized that making gains and losses more apparent to investors could help
recalibrate investors’ perceptions of the risks inherent in money market funds. See, e.g., Schwab Comment
Letter; Fin Svcs. Roundtable Comment Letter; Boston Federal Reserve Comment Letter.

159

money market funds, particularly if funds manage themselves in such a way that their NAVs
remain constant or nearly constant. 501
In considering whether to require basis point rounding or, instead, to allow 10 basis point
rounding, we have looked to the potential for price fluctuations under the two approaches. Based
on our staff analysis of Form N-MFP data between November 2010 and November 2013, 53% of
money market funds have fluctuated in price over a twelve-month period with a NAV priced
using basis point rounding, compared with less than 5% of money market funds that would have
fluctuated in price using 10 basis point rounding. 502 We recognize that, either way, this limited
fluctuation in prices is the result of the nature of money market fund portfolios, whose short
duration and/or high quality generally results in fluctuations in value primarily when there is a
credit deterioration or other significant market event. 503 Because of the nature of money market
fund portfolios, pricing with the accuracy of basis point rounding should better reflect the nature
of money market funds as an investment product by regularly showing market gains and losses
in an institutional prime money market fund’s portfolio. 504
After considering the results of the staff’s analysis, we are persuaded to require basis
point rounding. We believe that some of the institutional investors in these funds may not

Our staff has updated its analysis from the discussion in the Proposing Release. See Proposing Release,

160

appreciate the risk associated with money market funds. 505 As for this subset of institutional
investors, we believe that the basis point rounding requirement may accentuate the visibility of
the risks in money market funds by causing these shareholders to experience gains and losses
when the funds’ value fluctuates by 1 basis point or more. 506 We further believe this may, in
turn, have two potential effects that are consistent with our overall goal of addressing features in
money market funds that can make them susceptible to heavy redemption. First, to the extent
that some of these investors become more aware of the risks, they may develop an increased risk
tolerance that could help make them less prone to run. 507 Second, by helping make the risk more
apparent through periodic price fluctuations, basis point rounding may help signal to those
investors who cannot tolerate the risk associated with the fluctuating NAV that they should
505

To be sure, this may not generally include the more sophisticated institutional investors who have
professional financial experts advising them and carefully monitoring their investments. See, e.g.,
Federated IV Comment Letter (citing to comments submitted on the FSOC Proposed Recommendations;
Hanson et al. Comment Letters). But within the class of institutional investors, we understand that there
are many less sophisticated investors—e.g., smaller, closely held corporations—who rely on money market
funds to manage their cash flow but who are not fully aware of the risks and the potential for loss.

506

See, e.g., Report of the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, Money Market Fund Reform
Options (Oct. 2010) (“PWG Report”), available at http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/pressreleases/Documents/10.21%20PWG%20Report%20Final.pdf, at 22 (“Investors’ perceptions that MMFs are
virtually riskless may change slowly and unpredictably if NAV fluctuations remain small and rare. MMFs
with floating NAVs, at least temporarily, might even be more prone to runs if investors who continue to see
shares as essentially risk-free react to small or temporary changes in the value of their shares.”); Comment
Letter of Federated Investors, Inc. (May 19, 2011) (available in File No. 4-619) (“Federated May 2011
Comment Letter”) (stating that “managers would employ all manners of techniques to minimize the
fluctuations in their funds’ NAVs” and, therefore, “[i]nvestors would then expect the funds to exhibit very
low volatility, and would redeem their shares if the volatility exceeded their expectations”). As discussed
above, we believe that our floating NAV reform improves the allocation of risk and should result in betterinformed investors that, by choosing to invest in a floating NAV, appreciate and are willing to tolerate the
risks of principal volatility, even if those fluctuations do not occur on a daily basis. See supra section
III.B.3.c.

507

Several commenters agreed with this position. See, e.g., Comment Letter of Eric S. Rosengren, President,
Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, et al. (Sept. 12, 2013) (“Fed Bank President Comment Letter”) (“We
agree with the SEC’s position that a floating NAV requirement, if properly implemented, could recalibrate
investors’ perception of the risks inherent in a fund by ‘making gains and losses a more regularly
observable occurrence’.”); HSBC Comment Letter.

161

migrate to other investment options, such as government funds. 508 Because basis point rounding
is, as the staff’s study demonstrated, more likely to produce price fluctuations than 10 basis point
rounding, we believe it is more likely to have these desired effects. 509
a. Other Considerations
We recognize that 10 basis point rounding would provide certain benefits. For example,
it could provide consistency in pricing among all floating NAV mutual funds and this could
reduce investors’ incentives to reallocate assets into other potentially riskier floating NAV
mutual funds (e.g., ultra-short bond funds) that some commenters suggested may appear to
present less volatility. A number of commenters argued for this alternative, suggesting that
money market funds should not be required to use a more precise rounding convention than what
is required of other mutual funds. 510
Notwithstanding these potential benefits, as discussed above we believe there are
sufficient countervailing considerations that make it appropriate to require basis point rounding
for institutional prime money market funds. Further, we are requiring this additional level of
precision because institutional prime money market funds are distinct from other mutual funds in

508

See, e.g., Fed Bank President Comment Letter (“Because a constant NAV MMMF generally draws riskaverse investors, it is likely that given an appropriate transition period, the investor base would either
change or become more tolerant of NAV fluctuations, lowering the chance of destabilizing runs.”).

509

We are concerned that, were we to adopt 10 basis point rounding, institutional prime money market funds
would not regularly float during normal market times, in which case certain institutional investors may not
fully appreciate that the investment has risks and they might thus invest in the product despite their lower
risk tolerance. See, e.g., PWG Report, supra note 506, at 10 (“Investors have come to view MMF shares as
extremely safe, in part because of the funds’ stable NAVs and sponsors’ record of supporting funds that
might otherwise lose value. MMFs’ history of maintaining stable value has attracted highly risk-averse
investors who are prone to withdraw assets rapidly when losses appear possible.”)

510

See, e.g., BlackRock II Comment Letter; Legg Mason & Western Asset Comment Letter; Fidelity
Comment Letter.

162

their regulatory structure, purpose, and investor risk tolerance, as well as the risks they pose of
investor dilution and to well-functioning markets. Accordingly, we believe on balance that it is
appropriate to require these money market funds to use a more precise pricing and rounding
convention than used by other mutual funds.
Some commenters also argued that enhanced disclosure (including daily website
reporting of shadow NAVs), would be a more efficient and less costly way to achieve the same
goal. 511 We agree that daily disclosure of funds’ shadow NAVs does improve visibility of risk to
some degree, by making the information about NAV fluctuations available to investors should
they choose to seek it out. But we are skeptical that, as to the subset of institutional investors
who are less aware of the risks, the mere availability of this information can provide the same
level of impact than is provided by actually experiencing fluctuations in the investment value (or
acknowledging, through these investors’ investment in a fully disclosed floating NAV
investment product, their willingness to accept daily fluctuations in share price value), which
will be provided by a floating NAV priced using basis rounding. In a similar vein, one
commenter suggested that, as an alternative to a floating NAV, we consider a modified pennyrounding pricing method whereby a money market fund would be permitted to calculate an
unrounded NAV once each day and therefore, absent a significant market event, use the previous
day’s portfolio valuation for any intraday NAV calculations. 512 Under this approach, money

511

See, e.g., Federated IV Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter; J.P. Morgan Comment Letter; SIFMA
Comment Letter; Chamber II Comment Letter.

512

See Comment Letter of Federated Investors, Inc. (Nov. 6, 2013); see also Comment Letter of Arnold &
Porter LLP on behalf of Federated Investors (July 16, 2014). We note that this alternative, if combined
with fees and gates, is very similar to the fees and gates alternative we proposed (which included a
requirement for penny-rounded pricing). We discuss why we have chosen not to adopt that alternative in

163

market funds would disclose their basis-point rounded price, but only transact at the pennyrounded price. 513 Although we recognize that such an approach would likely retain the
efficiencies associated with amortized cost valuation, this alternative is not without other risks,
including the use of potentially stale valuation data. More significantly, unlike our floating NAV
reform, this alternative does not address the first-mover advantage or risks of investor dilution
discussed above. 514
Several commenters argued that basis point rounding is an artificial means to increase the
volatility of floating NAV funds and would mislead investors by exaggerating the risks of
investing in money market funds compared to ultra-short bond funds, and suggested that instead
we should adopt 10 basis point rounding. 515 For example, one commenter noted that basis point
rounding is so sensitive that it might produce price distinctions among funds that result merely
from the valuation model used by a pricing service, rather than from a difference in the intrinsic
value of the securities (“model noise”). 516 We do not believe that basis point rounding will
mislead investors, nor do we believe that price changes at the fourth decimal place will generally
be a result of “model noise” rather than reflecting changes in the market value of the fund’s
portfolio. 517 We note that today many money market funds are voluntarily disclosing their

shadow price with basis point rounding, and they are prohibited from doing so if the shadow
price was misleading to investors. Funds have also been required to report their shadow NAVs
to us on Form N-MFP priced to the fourth decimal place since the inception of the form, and we
have found the shadow NAVs priced at this level useful and relevant in our risk monitoring
efforts. For example, reporting of shadow prices to four decimal places provides a level of
precision (as compared with three decimal place rounding) needed for our staff to fully evaluate
and monitor the impact of credit events on money market fund share prices. 518
Some commenters also stated that ultra-short bond funds priced using 10 basis point
rounding might appear less volatile than money market funds priced using basis point
rounding. 519 As a result, these commenters noted what they viewed as the undesirable effect that
investors might be incentivized to move their assets into ultra-short bond funds that have similar
investment parameters to money market funds but are not required to adhere to the risk-limiting
conditions of rule 2a-7. 520 Based on our staff analysis of Morningstar data between November
2010 and November 2013, 100% of ultra-short bond funds have fluctuated in price over a
twelve-month period with a NAV priced using 10 basis point rounding, compared with 53% of
money market funds that would have fluctuated in price using basis point rounding. 521
518

Basis point precision will also enable our staff to monitor the effect of shifts in interest rates on money
market fund share prices (particularly in more regular market conditions).

519

See, e.g., BlackRock II Comment Letter; Stradley Ronon Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter;
Fidelity Comment Letter.

520

We note that other features of ultra-short bond funds may counter this incentive, including that they are
generally not a cash equivalent for accounting purposes and their less favorable tax treatment than what the
Treasury Department and IRS have proposed and issued today. See infra section III.B.6.

521

Using Morningstar data, our staff analyzed the monthly NAV fluctuations of 54 active ultra-short bond
fund share classes during November 2010 and November 2013. The money market fund data was obtained
using Form N-MFP data. See supra note 502 and accompanying text.

165

Accordingly, we do not believe that it is likely investors will view ultra-short bond funds as less
volatile than money market funds priced using basis point rounding. We also note, however, that
because floating NAV money market funds and ultra-short bond funds invest in different
securities and are subject to different regulatory requirements (including risk-limiting
conditions), investors may consider these factors when evaluating the risk profile of these
different investment products. 522 Existing disclosure requirements, along with the amendments
to money market fund disclosure requirements we are adopting today, are designed to help
investors understand these differences and the associated risks.
b. Implementation of Basis Point Rounding
One commenter noted that basis point rounding “should be relatively straightforward for
the industry to accommodate.” 523 A number of commenters, however, objected to our proposed
amendment to require that floating NAV money market funds price and transact their shares at
the fourth decimal place. Commenters stated that pricing and transacting at four decimal places
(as opposed to reporting only their shadow price at four decimal places) would be operationally
expensive and overly burdensome because money market fund systems are typically designed for
processing all mutual funds, 524 which generally process and record transactions rounded to the
nearest penny (which is typically the equivalent of three decimal places at a $10.00 share

522

As discussed in infra section III.B.6, the Treasury Department and the IRS will issue today a revenue
procedure that exempts from the wash sale rule dispositions of shares in any floating NAV money market
fund. This exemption does not apply to ultra-short bond funds.

523

166

price). 525 We acknowledge that money market funds, intermediaries, and shareholders will likely
incur significant costs in order to modify their systems to accommodate pricing and transacting
in fund shares rounded to four decimals. We discuss these costs in section III.B.8.a below. We
understand, however, that because virtually all mutual funds (including money market funds),
regardless of price, round their NAV to the nearest penny, these system change costs will be
incurred if we require money market funds to float their NAV, regardless of whether we require
the use of basis point rounding (unless funds were to re-price to $10.00 per share). 526
A few commenters also noted that although basis point rounding may convey the risk of a
floating NAV to investors more clearly by reflecting very small fluctuations in value, it does so
at a significant cost—increasing the tax and accounting burdens associated with the realized
gains and losses that would result from more frequent changes in a money market fund’s NAV
per share. 527 As discussed in section III.B.6.a below, however, the Treasury Department and IRS
are today proposing a new regulation that would permit investors to elect to use a “simplified
525

See, e.g., BlackRock II Comment Letter; Invesco Comment Letter; Schwab Comment Letter; Legg Mason
& Western Asset Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter.

526

We understand that virtually all systems round to the nearest penny when processing fund share
transactions. See ICI Comment Letter. Accordingly, if a money market fund continued to be priced at a
dollar, even if rounded to the third decimal place, we understand that similar significant systems changes
would be necessary to transact and report in fund shares priced at $1.000. We note that money market
funds would be able to avoid these costs and move floating NAV money market funds to existing mutual
fund systems by re-pricing fund shares to $100.00 per share, under a basis point rounding requirement. See
id. We recognize that such a transition might create other costs, such as proxy solicitation if the fund’s
charter prohibits such a re-pricing and potential investor resistance to using a cash management product
that prices based on a $100.00 initial share price. See id. (noting that basis point rounding would be
workable (without significant costs) if money market funds moved to a $100.00 price per share, but
suggesting that investors would be unlikely to use a cash management product priced at this level). We
agree with this commenter that it is unlikely that investors would invest in a money market fund that
implements an initial $100.00 share price in a floating NAV money market fund. If a money market fund
chose to do so, we estimate that each fund would incur one-time proxy solicitation costs of $100,000. See
infra note 735 and accompanying text.

aggregate mark-to-market method” to determine annual realized gains or losses and therefore
eliminate the need to track purchase and sale transactions. Therefore, it is unlikely that there will
be increased operational burdens that result from tax or accounting costs associated with more
frequent realized gains or losses. 528
c. Economic Analysis
Under our final amendments, and as we proposed, institutional prime funds will round
prices and transact in fund shares to four decimal places in the case of a fund with a $1.00 target
share price (i.e., $1.0000) or an equivalent or more precise level of accuracy for money market
funds with a different share price. During normal market conditions, rounding prices and
transacting in fund shares at four decimal places will provide investors an opportunity to better
understand the risks of institutional prime funds as an investment option and will provide
investors with improved transparency in pricing. This should positively affect competition.
During times of stress, it will reduce much of the economic incentive for shareholders to redeem
shares ahead of other investors at a stable net asset value when the market value of portfolio
holdings fall and will reduce shareholder dilution. As such, the risk of heavy share redemptions
should decrease, and shareholders will be treated more equitably as they absorb their
proportionate share of gains, losses, and costs. In addition, rounding prices and transacting in
fund shares at four decimal places may help to further reduce the incentive for shareholders to
redeem shares ahead of other investors by helping less informed investors better understand the
inherent risks in money market funds. As such, the risk of heavy share redemptions may
528

As discussed in section III.B.6.a.i, however, investors are likely to incur additional, although small, realized
gains and/or losses as a result of more frequent fluctuations in the share price under a floating NAV priced
to four decimal places.

168

decrease as investors experience greater information efficiency and allocative efficiency by
better understanding the risks more closely and directing their investments accordingly.
Reducing the risk of heavy share redemptions by removing the first-mover advantage should
promote capital formation by making money market funds a more stable source of financing for
issuers of short-term credit instruments. We recognize, however, that as discussed below in
section II.K, to the extent that money flows out of institutional prime floating NAV funds and
into alternative investment vehicles, capital formation may be adversely affected.
5.

Amortized Cost and Penny Rounding for Stable NAV Funds

As discussed above, all money market funds that are not subject to our targeted floating
NAV reform may continue to price fund shares as they do today and use the amortized cost
method to value portfolio securities. 529 This approach differs from our 2013 proposal, in which
we proposed to eliminate the use of the amortized cost method of valuation for all money market
funds. At that time, we stated that amortized cost valuation or penny rounding pricing alone
effectively provides the same 50 basis points of deviation from a fund’s shadow price before the
fund must “break the buck” and re-price its shares. Accordingly, and in light of the fact that,
under our proposal, all money market funds (including stable NAV funds) would be required to
disclose on a daily basis their fund share prices with their portfolios valued using market-based
factors (rather than amortized cost), we proposed to eliminate the use of amortized cost for stable
NAV funds (but to continue to permit penny rounding pricing). 530
529

Stable NAV money market funds may also choose to use the penny rounding method of pricing fund
shares. Under our amendments, government and retail money market funds will be permitted to maintain a
stable NAV. See infra sections III.C.1 and III.C.2.

530

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at section III.A.3.

169

A number of commenters objected to eliminating amortized cost valuation for stable
NAV funds. 531 Most significantly, commenters argued that prohibiting the use of amortized cost
valuation would hinder money market funds’ ability to provide for intraday purchases and
redemptions and same-day settlement because of the increased time required to strike a marketbased price. 532 One commenter noted, for example, that if a money market fund prices at the
close of the New York Stock Exchange, the fund may not be able to complete the penny
rounding process, wire redemption proceeds, and settle fund trades before the close of the
Fedwire. 533 Commenters also argued that substituting penny rounding pricing for amortized cost
valuation would increase costs and operational complexity without providing corresponding
benefits. 534 A few commenters also suggested that, in assessing whether to eliminate amortized
cost valuation for securities that mature in more than 60 days, we should consider the broader
531

See generally BlackRock II Comment Letter; Dreyfus Comment Letter; Federated VI Comment Letter;
Wells Fargo Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter. A number of commenters suggested that
amortized cost is an appropriate valuation method for money market funds because the characteristics of
typical portfolio holdings (i.e., high quality, short duration, and typically held-to-maturity) result in
minimal differences between a money market fund’s NAV calculated using amortized cost and a fund’s
market-based NAV. See, e.g., Legg Mason & Western Asset Comment Letter; UBS Comment Letter;
Chamber II Comment Letter. Commenters also suggested that amortized cost valuation may increase
objectivity and consistency across the fund industry because money market instruments do not often trade
in the secondary markets and therefore the market-based prices may be less reliable. See, e.g., Federated
VI Comment Letter; Goldman Sachs Comment Letter; Legg Mason & Western Asset Comment Letter.

532

See, e.g., Federated VI Comment Letter (suggesting that it would take a minimum of three to four hours to
strike a market-based NAV (assuming there are no technology problems), compared with as little as one
hour for a fund using penny-rounded pricing and amortized cost valuation). See also, e.g., Legg Mason &
Western Asset Comment Letter; SunGard Comment Letter; UBS Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter;
BlackRock II Comment Letter.

See, e.g., Federated VI Comment Letter (noting that June 2012 survey data from Form N-MFP filings
shows that approximately 72% of prime money market fund assets had maturities of less than 60 days). As
a result, this commenter suggests that substituting penny rounding for amortized cost imposes
disproportionately high costs without incremental benefits because a large portion of fund portfolios will
continue to use amortized cost under current Commission guidance. See also, e.g., Legg Mason & Western
Asset Comment Letter; SunGard Comment Letter; UBS Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter.

systemic implications of a potential shift in money market fund portfolio holdings towards
securities that mature within 60 days (in order to avoid the need to use market-based values). 535
We no longer believe that, as we stated in the Proposing Release, there would be little
additional cost to funds if we eliminated amortized cost valuation (and permitted only penny
rounding) for all money market funds (including stable NAV money market funds). Our belief
was, in part, based on the fact that, as proposed (and as we are adopting today), all money market
funds would be required to post on their websites daily shadow prices (determined using marketbased values) rounded to four decimal places. Because, under our proposal money market funds
would be required to obtain daily market-based valuations in order to post daily shadow prices to
fund websites, we believed that funds would have this information readily available (and
therefore not require the use of amortized cost). Notwithstanding this, commenters noted,
however, the ability to use amortized cost valuation provides a significant benefit to money
market funds when compared to penny rounding pricing—the ability to provide intraday
liquidity to shareholders in a cost-effective and efficient manner. We agree with commenters
that eliminating amortized cost valuation would likely hinder the ability of funds to provide
frequent intraday liquidity to shareholders and may impose unnecessary costs and operational
burdens on stable NAV money market funds. This is particularly true in light of the fact that
under existing regulatory restrictions and guidance, a material intraday fluctuation would still
have to be recognized in fair valuing the security. We therefore believe that eliminating
amortized cost valuation in the context of stable NAV funds would be contrary to a primary goal
535

See, e.g., Stradley Ronon Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter. As discussed in this section, we are
not eliminating, as proposed, the use of amortized cost valuation for stable NAV money market funds
under our final amendments.

171

of our rulemaking—to preserve to the extent feasible, while protecting investors and the markets,
the benefits of money market funds for investors and the short-term funding markets by retaining
a stable NAV alternative.
Accordingly, we are not adopting the proposed amendments that would prohibit stable
NAV money market funds from using amortized cost to value portfolio securities. Rather, under
the final amendments, stable NAV funds may continue to price fund shares as they do today,
using the amortized cost method to value portfolio securities and/or the penny rounding method
of pricing. Given the continued importance of amortized cost valuation under our final rules, we
are providing expanded valuation guidance related to the use of amortized cost and other related
valuation matters in section III.D.

Tax and Accounting Implications of Floating NAV Money Market Funds
a.

Tax Implications

In the Proposing Release, we discussed two principal tax consequences of requiring
certain money market funds to implement a floating NAV, potentially causing shareholders to
experience taxable gains or losses. First, under tax rules applicable at the time of the Proposing
Release, floating NAV money market funds (or their shareholders) would be required to track
the timing and price of purchase and sale transactions in order to determine and report capital
gains or losses. Second, floating NAV funds would be subject to the “wash sale” rule, which
postpones the tax benefit of losses when shareholders sell securities at a loss and, within 30 days
before or after the sale, buy substantially identical securities. These tax consequences generally
do not exist today, because purchases and sales of money market fund shares at a stable $1.00
share price do not generate gains or losses. Because we are today adopting the floating NAV

172

requirement for certain money market funds as part of our reforms, we have continued to analyze
the related tax effects. As discussed below, the Treasury Department and IRS will address these
tax concerns to remove almost all tax-related burdens associated with our floating NAV
requirement.
i.

Accounting for Net Gains and Losses

As we discussed in the Proposing Release, we expected taxable investors in floating
NAV money market funds, like taxable investors in other types of mutual funds, to experience
gains and losses. Accordingly, we expected shareholders in floating NAV money market funds
to owe tax on any realized gains, to receive tax benefits from any realized losses, and to be
required to determine those amounts. However, because it is not possible to predict the timing of
shareholders’ future transactions and the amount of NAV fluctuations, we were not able to
estimate with any specificity the amount of any increase or decrease in shareholders’ tax
burdens. Because we expect that investors in floating NAV money market funds will experience
relatively small fluctuations in value, and because many money market funds may qualify as
retail and government money market funds, any changes in tax burdens likely would be minimal.
In the Proposing Release, we also noted that tax rules generally require mutual funds or
intermediaries to report to the IRS and shareholders certain information about sales of shares,
including sale dates and gross proceeds. If the shares sold were acquired after January 1, 2012,
the fund or intermediary would also have to report basis and whether any gain or loss is long or
short term. 536 At the time of the Proposing Release, Treasury regulations excluded sales of stable

536

The new reporting requirements (often referred to as “basis reporting”) were instituted by section 403 of
the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 (Division B of Pub. L. No. 110–343) (26 U.S.C.

173

value money market funds from this transaction reporting obligation. 537 We noted that mutual
funds and intermediaries (and, we anticipated, floating NAV money market funds) are not
required to make reports to certain shareholders, including most institutional investors. The
regulations call these shareholders “exempt recipients.” 538
We have been informed that the Treasury Department and the IRS today will propose
new regulations to make all money market funds exempt from this transaction reporting
requirement, and the exemption is to be formally applicable for calendar years beginning on or
after the date of publication in the Federal Register of a Treasury Decision adopting those
proposed regulations as final regulations. Importantly, the Treasury Department and the IRS
have informed us that the text of the proposed regulations will state that persons subject to
transaction reporting may rely on the proposed exemption for all calendar years prior to the final
regulations’ formal date of applicability. Therefore, the Treasury and IRS relief described above
is available immediately.
We noted in the Proposing Release our understanding that the Treasury Department and
the IRS were considering alternatives for modifying forms and guidance: (1) to include net
transaction reporting by the funds of realized gains and losses for sales of all mutual fund shares;
and (2) to allow summary income tax reporting by shareholders. Many commenters argued that
this potential relief does not go far enough and noted that, because institutions are exempt

6045(g), 6045A, and 6045B); see also 26 CFR 1.6045–1; Internal Revenue Service Form 1099-B. These
new basis reporting requirements and the pre-2012 reporting requirements are collectively referred to as
“transaction reporting.”

174

recipients, these investors would still incur costs to build systems to track and report their own
basis information and calculate gains and losses. 539 We recognized in the Proposing Release the
limitations of this potential tax relief.
We have been informed that the Treasury Department and the IRS today will propose
new regulations that will provide more comprehensive and effective relief than the approaches
described in the Proposing Release. These regulations will, as suggested by one commenter, 540
make a simplified aggregate method of accounting available to investors in floating NAV money
market funds and are proposed to be formally applicable for taxable years ending after the
publication in the Federal Register of a Treasury Decision adopting the proposed regulations as
final regulations. Importantly, the Treasury Department and the IRS have informed us that the
text of the proposed regulations will state that taxpayers may rely on the proposed rules for
taxable years ending on or after the date that the proposed regulations are published in the
Federal Register. That is, because investors may use this method of accounting before final
regulations are published, the Treasury Department and IRS relief is available as needed before
then.
The simplified aggregate method will allow money market fund investors to compute net
capital gain or loss for a year by netting their annual redemptions and purchases with their annual
starting and ending balances. Importantly, for shares in floating NAV money market funds, the
simplified aggregate method will enable investors to determine their annual net taxable gains or

(Tax Compliance Issues Created by Floating NAV) (May 1, 2014) (“Federated XII Comment Letter”)

significant tax issue (as compared with “wash sale” provisions) resulting from the floating NAV reform).

175

losses using information that is currently provided on shareholder account statements and—most
important—will eliminate any requirement to track individually each share purchase, each
redemption, and the basis of each share redeemed. We expect that the simplified aggregate
method will significantly reduce the burdens associated with tax consequences of the floating
NAV requirement because funds will not have to build new tracking and reporting systems and
shareholders will be able to calculate their tax liability using their existing shareholder account
statements, rather than tracking the basis for each share. We have also considered the effect of
this relief on the tax-related burdens associated with accounting for net gains and losses in our
discussion of operational implications below. 541
The Treasury Department and IRS have informed us of their intention to proceed as
expeditiously as possible with the process of considering comments and issuing final regulations
regarding the simplified aggregate method of accounting for floating NAV money market funds.
We note that money market funds and their shareholders may begin using the simplified method
of accounting as needed before the regulations are finalized. Were the Treasury Department and
IRS to withdraw or materially limit the relief in the proposed regulations, the Commission would
expect to consider whether any modifications to the reforms we are adopting today may be
appropriate.
ii.

Wash Sales

As discussed in the Proposing Release, the “wash sale” rule applies when shareholders
sell securities at a loss and, within 30 days before or after the sale, buy substantially identical

541

See infra section III.B.8.

176

securities. 542 Generally, if a shareholder incurs a loss from a wash sale, the loss cannot be
recognized currently and instead must be added to the basis of the new, substantially identical
securities, which postpones the loss recognition until the shareholder recognizes gain or loss on
the new securities. 543 Because many money market fund investors automatically reinvest their
dividends (which are often paid monthly), virtually all redemptions by these investors would be
within 30 days of a dividend reinvestment (i.e., purchase) and subject to the wash sale rule.
Subsequent to our proposal, the Treasury Department issued for comment a proposed
revenue procedure under which redemptions of floating NAV money market fund shares that
generate losses below 0.5% of the taxpayer’s basis in those shares would not be subject to the
wash sale rule (de minimis exception). 544 Many commenters noted, however, that the de minimis
exception to the wash sale rule does not mitigate the tax compliance burdens and operational
costs that would be required to establish systems capable of identifying wash sale transactions,
determining if they meet the de minimis criterion, and adjusting shareholder basis when they do
not. 545
We understand that these concerns will not be applicable to floating NAV money market
funds. First, under the simplified aggregate method of accounting described above, taxpayers
will compute aggregate gain or loss for a period, and gain or loss will not be associated with any
particular disposition of shares. Thus, the wash sale rule will not affect any shareholder that

545

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter; BlackRock II Comment Letter; Schwab Comment Letter.

177

chooses to use the simplified aggregate method. Second, for any shareholder that does not use
the simplified aggregate method, the Treasury Department and the IRS today will release a
revenue procedure that exempts from the wash sale rule dispositions of shares in any floating
NAV money market fund. This wash-sale tax relief will be available beginning on the effective
date of our floating NAV reforms (60 days after publication in the Federal Register). We have
also considered the effect of this relief from the tax-related burdens associated with the wash sale
rule in our discussion of operational implications below. 546
b.

Accounting Implications

In the Proposing Release, we noted that some money market fund shareholders may
question whether they can treat investments in floating NAV money market funds as “cash
equivalents” on their balance sheets. As we stated in the Proposing Release, and as we discuss
below, it is the Commission’s position that, under normal circumstances, an investment in a
money market fund with a floating NAV under our final rules meets the definition of a “cash
equivalent.” 547
Many commenters agreed with our position regarding the treatment of investments in
floating NAV money market funds as cash equivalents. 548 Most of these commenters, however,
suggested that the Commission issue a more formal pronouncement and/or requested that FASB

See supra section III.A.7 for a discussion of accounting implications related to the liquidity fees and gates
aspect of our final rules.

Young Comment Letter.

178

and GASB codify our position. 549 A few commenters suggested that our floating NAV
requirement raises uncertainty about whether floating NAV money market fund shares could
continue to be classified as cash equivalents, 550 and one commenter disagreed and suggested that
it is likely that under present accounting standards investors would have to classify investments
in shares of floating NAV money market funds as trading securities or available-for-sale
securities (rather than as a cash equivalent). 551 We have carefully considered commenters’ views
and, for the reasons discussed below, our position continues to be that an investment in a floating
NAV money market fund under our final rules, under normal circumstances, meets the definition
of a “cash equivalent.” A more formal pronouncement (as requested by some commenters) is
not required because the federal securities laws provide the Commission with plenary authority
to set accounting standards, and we are doing so here. 552 We reiterate our position below. 553
The adoption of a floating NAV alone for certain rule 2a-7 funds will not preclude
shareholders from classifying their investments in money market funds as cash equivalents,
under normal circumstances, because fluctuations in the amount of cash received upon
redemption would likely be small and would be consistent with the concept of a ‘known’ amount
549

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter; BlackRock II Comment Letter; Fidelity Comment Letter. We do not have
authority over the actions that GASB may or may not take with respect to local government investment
pools (“LGIPs”). See infra section III.C.4.

550

See, e.g., J.P. Morgan Comment Letter; Northern Trust Comment Letter; Boeing Comment Letter.

551

See, Federated X Comment Letter (citing to Statement on Financial Accounting Standards No. 115); see
also infra note 429 and accompanying text.

552

The federal securities laws provide the Commission with authority to set accounting and reporting
standards for public companies and other entities that file financial statements with the Commission. See,
e.g., 15 U.S.C. 77g, 77s, 77aa(25) and (26); 15 U.S.C. 78c(b), 78l(b) and 78m(b); section 8, section 29(e),
section 30, and section 37(a) of the Investment Company Act.

553

We are also amending the Codification of Financial Reporting Policies to reflect our interpretation under
U.S. GAAP, as discussed below. See infra section VI.

179

of cash. As already exists today with stable share price money market funds, events may occur
that give rise to credit and liquidity issues for money market funds so that shareholders would
need to reassess if their investments continue to meet the definition of a cash equivalent.
7.

Rule 10b-10 Confirmations

Rule 10b-10 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) addresses
broker-dealers’ obligations to confirm their customers’ securities transactions. 554 Under Rule
10b-10(a), a broker-dealer generally must provide customers with information relating to their
investment decisions at or before the completion of a securities transaction. 555 Rule 10b-10(b),
however, provides an exception for certain transactions in money market funds that attempt to
maintain a stable NAV and where no sales load or redemption fee is charged. The exception
permits broker-dealers to provide transaction information to money market fund shareholders on
a monthly basis (subject to certain conditions) in lieu of immediate confirmations for all
purchases and redemptions of shares of such funds. 556
Because share prices of institutional prime money market funds likely will fluctuate,
absent exemptive relief, broker-dealers will not be able to continue to rely on the current
exception under Rule 10b-10(b) for transactions in floating NAV money market funds. 557
Instead, broker-dealers will be required to provide immediate confirmations for all such

transactions. We note, however, that contemporaneous with this Release, the Commission is
providing notice and requesting comment on a proposed order that, subject to certain conditions,
would grant exemptive relief from the immediate confirmation delivery requirements of Rule
10b-10 for transactions effected in shares of any open-end management investment company
registered under the Investment Company Act that holds itself out as a money market fund
operating in accordance with rule 2a-7(c)(1)(ii). 558
In the Proposing Release, we requested comment on whether, if the Commission adopted
the floating NAV requirement, broker-dealers should be required to provide immediate
confirmations to all institutional prime money market fund investors. Commenters generally
urged the Commission not to impose such a requirement, arguing that there would be significant
costs associated with broker-dealers providing immediate confirmations. 559 Commenters noted
that there would be costs of implementing new systems to generate confirmations and ongoing
costs related to creating and sending trade-by-trade confirmations. 560 We estimate below the
costs to broker-dealers associated with providing securities transaction confirmations for floating
NAV money market funds. 561
We believe that the initial one-time cost to implement, modify, or reprogram existing
systems to generate immediate confirmations (rather than monthly statements) will be

Act of 1934 from the Confirmation Requirements of Exchange Act Rule 10b-10 for Certain Money Market

561

Broker-dealers may not incur all of these costs if the exemptive relief we propose today is adopted.

181

approximately $96,650 on average per affected broker-dealer, based on the costs that the
Commission has estimated in a similar context of developing internal order and trade
management systems so that a registered security-based swap entity could electronically process
transactions and send trade acknowledgments. 562 In addition, we estimate that 320 brokerdealers that are clearing customer transactions or carrying customer funds and securities would
be affected by this requirement because they would likely be the broker-dealers responsible for
providing trade confirmations. 563 As a result, the Commission estimates initial costs of
$30,928,000 for providing immediate confirmations for shareholders in institutional prime
money market funds. 564
To estimate ongoing costs of providing immediate confirmations, one commenter stated
that, based on the data it had gathered, the median estimated ongoing annual cost associated with

562

This estimate is based on the following: [(Sr. Programmer (160 hours) at $285 per hour) + (Sr. Systems
Analyst (160 hours) at $251 per hour) + (Compliance Manager (10 hours) at $294 per hour) + (Director of
Compliance (5 hours) at $426 per hour) + (Compliance Attorney (20 hours) at $291 per hour)] = $96,650
per broker-dealer. See Trade Acknowledgement and Verification of Security-Based Swap Transactions,
Exchange Act Release No. 63727, 76 FR 3859, 3871 n.81 (Jan. 21, 2011). (We note that the original
estimate in the Trade Acknowledgment release contained a technical error in the calculation stating a cost
of $66,650 instead of $96,650 for a security-based swap entity.) A SIFMA survey also indicates that the
costs are likely to be below $500,000 per firm. See SIFMA Comment Letter, at Appendices 1 and 2.
According to this commenter, after surveying its members, it found that the vast majority of respondents
estimated that initial costs associated with providing confirmation statements would fall below $500,000.
However, based on the data provided, it was unclear at what level below $500,000 its members considered
to be the actual cost and whether the firms were a representative sample (e.g., in terms of size and
sophistication) of the type of firms that would be affected.

563

Based on FOCUS Report data as of December 31, 2013, the Commission estimates that there are
approximately 320 broker-dealers that are clearing or carrying broker-dealers that do not claim exemptions
pursuant to paragraph (k) of Exchange Act rule 15c3-3. Because not all of these clearing or carrying
broker-dealers would necessarily provide rule 10b-10 confirmations to customers of institutional prime
money market funds, the Commission anticipates that this is a conservative estimate of the number of
clearing or carrying broker-dealers that would provide trade confirmations to customers in money market
funds subject to the floating NAV requirement.

564

This estimate is based on the following: $96,650 x 320 firms = $30,928,000.

182

confirmation statements would constitute between 10% and 15% of the initial costs. 565 To be
conservative, we have estimated that the ongoing annual costs would constitute 15% of the initial
costs. Applying that figure to the initial costs, the Commission estimates ongoing annual costs
of $4,639,200 for providing immediate confirmations for shareholders in institutional prime
money market funds. 566
The Commission notes that benefits related to the immediate trade confirmation
requirements under Rule 10b-10 with respect to institutional prime money market funds are
difficult to quantify as they relate to the additional value to investors provided by having more
timely confirmations with respect to funds that we expect will experience relatively small
fluctuations in value. While the Commission did not receive any comments regarding these
potential benefits, given that institutional prime money market funds likely will fluctuate in
price, some investors may find value in receiving information relating to their investment
decisions at or before the completion of a securities transaction. 567

Operational Implications of Floating NAV Money Market Funds

Operational Implications to Money Market Funds and Others in
the Distribution Chain

In the Proposing Release, we stated that we expect that money market funds and transfer

See SIFMA Comment Letter, at Appendices 1 and 2.

566

This estimate is based on the following: $30,928,000 x 15% = $4,639,200.

567

The Commission acknowledges that shareholders that invest in institutional prime money market funds will
continue to have extensive investor protections separate and apart from the protections provided under rule
10b-10, including that (1) funds subject to the floating NAV requirement will continue to be subject to the
“risk-limiting” conditions of rule 2a-7, and (2) information on prices will be available through other means
(for example, under the new fund disclosure requirements of Investment Company Act Rule 2a-7(h)(10),
investors will be able to access a fund’s daily market-based NAV per share on a money market fund’s
website). See Notice of Proposed Exemptive Order, at 6-7.

183

agents already have laid the foundation required to use floating NAVs because they are required
under rule 2a-7 to have the capacity to redeem and sell fund shares at prices based on the funds’
current NAV pursuant to rule 22c-1 rather than $1.00, i.e., to transact at the fund’s floating
NAV. 568 Intermediaries, although not subject to rule 2a-7, typically have separate obligations to
investors with regard to the distribution of proceeds received in connection with investments
made or assets held on behalf of investors. 569 We also noted that before the Commission adopted
the 2010 amendments to rule 2a-7, the ICI submitted a comment letter detailing the
modifications that would be required to permit funds to transact at the fund’s floating NAV. 570
Commenters noted, as we recognized in the Proposing Release, however, that some
funds, transfer agents, intermediaries, and others in the distribution chain may not currently have
the capacity to process constantly transactions at floating NAVs, as would be required under our
proposal. 571 Accordingly, consistent with our views reflected in the Proposing Release and as
568

See current rule 2a-7(c)(13). See also 2010 Adopting Release, supra note 17, at nn.362-363.

569

See, e.g., 2010 Adopting Release, supra note 17, at nn.362-363. Examples of intermediaries that offer
money market funds to their customers include broker-dealers, portals, bank trust departments, insurance
companies, and retirement plan administrators. See INVESTMENT COMPANY INSTITUTE, OPERATIONAL
IMPACTS OF PROPOSED REDEMPTION RESTRICTIONS ON MONEY MARKET FUNDS , at 13 (2012), available at
http://www.ici.org/pdf/ppr_12_operational_mmf.pdf (“ICI Operational Impacts Study”).

570

See, e.g., Comment Letter of the Investment Company Institute (Sept. 8, 2009) (available in File No. S711-09) (“ICI 2009 Comment Letter”) (describing the modifications that would be necessary if the
Commission adopted the requirement, currently reflected in rule 2a-7(c)(13), that money market funds (or
their transfer agents) have the capacity to transact at a floating NAV, to: (i) fund transfer agent
recordkeeping systems (e.g., special same-day settlement processes and systems, customized transmissions,
and reporting mechanisms associated with same-day settlement systems and proprietary systems used for
next day settlement); (ii) a number of essential ancillary systems and related processes (e.g., systems
changes for reconciliation and control functions, transactions accepted via the Internet and by phone,
modifying related shareholder disclosures and phone scripts, education and training for transfer agent
employees and changes to the systems used by fund accountants that transmit net asset value data to fund
transfer agents); and (iii) sub-transfer agent/recordkeeping arrangements (explaining that similar
modifications likely would be needed at various intermediaries).

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter; Comment Letter of Chapin Davis, Inc. (Aug. 28, 2013) (“Chapin Davis
Comment Letter”); Federated IV Comment Letter.

184

discussed below, we continue to expect that sub-transfer agents, fund accounting departments,
custodians, intermediaries, and others in the distribution chain would need to develop and
overlay additional controls and procedures on top of existing systems in order to implement a
floating NAV on a continual basis. 572 In each case, the procedures and controls that support the
accounting systems at these entities would have to be modified to permit those systems to
calculate a money market fund’s floating NAV periodically each business day and to
communicate that value to others in the distribution chain on a permanent basis.
Some commenters noted that our floating NAV requirement would adversely affect cash
sweep programs, in which customer cash balances are automatically “swept” into investments in
shares of money market funds (usually through a broker-dealer or other intermediary). For
example, one commenter suggested that sweep programs cannot accommodate a floating NAV
because such programs are predicated on the return of principal. 573 Another commenter
suggested that the substantial cost and complexity associated with intraday pricing makes it
likely that many intermediaries will discontinue offering floating NAV institutional prime money
market funds as sweep options, and instead turn to alternative investment products, including

572

Even though a fund complex’s transfer agent system is the primary recordkeeping system, there are a
number of additional subsystems and ancillary systems that overlay, integrate with, or feed to or from a
fund’s primary transfer agent system, incorporate custom development, and may be proprietary or vendor
dependent (e.g., print vendors to produce trade confirmations). See ICI Operational Impacts Study, supra
note 569, at 20. The systems of sub-transfer agents and other parties may also require modifications related
to the floating NAV requirement. We have included these anticipated modifications in our cost estimates
below.

573

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter. Another commenter noted that the sweep investment product is only
feasible in the current stable-NAV environment because the client knows at the time of submitting the
purchase order how many shares it has purchased, and how many shares it will receive the next day upon
redemption, absent a break-the-buck event. See State Street Comment Letter.

185

stable NAV government funds. 574 Although we do not know to what extent, if at all,
intermediaries will continue to offer sweep accounts for floating NAV money market funds, we
acknowledge that there are significant operational costs involved in order to modify sweep
platforms to accommodate a floating NAV product. Accordingly, we anticipate that sweep
account assets currently invested in institutional prime money market funds will likely shift into
government funds that will maintain a stable NAV under our final rules. We discuss in the
Macroeconomic Effects section below potential costs related to a migration of assets away from
floating NAV funds into alternative investments, including stable NAV money market funds
such as government funds. Because the amount of sweep account assets currently invested in
institutional prime money market funds is not reported to us, nor are we aware of such
information in the public domain, we are not able to provide a reasonable estimate of the amount
of sweep account assets that may shift into alternative investment products.
In the Proposing Release, we also estimated additional costs under our floating NAV
reform that would be imposed on money market funds and other recordkeepers to track portfolio
security gains and losses, provide “basis reporting,” and monitor for potential wash-sale
transactions. As discussed above, we have been informed that, today, the Treasury Department
and the IRS will propose new regulations that will eliminate the need for money market funds

See, e.g., Wells Fargo Comment Letter (acknowledging that, as we stated in the Proposing Release, sweep
products may continue to be viable for floating NAV money market funds because fund sponsors and other
intermediaries will make modifications to price fund shares periodically during the day, but suggesting that
the costs for broker-dealers to reprogram their systems would be significant and the operational complexity
could be made worse to the extent that fund sponsors do not standardize the times of day at which they

revenue procedure that exempts money market funds from the wash-sale rules. Accordingly, our
cost estimates for the floating NAV reform have been revised from our proposal to reflect this
fact. 575
We understand that the costs to modify a particular entity’s existing controls and
procedures will vary depending on the capacity, function and level of automation of the
accounting systems to which the controls and procedures relate and the complexity of those
systems’ operating environments. 576 Procedures and controls that support systems that operate in
highly automated operating environments will likely be less costly to modify while those that
support complex operations with multiple fund types or limited automation or both will likely be
more costly to change. Because each system’s capabilities and functions are different, an entity
will likely have to perform an in-depth analysis of the new rules to calculate the costs of
modifications required for its own system. While we do not have the information necessary to
provide a point estimate 577 of the potential costs of modifying procedures and controls, we expect
that each entity will bear one-time costs to modify existing procedures and controls in the
functional areas that are likely to be impacted by the floating NAV reform.
In the Proposing Release, we estimated that the one-time costs of implementation for an
affected entity would range from $1.2 million (for entities requiring less extensive modifications)
to $2.3 million (for entities requiring more extensive modifications) and that the annual costs to
keep procedures and controls current and to provide continuing training would range from 5% to

estimates.

15% of the one-time costs. 578 In addition, we noted that we expect money market funds (and
their intermediaries) would incur additional costs associated with programs and systems
modifications necessary to provide shareholders with access to information about the floating
NAV per share online, through automated phone systems, and on shareholder statements and to
explain to shareholders that the value of their money market funds shares will fluctuate. 579 We
estimated that the costs for a fund (or its transfer agent) or intermediary that may be required to
perform these activities would range from $230,000 to $490,000 and that the ongoing costs to
maintain automated phone systems and systems for processing shareholder statements would
range from 5% to 15% of the one-time costs. 580 In sum, we estimated that the total range of onetime implementation costs to money market funds and others in the distribution chain would be
approximately $1,430,000 to $2,790,000 per entity, with ongoing costs that range between 5% to
15% of these one-time costs. 581
Commenters did not generally disagree with the type and nature of costs that we
estimated will be imposed by our floating NAV reform. One commenter noted that the costs

578

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, nn.285-86 and accompanying text. We estimated that these costs
would be attributable to the following activities: (i) drafting, integrating, and implementing procedures and
controls; (ii) preparation of training materials; and (iii) training. As noted throughout this Release, we
recognize that adding new capabilities or capacity to a system (including modifications to related
procedures and controls) will entail ongoing annual maintenance costs and understand that those costs
generally are estimated as a percentage of initial costs of building or expanding a system.

579

See id. at n.287 and accompanying text. We expect these costs would include software programming
modifications, as well as personnel costs that would include training and scripts for telephone
representatives to enable them to respond to investor inquiries.

580

See id. at n.288 and accompanying text. We estimate that these costs would be attributable to the following
activities: (i) project assessment and development; (ii) project implementation and testing; and (iii) written
and telephone communication. See also supra note 578.

581

This estimate is calculated as follows: less extensive modifications ($1,200,000 + $230,000 = $1,430,000);
more extensive modifications ($2,300,000 + $490,000 = $2,790,000).

188

required to make the necessary systems changes would not be prohibitive and could be
completed within two to three years. 582 A number of commenters, however, provided a wide
range of estimated operational costs to money market funds, intermediaries, and others in the
distribution chain. These commenters suggested that estimated one-time implementation costs
would be between $350,000 to $3,000,000, depending on the affected entity. 583 One commenter
estimated that it could cost up to $2,300,000 per fund, transfer agent, or intermediary, to modify
systems procedures and controls to implement a floating NAV. 584 Another commenter estimated
that it would cost each back office processing service provider $1,725,000 in one-time costs to
implement a floating NAV. 585 We also received from commenters some cost estimates provided
on a fund complex level. Two fund complexes estimated their total one-time costs to implement
a floating NAV to be between $10,000,000 to $11,000,000, and one of the largest money market
fund sponsors approximated its one-time costs to be $28,000,000. Averaged across the number
of money market funds offered, these one-time implementation costs range from $306,000 to
$718,000. 586 Another commenter provided survey data stating that 40% of respondents (asset

See Chamber II Comment Letter (citing Treasury Strategies, Operational Implications of a Floating NAV
across Money Market Fund Industry Key Stakeholders (Summer 2013) (“TSI Report”)). This commenter
estimated costs for various intermediaries in order to implement a floating NAV: Corporate treasury
management system vendors ($350,000 - $400,000); fund accounting service providers ($400,000 $425,000); broker-dealers and portals ($500,000 - $600,000); transfer agent systems ($2,000,000 $2,500,000); and sweep account software providers ($2,000,000 - $3,000,000). Another commenter
estimated that it would cost approximately $2,000,000 in one-time costs for a large trust group to
implement a floating NAV. See Treasury Strategies Comment Letter.

managers and intermediaries) estimated that it would cost $2,000,000 to $5,000,000 in one-time
costs to implement a floating NAV. 587 Finally, a few commenters estimated the one-time costs to
the entire fund industry related to implementing our floating NAV reform. 588
We estimated in the Proposing Release that it would cost each money market fund,
intermediary, and other participant in the distribution chain approximately $1,430,000 (for less
extensive modifications) to $2,790,000 (for more extensive modifications) in one-time costs to
implement a floating NAV. 589 Based on staff analysis and experience, we are revising the
estimated operational costs for our floating NAV reform downward by 15% to reflect the tax
relief discussed above. 590 In addition, as discussed above (and, in a change from our proposal),
our final rules will permit retail and government money market funds to continue to maintain a
stable NAV as they do today and to use amortized cost valuation and/or penny-rounding pricing.
A number of commenters noted that eliminating the ability of stable NAV funds to use amortized
$28,000,000). Based on Form N-MFP data as of February 28, 2014, the per fund costs are: Federated
$311,000 ($11,200,000 ÷ 36 money market funds); Schwab $588,000 ($10,000,000 ÷ 17 money market
funds); and Fidelity $718,000 ($28,000,000 ÷ 39 money market funds).
587

See SIFMA Comment Letter (stating that another 20% of survey respondents estimated that one-time
implementation costs for a floating NAV would be between $5,000,000 to $15,000,000). Because we do
not have access to the names of the survey respondents or their specific cost estimates, we are unable to
approximate these costs on a per fund basis.

588

See, e.g., TSI Report (estimating $1.8 to $2.0 billion in total upfront costs for U.S. institutional money
market fund investors to modify operations in order to comply with a floating NAV requirement); Angel
Comment Letter (estimating $13.7 to $91.5 billion in initial upfront costs related to implementing a floating
NAV reform). As discussed above, we have analyzed a variety of commenter estimates and provided cost
estimates on a per-fund basis. We are unable, however, to verify the accuracy or make a relevant
comparison between our per-fund cost estimates and the broad range of costs provided by these
commenters that apply to all U.S. institutional money market fund investors and/or the entire fund industry.

589

See supra note 581.

590

See supra section III.B.6.a. We note that many commenters suggested that a primary drawback (and cost)
of our floating NAV reform is the substantial operational costs associated with complying with tax tracking
requirements in a floating NAV fund. See, e.g., Fin. Svcs. Roundtable Comment Letter; Federated IV
Comment Letter; Fidelity Comment Letter. Although we attribute a 15% reduction in estimated
operational costs to tax-related costs, the cost savings could be higher or lower than our estimate.

190

cost valuation, as we proposed, would impose significant operational costs on these funds. 591
Accordingly, based on staff analysis and experience, we are also revising the estimated
operational costs downward by 5% to reflect the ability of stable NAV funds to continue to use
amortized cost valuation as they do today. We therefore estimate that it will cost each money
market fund, intermediary, and other participant in the distribution chain approximately
$1,144,000 (for less extensive modifications) to $2,232,000 (for more extensive modifications)
in one-time costs to implement the floating NAV reform. 592
We believe that this range of estimated costs generally fits within the range of costs
suggested by commenters as described above (after accounting for estimated costs savings
related to tax relief and the increased availability of amortized cost valuation, not contemplated
by commenters in their estimates). We note, however, that many money market funds, transfer
agents, custodians, and intermediaries in the distribution chain may not bear the estimated costs
on an individual basis and therefore will likely experience economies of scale. Accordingly, we
expect that the cost for many individual entities that would have to process transactions at a
floating NAV will likely be less than these estimated costs. 593
591

See supra note 534.

592

This estimate is calculated as follows: $1,430,000 x 80% = $1,144,000 (less extensive modifications);
$2,790,000 x 80% = $2,232,000 (more extensive modifications). A few commenters also noted that our
floating NAV requirement would also result in significant lost management fees. See, e.g., Federated X
Comment Letter (suggesting that a shift of one-third of assets away from institutional prime funds would
result in annual lost management fees of approximately $578 million for money market fund advisers
nationwide). We acknowledge that, to the extent there is a significant outflow of assets from the
institutional prime funds into non-money market funds as a result of the floating NAV requirement, money
market fund managers may experience declines in management fee income. We discuss the possibility of
such shifts in money market fund assets in our discussion of macroeconomic effects below.

593

For example, the costs will likely be allocated among the multiple users of affected systems, such as money
market funds that are members of a fund group, money market funds that use the same transfer agent or
custodian, and intermediaries that use systems purchased from the same third party.

191

In addition to the estimated one-time implementation costs, we estimate that funds,
intermediaries, and others in the distribution chain will incur annual operating costs of
approximately 5% to 15% of initial costs. Accordingly, we estimate that funds and other
intermediaries will incur annual operating costs as a result of the floating NAV reform that range
from $57,200 to $334,800. 594 Most commenters that addressed this issue directly did not
disagree with our estimate of ongoing costs, although we note that a few commenters estimated
the new annual operating costs to the entire fund industry related to implementing our floating
NAV reform. 595 One commenter provided survey data showing that 66% of respondents (asset
managers and intermediaries) estimated that annual costs would approximate 10% to 15% of
initial costs. 596 Another commenter, however, disagreed with our estimate of annual operating
costs of approximately 5% to 15% of initial costs and suggested that the annual costs to fund
sponsors will actually be close to the costs of initial implementation. We disagree. This
commenter noted that most of the ongoing cost would result from the elimination of amortized
cost accounting (generally) and more frequent price calculations using market-based factors. 597
Because stable NAV money market funds may continue to use amortized cost valuation under
594

This estimate is calculated as follows: less extensive modifications = $57,200 ($1,144,000 x 5%); more
extensive modifications = $334,800 ($2,232,000 x 15%).

595

See, e.g., Chamber II Comment Letter (estimating $2.0 to $2.5 billion in new annual operating costs
relating to the FNAV reform). As discussed above, most commenters did not specifically object to our
estimated range of ongoing costs on a per-fund basis. We do not, however, have information available to
us to evaluate the accuracy of cost estimates to the entire fund industry or make a meaningful comparison
of such estimates with our per-fund cost ongoing cost estimates.

596

See SIFMA Comment Letter.

597

See Federated X Comment Letter (noting, however, that it estimates annual operating costs of
approximately $231,000 per fund ($5.7 million for pricing services + $1.5 million for transfer agent
services + $2.5 million for technology, training, and other monitoring costs = $9.7 million ÷ 42 money
market funds managed by Federated = approximately $231,000 per fund). This estimate is consistent with
our estimated range of ongoing costs. See supra note 594.

192

our final rules (unlike our proposal), we believe this commenter has overstated the ongoing costs
under our final rules. 598 Therefore, we believe consistent with the comments received, that it is
more appropriate to continue to estimate the ongoing operational costs as approximately 5% to
15% of the initial implementation costs and are not revising the ongoing cost estimates from our
proposal.
b.

Operational Implications to Money Market Fund Shareholders

In addition to money market funds and other entities in the distribution chain, each
money market fund shareholder will also likely be required to analyze our floating NAV
proposal and its own existing systems, procedures, and controls to estimate the systems
modifications it would be required to undertake. Because of this, and the variation in systems
currently used by institutional money market fund shareholders, we do not have the information
necessary to provide a point estimate of the potential costs of systems modifications. We
describe below the types of activities typically involved in making systems modifications and
estimate a range of hours and costs that we anticipate will be required to perform these activities.
We sought comment in the Proposing Release regarding the potential costs of system
modifications for money market fund shareholders, and the comments we received, along with
the differences between our proposal and the final rules, have informed our estimates.
In the Proposing Release, we prepared ranges of estimated costs, taking into account
variations in the functionality, sophistication, and level of automation of money market fund
598

We recognize, however, that under our final rules, floating NAV money market funds will incur increased
costs as a result of the elimination of amortized cost valuation. These costs, discussed above, are
significantly lower than those that funds would incur under our proposal (that would have eliminated
amortized cost valuation for all money market funds, including those funds not subject to our floating NAV
reform).

193

shareholders’ existing systems and related procedures and controls, and the complexity of the
operating environment in which these systems operate. In deriving our estimates, we considered
the need to modify systems and related procedures and controls related to recordkeeping,
accounting, trading, and cash management, and to provide training concerning these
modifications. We estimated that a shareholder whose systems (including related procedures and
controls) would require less extensive modifications would incur one-time costs ranging from
$123,000 to $253,000, while a shareholder whose systems (including related procedures and
controls) would require more extensive modifications would incur one-time costs ranging from
$1.4 million to $2.9 million. 599
Most commenters did not disagree with our cost estimates. One commenter stated that it
expects at least 50% of institutional investors in money market funds will require some systems
development to be able to invest in a floating NAV money market fund. This commenter also
noted that having sufficient time to implement the changes is a more important factor than cost in
determining the extent to which corporate treasurers, for example, would use a floating NAV
fund product. 600 Another commenter acknowledged our range of estimated costs and suggested
that while these estimates may not appear substantial at first glance, when viewed in the context
of current money market fund returns, such costs represent a significant disincentive to continued
investment in institutional prime funds. 601 Although we acknowledge that the costs to money

599

We estimate that these costs would be attributable to the following activities: (i) planning, coding, testing,
and installing system modifications; (ii) drafting, integrating, implementing procedures and controls;
(iii) preparation of training materials; and (iv) training.

194

market fund shareholders may make investing in floating NAV money market funds
uneconomical given the current rates of return, we note that we are adopting a two-year
compliance period that may, to the extent that interest rates return to more typical levels, counter
any disincentive that may exist currently. 602
The TSI Report 603 provided ranges of costs that it expects would be imposed on floating
NAV money market fund shareholders. These costs ranged from $250,000 for a U.S. business
that invests in floating NAV money market funds and makes the fewest changes possible, to
$550,000 for a government-sponsored entity money market fund shareholder. 604 We have
carefully considered this range of costs to shareholders provided by the commenter and the
changes from the proposal to the rule that we are adopting today, and we now believe that it is
appropriate to decrease our cost estimates from the proposal. Accordingly, we estimate that a
shareholder whose systems (including related procedures and controls) would require less
extensive modifications would incur one-time costs ranging from $212,500 to $340,000, while a
shareholder whose systems (including related procedures and controls) would require more
extensive modifications would incur one-time costs ranging from $467,500 to $850,000. We
believe that these estimates better reflect the changes in our final rules from those that we
proposed. 605 We also recognize that these estimates are more consistent with the range of cost
602

See infra section III.N.2. for a discussion of the floating NAV compliance date.

603

See supra note 583.

604

See id., TSI Report (estimating that the one-time implementation costs would range from $350,000 to
$370,000 for a corporate investor; $275,000 to $300,000 for a public university investor; $325,000 to
$350,000 for a municipality investor; and $400,000 to $425,000 for a fiduciary investor).

605

Consistent with our cost estimates discussed above for funds, intermediaries, and others in the distribution
chain, we have considered in these estimates cost savings related to the tax relief discussed above. See
supra section III.B.8.a.

195

estimates provided by this commenter. We estimate that the annual maintenance costs to these
systems and procedures and controls, and the costs to provide continuing training, will range
from 5% to 15% of the one-time implementation costs. 606
c.

Intraday Liquidity and Same-Day Settlement

As discussed below, we believe that floating NAV money market funds should be able to
continue to provide shareholders with intraday liquidity and same-day settlement by pricing fund
shares periodically during the day (e.g., at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.). In the Proposing Release, we
noted that money market funds’ ability to maintain a stable value also facilitates the funds’ role
as a cash management vehicle and provides other operational efficiencies for their shareholders.
Shareholders generally are able to transact in fund shares at a stable value known in advance,
which permits money market fund transactions to settle on the same day that an investor places a
purchase or sell order and determine the exact value of his or her money market fund shares
(absent a liquidation event) at any time. These features have made money market funds an
important component of systems for processing and settling various types of transactions.
Some commenters have expressed concern that intraday liquidity and/or same-day
settlement would not be available to investors in floating NAV money market funds. These
commenters point to, for example, operational challenges such as striking the NAV multiple
times during the day while needing to value each portfolio security using market-based values. 607
A few commenters also noted that pricing services may not be able to provide periodic pricing
606

See supra note 578. Commenters did not address specifically our estimate of ongoing costs to money
market fund shareholders in floating NAV funds. Accordingly, we are not amending our estimate from the
proposal.

607

See, e.g., BlackRock II Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter; Chamber II Comment Letter.

196

throughout the day. 608 Some commenters also raised concerns about the additional costs
involved with striking the NAV multiple times per day, including, for example, costs for pricing
services to provide multiple quotes per day and for accounting agents to calculate multiple
NAVs. 609 On the other hand, one commenter who provides pricing services noted that, while
providing intraday liquidity and same-day settlement for floating NAV funds would require
some investment, they believe that calculating NAVs multiple times per day is feasible within
our proposed two-year compliance period. 610 A few commenters further noted that transfer
agents will need to enhance their systems to account for floating NAV money market funds and
condense their reconciliation and audit processes (which may, for example, increase the risk of
errors). 611
A few commenters also asserted that if floating NAV funds are unable to provide sameday settlement, this could affect features that are particularly appealing to retail investors, such as
ATM access, check writing, and electronic check payment processing services and products. 612
First, as discussed below, we believe that many floating NAV money market funds will continue
to be able to provide same-day settlement. Second, we note that under the revised retail money

608

See, e.g., Federated IV Comment Letter; Interactive Data Comment Letter; Chamber II Comment Letter.

609

See, e.g., BlackRock II Comment Letter; Dreyfus Comment Letter; State Street Comment Letter.

610

See Interactive Data Comment Letter. Another commenter noted that money market funds would still be
able to provide same-day settlement in floating NAV funds. See State Street Comment Letter.

611

See J.P. Morgan Comment Letter; Dreyfus Comment Letter; Comment Letter of DST Systems, Inc. (Sept.
18, 2013) (“DST Systems Comment Letter”).

612

See, e.g., Fidelity Comment Letter (“[B]roker-dealers offer clients a variety of features that are available
generally only to accounts with a stable NAV, including ATM access, check writing, and ACH and
Fedwire transfers. A floating NAV would force MMFs that offer same-day settlement on shares redeemed
through wire transfers to shift to next day settlement or require fund advisers to modify their systems to
accommodate floating NAV MMFs.”).

197

market fund definition adopted today, retail investors should have ample opportunity to invest in
a fund that qualifies as a retail money market fund and thus is able to maintain a stable NAV. As
a result, this should significantly alleviate concerns about the costs of altering these features and
permit a number of funds to continue to provide these features as they do today. Nonetheless,
we recognize that not all funds with these features may choose to qualify as retail money market
funds, and therefore, some funds may need to make additional modifications to continue offering
these features. We have included estimates of the costs to make such modifications below.
We understand that many money market funds currently permit same-day trading up until
5 p.m. Eastern Time. These funds do so because amortized cost valuation allows funds to
calculate their NAVs before they receive market-based prices (typically provided at the end of
the day after the close of the Federal Reserve Cash Wire). We recognize that, under the floating
NAV reform, closing times for same-day settlement will likely need to be moved earlier in the
day to allow sufficient time to calculate the NAV prior to the close of the Federal Reserve Cash
Wire. One commenter suggested that it will take a minimum of three to four hours to strike a
market-based NAV price. 613 As a result, investors in floating NAV money market funds may not
have the ability to redeem shares late in the day, as they can today. We also recognize that
floating NAV money market funds may price only once a day, at least until such time as pricing
vendors are able to provide continuous pricing throughout the day. 614 We considered these

613

See Federated II Comment Letter.

614

See SIFMA Comment Letter (noting that in its survey of members, 60% of asset managers expect to price
their floating NAV money market funds only once per day, which is less frequent than currently offered by
most money market funds). See also Institutional Cash Distributors, ICD Commentary: Operational and
Accounting Issues with the Floating NAV and the Impact on Money Market Funds (July 2013), available at
http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-03-13/s70313-40.pdf. One commenter noted that they are already

198

potential costs as well as the benefits of our floating NAV reform and believe that, as discussed
above, it is appropriate to address, through the floating NAV reform, the incremental incentive
that exists for shareholders to redeem in times of stress from institutional prime money market
funds. We note, however, that because stable NAV money market funds may continue to use
amortized cost as they do today (as revised from our proposal), these same-day settlement
concerns raised by commenters here would be limited to institutional prime funds—the only
money market funds subject to the floating NAV reform. 615
We sought comment in the Proposing Release on the costs associated with providing
same-day settlement and for pricing services to provide prices multiple times each day. One
commenter provided survey data that estimated the range of costs for floating NAV funds to
offer same-day settlement. Seventy-five percent of respondents estimated the one-time costs to
be approximately $500,000 to $1 million, and 25% of respondents estimated the one times costs
to be approximately $1 million to $2 million.616 Sixty-six percent of respondents approximated
ongoing costs that would range between 10-15% of initial costs. 617 We did not receive other
quantitative estimates specifically on the costs associated with modifying systems to allow for

investing in new technology that includes real-time debt security evaluations. See Comment Letter of
Interactive Data.
615

See SIFMA Comment Letter (noting that, under our proposal, the impediment to same-day settlement
exists for stable NAV money market funds as well as floating NAV money market funds because both
types of funds would be prohibited from using amortized cost for securities with remaining maturities over
60 days). As noted above, we are no longer prohibiting stable NAV funds from using amortized cost.

616

As discussed supra in note 587, we do not have access to the names of the survey respondents or their
specific cost estimates and are therefore unable to approximate these costs on a per fund basis.
Accordingly, the costs on a per fund basis will likely be significantly lower than the figures provided here.

same-day settlement by floating NAV funds. 618 We have carefully considered this survey data
with respect to same-day settlement issues in arriving at our aggregate operational cost estimates
discussed above in section III.B.8.a. 619
9.

Transition

We are providing a two-year compliance date (as proposed) for money market funds to
implement the floating NAV reform. A long compliance period will give more time for funds to
implement any needed changes to their investment policies and train staff, and also will provide
more time for investors to analyze their cash management strategies. This compliance period
will also give time for retail money market funds to reorganize their operations and establish new
funds. Importantly, this compliance period will allow additional time for the Treasury
Department and IRS to consider finalizing rules addressing certain tax issues relating to a
floating NAV described above and for the Commission to consider final rules removing NRSRO
ratings from rule 2a-7, 620 so that funds could make several compliance-related changes at one
time.
We acknowledge, as discussed in the Proposing Release and as noted by some

618

We note that some commenters may have included costs associated with enabling floating NAV funds to
provide same-day settlement in their cost estimates of operational implications generally. These costs are
discussed above.

619

We have based our cost estimates for same-day settlement principally on staff experience and expertise. In
assessing the reasonableness of our estimates, we considered as an outer bound the survey data provided by
SIFMA (although as noted above, the survey respondents likely represent fund complexes and thus we are
not able to determine these costs on a per fund basis). We estimate that money market funds will likely
establish twice per day pricing as the appropriate balance between current money market fund practice to
provide multiple settlements per business day and the additional costs and complexities involved in pricing
money market fund shares using market-based values.

commenters, that a transition to a new regulatory regime could itself cause the type of heavy
redemptions that the amendments, including the floating NAV reform, are designed to prevent. 621
In the proposal, we noted that our proposed two-year compliance period would benefit money
market funds and their shareholders by allowing money market funds to make the transition to a
floating NAV at the optimal time and potentially not at the same time as all other money market
funds. In addition, we stated our belief that money market fund sponsors would use the
relatively long compliance period to select an appropriate conversion date that would minimize
the risk that shareholders may pre-emptively redeem shares at or near the time of conversion if
they believe that the market value of their shares will be less than $1.00. Several commenters
reiterated this concern, with one commenter noting that shareholders in floating NAV money
market funds may be incentivized to redeem in order to avoid losses or realize gains, depending
on the expected NAV at the time of conversion. 622 A few commenters suggested that money
market funds will likely be unwilling or unable to stagger their transitions over our proposed
two-year transition period, but did not provide any survey data or other support for their
beliefs. 623
We continue to believe that an extended compliance period (as adopted, two years)
should help mitigate potential pre-emptive redemptions by providing money market fund
shareholders with sufficient time to consider the reforms and decide, if they determine that a

floating NAV investment product is not appropriate or desirable, to invest a stable NAV retail or
government money market fund or an alternative investment product. We recognize that,
although money market funds may comply with the rule amendments at any time between the
effective date and the compliance date, in practice, money market funds may implement
amendments relating to floating NAV near the end of the transition period, which may further
cause the potential for widespread redemptions prior to the transition. Although a few
commenters suggested as much, 624 we did not receive any survey data and we are not able to
reasonably estimate the extent to which money market funds may or may not stagger their
transition to a floating NAV.
We note, however, that in order to mitigate this risk, money market fund managers could
take steps to ensure that the fund’s market-based NAV is $1.00 or higher at the time of
conversion and communicate to shareholders the steps that the fund plans to take ahead of time
in order to mitigate the risk of heavy pre-emptive redemptions, though funds would be under no
obligation to do so. Even if funds took such steps, investors may pre-emptively withdraw their
assets from money market funds that will transact at a floating NAV to avoid this risk. We note,
however, that while a two-year compliance period does not eliminate such concerns, we expect,
as discussed above, that providing a two-year compliance period will allow money market funds
time to prepare and address investor concerns relating to the transition to a floating NAV, and
therefore possibly mitigate the risk that the transition to a floating NAV, itself, could prompt
significant redemptions. In addition, the liquidity fees and gates reforms will be effective and

therefore available to fund boards as a tool to address any heightened redemptions that may
result from the transition to a floating NAV. 625
C.

Effect on Certain Types of Money Market Funds and Other Entities
1.

Government Money Market Funds

The fees and gates and floating NAV reforms included in today’s Release will not apply
to government money market funds, which are defined as a money market fund that invests at
least 99.5% of its total assets in cash, government securities, 626 and/or repurchase agreements that
are “collateralized fully” (i.e., collateralized by cash or government securities). 627 In addition,
under today’s amendments, government money market funds may invest a de minimis amount
(up to 0.5%) in non-government assets, 628 unlike our proposal and under current rule 2a-7, which
permits government money market funds to invest up to 20% of total assets in non-government
assets. 629
625

We will monitor fund redemption activity during the transition period and consider appropriate action if it
appears necessary. For example, such action could include SEC Staff contacting fund groups to determine
the nature of any stress from redemption activity and the potential need for any exemptive or other relief.

626

A “government security” is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. See rule 2a7(a)(17); section 2(a)(16).

627

See rule 2a-7(a)(5) (defining “collateralized fully” by reference to rule 5b-3(c)(1), which requires that
collateral be comprised of cash or government securities).

628

Non-government assets would include all “eligible securities” permitted under rule 2a-7 other than cash,
government securities (as defined in section 2(a)(16), or repurchase agreements that are “collateralized
fully” (as defined in rule 5b-3).

629

Under current rule 2a-7 (and as proposed), a government money market fund is defined based on the
portfolio holdings test used today for determining the accuracy of a fund’s name (“names rule”). See
Proposing Release, supra note 25, n.169 and accompanying text (rule 35d-1states that a materially
deceptive and misleading name of a fund (for purposes of section 35(d) of the Investment Company Act
(Unlawful representations and names)) includes a name suggesting that the fund focuses its investments in
a particular type of investment or in investments in a particular industry or group of industries, unless,
among other requirements, the fund has adopted a policy to invest, under normal circumstances, at least
80% of the value of its assets in the particular type of investments or industry suggested by the fund’s
name). While in the Proposing Release we discussed the definition of government money market fund in
the context of the proposed floating NAV reform, this definition also was applicable to the proposed fees

203

Additionally, as proposed, a government money market fund will not be required to, but
may, impose a fee or gate if the ability to do so is disclosed in a fund’s prospectus and the fund
complies with the fees and gates requirements in the amended rule. 630
With respect to the floating NAV reform, most commenters supported a reform that does
not apply to government money market funds. 631 Commenters noted that government funds pose
significantly less risk of heavy investor redemptions than prime funds, have low default risk and
are highly liquid even during market stress, and experienced net inflows during the financial
crisis. 632 Also, few commenters explicitly supported or opposed excluding government funds
from the fees and gates reforms. Of these commenters, a few supported a narrowly tailored fees
and gates reform that does not apply to government money market funds, 633 and a few

and gates reform. We understand that government money market funds today invest in other government
money market funds (“fund of funds”) and look through those funds to the underlying securities when
determining compliance with rule 35d-1, or the “names rule.” Accordingly, we expect that money market
funds will continue to evaluate compliance with what investments qualify under our definition of
government money market fund in the same way, and therefore categorize, as appropriate, investments in
other government money market funds as within the 99.5% government-asset basket.
630

See rule 2a-7(c)(2)(iii). Any government money market fund that chooses not to rely on rule 2a-7(c)(2)(iii)
may wish to consider providing notice to shareholders. We believe at least sixty days written notice of the
fund’s ability to impose fees and gates would be appropriate.

631

See, e.g., J.P. Morgan Comment Letter; T. Rowe Price Comment Letter; Vanguard Comment Letter; ICI
Comment Letter; IDC Comment Letter. But see Comment Letter of J. Huston McCulloch (Sept. 13, 2013)
(“McCulloch Comment Letter”) (suggesting that the floating NAV reform also apply to government money
market funds and noting that even short-term treasury bills fluctuate in present value). As discussed below,
we continue to believe that our floating NAV reform should not apply to government funds. Our belief is
based, in part, on the strong commenter support in favor of a more targeted floating NAV reform that
addresses the incremental incentive for institutional investors to redeem from prime funds, and our stated
goal of preserving as much as possible the benefits of money market funds for most investors, while
appropriately balancing concerns about the risks of heavy redemptions in prime funds during times of stress
and the harm this can cause to short-term funding markets.

See, e.g., BlackRock II Comment Letter, (“Government MMFs … should not be required to implement
liquidity fees and gates.”); J.P. Morgan Comment Letter.

204

commenters argued that all types of money market funds – including government money market
funds – should have the ability to apply a fee or gate. 634
We continue to believe that government money market funds should not be subject to the
fees and gates and floating NAV reforms. As discussed in the Proposing Release, government
money market funds face different redemption pressures and have different risk characteristics
than other money market funds because of their unique portfolio composition. 635 The securities
primarily held by government money market funds typically have a lower credit default risk than
commercial paper and other securities held by prime money market funds and are highly liquid
in even the most stressful market conditions. 636 As noted in our proposal, government funds’
primary risk is interest rate risk; that is, the risk that changes in the interest rates result in a
change in the market value of portfolio securities. 637 Even the interest rate risk of government
money market funds, however, is generally mitigated because these funds typically hold assets
that have short maturities and hold those assets to maturity. 638
As discussed in the DERA Study and below, government money market funds
historically have experienced inflows, rather than outflows, in times of stress. 639 In addition, the
assets of government money market funds tend to appreciate in value in times of stress rather
634

See, e.g., U.S. Bancorp Comment Letter, (“If ultimately adopted, gating should be available to all classes of
funds ….”); HSBC Comment Letter, (“[W]e believe all MMFs should be required to have the power to
apply a liquidity fee or gate so that the MMF provider can manage a low probability but high impact
event.”).

than depreciate. 640 Most government money market funds always have at least 30% weekly
liquid assets because of the nature of their portfolio (i.e., the securities they generally hold, by
definition, are weekly liquid assets). Accordingly, with respect to fees and gates, the portfolio
composition of government money market funds means that these funds are less likely to need to
use these tools.
We have also determined not to impose the fees and gates and floating NAV reforms on
government money market funds in an effort to facilitate investor choice by providing a money
market fund investment option that maintains a stable NAV and that does not require investors to
consider the imposition of fees and gates. As noted above, we expect that some money market
fund investors may be unwilling or unable to invest in a money market fund that floats its NAV
and/or can impose a fee or gate. 641 By not subjecting government money market funds to the
fees and gates and floating NAV reforms, fund sponsors will have the ability to offer money
market fund investment products that meet investors’ differing investment and liquidity needs. 642
We also believe that this approach preserves some of the current benefits of money market funds
for investors. Based on our evaluation of these considerations and tradeoffs, and the more
limited risk of heavy redemptions in government money market funds, we believe it is preferable
to tailor today’s reforms and not apply the floating NAV requirement to government funds, but
640

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, n.412.

641

For example, there could be some types of investors, such as sweep accounts, that may be unwilling to
invest in a money market fund that could impose a gate because such an investor generally requires the
ability to immediately redeem at any point in time, regardless of whether the fund or the markets are
distressed.

642

To the extent a number of government funds opt in to the fees and gates requirements, and there exists
investor demand to invest in government funds that are not subject to the fees and gates reforms, we believe
market forces and competitive pressures may lead to the creation of new government funds that do not
implement fees and gates.

206

to permit them to implement the fees and gates reforms if they choose. 643
We also sought comment on the appropriate size of the non-government basket.
Notwithstanding the relative safety and stability of government money market funds, we noted
our concern that a credit event in this 20% basket or a shift in interest rates could trigger a
decline in a fund’s shadow price and therefore create an incentive for shareholders to redeem
shares ahead of other investors (similar to that described for institutional prime funds subject to
the floating NAV reform). We stated in the Proposing Release our preliminary belief that the
benefits of retaining a stable share price money market fund option and the relative safety in a
government money market fund’s 80% basket appropriately counterbalances the risks associated
with the 20% portion of a government money market fund’s portfolio that may be invested in
non-government securities. 644
A number of commenters, however, raised concerns that the proposed definition of
government money market fund would permit these funds to invest up to 20% of their portfolio
in non-government assets, and, contrary to the goals of our money market fund reforms,
potentially increase risk as stable NAV government funds may use this 20% basket to reach for
yield. 645 One commenter noted that, notwithstanding the current 20% non-government security
643

Although government money market funds may opt-in to fees and gates, we expect these funds will rarely
impose fees and gates because their portfolio assets present little credit risk.

644

The Proposing Release also would have required unaffected stable NAV funds, including government
money market funds, to maintain a stable NAV through penny-rounding pricing (and generally eliminate
amortized cost valuation except for securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less). As discussed
in section III.B.5, however, we have revised our approach and will permit stable NAV funds to continue to
value portfolio securities using amortized cost and price fund shares using penny-rounding, as they do
today. We are also providing expanded guidance on the use of amortized cost. See infra section III.D.

645

See, e.g., Goldman Sachs Comment Letter (suggesting that a new class of money market funds could
emerge that would invest 19.9% of its assets in higher yield commercial paper and other privately issued
debt while maintaining a stable NAV, and under Commission rules, holding itself out as a government

207

basket, its government money market funds invest 100% of fund assets in government securities
because doing so meets the expectations of government money market fund investors. 646
We agree with commenters who suggested that permitting government funds to invest
potentially up to 20% of fund assets in riskier non-government securities may promote a type of
hybrid money market fund that presents new risks that are not consistent with the purposes of the
money market reforms adopted today. 647 One commenter suggested that without a 20% basket,
there may be an oversupply of commercial paper that disrupts corporate funding (presumably a
result of a shift of assets out of institutional prime funds required to adopt our floating NAV

money market fund); HSBC Comment Letter; CFA Institute Comment Letter; Systemic Risk Council
Comment Letter; Invesco DERA Comment Letter. One commenter suggested reducing further the
percentage of portfolio assets required to be invested in government securities and potentially including
state and local government securities in the permissible investment basket. See Comment Letter of The
Independent Trustees of the North Carolina Capital Management Trust (“Sept. 17, 2013) (“NC Cap. Mgmt.
Trust Comment Letter”). We believe that the definition of a government money market fund should not
include state and local government securities as suggested by this commenter. We discuss the risks present
in these types of securities and municipal money market funds in general, infra section III.C.3. See also
infra note 773 and accompanying text. In addition, as discussed above, reducing further the percentage of
assets that must be invested in government securities undercuts the goals of this rulemaking. A few
commenters also raised concerns about the economic effects of not applying our floating NAV reform to
government funds, including promoting the ability of the federal government to borrow at the expense of
state and local governments and private issuers. See, e.g., Comment Letter of Arnold & Porter LLP on
behalf of Federated Investors [Alternative 1] (Sept. 13, 2013) (“Federated III Comment Letter”); Mass.
Governor Comment Letter; Systemic Risk Council Comment Letter. We address the macroeconomic
effects of the floating NAV requirement and related exemptions in section III.K. One commenter also
noted that because stable NAV funds (including government money market funds) would no longer be
permitted to value securities using amortized cost, these funds would still incur many of the same
operational burdens as floating NAV funds. See Federated II Comment Letter; Federated III Comment
Letter. As discussed in section III.B.5, however, we have revised our approach from the Proposing Release
and will permit both retail and government money market funds to continue to value portfolio securities
using amortized cost and use the penny-rounding method of pricing.

See, e.g., Comment Letter of BlackRock, Inc. (June 6, 2013) (“Blackrock I Comment Letter”); CFA
Institute Comment Letter (noting that “the 80 percent requirement [. . .] would undermine the implied NAV
stability of a [g]overnment fund[’]s structure. Allowing fund managers to invest as much as 20 percent of
their assets in securities and instruments with greater volatility in value than government securities, while
continuing to operate as stable NAV funds creates potential problems.”).

reform). 648 As a result, this commenter suggested that the Commission wait until after final rules
are adopted to evaluate the use of the 20% basket, including the effects on commercial paper
supply, and then consider phasing the 20% basket out over time, if appropriate. We disagree.
As stated above, the reason for not applying our fees and gates and floating NAV reforms to
government money market funds is, in part, a recognition of the relative stability of this type of
money market fund, through its lack of credit risk. It would limit the effectiveness of our
floating NAV reform, for example, to allow a hybrid government fund to develop and potentially
present credit risk to institutional investors seeking greater yield, while keeping the benefit of a
stable NAV.
As noted above, many commenters suggested completely eliminating the 20% basket. 649
One commenter suggested a smaller de minimis basket, for example 5%. 650 Our approach
includes a 0.5% de minimis basket in which government funds may invest in non-government
securities. In order to evaluate an appropriate de minimis amount of non-government securities,
Commission staff, using Form N-MFP data, analyzed the exposure of government money market
funds to non-government securities between November 2010 and November 2013. 651

potential shift in assets out of institutional prime money market funds and into alternative investment

Securities, dated March 17, 2014 (DERA Government MMF Exposure Memo”) available at
http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-03-13/s70313-322.pdf. This analysis categorized securities into two
types: “government securities” and “other securities.” “Government securities” includes Treasury Debt,
Treasury Repurchase Agreements, Government Agency Debt, and Government Agency Repurchase
Agreements. “Other securities” includes all remaining non-government securities (as referred to above),
such as non-government tri-party repurchase agreements, financial company commercial paper, and
variable rate demand notes without a demand feature or guarantee. Although this analysis sought, where

This analysis showed, among other things, that as of November 2013, approximately
17% of all money market funds were government funds and that average total net assets of
government funds remained fairly constant at near $500 billion since March of 2012. 652 An
analysis of the data also showed that, between November 2010 and November 2013, government
money market funds generally invested between 0.5% and 2.5% of their total amortized cost
dollar holdings in non-government securities and, more recently closer to 0.5% in nongovernment securities from November 2012 to November 2013. 653 For example, the 90th
percentile of reporting government money market funds demonstrates that investments in nongovernment securities declined from 12.7% (representing 11 funds) in November 2010 to nearly
zero in November 2013. 654
A few commenters suggested that this analysis is flawed because it inappropriately
focuses on the historical use of the non-government securities basket to predict future use of the
20% basket, when we cannot accurately predict how investors will react following the adoption
of proposed regulatory changes, such as a floating NAV. 655 One commenter further suggested

possible, to identify “other securities” that may actually qualify as “government securities,” it is possible
that some assets classified as other securities may still qualify as government securities. Accordingly, the
results of this analysis should be viewed as upper bounds on the extent to which government money market
funds invest in “other securities” (i.e. non-government securities).

that must be viewed in the context of stable NAV money market funds and noting that investor interest in

Wells Fargo Fund Management, LLC (Apr. 23, 2014, DERA Study) (“Wells Fargo DERA Comment

that the analysis instead should address the potential systemic risk posed by a hybrid fund. 656 As
other commenters noted, however, we recognize the potential for increased investor interest in
hybrid government money market funds, and as discussed above, we are concerned that
continuing to permit government money market funds to invest potentially up to 20% of fund
assets in non-government securities presents risks that are contrary to goals of this rulemaking.
In fact, the concern raised by these commenters, suggesting that the historical use of the 20%
basket is irrelevant in the context of a future regulatory regime that includes a floating NAV
reform, further supports our concern that retaining the 20% non-government securities basket is
likely to result in increased risk taking by institutional prime fund investors who move to
government money market funds in search of greater yield (but with the continued benefit of a
stable NAV). We also note that our staff’s analysis of the historical use of the 20% basket
establishes the baseline (i.e., the extent to which government money market funds have used the
20% basket) for our economic analysis discussed below.
One commenter stated its belief that allowing government money market funds to invest
up to 20% in non-government securities will not materially increase the risks of these funds to
investors or the financial system and that such a fund would have adequate liquidity to satisfy

Letter”) (suggesting that without the ability for government money market funds to diversify into prime and
municipal securities, a significant inflow into government funds could force already low yields on shortterm government securities to turn negative). Although we recognize the potentially adverse effects of
negative yields (e.g., some funds might close to further investment, affecting capital formation), we believe
that the potential risks associated with a government fund investing up to 20% of its total assets in nongovernment assets outweighs speculative concerns about future interest rates that may or may not remain at
historic lows two years after the rules regarding our floating NAV reform become final.

211

any increased redemption pressure that results from a credit event in the 20% basket. 657 This
commenter cites to our statement in the Proposing Release, where we characterized as “minimal”
the risk of government money market funds that maintain at least 80% of their total assets in
cash, government securities, or repurchase agreements that are collateralized by cash or
government securities. 658 We continue to believe, however, as we also stated in the Proposing
Release, that “a credit event in [the] 20% portion of the portfolio or a shift in interest rates could
trigger a drop in the shadow price, thereby creating incentives for shareholders to redeem shares
ahead of other investors.” 659 Even if we assume that a government fund had sufficient liquidity
from its 80% basket of government securities to cover adequately increased redemptions that
result from a credit event in the 20% basket, we note that the structural incentives that exist in
stable NAV money market funds, and the associated first mover advantage and potential
shareholder dilution concerns, still exist.660 And, indeed, after our floating NAV reform takes
effect, the incentives could be even more pronounced in government funds if those institutional
investors who are the most sensitive to risk move to government funds.
Based on the staff’s analysis, we expect that the 0.5% non-conforming basket is
consistent with current industry practices and strikes an appropriate balance between providing
government money market fund managers with adequate flexibility to manage such funds while
preventing them from taking on potentially high levels of risk associated with non-government
assets. We therefore are revising the definition of a government fund to require that such a fund

212

invest at least 99.5% (up from 80% in the proposal) of its assets in cash, government securities,
and/or repurchase agreements that are collateralized by cash or government securities. A money
market fund may not call itself or include in its name “government money market fund” or
similar names unless the fund complies with this requirement. 661
Because we believe that the de minimis basket we are adopting is consistent with current
industry practice, we do not believe that government funds will experience any material
reduction in yield, based on current interest rates, as a result of our amendments. In addition, we
do not believe that government funds will be required to make any systems modifications as a
result of changing to a 0.5% de minimis basket because funds are already required to monitor
compliance with the existing 20% non-government basket requirement. As discussed below,
however, we do expect that money market funds may need to amend their policies and
procedures to reflect the changes we are adopting today, including the new 0.5% de minimis
basket. 662 We estimate that it will cost each money market fund complex approximately $2,580
in one-time costs to amend their policies and procedures. 663
Because staff analysis shows that our 0.5% non-conforming basket is consistent with
industry practice, we believe that any effect on efficiency, competition, or capital formation
should be minimal. In addition, any government money market funds that do currently use the
20% basket could roll out of any excess exposure to non-government assets by the time that

661

Rule 2a-7(a)(16) defines a government money market fund and requires that such funds invest at least
99.5% of fund assets in cash, government securities, and repurchase agreements that are collateralized
fully.

662

These costs are included as part of the Paperwork Reduction Act analysis. See infra section IV.A.

663

Id.

213

funds are required to comply with the amended rule, given rule 2a-7’s maturity limits on
portfolio securities. Nevertheless, reducing the size of the basket could affect efficiency,
competition, or capital formation in the future because decreasing the size of the basket reduces a
government fund’s flexibility to invest in non-government assets in the future. For example,
decreasing the size of the basket could lead to a loss of efficiency if government funds are unable
to invest in securities that government funds are currently permitted to purchase. Reducing the
basket size could also restrict competition among money market funds because government
funds would not be able to invest more than 0.5% in non-government assets and thus will have a
reduced ability to compete with other money market funds based on yield. Finally, capital
formation in the commercial paper market could be hindered by reducing the 20% basket and
reducing these funds’ ability to invest in commercial paper. We do not expect any such effect to
be substantial, however, given the very small extent to which government funds have recently
used the non-government basket.
We also recognize the potential for a significant inflow of money market fund assets into
government money market funds from institutional prime investors (seeking a stable NAV
alternative) and investors that are unable or unwilling to invest in a product that may restrict
liquidity (through our liquidity fees and gates reform). As we discuss in section III.K below, we
do not anticipate that the impact from the final rule amendments, including those related to our
floating NAV reform, will be large enough to constrain government funds and their potential
investors.
2.

Retail Money Market Funds

As was proposed, our fees and gates reform will apply to retail money market funds, but

214

our floating NAV reform will not. However, as discussed more below, we are revising the
definition of a retail money market fund from our proposal to address concerns raised by
commenters. As amended, a retail money market fund means a money market fund that has
policies and procedures reasonably designed to limit all beneficial owners of the fund to natural
persons. 664
As discussed in the Proposing Release and the DERA Study, retail investors historically
have behaved differently from institutional investors in a crisis, being less likely to make large
redemptions quickly in response to the first sign of market stress. During the financial crisis,
institutional prime money market funds had substantially larger redemptions than prime money
market funds that self-identify as retail. 665 As noted in the Proposing Release, for example,
approximately 4-5% of retail prime money market funds had outflows of greater than 5% on
each of September 17, 18, and 19, 2008, compared to 22-30% of institutional prime money
market funds. 666 Similarly, in late June 2011, institutional prime money market funds
experienced heightened redemptions in response to concerns about their potential exposure to the
Eurozone debt crisis, whereas retail prime money market funds generally did not experience a
similar increase. 667 Studies of money market fund redemption patterns in times of market stress

See infra note 679 and accompanying text.

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.185 and accompanying text.

666

See id.

667

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.187 and accompanying text. We noted that, based on
iMoneyNet data, retail money market funds experienced net redemptions of less than 1% between June 14,
2011 and July 5, 2011, and only 27 retail money market funds had redemptions in excess of 5% during that
period (and of these funds only 7 had redemptions in excess of 10% during this period), far fewer
redemptions than those incurred by institutional funds. We have also reviewed the redemption activity for
institutional prime funds during this same time period and note that institutional prime funds experienced
net redemptions of approximately 9% between June 14, 2011 and July 5, 2011, and 46 institutional prime

215

also have observed this difference. 668 As we noted in the Proposing Release and discussed
above, we believe that institutional shareholders tend to respond more quickly than retail
shareholders to potential market stresses because generally they have greater capital at risk and
may be better informed about the fund through more sophisticated tools to monitor and analyze
the portfolio holdings of the funds in which they invest. 669 We discuss below our fees and gates
and floating NAV reforms and their application to retail money market funds, as defined by our
amendments adopted today.
a.

Fees and Gates

Largely for the reasons discussed above, several commenters argued that our fees and
gates reforms should not apply to retail money market funds, in the same way that our floating
NAV reform would not apply to retail funds. 670 More specifically, commenters argued that retail
investors behave differently than institutional investors and, therefore, retail money market funds
are insulated from runs and sudden losses of liquidity. 671

money market funds had redemptions in excess of 5% during that period (and of these funds 35 had
redemptions in excess of 10% during this period), far greater redemptions than those incurred by retail
funds.
668

See, e.g., DERA Study, supra note 24, at 8; Cross Section, supra note 35, at 9 (noting that institutional
prime money market funds experienced net redemptions of $410 billion (or 30% of assets under
management) in the four weeks beginning September 10, 2008, based on iMoneyNet data, while retail
prime money market funds experienced net redemptions of $40 billion (or 5% of assets under management)
during this same time period); Marcin Kacperczyk & Philipp Schnabl, How Safe are Money Market
Funds?, 128 Q. J. ECON. 1017 (April 5, 2013) (“Kacperczyk & Schnabl”); Wermers Study, supra note 35.

669

We also understand that retail money market funds’ shareholder base tends to be less concentrated and,
thus, less likely to move large amounts of money at once. We believe this may be, in part, why retail
money market funds experienced fewer redemptions during the financial crisis.

670

See, e.g., Fin. Svcs. Roundtable Comment Letter; Comment Letter of United Services Automobile
Association (Sept. 17, 2013) (“USAA Comment Letter”); MFDF Comment Letter; see also Fidelity
Comment Letter (arguing that the fees and gates requirements should be limited to institutional prime
funds).

671

See, e.g., USAA Comment Letter; MFDF Comment Letter (“Because retail investors are demonstrably

216

Although, as discussed above, the evidence suggests that retail investors historically have
exhibited much lower levels of redemptions or a slower pace of redemptions in times of stress, 672
we cannot predict future investor behavior with certainty and, thus, we cannot rule out the
potential for heavy redemptions in retail funds in the future. Empirical analyses of retail money
market fund redemptions during the financial crisis show that at least some retail investors
eventually began redeeming shares. 673 Similarly, we note that when the Reserve Primary Fund,
which was a mixed retail and institutional money market fund, “broke the buck” as a result of the
Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, almost all of its investors ran—retail and institutional alike.
Additionally, we note that it is possible that the introduction of the Treasury Temporary
Guarantee Program on September 19, 2008 (a few days after institutional prime money market
funds experienced heavy redemptions) lessened the incentive for shareholders to redeem from
retail money market funds. Moreover, as we recognized in the Proposing Release, retail prime
money market funds, unlike government money market funds, generally are subject to the same
credit and liquidity risks as institutional prime money market funds. 674 As such, absent fees and
gates, there would be nothing to help manage or prevent a run on retail prime money market
funds in the future.

slower to redeem their shares, the fund’s adviser will have greater ability to manage the fund’s liquidity in a
way necessary to meet redemptions, even in times of market stress, without necessitating the cost of that
liquidity being imposed on redeeming retail shareholders.”); Comment Letter of Financial Services Institute
(Sept. 17, 2013) (“Fin. Svcs. Inst. Comment Letter”) (“Retail investors pose a substantially lower risk of

217

As noted in the Proposing Release, we also believe there is a difference in the anticipated
shareholder behaviors we are trying to address by the fees and gates requirements and floating
NAV requirement as applied to retail funds. 675 The floating NAV requirement is specifically
designed to address shareholders’ incentive to redeem to take advantage of pricing discrepancies
between a money market fund’s market-based NAV per share and its stable share price. As
discussed above, we believe this incentive likely is greatest among institutional investors because
they are more likely to have significant sized investments at stake and the sophistication and
resources to monitor actively such discrepancies. 676 While retail investors are unlikely to be
motivated to a substantial degree by the first-mover advantage created by money market funds’
stable pricing convention, they may be motivated to redeem heavily in flights to quality,
liquidity, and transparency (even if they may do so somewhat slower than institutional
investors). Fees and gates are designed to address these types of redemptions. 677 We also note
that retail money market funds today operate with the potential for gates under rule 22e-3, which
allows a fund board to permanently gate and liquidate a money market fund under certain
circumstances. Today’s amendments include a number of disclosure reforms that are designed to
ensure that retail investors will understand this new additional fee and gate regime for money
market funds. 678
In addition, the floating NAV requirement will affect a shareholder’s experience with an

institutional prime money market fund on a daily basis. It thus is a significant reform that is
targeted only at those investors that we consider most likely to be motivated to redeem at least in
part on the basis of pricing discrepancies in the fund. In contrast, and as discussed above, the
fees and gates requirements will not affect a money market fund on a day-to-day basis; its effect
will be felt only if the fund’s weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets–i.e., unless it
comes under potential stress–and even then, only if the board determines that a fee and/or gate is
in the best interests of the fund. Further, while we recognize that a retail money market fund
may be less likely to experience strained liquidity (and thus less likely to need to impose a fee or
gate), we believe there is still a sufficient risk of this occurring that we should allow such funds
to impose a fee or gate to manage any related heavy redemptions when the weekly liquid assets
fall below 30% and doing so is in the fund’s best interests. For the same reasons, we believe
requiring a fund to impose a liquidity fee when weekly liquid assets fall below 10% is also
appropriate, unless the board determines otherwise based on the fund’s best interests.
Accordingly, retail money market funds will be subject to the fees and gates reform.
b.

Floating NAV
i.

Definition of Retail Money Market Fund

As we proposed, however, we are not imposing the floating NAV reform on retail money
market funds. For purposes of the floating NAV reform, we are defining a retail money market
fund to mean a money market fund that has policies and procedures reasonably designed to limit
all beneficial owners of the fund to natural persons (“retail funds”). 679

679

See rule 2a-7(a)(25). “Beneficial ownership” typically means having voting and/or investment power. See,
e.g., Securities Exchange Act rules 13d-3 and 16a-1(a)(2); Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, SEC

219

Many commenters generally supported not applying a floating NAV requirement to retail
money market funds, noting, for example, retail investors’ moderate redemption activity during
the financial crisis as compared with institutional prime funds and the importance of retaining a
stable NAV investment product for retail investors that facilitates cash management, particularly
where there are few alternatives offering diversification, stability, liquidity, and a market-based
rate of return for these investors. 680 Some commenters, however, objected to, or expressed
concerns about not applying a floating NAV to retail funds. These commenters noted, for
example, that (i) retail investors in the future may not behave the way we observed in 2008; (ii)
increases in sophistication of retail investors (for example, through technological advancements)
may lead retail investors to act more like institutional investors over time; and (iii) any
differentiation between retail and institutional funds provides opportunities for gaming behavior
by institutional investors. 681
We recognize, as discussed above, that we cannot be certain how retail investors would
have reacted during the financial crisis had the Treasury Temporary Guarantee Program not been
implemented. Similarly, we cannot predict whether retail investors, in light of new tools to

Staff No-Action Letter (Nov. 23, 1999) (“Met Life No-Action Letter”) at n.9 and accompanying text. We
note that our definition of retail money market fund is consistent with the way in which Congress defined a
“retail customer” in section 913(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act (defining “retail customer,” among other things,
as a natural person). 15 U.S.C. 80b-11(g)(2). A retail fund may disclose in its prospectus that it limits
investments to accounts beneficially owned by natural persons and describe in its policies and procedures
how the fund complies with the retail fund limitation when a shareholder of record is an omnibus account
holder that does not provide transparency down to the beneficial ownership level. We discuss omnibus
account issues below. See infra section III.C.2.b.iii.

manage liquidity (e.g., fees and gates) and enhanced disclosure and transparency, will behave
more like institutional investors in the future. But the evidence to date suggests that retail
investors do not present the same risks associated with high levels of redemptions posed by
institutional investors.682 We continue to believe that the significant benefits of providing an
alternative stable NAV fund option justify the risks associated with the potential for a shift in
retail investors’ behavior in the future, particularly given that retail money market funds will be
able to use fees and gates as tools to stem heavy redemptions should they occur. We also note
that, as discussed below, our revised approach to defining a retail fund based on shareholder
characteristics should minimize the potential for gaming behavior by institutional investors.
As of February 28, 2014, funds that self-report as retail money market funds held nearly
$998 billion in assets, which is approximately one-third of all assets held in money market
funds. 683 Unlike under our proposal, which would have required retail funds generally to value
portfolio securities using market-based factors rather than amortized cost, money market funds
that qualify as retail funds may continue to offer a stable value as they do today—and facilitate
their stable price by use of amortized cost valuation and/or penny-rounding pricing of their
portfolios. As discussed below, our definition of a retail fund reflects several modifications from
our proposal (in which a retail fund was defined as a fund that limits redemptions to $1 million in

Staff estimates were derived by using self-reported data from iMoneyNet as of February 28, 2014 to
estimate percentages for retail and institutional segments by money market fund type. Staff then applied
these percentages to the total market size segments based on Form N-MFP data as of February 28, 2014.
Of these assets, approximately $593 billion are held by prime money market funds and another $209 billion
are in government funds. Because the final rules do not subject government funds to the floating NAV
requirement, funds that qualify as retail money market funds would be potentially relevant only to the
investors holding the $593 billion in retail prime funds.

a single business day) and reflects an approach suggested by a number of commenters. 684
We proposed to define a fund as retail, and thus not subject to the floating NAV reform,
if it is a fund that restricts a shareholder of record from redeeming more than $1 million in any
one business day. We explained our belief that this approach should be relatively simple to
implement because it would only require a fund to establish a one-time, across-the-board
redemption policy, unlike other approaches based on shareholder characteristics that would
require ongoing monitoring by the fund. We also stated our belief that our proposed approach
would reduce the risk that a retail fund would experience heavier redemption requests than it
could effectively manage in a crisis because it would limit the total amount of redemptions a
fund can experience in a single day and therefore provide the fund time to better predict and
manage its liquidity.
In the Proposing Release, we selected a $1 million redemption limit because we expected
this amount would be high enough to make money market funds a viable cash management tool
for retail investors, but low enough that institutional investors would likely self-select out of
these funds because it would not satisfy their operational needs. 685 Under the proposed retail
fund definition, a fund would be able to permit an “omnibus account holder” to redeem more

684

The definition of retail money market fund we are adopting is informed by a joint comment letter submitted
by eight fund complexes that manage approximately $1.2 trillion of U.S. money market funds (representing
approximately 45% of the total U.S. money market fund industry assets) as of September 30, 2013. See
Comment Letter dated October 31, 2013 (submitted by BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco, Legg Mason &
Western Asset, Northern Trust, T. Rowe, Vanguard, and Wells Fargo) (“Retail Fund Joint Comment
Letter”).

685

The Proposing Release also noted that a money market fund that sought to qualify as a retail fund would
need to effectively describe that it is intended for retail investors and include in the fund’s prospectus and
advertising materials information about the fund’s daily redemption limitations. See Proposing Release,
supra note 25, at section III.A.4.b.i.

222

than $1 million in a single business day provided the fund has policies and procedures
reasonably designed to allow the conclusion that the omnibus account holder does not permit any
beneficial owner to directly or indirectly redeem more than $1 million in a single day. 686 The
Proposing Release also considered and sought comment on other ways to distinguish a retail
fund from an institutional fund, including applying limitations based on maximum account
balance, shareholder concentration, or shareholder characteristics (e.g., a social security number
that would identify the shareholder as an individual person and not an institution). 687 We discuss
below comments received on these alternative means for distinguishing retail funds from
institutional funds.
A number of commenters supported (some with suggested scope modifications) our
proposed approach to define a retail investor by means of a daily redemption limit.688 Many
commenters, however, raised concerns with defining a retail fund as a fund that imposes a daily
redemption limit on its investors, stating, for example, that the $1 million daily redemption limit
would (i) unduly limit liquidity by prohibiting transactions by shareholders whose behavior does
not present run risk; (ii) restrict full liquidity not only in times of market stress, but also when the
markets are operating effectively; and (iii) be costly and difficult to implement, monitor, and

686

We proposed to define an “omnibus account holder” as “a broker, dealer, bank, or other person that holds
securities issued by the fund in nominee name.” See proposed (FNAV) rule 2a-7(c)(3)(ii).

687

See infra note 701 and accompany text for a discussion of social security numbers as a means for
distinguishing retail from institutional funds in the Proposing Release.

688

See, e.g., CFA Institute Comment Letter; Northern Trust Comment Letter; Schwab Comment Letter;
USAA Comment Letter; Vanguard Comment Letter. These commenters also offered suggested scope
modifications, including increasing or decreasing the daily redemption limit, creating an advance notice
provision (pre-approved redemptions over $1 million in a single business day), applying the daily
redemption limit on a per-account basis rather than a per-shareholder basis, and exempting certain
transactions from the daily redemption limit.

223

enforce. 689 As noted above, however, a number of commenters have suggested defining a retail
money market fund as a fund that seeks to limit beneficial ownership interest to natural
persons. 690 After analyzing the comments received, we agree that defining a retail fund as a fund
that has policies and procedures reasonably designed to limit beneficial ownership to natural
persons (“natural person test”) provides a simpler and more cost-effective way to accomplish our
goal of targeting the floating NAV reform to the type of money market fund that has exhibited
greater tendencies to redeem first in times of market stress and has the investors most likely to
seek to take advantage of any pricing discrepancies and therefore dilute the interests of
remaining shareholders. 691 We discuss below the operation of the natural person test and its
economic effects.
ii.

Operation of the Natural Person Test

As discussed in the Proposing Release, it currently is difficult to distinguish precisely
between retail and institutional money market funds, given that funds generally self-report this

Inc., Washington, District of Columbia (Nov. 21, 2013) (“Federated XIII Comment Letter”); Federated II
Comment Letter; Fidelity Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter.

690

See supra note 684 and accompanying text. In addition to the eight commenters who submitted a joint
comment letter in support of defining a retail fund by limiting beneficial ownership to natural persons, a
number of other commenters also supported this definition. See, e.g., SunTrust Comment Letter; ICI
Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter.

691

A number of commenters supported alternate means of defining a retail investor. See, e.g., Schwab
Comment Letter (supporting defining retail investors based on concentration risk); Deutsche Comment
Letter (supporting defining retail investors based on a maximum account balance limit); SIFMA Comment
Letter (supporting defining retail investors based on a minimum initial investment, but also supporting the
“natural person” approach we are adopting today); Dreyfus Comment Letter (supporting defining retail
investors based on settlement times); Fin. Svcs. Roundtable Comment Letter (supporting defining
institutional investors, rather than retail investors, by, for example, reference to assets under management).
We have carefully considered these alternative means of defining a retail investor, but we believe, as
discussed below, that the “natural person” approach suggested by a number of other commenters is a
simpler and more cost effective way to distinguish between institutional and retail investors.

224

designation, there are no clear or consistent criteria for classifying funds, and there is no
common regulatory or industry definition of a retail investor or a retail money market fund. We
noted that the operational challenges of defining a retail fund are numerous and complex. In
addition, as discussed below, drawing a distinction between retail and institutional investors is
complicated by the extent to which shares of money market funds are held by investors through
omnibus accounts and other financial intermediaries. We also recognize that any distinction
between retail and institutional funds could result in “gaming behavior” whereby investors
having the general attributes of an institution might attempt to fit within the confines of whatever
retail fund definition we craft. We believe, however, that defining a retail fund using the natural
person test will, as a practical matter, significantly reduce opportunities for gaming behavior
because we believe that most funds will use social security numbers as part of their compliance
process to limit beneficial ownership to natural persons, and institutional investors are not issued
social security numbers.
A money market fund that has policies and procedures reasonably designed to limit
beneficial owners to natural persons will not be subject to the floating NAV reform. We expect
that a fund that intends to qualify as a retail money market fund would disclose in its prospectus
that it limits investments to accounts beneficially owned by natural persons. 692 Funds will have
flexibility in how they choose to comply with the natural person test. As noted by commenters,
we expect that many funds will rely on social security numbers to confirm beneficial ownership
by a natural person. The social security number is one well-established method of identification,
692

For example, a fund could disclose that it is a retail-only money market fund not subject to the floating
NAV requirement, consistent with the requirements of Form N-1A. See, e.g., Item 6 and Item 11 of Form
N-1A; see also infra note 940 and accompanying text.

225

issued to natural persons who qualify under the Social Security Administration’s requirements.
Because social security numbers are in nearly all cases obtained as part of the account-opening
process (for natural persons) and are populated in transfer agent and intermediary recordkeeping
systems, this approach should reduce significantly the required enhancements to systems,
processes, and procedures that would be required under alternative approaches, including our
proposed daily redemption limit. 693 In addition, for intermediaries using omnibus account
registrations where the beneficial owners are natural persons (e.g., retail brokerage accounts,
certain trust accounts, and defined contribution plan accounts), a social security number is a key
component of customer account-opening procedures and compliance and therefore should allow
intermediaries to distinguish retail from institutional investors (and therefore assist retail funds in
satisfying the retail fund definition). 694 In many cases, funds and intermediaries already collect
this data to comply with “know your customer” practices and anti-money laundering laws and
should easily be able to identify if a beneficial owner is a natural person. 695
As commenters noted, defining a retail fund in this way encompasses a large majority of
individual investors who use retail accounts today. 696 For example, we understand that many taxadvantaged savings accounts and ordinary trusts are beneficially owned by natural persons, and
therefore would likely qualify under the natural person test. 697 We understand that, often, in

693

697

Natural persons often invest in money market funds through a variety of tax-advantaged accounts and
trusts, including, for example: (i) participant-directed defined contribution plans (section 3(34) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”)); (ii) individual retirement accounts (section 408 or

226

these types of accounts, natural persons are responsible for making the decision to redeem from a
fund during a time of crisis (rather than an institutional decision maker). We acknowledge,
however, that a fund may still qualify as a retail money market fund notwithstanding having an
institutional decision maker (e.g., a plan sponsor in certain retirement arrangements, or an
investment adviser managing discretionary investment accounts) that could eliminate or change
an investment option, such as offering or investing in a money market fund. We also recognize
that there is a potential risk that an institutional decision maker may react differently in times of
market stress than the individuals that we expect will invest in retail money market funds as
defined under our amended rule. We believe that in many instances, however, this risk can be
mitigated. A number of commenters noted, for example, that under section 3(34) of ERISA, the
plan sponsor of a defined contribution plan can eliminate or change an investment option without
providing notice of the change, but stated that the plan sponsor would likely provide 30 days’
notice of any change in order to obtain the benefit of the fiduciary safe harbor in section 404(c)
of ERISA. 698 To the extent that there remains a risk that an institutional decision maker
associated with a qualifying retail fund makes decisions inconsistent with how we understand
retail funds generally behave, we believe that our approach appropriately balances this potential

408(k) of the IRC); (iv) simple retirement accounts (section 408(p) of the IRC); (v) custodial accounts
(section 403(b)(7) of the IRC); (vi) deferred compensation plans for government or tax-exempt
organization employees (section 457 of the IRC); (vii) Keogh plans (section 401(a) of the IRC); (viii)
Archer medical savings accounts (section 220(d) of the IRC); (ix) college savings plans (section 529 of the
IRC); (x) health savings account plans (section 223 of the IRC); and (xi) ordinary trusts (section 7701 of
the IRC). Accounts that are not beneficially owned by natural persons (for example, accounts not
associated with social security numbers), such as those opened by businesses, including small businesses,
defined benefit plans, or endowments, would not qualify as retail money market funds.

227

risk against the substantial benefits of providing a simple and cost-effective way to distinguish
retail funds and provide a targeted floating NAV requirement.
As noted above, funds that intend to satisfy the retail fund definition will be required to
adopt and implement policies and procedures reasonably designed to restrict beneficial
ownership to natural persons. 699 For example, funds could have policies and procedures that will
help enable the fund to “look through” these types of accounts and reasonably conclude that the
beneficial owners are natural persons. A fund’s policies and procedures could, for example,
require that the fund reasonably conclude that ownership is limited to natural persons and do so
(i) directly, such as when the investor provides a social security number to the fund adviser,
when opening a taxable or tax-deferred account through the adviser’s transfer agent or brokerage
division; or (ii) indirectly, such as when a social security number is provided to the fund adviser
in connection with recordkeeping for a retirement plan, or a trust account is opened with
information regarding the individual beneficiaries. We note that our definition of a retail money
market fund provides a fund with the flexibility to develop policies and procedures that best suit
its investor base and does not require that the fund use social security numbers to reasonably
conclude that investors are natural persons. For example, a money market fund or the
appropriate intermediary could determine the beneficial ownership of a non-U.S. natural person
by obtaining other government-issued identification, for example, a passport. 700
In the Proposing Release, we discussed as an alternative to the daily redemption limit

See rule 2a-7(a)(25).

See, e.g., 31 CFR 1023.220(a)(2)(i)(A)(4)(ii) (requiring a broker-dealer to obtain for non-U.S. persons [a]

number, or the number and country of issuance of any other government-issued document evidencing
nationality or residence and bearing a photograph or similar safeguard).

228

approach requiring that funds consider shareholder characteristics, such as whether the investor
has a social security number or a taxpayer identification number. We noted our concern,
however, that social security numbers do not necessarily correlate to an individual, and taxpayer
identification numbers do not necessarily correlate to a business (for example, businesses
operated as pass-through entities). 701 One commenter reiterated this concern. 702 We note,
however, that the definition of a retail fund does not rely solely on each investor having a social
security number. Rather, our approach recognizes that in most cases, a fund or intermediary may
often satisfy the natural person test by implementing policies and procedures that require
verifying a social security number at the time of account opening. But, the fund or intermediary
may, for example, determine that a non-U.S. investor who does not have a social security
number is a natural person (e.g., using a passport).
Finally, we note that, currently, it is not uncommon for a money market fund to be owned
by both retail and institutional investors, typically through a retail and institutional share class,
respectively. 703 In order to qualify as a retail money market fund, funds with separate share
classes for different types of investors (as well as single-class funds for both types of investors)

See Schwab Comment Letter (suggesting that any final rule identify accounts that are inherently retail and
include them as part of the definition of a retail fund so that, for example, estates and trusts would qualify
to invest in a retail money market fund (despite having a tax identification number, rather than a social
security number). We note that an estate or trust would be able to qualify for investment in a retail fund
under our definition, provided the fund reasonably concludes that the beneficial owner(s) is a natural
person.

703

Rule 18f-3 under the Investment Company Act enables a money market fund to offer retail and institutional
share classes by providing an exemption from sections 18(f)(1) and 18(i) of the Investment Company Act.
We are amending, as proposed, rule 18f-3 (the multiple class rule) to replace the phrase “that determines
net asset value using the amortized cost method permitted by § 270.2a-7” with “that operates in compliance
with § 270.2a-7” because the money market funds that are subject the floating NAV requirement would not
use the amortized cost method to a greater extent than mutual funds generally.

will need to reorganize into separate money market funds for retail and institutional investors,
which may be separate series of the fund. 704 In the case of a money market fund with retail and
institutional share classes, two commenters suggested that the Commission provide relief from
section 18(f)(1) of the Act (designed, in part, to prohibit material differences among the rights of
shareholders in a fund) 705 to allow the fund to reorganize the classes into separate money market
funds. 706
We recognize that a reorganization of a share class of a money market fund into a new
series may implicate section 18 of the Investment Company Act, as well as section 17(a) of the
Investment Company Act (section 17(a) prohibits, among other things, certain transactions
between a fund and an affiliated person of the fund to prevent unfairness to the fund or
overreaching by the affiliated person). 707 Notwithstanding the prohibitions in sections 17(a) and

See Dechert Comment Letter; NYC Bar Committee Comment Letter. Section 18(f)(1) of the Act generally
prohibits a fund from issuing any “senior security” and section 18(i) of the Act generally requires that every
share of stock issued by a fund “shall be a voting stock and have equal voting rights with every other
outstanding voting stock.” Rule 18f-3 under the Act provides a conditional exemption from sections
18(f)(1) and 18(i) of the Act, but Rule 18f-3 does not provide an exemption to permit a fund with multiple
classes of shares to separate a class from the other class(es) and reorganize it into a separate fund, and such
a reorganization may implicate the concerns underlying sections 18(f)(1) and 18(i) of the Act.

707

See section 17(b) (setting forth, among other things, the standards for exempting a transaction from the
prohibition). Section 17(a) of the Act, among other things, generally prohibits any affiliated person of a
fund, acting as principal, from knowingly selling to or buying from the fund, any security or other property,
with certain limited exceptions. A fund whose class of shares is being reorganized into a new fund may be
an affiliated person of the new fund, due to, among other possibilities, sharing an investment adviser or
board of directors. Similarly, the new fund may be an affiliated person of the fund. Accordingly, the sale
of the assets of the fund to the new fund, and the new fund's purchase of those assets from the fund, in a
reorganization of a class of the fund may be prohibited under sections 17(a)(1) and (2) of the Act. Rule

230

18(f)(1) and 18(i) of the Act, in the context of distinguishing between retail and institutional
money market funds when implementing the reforms we are adopting today, the Commission is
of the view that a reorganization of a class of a fund into a new fund may take place without
separate exemptive relief, provided that the fund’s board of directors, including a majority of the
directors who are not interested persons of the fund, determines that the reorganization results in
a fair and approximately pro rata allocation of the fund's assets between the class being
reorganized and the class remaining in the fund. 708 As is the case with any board determination,
the basis for the fund board’s determination should be documented fully in the fund’s corporate
minutes. 709 We believe that a reorganization accomplished in this manner would be consistent
with the investor protection concerns in sections 17(a) and 18 of the Act in this context. More
specifically, we believe that this board determination, in the context of a one-time reorganization
related specifically to effectuating a split of separate share classes in order to qualify as a retail
money market fund, addresses the primary concerns that sections 17 and 18 of the Act are
intended, in part, to address—to ensure that shareholders in a fund are treated fairly and prohibit
overreaching by affiliates.

17a-8 under the Act provides an exemption from sections 17(a)(1) and 17(a)(2) of the Act for a transaction
that is a “merger, consolidation, or purchase or sale of substantially all of the assets” of a fund that meets
the rule’s conditions. A reorganization of a class of a fund into a new fund may not be covered by rule 17a8.
708

A pro rata allocation ensures, for example, that portfolio securities with different liquidity and/or quality
characteristics are distributed equally among each fund class. The board’s determination requires a finding
that the reorganization results in a fair and approximately pro rata allocation of the fund’s assets in order to
acknowledge that there may be limited situations in which a 100% pro rata allocation may not be practical
(e.g., an odd-lot portfolio security).

709

All registered investment companies, including money market funds, must maintain as part of their records
minute books for board of directors’ meetings and preserve such records permanently, the first two years in
an easily accessible place. See rules 31a-1(b)(4) and 31a-2(a)(1).

231

The Commission’s position is that, as part of implementing a reorganization in response
to the amendments we are adopting today, a money market fund may involuntarily redeem
certain investors that will no longer be eligible to invest in the newly established or existing
money market fund. We recognize that such an involuntary redemption (or cancellation) of fund
shares may implicate section 22(e) of the Act, which, among other things, generally prohibits a
fund from suspending (or postponing) the right of redemption for any redeemable security for
more than seven days after tender of such shares. 710 Our staff has, in the past, however, provided
no-action relief under section 22(e) of the Act in similar situations (e.g., where an investor’s
account balance falls below a certain value, provided shareholders are notified in advance). 711
Notwithstanding the prohibitions in section 22(e) of the Act, in the context of a one-time
reorganization to distinguish between retail and institutional money market funds (either in
separating classes into new funds or in ensuring that an existing fund only has retail or
institutional investors), the Commission’s position is that a fund may involuntarily redeem
investors who no longer meet the eligibility requirements in a fund’s retail and/or institutional
money market funds without separate exemptive relief, provided that the fund notifies in writing
such investors who become ineligible to invest in a particular fund at least 60 days before the
710

For example, if a shareholder may not redeem a portion of his shares without causing an involuntary
redemption of his or her entire account balance, the shareholder may be deprived of the right to redeem that
portion of his account balance, in contravention of section 22(e).

711

See, e.g., Scudder Group of Funds (pub. avail. Sept. 15, 1992) (no-action relief granted to a fund that
proposed to, upon providing 30 days’ notice, involuntarily redeem accounts whose shareholders failed to
provide taxpayer identification numbers); DFA U.S. Large Cap Portfolio Inc. (pub. avail. Sept. 7, 1990)
(no-action relief provided to a fund that may, upon providing 30 days’ notice, involuntarily redeem
investors who failed to maintain at least $15 million in a private advisory account with the investment
adviser that produced annual advisory fees of at least $100,000; Axe-Houghton Income Fund, Inc. (pub.
avail. Mar. 19, 1981) (no-action relief provided to a fund that may, upon providing a number of notice and
delayed effectiveness provisions, involuntarily redeem investors whose account balances fall below a
prescribed threshold).

232

redemption occurs.
Accordingly, the Commission is exercising its authority under section 6(c) of the Act to
provide exemptions from these provisions of the Act to permit a money market fund to
reorganize a class of a fund into a new fund in order to qualify as a retail money market fund and
make certain involuntary redemptions as discussed above. 712 As discussed above, we believe that
such exemptions do not implicate the concerns that Congress intended to address in enacting
these provisions, and thus they are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent
with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the Act. We discuss the
potential costs of reorganizing funds below. 713
iii.

Omnibus Account Issues

As we discussed in the Proposing Release, most money market funds do not have the
ability to look through omnibus accounts to determine the characteristics of their underlying
investors. An omnibus account may consist of holdings of thousands of small investors in
retirement plans or brokerage accounts, just one or a few institutional accounts, or a mix of the
two. Omnibus accounts typically aggregate all the customer orders they receive each day, net
purchases, net redemptions, and they often present a single buy and single sell order to the fund.
Accordingly, omnibus accountholders may make it more difficult for a money market fund to

712

See section 6(c).

713

We expect that money market funds that choose to rely on our exemptive relief above and make this
determination in order to separate an existing retail share class into a new fund would do so only where the
fund’s adviser believes it would result in cost savings as compared with the costs of establishing entirely
new funds (these costs are estimated below). We do not estimate any additional costs for funds to
document the board’s determination that the reorganization results in a fair and approximately pro rata
allocation of the fund's assets. See supra note 709.

233

assure itself that it is able to operate as a retail fund. 714
A money market fund that seeks to qualify as a retail fund must have policies and
procedures that are reasonably designed to limit the fund’s beneficial owners to natural persons.
Because an omnibus accountholder is the shareholder of record (and not the beneficial owner),
retail funds will need to determine that the underlying beneficial owners of the omnibus account
are natural persons. We are not prescribing the ways in which a fund may seek to satisfy the
retail fund definition, including how the fund will reasonably conclude that underlying beneficial
owners of an omnibus account are natural persons. 715 There are many ways for a fund to
effectively manage their relationships with their intermediaries, including contractual
arrangements or periodic certifications. Funds may manage these relations in the manner that
best suits their circumstances. We note that a fund’s policies and procedures could include, for
example, relying on periodic representations of a third-party intermediary or other verification
methods to confirm the individual’s ownership interest, such as when a fund is providing
investment only services to a retirement plan or an omnibus provider is unable or unwilling to
share information that would identify the individual. Regardless of the specific policies and
procedures followed by a fund in reasonably concluding that the underlying beneficial owners of

714

As we noted in the Proposing Release, the challenges of managing implementation of fund policies through
omnibus accounts are not unique to distinguishing between retail and institutional funds. For example,
funds frequently rely on intermediaries to assess, collect, and remit redemption fees charged pursuant to
rule 22c-2 on beneficial owners that invest through omnibus accounts. Funds and intermediaries face
similar issues when managing compliance with other fund policies, such as account size limits, breakpoints,
rights of accumulation, and contingent deferred sales charges. Service providers also offer services
designed to facilitate compliance and evaluation of intermediary activities.

715

We note that although it is a fund’s obligation to satisfy the retail fund definition, an intermediary could
nonetheless be held liable for violations of other federal securities laws, including the antifraud provisions,
where institutional investors are improperly funneled into retail funds.

234

an omnibus account are natural persons, we expect that a fund will periodically review the
adequacy of such policies and procedures and the effectiveness of their implementation. 716
Accordingly, such periodic reviews would likely assist funds in detecting and correcting any
gaps in funds’ policies and procedures, including a fund’s ability to reasonably conclude that the
underlying beneficial owners of an omnibus account are natural persons. As discussed below in
the economic analysis, we have included in our aggregate cost estimate costs for funds to
establish policies and procedures with respect to omnibus accounts, but we expect that funds
generally will rely on financial intermediaries to implement such policies (rather than, for
example, entering into contractual arrangements).
iv.

Economic Analysis

In addition to the costs and benefits discussed above, implementing any reform that
distinguishes between retail and institutional money market funds will likely have similar effects
on efficiency, competition, and capital formation, regardless of how we define a retail money
market fund (or retail investor). We discussed these effects in the Proposing Release and they
are described below. 717 To the extent that retail investors prefer a stable NAV money market
fund, our floating NAV reform (that does not apply to retail funds) helps to maintain the utility
of such a money market fund investment product. However, to the extent that funds seek to
maintain a stable NAV by qualifying as a retail fund, there may be an adverse effect on capital

716

See rule 38a-1(a)(3).

717

Commenters did not specifically address our discussion in the Proposing Release of the effects on
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. A few commenters raised concerns about the costs
associated with reorganizing money market funds into separate retail and institutional funds (or series), but
did not quantify those costs or object specifically to the costs we estimated in the Proposing Release. See,
e.g., Goldman Sachs Comment Letter; UBS Comment Letter.

235

formation if the associated costs incurred by funds are passed on to shareholders. Funds that
choose to qualify as retail money market funds will incur some operational costs (discussed
below) and, depending on their magnitude, these costs might affect capital formation and
competition (depending on the varied ability of funds to absorb these costs).
To the extent that retail investors prefer a stable NAV product and funds seek to qualify
as retail money market funds under the amended rules, there may be negative effects on
competition by benefitting fund groups with large percentages of retail investors relative to other
funds. The Commission estimates that, as of February 28, 2014, 39 fund complexes (or 46% of
all fund complexes) have 75% or more of their total assets self-reported as “retail.” 718 There also
could be a negative effect on competition to the extent that certain fund groups already offer
separate retail and institutional money market funds and thus might not need to reorganize an
existing money market fund into two separate funds (retail and institutional). The Commission
estimates that, as of February 28, 2014, there are approximately 76 fund complexes that currently
offer separately designated retail and institutional money market funds (or series). 719 On the
other hand, as discussed above, we believe that the majority of money market funds currently are
owned by both retail and institutional investors (although many funds are separated into retail
and institutional classes), and therefore relatively few funds would benefit from an existing
structure that includes separate retail and institutional funds.
Two commenters also suggested that a bifurcation of existing assets in money market
funds into retail and institutional funds might lead to a significant reduction in scale and
718

Based on iMoneyNet data (39 fund complexes ÷ 84 total fund complexes reported = 46%).

719

Based on data from iMoneyNet.

236

therefore some funds may become uneconomical to operate, leading to further consolidation in
the industry and a reduction in competition. 720 As noted above, many fund complexes already
operate under structures that separate retail and institutional investors, either by established
funds, series, or classes, and therefore demonstrate that doing so is not uneconomical. We
recognize, however, that to the extent there are money market funds or fund groups that
determine that it would not be economical to operate separate retail and institutional individual
money market funds, there may be a reduction in competition. We believe that such effects
would be relatively small, as discussed in section III.K below. Finally, we note that there may be
an adverse effect on competition to the extent that large money market funds are able, based on
information from broker-dealers and other intermediaries, to receive full transparency into
beneficial owners. In this way, larger money market funds may find it easier to comply with
their policies and procedures (and, in particular, with regard to omnibus account holders) to
qualify as retail money market funds.
To the extent that money market funds are not able to distinguish effectively institutional
from retail shareholders, it may have negative effects on efficiency by permitting “gaming
behavior” by shareholders with institutional behavior patterns who nonetheless invest in retail
funds. As discussed above, however, we believe the natural person test we are adopting reduces
significantly the opportunity for “gaming behavior” when compared with our proposal. We also
recognize that establishing qualifying retail money market funds may also negatively affect fund
efficiency to the extent that a fund that currently separates institutional and retail investors

720

See HSBC Comment Letter; M&T Bank Comment Letter.

237

through different classes instead would need to create separate and distinct funds, which may be
less efficient. 721 The costs of such a re-organization are discussed below.
The costs and benefits of the natural person test are discussed above. In the Proposing
Release, we also quantified the operational costs that money market funds, intermediaries, and
money market fund service providers might incur in implementing and administering a $1
million daily redemption limit.722 As commenters noted, however, we expect that the approach
we are adopting today, based on limiting beneficial ownership to natural persons, is a simpler
and more cost-effective way to achieve our goals. Commenters noted that the natural person
approach provides a front-end qualifying test that effectively requires intermediaries and/or fund
advisers to verify the nature of each investor only once. As a result, the natural person test
reduces operational complexity and eliminates some of the need for costly programming and
ongoing monitoring. 723 These commenters also noted that, although this approach will require
some refinements to existing systems, these modifications will be significantly less costly than
building a new system for tracking and aggregating daily shareholder redemption activity (as
would be required under our proposal). Below, we quantify the estimated operational costs
associated with implementing the natural person test. 724

721

We provide exemptive relief from certain provisions of the Act to facilitate the ability of money market
funds to convert an existing retail fund share class into a separate retail fund series. See supra notes 706709 and accompanying text.

722

We estimated that the initial costs would range from $1,000,000 to $1,500,000 for each fund that chooses
to qualify as a retail money market fund and that money market funds and intermediaries implementing
policies and procedures to qualify as retail money market funds likely would incur ongoing costs of 20%30% of the one-time costs, or between $200,000 and $450,000 per year. See Proposing Release, supra note
25, at nn.245 and 246 and accompanying text.

723

See Retail Fund Joint Comment Letter.

724

Our cost estimates are informed by the analysis in the Proposing Release, comments received, and adjusted

238

The Commission estimates that based on those money market funds that self-report as
“retail,” approximately 195 money market funds are likely to seek to qualify as a retail money
market fund under our amended rules. 725 We have estimated the ranges of hours and costs
associated with the natural person test that may be required to perform activities typically
involved in making systems modifications, implementing fund policies and procedures, and
performing related activities. 726 Although we do not have the information necessary to provide a
point estimate of the potential costs associated with the natural person test, these estimates
include one-time and ongoing costs to establish separate funds (or series) if necessary, modify
systems and related procedures and controls, update disclosure in a fund’s prospectus, as well as
ongoing operational costs. All estimates are based on the staff’s experience, commenter
estimates, and discussions with industry representatives. We expect that only funds that
determine that the benefits of qualifying as a retail money market fund justify the costs would
seek to qualify and thus bear these costs. Otherwise, they would incur the costs of implementing
a floating NAV generally or decide to liquidate the fund.
As discussed above, many money market funds currently are owned by both retail and

to reflect the definition of a retail money market fund we are adopting today. See Proposing Release, supra
note 25, at section III.A.4.d.
725

Based on iMoneyNet, as of February 28, 2014.

726

The costs estimated in this section would be spread among money market funds, intermediaries, and money
market fund service providers (e.g., transfer agents and custodians). For ease of reference, we refer only to
money market funds and intermediaries in our discussion of these costs. As with other costs we estimate in
this Release, we have estimated the costs that a single affected entity would incur. We anticipate, however,
that many money market funds and intermediaries may not bear the estimated costs on an individual basis.
The costs of systems modifications, for example, likely would be allocated among the multiple users of the
systems, such as money market fund members of a fund group, money market funds that use the same
transfer agent, and intermediaries that use systems purchased from the same third party. Accordingly, we
expect that the cost for many individual entities may be less than the estimated costs.

239

institutional investors, although they often are separated into retail and institutional share classes.
A fund that seeks to qualify as a retail money market fund under our amended rules will need to
be structured to limit beneficial ownership to only natural persons, and thus any money market
fund that currently has both retail and institutional shareholders would need to be reorganized
into separate retail and institutional money market funds. One-time costs associated with this
reorganization would include costs incurred by the fund’s counsel to draft appropriate
organizational documents and costs incurred by the fund’s board of directors to approve such
documents. One-time costs also would include the costs to update the fund’s registration
statement and any relevant contracts or agreements to reflect the reorganization, as well as costs
to update prospectuses and to inform shareholders of the reorganization. In addition, funds may
have one-time costs to obtain shareholder approval to the extent that a money market fund’s
charter documents and/or applicable state law require shareholder approval to effect a
reorganization into separate retail and institutional money market funds. 727 Funds and
intermediaries also may incur one-time costs in training staff to understand the operation of the
fund and effectively implement the natural person test.
In order to qualify as a retail money market fund, a fund will be required to adopt and
implement policies and procedures reasonably designed to restrict beneficial owners to natural
persons. Adopting such policies and procedures and modifying systems to identify an investor
as a natural person who is eligible for investment in the fund also would involve one-time costs

727

One commenter provided survey data suggesting that the one-time range of costs of a shareholder vote to
segregate retail from institutional investors could range from $2 million - $5 million (57% of respondents)
or $1 million - $2 million (14% of respondents). See SIFMA Comment Letter. No other commenters
provided cost estimates regarding shareholder votes.

240

for funds and intermediaries. Regarding omnibus accounts, the rule does not prescribe the way
in which funds should determine that underlying beneficial owners of an omnibus account are
natural persons. We note that a fund may require (as a matter of doing business) that its
intermediaries implement its policies, including those related to qualification as a retail fund.
However, there are also other ways for a fund to manage their relationships with their
intermediaries, such as entering into a contractual arrangement or obtaining certifications from
the omnibus account holder. In preparing the following cost estimates, we assumed that funds
will generally rely on financial intermediaries to implement their policies without undergoing the
costs of entering into a contractual arrangement with the financial intermediaries because funds
and intermediaries would typically take the approach that is the least expensive. However, some
funds may choose to undertake voluntarily the costs of obtaining an explicit contractual
arrangement despite the expense. 728
In our proposal, we estimated that the initial costs would range from $1,000,000 to
$1,500,000 for each fund that seeks to satisfy the retail money market fund definition (as
proposed, using a daily redemption limit). 729 One commenter provided specific cost estimates
related to our proposal to define a retail money market fund based on a $1,000,000 daily
redemption limit, estimating that it would cost the fund complex $11,200,000, or $311,000 per
fund. 730

728

A fund might, as a general business practice, prefer to enter into a formal contractual arrangement.

729

See supra note 722.

See Federated X Comment Letter (“Federated would have to create new funds and fund classes in order to
implement retail vs. institutional fund structures. This would cost approximately $1.7 million. In order to
accomplish client outreach, effect shareholder votes, print new regulatory documents, create new sales
literature and engage with investors as to the new nature of their shares and alternatives, we estimate that

241

Based on staff experience and review of the comments received, as well as the changes to
the retail definition in the final amendments, we estimate that the one-time costs necessary to
implement policies and procedures and/or for a fund to qualify as a retail money market fund
under our amended rules, including the various organizational, operational, training, and other
costs discussed above, will range from $830,000 to $1,300,000 per entity. 731 Our estimates
represent a decrease of $170,000 on the low end, and a decrease of $200,000 on the high end
from our proposed range of estimated operational costs. 732 Our revised cost estimates reflect, as
noted by commenters, a more cost-effective way to define a retail money market fund.

Federated will expend another $4 million. Revisiting and revising contractual relationships with brokerdealers and other intermediaries to provide for enforcement of the $1 million redemption limit would cost a
further $1.3 million. Charges from independent pricing services, custodians, record-keepers, and transfer
agents are expected at nearly $3 million. Upgrades to Federated’s internal systems and systems that
interface with customers and transfer agents would cost another $1.2 million.”). These costs total
$11,200,000. Averaged across the number of money market funds offered, this commenter estimates the
one-time implementation costs to be $311,000 per fund ($11,200,000 ÷ 36 money market funds). See
supra note 586 (using Form N-MFP data, Federated manages 36 money market funds).
731

Estimates also include costs to intermediaries to implement systems and procedures to satisfy money
market fund requirements regarding omnibus accounts. We estimate that the costs would be attributable to
the following activities: (i) planning, coding, testing, and installing system modifications; (ii) drafting,
integrating, and implementing related procedures and controls and documents necessary to reorganize fund
structures into retail and institutional funds; and (iii) preparing training materials and administering training
sessions for staff in affected areas. Our estimates of these operational and related costs, and those
discussed throughout this Release, are based on, among other things, staff experience implementing, or
overseeing the implementation of, systems modifications and related work at mutual fund complexes, and
included analyses of wage information from SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the
Securities Industry 2013 at infra note 2214. See infra note 2228 for the various types of professionals we
estimate would be involved in performing the activities associated with our proposals. The actual costs
associated with each of these activities would depend on a number of factors, including variations in the
functionality, sophistication, and level of automation of existing systems and related procedures and
controls, and the complexity of the operating environment in which these systems operate. Our estimates
generally are based on our assumption that funds would use internal resources because we believe that a
money market fund (or other affected entity) would engage third-party service providers only if the external
costs were comparable, or less than, the estimated internal costs. The total operational costs discussed here
include the costs that are “collections of information” that are discussed in section IV.A.2 of this Release.

732

These amounts are calculated as follows: $1,000,000 (proposed) - $830,000 = $170,000 (low end);
$1,500,000 (proposed) - $1,300,000 = $200,000 (high end). See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.245
and accompanying text.

242

Accordingly, our cost estimates take into account the fact that most money market funds will
largely be able to satisfy the natural person test using information that funds already collect and
have readily available, and reduce the estimated amount of resources necessary, for example, to
program systems capable of tracking and aggregating daily shareholder redemption activity (that
would have been required under our proposal). 733
In addition to these one-time costs, as discussed above, funds may have one-time costs to
obtain shareholder approval to the extent that a money market fund’s charter documents and/or
applicable state law require shareholder approval to effect a reorganization into separate retail
and institutional money market funds. One commenter provided survey data that estimated the
one-time costs would be between $1,000,000 to $5,000,000. 734 We note, however, that the
survey respondents are asset managers, many of whom may be responsible for fund complexes,
and it is not clear whether these cost estimates represent costs to a fund complex or to a single
fund. Although the Commission does not have the information necessary to estimate the number
of funds that may seek shareholder approval to effect a reorganization, we estimate that it will
cost, on average, approximately $100,000 per fund in connection with a shareholder vote. 735
Finally, money market funds that seek to qualify as retail funds will be required to adopt policies
and procedures that are reasonably designed to limit beneficial owners of the fund to natural
persons. As discussed in section IV.A.2 (Retail Funds) below, we estimate that the initial time
733

See supra notes 722-724 and accompanying text.

734

See supra note 727.

735

Our estimate is based on the most recently approved Paperwork Reduction Act renewal for rule 17a-8
under the Act (Mergers of Affiliated Companies), OMB Control No. 3235-0235, available at
http://reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=201304-3235-015. Our estimate includes legal,
mailing, printing, solicitation, and tabulation costs in connection with a shareholder vote.

243

costs associated with adopting policies and procedures will be $492,800 for all fund complexes.
Funds that intend to qualify as retail money market funds will also incur ongoing costs.
These ongoing costs would include the costs of operating two separate funds (retail and
institutional) instead of separate classes of a single fund, such as additional transfer agent,
accounting, and other similar costs. Other ongoing costs may include systems maintenance,
periodic review and updates of policies and procedures, and additional staff training. Finally,
our estimates include ongoing costs for funds to manage and monitor intermediaries’ compliance
with fund policies regarding omnibus accounts. Accordingly, we continue to estimate, as we did
in the proposal, that money market funds and intermediaries likely will incur ongoing costs
related to implementation of a retail money market fund definition of 20%-30% of the one-time
costs, or between $166,000 and $390,000 per year. 736 We received no comments on this aspect
of our proposal.

Municipal Money Market Funds

Both the fees and gates reform and floating NAV reform will apply to municipal money
market funds (or tax-exempt funds 737). We discuss below the key characteristics of tax-exempt
funds, commenter concerns regarding our proposal (and final amendments) to apply the fees and
gates and floating NAV reforms to tax-exempt funds, and an analysis of potential economic
effects. We note, as addressed below, that the majority of the comments received relating to tax736

We recognize that adding new capabilities or capacity to a system (including modifications to related
procedures and controls and related training) will entail ongoing annual maintenance costs and understand
that those costs generally are estimated as a percentage of the initial costs of building or modifying a
system.

737

“Municipal money market fund” and “tax-exempt fund” are used interchangeably throughout this Release.
A municipal money market fund that qualifies as a retail money market fund would not be subject to the
floating NAV reform. See supra section III.C.2.

244

exempt funds were given in the context of our floating NAV reform. 738
a.

Background

Tax-exempt funds primarily hold obligations of state and local governments and their
instrumentalities, which pay interest that generally is exempt from federal income taxes. 739 Thus,
the majority of investors in tax-exempt money market funds are those investors who are subject
to federal income tax and therefore can benefit from the funds’ tax-exempt interest. As
discussed below, state and local governments rely in part on tax-exempt funds to fund public
projects. 740 As of February 28, 2014, tax-exempt funds held approximately $279 billion of
assets, out of approximately $3.0 trillion in total money market fund assets. 741
Industry data suggests institutional investors hold approximately 29% ($82 billion) of
municipal money market fund assets. 742 This estimate is likely high, as omnibus accounts (which
often represent retail investors) are often categorized as institutional by third-party researchers.
One commenter, for example, surveyed its institutional tax-exempt money market funds, and
found that approximately 50% of the assets in these “institutional” funds were beneficially
owned by institutions.743
On average, over 70% of tax-exempt funds’ assets (valued based upon amortized cost)
738

Section III.C.7 below discusses more general reasons for not excluding specific types of money market
funds from the fees and gates amendments. These reasons apply equally to our analysis of municipal
money market funds and the fees and gates amendments.

are comprised of municipal securities issued as variable-rate demand notes (“VRDNs”). 744 The
interest rates on VRDNs are typically reset either daily or every seven days. 745 VRDNs include a
demand feature that provides the investor with the option to put the issue back to the trustee at a
price of par value plus accrued interest. 746 This demand feature is supported by a liquidity
facility such as letters of credit, lines of credit, or standby purchase agreements provided by
financial institutions. 747 The interest-rate reset and demand features shorten the duration of the
security and allow it to qualify as an eligible security under rule 2a-7. Tax-exempt funds also
invest in tender option bonds (“TOBs”), which typically are floating rate securities that provide
the holder with a put option at par, supported by a liquidity facility provided by a commercial
bank. 748

Discussion

In the Proposing Release, we noted that because most municipal money market funds
tend to be owned by retail investors, who are among the greatest beneficiaries of the funds’ tax
advantages, most tax-exempt funds would qualify under our proposed definition of retail money
market fund and therefore would continue to offer a stable share price. 749 We stated that,

A few commenters noted that, in addition to individuals, corporations, partnerships, and other business
entities may enjoy the tax benefits of investments in tax-exempt funds. See, e.g., Comment Letter of
Federated Investors (Regulation of Tax-Exempt Money Market Funds) (Sept. 16, 2013) (“Federated VII
Comment Letter”). One commenter noted that, while corporations may not enjoy the tax advantages
afforded under the Internal Revenue Code to exempt dividends to the full degree that individuals can enjoy
them, eligible corporations can benefit from a tax exemption under certain conditions (such as meeting a
minimum holding period). See Dreyfus II Comment Letter.

although there are some tax-exempt money market funds that self-classify as institutional funds,
we believed these funds’ shareholder base typically is comprised of omnibus accounts with
underlying individual investors. As noted by commenters and discussed below, we now
understand that only some (and not all) of these funds’ shareholder base is comprised of omnibus
accounts with underlying individual investors. We also stated our belief that, like many
securities in prime funds, municipal securities present greater credit and liquidity risk than U.S.
government securities and could come under pressure in times of stress.
Many commenters suggested that we not apply our floating NAV reform 750 or our fees
and gates reform 751 to municipal money market funds. Commenters raised specific concerns
about the ability and extent to which tax-exempt funds would qualify as retail money market
funds as proposed (and therefore be permitted to maintain a stable NAV). Several commenters
noted that high-net-worth individuals, who often invest in tax-exempt funds because of the tax
benefits, engage in periodic transactions that exceed the proposed $1 million daily redemption
limit, which would effectively disqualify them from investing in a retail municipal fund, as
proposed. 752 We are addressing these concerns by adopting a definition of retail money market
fund that will allow many of these individuals to invest in tax-exempt funds that offer a stable
NAV. Funds that wish to qualify as retail money market funds will be required to limit
beneficial ownership interests to “natural persons” (e.g., individual accounts registered with

247

social security numbers). Because the retail money market fund definition is not conditioned on
a daily redemption limitation, but instead requires that retail money market funds restrict
beneficial ownership to natural persons, high-net-worth individuals will not be subject to a
redemption limit and thus should be able to continue investing in tax-exempt funds much like
they do today. 753
Several commenters expressed concern that a number of municipal money market funds
would not qualify as retail money market funds, as proposed, because institutional investors hold
them. Commenters noted that approximately 30% (and historically between 25% and 40% 754) of
tax-exempt funds currently self-report as institutional funds. 755 We understand that some but not
all of these funds’ shareholder base is comprised of omnibus accounts with underlying individual
investors. A number of commenters supported the view that most investors in tax-exempt funds
are individuals. 756 One commenter stated its belief, however, that institutions rather than
individuals or natural persons beneficially own a significant, if not majority, portion of the assets
invested in these self-reported institutional tax-exempt funds. 757 Although we understand that
some omnibus accounts may be comprised of institutions without underlying individual
753

Tax-exempt funds would, however, be potentially subject to our fees and gates reform.

754

Our staff’s analysis, based on iMoneyNet data, shows that the amount of municipal money market fund
assets held by institutional investors varied between 25% to 43% between 2001 to 2013.

Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter.

757

See Dreyfus II Comment Letter, supra note 743 and accompanying text. This commenter provided data
suggesting that approximately 50% of the assets of its self-reported “institutional” tax-exempt funds are
beneficially owned by institutional investors. We acknowledge that certain tax-exempt funds may be
beneficially owned by a large number of institutional investors. However, this data, which reflects only an
analysis of this commenter’s money market funds (rather than industry-wide data), does not necessarily
support a finding that a majority of such assets is “institutional” in nature.

248

beneficial owners, the lack of a statutory or regulatory definition of institutional and retail funds,
along with a lack of information regarding investor attributes in omnibus accounts, prevents us
from estimating with precision the portion of investors and assets in tax-exempt funds that selfreport as institutional that are beneficially owned by institutions. As discussed above, however,
industry data suggests that approximately 30% of municipal money market fund assets are held
by institutional investors–investors that may not qualify to invest in a retail municipal money
market fund. 758
Several commenters argued that tax-exempt funds should not be subject to the fees and
gates and floating NAV reforms because the municipal money market fund industry is not
systemically risky. In support, commenters pointed to the relatively small amount of assets
managed by municipal money market funds, the stability of tax-exempt funds during recent
periods of market stress, and the diversity of the municipal issuer market. 759 As discussed above,
we acknowledge that the current institutional municipal money market fund industry is small
relative to the overall money market fund industry. Despite its relatively small size, however, we
are concerned that institutional investors that currently hold prime funds might be incentivized to
shift assets from prime funds to municipal money market funds as an alternative stable NAV
investment. This could undermine the goals of reform with respect to the floating NAV
requirement by providing an easy way for institutional investors to keep stable value pricing
while continuing to invest in funds with assets that, relatively speaking, have a risk character that

249

is significantly closer to prime funds than government funds. 760
Commenters argued that historical shareholder flows in municipal money market funds,
as well as their past resiliency, demonstrate that they are not prone to runs or especially risky. 761
They pointed out that shareholder flows from tax-exempt funds were moderate during times of
recent market stress compared to significant outflows from institutional prime money market
funds. 762 A review of money market fund industry asset flows during the market stress in 2008
and 2011 shows that tax-exempt funds remained relatively flat and tracked investor flows in
other retail prime funds. 763 We believe that some of this stability may be attributable to
municipal money market funds’ significant retail investor base rather than low portfolio risk. 764
In this regard, we note that although investors did not flee municipal funds in times of market
stress, they also did not move assets into municipal funds as they did into government funds. 765
Accordingly, it appears that those investors did not perceive the risk characteristics of municipal

760

In addition, as discussed below, municipal money market funds may be subject to heavy redemptions, even
if they have not been in the past. The fees and gates amendments are intended to give funds and their
boards tools to stem such heavy redemptions.

761

See, e.g., Fidelity Comment Letter (noting that, more recently, the largest municipal bankruptcy (City of
Detroit) had no discernible effects on money market funds); ICI Comment Letter; J.P. Morgan Comment
Letter. A number of commenters also noted that during these periods of market stress, tax-exempt funds
did not experience contagion from heavy redemptions like those experienced by institutional prime funds.
See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter (noting that a tax-exempt fund sponsored by Lehman Brothers (the
Neuberger Berman Tax-Free Fund) had two-thirds of its total net assets redeemed, but had no ripple effect
on other tax-exempt funds or the broader municipal market); Dechert Comment Letter; BlackRock II
Comment Letter.

funds to be similar to those of government funds. Consistent with this observation, our analysis
indicates that the shadow price of tax-exempt funds is distributed more similarly to that of prime
funds than government funds. 766 Specifically, the volatility of the distribution of municipal
money market fund shadow prices is significantly larger than the volatility of government
funds. 767 In addition, our staff’s analysis of historical shadow prices shows that tax-exempt funds
are more likely than government funds to experience large losses. 768 Thus, we believe municipal
funds are more similar in nature to prime funds than government funds for purposes of the
floating NAV reform.
Several commenters noted that the diversity of the municipal issuer market reduces the
risks associated with municipal money market funds. 769 We note that although there is some
diversity among the direct issuers of municipal securities, the providers of most of the demand
features for the VRDNs, most of which are financial services firms, are highly concentrated. 770
This is a significant countervailing consideration because VRDNs comprise the majority of taxexempt funds’ portfolios. 771 This level of concentration increases municipal funds’ exposure to
766

Using data collected from Form N-MFP and iMoneyNet, the standard deviation of shadow prices (which is
a measure used to assess the overall riskiness of a fund) estimated over the time period from November
2010 to February 2014 are 0.00023, 0.00039, and 0.00052 for government, prime, and tax-exempt funds,
respectively. This data shows that the standard deviation of tax-exempt funds is statistically significantly
larger than the other two types of funds with a 99% confidence level. Furthermore, the frequency at which
the shadow prices for tax-exempt funds is less than 1.000 is greater than for government funds and is
increasing at lower shadow price values. Accordingly, this means that the likelihood for large negative
returns and hence large losses is greater for tax-exempt funds than for government funds.

financial sector risk relative to, for example, government funds. 772 And, in this regard, we are
mindful of the potential for increased sector risk to the financial services firms that provide the
demand features if investors reallocate assets to tax-exempt funds that are not subject to the fees
and gates and floating NAV reforms.
A number of commenters cited the resilient portfolio construction of municipal money
market funds and argued that the liquidity risk, interest rate risk, issuer risk, and credit/default
risk of tax-exempt funds are more similar to government funds than prime funds. 773 As discussed
above, however, staff analysis shows that the distribution of fluctuations in the shadow NAV of
tax-exempt funds is more similar to that of prime funds than government funds. 774 Municipal
securities typically present greater credit and liquidity risk than government securities. 775 We
believe that recent municipal bankruptcies have highlighted liquidity concerns related to
municipal money market funds and note that, although municipal money market funds have
previously weathered these events, there is no guarantee that they will be able to do so in the
772

Based on a review of Form N-MFP data as of February 28, 2014, over 10% of the amortized cost value of
VRDNs are guaranteed by a single bank, and approximately 54% of the amortized cost value is guaranteed
by 10 banks.

773

See, e.g., Fidelity Comment Letter (weekly liquid assets of tax-exempt funds is typically more than double
the current 30% requirement under rule 2a-7). See also, e.g., ICI Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment
Letter; Invesco Comment Letter; Legg Mason & Western Asset Comment Letter. Interest rate risk, as
measured by weighted average maturity, is consistently lower for tax-exempt funds (averaging 35 days,
well below the 60-day requirement in rule 2a-7) than prime and government funds. See Fidelity Comment
Letter (citing iMoneyNet). Commenters also argued that the credit risk of tax-exempt funds is more similar
to government funds than prime funds. See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter (tax-exempt securities have low
credit risk because municipalities are not generally interconnected and deterioration occurs over a
protracted time); Dreyfus Comment Letter (many distressed issues (e.g., City of Detroit) become ineligible
under rule 2a-7s risk-limiting conditions and therefore bankruptcy does not affect direct holdings of taxexempt funds).

future.
Further, although we recognize that the structural features of VRDNs may provide taxexempt funds with higher levels of weekly liquid assets and reduced interest rate risk as
compared with prime funds, we do not find that on balance that warrants treating municipal
funds more like government funds than prime funds. This is so because, among other things, the
liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and credit risk characteristics result from concentrated exposure
to VRDNs, and not because the municipal debt securities underlying the VRDNs or the related
structural support are inherently liquid, free from interest rate risk, or immune from credit risks
in the way that government securities generally are. 776 Indeed, long-term municipal debt
securities underlie most VRDNs, and these securities infrequently trade. 777 Instead, the liquidity
is provided through the demand feature to a concentrated number of financial institutions, and
money market funds have experienced problems in the past when a large number of puts on
securities were exercised at the same time. 778
In fact, when we adopted the 2010 amendments to rule 2a-7, we cited to commenter
concerns regarding the market structure of VRDNs and heavy reliance of tax-exempt funds on
these security investments in determining not to require that municipal money market funds meet
the 10% daily liquid asset requirement that other money market funds must satisfy. 779

American Life Insurance Co.).

779

See 2010 Adopting Release, supra note 17, at nn.240-243 and accompanying text.

253

Commenters did not generally support adding such a requirement, but the lack of a mandated
supply of daily liquid assets leaves these funds more exposed to potential increases in
redemptions in times of fund and market stress. 780 As a result, the portfolio composition of some
tax-exempt funds may change and present different risks in the future. In addition, because of
the daily liquidity issues associated with VRDNs and the fact that tax-exempt money market
funds are not required to maintain 10% daily liquid assets, 781 these funds in particular may
experience stress on their liquidity necessitating the use of fees and gates to manage redemptions
(even with respect to the lower level of redemptions expected in a tax-exempt retail money
market fund as compared to an institutional prime fund).
Several commenters also argued that certain structural features of tax-exempt funds make
them more stable than prime money market funds and therefore these commenters believe that
the floating NAV reform should not apply to tax-exempt funds. For example, these commenters
observed that a tax-exempt fund’s investments, primarily VRDNs, and, to a lesser extent,
TOBs, 782 have structural features (e.g., contractual credit enhancements or liquidity support
provided by highly rated banks and one-to-seven day interest rate resets) that facilitate trading at

780

See Fidelity Comment Letter; but see Wells Fargo Comment Letter. We note also that new regulations also
may affect the issuance of the dominant types of securities that now provide the stability of tax-exempt
funds. For example, because TOB programs are not exempt from the Volcker rule, banks and their
affiliates will no longer be able to sponsor or provide support to a TOB program. See Volcker Rule, infra
note 782. As a result, the portfolio composition of some tax-exempt funds may change and present
different risks in the future.

781

See rule 2a-7(d)(4)(ii).

782

Participation by banks and their affiliates in TOB programs are subject to the prohibitions and restrictions
applicable to covered funds under the recently adopted Volcker Rule (implemented by Title VI of the
Dodd-Frank Act, named for former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, Section 619 of the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (12 U.S.C. 1851) (“Volcker Rule”)).

254

par in the secondary market. 783 We agree that these features lower the risk of portfolio holdings
as compared to prime money market funds, but also recognize that holding municipal money
market funds presents higher risks than those associated with government or Treasury funds.
Not all VRDNs have credit support, 784 and tax-exempt funds present credit risk. 785 Accordingly,
we do not agree with commenters that, as noted above, suggest that the credit risk of tax-exempt
funds is more similar to government funds than prime funds.
For all of the above reasons, we believe that tax-exempt funds should be subject to the
fees and gates and floating NAV reforms. As discussed, the risk profile of institutional
municipal money market funds more closely approximates that of prime funds than government
783

See, e.g., Fidelity Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter.

784

Based on Form N-MFP data as of February 28, 2014, only 57% of VRDNs, which make up a majority of
the assets in municipal money market funds, have a guarantee that protects a fund in case of default. In
comparison, the federal government guarantees all government securities held by government funds.

785

Credit risk may result from the financial health of the issuer itself, such as when the city of Detroit recently
filed for bankruptcy, becoming the largest municipal issuer default in U.S. history, leading to significant
outflows from municipal bond funds. See Jeff Benjamin, Detroit bankruptcy has surprising long-term
implications for muni bond market, CRAIN’S DETROIT BUSINESS (Dec. 3, 2013)
http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20131203/NEWS/131209950/detroit-bankruptcy-has-surprising-longterm-implications-for-muni#. Although Detroit’s credit deteriorated over a long period of time and thus the
bankruptcy did not cause tax-exempt money market funds, which had largely anticipated the event, to
experience significant losses, in the past there have not have not been significant lead times before a
municipality evidenced a credit deterioration. See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter. For example, Orange
County, California, had high-quality bond credit ratings just before filing one of the largest municipal
bankruptcies in U.S. history on December 6, 1994. See HANDBOOK OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, supra
note 745, at 239. Orange County caused one money market fund to break the buck and several sponsors to
inject millions of dollars of additional cash to rescue their funds. See, e.g., Viral V. Acharya et al,
REGULATING WALL STREET: THE DODD-FRANK ACT AND THE NEW ARCHITECTURE OF GLOBAL FINANCE
308 (2011); see also Suzanne Barlyn, Investing Strategy What the Orange County Fiasco Means to the
Muni Bond Market, FORTUNE (Jan. 16, 1995),
http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1995/01/16/201819/index.htm. Another type
of credit risk arises when financial institutions provide credit enhancement to municipal securities. For
example, in 1992, Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company (“Mutual Benefit”) went into conservatorship
with the New Jersey Insurance Commissioner. The company had guaranteed forty-three municipal bond
issues totaling $600 million, which financed money-losing real estate projects. Mutual Benefit’s
insolvency resulted in the termination of its guarantee on the bonds and halted interest payments resulting
in losses for investors. See C. Richard Lehmann, Municipal Bond Defaults, in THE HANDBOOK OF
MUNICIPAL BONDS 509 (Susan C. Heide et al. eds., 1994).

255

funds. Tax-exempt funds present credit risk, typically rely on a concentrated number of financial
sector put or guarantee providers, and have portfolios comprised largely of a single type of
structured investment product—all of which may present future risks that may be exacerbated by
a potential migration of investors from prime funds that are unable or unwilling to invest in a
floating NAV money market fund or money market fund that may impose fees and gates.
Accordingly, we believe that tax-exempt funds should be subject to the fees and gates and
floating NAV reforms adopted today. 786
c.

Economic Analysis of FNAV

Although we expect that many tax-exempt funds will qualify as retail money market
funds and therefore be able to maintain a stable NAV (as they do today), there are, as we
discussed above, some institutional investors in municipal money market funds that may be
unable or unwilling to invest in a floating NAV fund. 787 To the extent that institutional investors
continue to invest in a floating NAV municipal money market fund, the benefits of a floating
NAV discussed in section III.B extend to these types of funds. Because a floating NAV
requirement may reduce investment in those funds, however, we recognize that there will likely
be costs for the sponsors of tax-exempt funds, the institutions that invest in these types of funds,
and tax-exempt issuers. These costs are the same as those described in section III.B for
institutional prime funds and the costs described in section III.I for corporate issuers.
786

Our rationale is consistent with our finding, discussed above, that we no longer believe that exempting
institutional prime money market funds under section 6(c) of the Act is appropriate. See supra note 446
and accompanying text .

787

We believe that the economic analysis that follows would apply equally in the context of the fees and gates
reform. For a discussion of the economic implications that may arise for investors, including retail
investors who may be unable or unwilling to invest in a fund that can impose fees and gates, including
potential implications on state and local funding, see infra section III.K.

256

To the extent that institutions currently invest in tax-exempt funds and are unwilling to
invest in a floating NAV tax-exempt fund, the demand for municipal securities, for example,
may fall and the costs of financing for municipalities may rise. 788 We anticipate the impact,
however, will likely be relatively small. As of the last quarter of 2012, tax-exempt funds held
approximately 7% of the municipal debt outstanding. 789 Of that 7%, institutional investors, who
might divest their municipal fund assets if they do not want to invest in a floating NAV fund,
held approximately 30% of municipal money market fund assets. 790 Accordingly, we estimate
institutional tax-exempt funds hold approximately 2% of the total municipal debt outstanding
and thus 2% is at risk of leaving the municipal debt market. 791 Although this could impact
capital formation for municipalities, there are several reasons to believe that the impact would
likely be small (including minimal impact on efficiency and competition, if any). First,
institutional investors that currently invest in municipal funds likely value the tax benefits of
these funds and many may choose to remain invested in them to take advantage of the tax
benefits even though they might otherwise prefer stable to floating NAV funds. Second, to the
788

A number of commenters argued that applying our floating NAV reform to tax-exempt funds would reduce
demand for municipal securities and raise the costs of financing. See, e.g., Fidelity Comment Letter (noting
that tax-exempt funds purchase approximately 65% of short-term municipal securities and that fewer
institutional investors in tax-exempt funds will lead to less purchasing of short-term municipal securities by
tax-exempt funds and a corresponding higher yield paid by municipal issuers to attract new investors);
BlackRock II Comment Letter; Federated VII Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter; Comment Letter of
Mayors, City of Irving, TX, et al (Sept. 12, 2013) (“U.S. Mayors Comment Letter”).

789

Other published data is consistent with this estimate. See, for example, the Federal Reserve Board “Flow
of Funds Accounts of the United States” (Z.1), which details the flows and levels of municipal securities
and loans, to estimate outstanding municipal debt (March 6, 2014), available at
http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/current/. These estimates are consistent with previous estimates
presented in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 2012 Report on the Municipal Securities Market.
The estimates in the 2012 report were based on data from Mergent’s Municipal Bond Securities Database.

790

See supra note 742 and accompanying text.

791

This estimate is calculated as follows: tax-exempt funds hold 7% of municipal debt outstanding x 30% of
tax-exempt assets held by institutional investors = 2.1% of total tax-exempt debt held by institutions.

257

extent that institutional investors divesting municipal funds lead to a decreased demand for
municipal debt instruments, other investors may fill the gap. As discussed in the Proposing
Release, “Between the end of 2008 and the end of 2012, money market funds decreased their
holdings of municipal debt by 34% or $172.8 billion. 792 Despite this reduction in holdings by
money market funds, municipal issuers increased aggregate borrowings by over 4% between the
end of 2008 and the end of 2012. Municipalities were able to fill the gap by attracting other
investor types. Other types of mutual funds, for example, increased their municipal securities
holdings by 61% or $238.6 billion.” 793
Although institutional municipal funds represent a relatively small portion of the
municipal debt market, we recognize that these funds represent a significant portion of the shortterm municipal debt market. 794 According to Form N-MFP data, municipal money market funds
held $256 billion in VRDNs and short-term municipal debt as of the last quarter of 2013. 795
Effectively, municipal money market funds absorbed nearly 100% of the outstanding VRDNs
and short-term municipal debt. Considering that institutional tax-exempt funds represented
approximately 30% of the municipal money market fund market, it follows that institutional taxexempt funds likely held about $77 billion in VRDNs and short-term municipal debt. Any
reduction in municipal funds therefore could have an appreciable impact on the ability of
municipalities to obtain short-term lending. That said, this impact could be substantially
mitigated because, as discussed above, other market participants may buy these securities or

258

municipalities will adapt to a changing market by, for example, altering their debt structure. As
discussed in the Proposing Release, “[t]o make their issues attractive to alternative lenders,
municipalities lengthened the terms of some of their debt securities,” 796 in the face of changing
market conditions in recent years. To the extent that other market participants step in and fill the
potential gap in demand, competition may increase. To the extent other market participants do
not step in and fill the gap, capital formation may be adversely affected. Finally, if
municipalities are required to alter their debt structure to foster demand for their securities (e.g.,
because demand declined as a result of our amendments), there may be an adverse effect on
efficiency. Although we discuss above ways in which the short-term municipal debt market may
adapt to continue to raise capital as it does today, we acknowledge that our floating NAV reform
will impact institutional investors in tax-exempt funds and therefore likely impact the short-term
municipal markets. On balance, however, we believe that realizing the goals of this rulemaking,
including recognizing the concerns discussed above with respect to the risks presented by taxexempt funds, justifies the potential adverse effects on efficiency, competition, and capital
formation.

Implications for Local Government Investment Pools

As we discussed in the Proposing Release, we recognize that many states have
established local government investment pools (“LGIPs”), money market fund-like investment
pools that invest in short-term securities, 797 which are required by law or investment policies to

796

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at 309.

LGIPs tend to emulate typical money market funds by maintaining a stable NAV per share through

maintain a stable NAV per share. 798 Accordingly, as we discussed in the Proposing Release, the
floating NAV reform may have implications for LGIPs, including the possibility that state
statutes and policies may need to be amended to permit the operation of investment pools that
adhere to amended rule 2a-7. 799 In addition, some commenters suggested that our floating NAV
reform, as well as the liquidity fees and gates requirement, may result in outflows of LGIP assets
into alternative investments that provide a stable NAV and/or do not restrict liquidity. 800
A few commenters noted that it is the GASB reference to “2a-7 like” funds that links
LGIPs to rule 2a-7, and not state statutes. 801 Some commenters noted that our money market
fund reforms do not directly affect LGIPs because the decision as to whether LGIPs follow our
changes to rule 2a-7 is determined by GASB and the states, not the Commission. 802 Some
commenters suggested that, in response to our floating NAV reform, GASB and the states might

Government Investment Pool Act, which sets certain prudential investment standards but leaves it to the
state treasury board to formulate specific investment policies for Virginia’s LGIP. See Va. Code Ann. §
2.2-4605(A)(3). Accordingly, the treasury board instituted a policy of managing Virginia’s LGIP in
accordance with “certain risk-limiting provisions to maintain a stable net asset value at $1.00 per share”
and “GASB ‘2a-7 like’ requirements.” Virginia LGIP’s Investment Circular, June 30, 2012, available at

however, see infra section III.K.1, Table 1, note N.

GASB states that LGIPs that are operated in a manner consistent with rule 2a-7 (i.e., a “2a-7-like pool”)
may use amortized cost to value securities (and presumably, facilitate maintaining a stable NAV per share).
See GASB, Statement No. 31, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Certain Investments and for
External Investment Pools (Mar. 1997).

Collector (Sept. 17, 2013) (“San Diego Treasurer Comment Letter”). Because we are unable to predict
how GASB will respond to our final amendments to rule 2a-7, we cannot quantify the extent to which
LGIP assets may migrate into alternative investments.

decouple LGIP regulation from rule 2a-7 and continue to operate at a stable value. 803 A few
commenters suggested that we make clear that the changes we are adopting to rule 2a-7 are not
intended to apply to LGIPs, 804 and also reiterated concerns similar to those raised by other
commenters on our floating NAV reform more generally (e.g., concerns about using marketbased valuation, rather than amortized cost). 805
We acknowledge, as noted by commenters, that there may be effects and costs imposed
on LGIPs as a result of the reforms we are adopting today. We expect it is likely that GASB will
reevaluate its accounting standards in light of the final amendments to rule 2a-7 that we are
adopting today and take action as it determines appropriate. 806 We do not, however, have
authority over the actions that GASB may or may not take, nor do we regulate LGIPs under rule
2a-7 or otherwise. In order for certain investors to continue to invest in LGIPs as they do today,
state legislatures may determine that they need to amend state statutes and policies to permit
investment in investment pools that adhere to rule 2a-7 as amended (unless GASB were to decouple LGIP accounting standards from rule 2a-7). GASB and state legislatures may address
these issues during the two-year compliance period for the fees and gates and floating NAV

policies may need to be amended, but did not provide us with information regarding how various
state legislatures and other market participants might react. Accordingly, we remain unable to
predict how various state legislatures and other market participants will react to our reforms, nor
do we have the information necessary to provide a reasonable estimate of the impact on LGIPs or
the potential effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. 808

Unregistered Money Market Funds Operating Under Rule 12d1-1

Several commenters expressed concern regarding amended rule 2a-7’s effect on
unregistered money market funds that choose to operate under certain provisions of rule 12d1-1
under the Investment Company Act. 809 Rule 12d1-1 permits investment companies (“acquiring
investment companies”) to acquire shares of registered money market funds in the same or in a
different fund group in excess of the limitations set forth in section 12(d)(1) of the Investment
Company Act. 810 In addition to providing an exemption from section 12(d)(1) of the Investment
Company Act, rule 12d1-1 also provides exemptions from section 17(a) and rule 17d-1, which

807

See infra section III.N.

808

As noted above, we do not have authority over the actions of GASB and/or its decision to facilitate the
operation of LGIPs as stable value investment vehicles through linkage to rule 2a-7 (including, as amended
today).

Letter”); Oppenheimer Comment Letter; UBS Comment Letter. See also Wells Fargo Comment Letter
(arguing that proposed amendments to Form PF should not apply to unregistered liquidity vehicles owned
exclusively by registered funds and complying with rule 12d1-1 under the Investment Company Act). We
address the Form PF requirements for unregistered money market funds below. See infra section III.H.

810

Under section 12(d)(1)(A), an investment company (and companies or funds it controls) is generally
prohibited from acquiring more than three percent of another investment company’s outstanding voting
securities, investing more than five percent of its total assets in any given investment company, and
investing more than 10 percent of its total assets in investment companies in the aggregate. See also
section 12(d)(1)(B) (limiting the sale of registered open-end fund shares to other funds).

262

restrict a fund’s ability to enter into transactions and joint arrangements with affiliated persons. 811
A fund’s investments in unregistered money market funds is not restricted by section 12(d)(1). 812
Nonetheless, these investments are subject to the affiliate transaction restrictions in section 17(a)
and rule 17d-1 and therefore require exemptive relief from such restrictions. 813 Rule 12d1-1 thus
permits a fund to invest in an unregistered money market fund without having to comply with the
affiliate transaction restrictions in section 17(a) and rule 17d-1, provided that the unregistered
money market fund satisfies certain conditions in rule 12d1-1.
Unregistered money market funds typically are organized by a fund adviser for the
purpose of managing the cash of other investment companies in a fund complex and operate in
almost all respects as a registered money market fund, except that their securities are privately

811

Section 17(a) generally prohibits affiliated persons of a registered fund (“first-tier affiliates”) or affiliated
persons of the fund’s affiliated persons (“second-tier affiliates”) from selling securities or other property to
the fund (or any company the fund controls). Section 17(d) of the Investment Company Act makes it
unlawful for first- and second-tier affiliates, the fund’s principal underwriters, and affiliated persons of the
fund’s principal underwriters, acting as principal, to effect any transaction in which the fund, or a company
it controls, is a joint or a joint and several participant in contravention of Commission rules. Rule 17d-1(a)
prohibits first- and second-tier affiliates of a registered fund, the fund’s principal underwriters, and
affiliated persons of the fund’s principal underwriter, acting as principal, from participating in or effecting
any transaction in connection with any joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan in
which the fund (or any company it controls) is a participant unless an application regarding the enterprise,
arrangement or plan has been filed with the Commission and has been granted.

812

Private funds are generally excluded from the definition of an “investment company” for purposes of the
Investment Company Act. However, private funds that fall under section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) are deemed to
be an investment company for purposes of the limitations set forth in section 12(d)(1)(A)(i) and
12(d)(1)(B)(i) governing the purchase or other acquisition by such private fund of any security issued by
any registered investment company and the sale of any securities issued by any registered investment
company to any such private fund. Although a private fund is subject to the limitations set forth in section
12(d) with respect to its investment in a registered investment company, a registered investment company
is not subject to the limitations set forth in section 12(d) with respect to its investment in any such private
fund.

offered and thus not registered under the Securities Act. 814 For purposes of investments in an
unregistered money market fund, the rule 12d1-1 exemption from the affiliate transaction
restrictions is available only for investments in an unregistered money market fund that operates
like a money market fund registered under the Investment Company Act. To be eligible, an
unregistered money market fund is required to (i) limit its investments to those in which a money
market fund may invest under rule 2a-7, and (ii) undertake to comply with all other provisions of
rule 2a-7. 815 Therefore, unless otherwise exempted, unregistered money market funds choosing
to operate under rule 12d1-1 would need to comply with the amendments to rule 2a-7 we are
adopting today.
Several commenters argued that unregistered money market funds that currently conform
their operations to the requirements of rule 12d1-1 should not be required to comply with certain
provisions of our amendments to rule 2a-7, particularly our floating NAV and liquidity fees and
gates amendments, 816 and no commenters argued otherwise. Some of these commenters argued
that the ability to invest in unregistered money market funds is a valuable tool for investment
companies, because such unregistered money market funds are designed to accommodate the
daily inflows and outflows of cash of the acquiring investment company, and can be operated at

814

Id.

815

Rule 12d1-1(d)(2)(ii). In addition, the unregistered money market fund’s adviser must be registered as an
investment adviser with the Commission. See rule 12d1-1(b)(2)(ii). In order for a registered fund to invest
in reliance on rule 12d1-1 in an unregistered money market fund that does not have a board of directors, the
unregistered money market fund’s investment adviser must perform the duties required of a money market
fund’s board of directors under rule 2a-7. See rule 12d1-1(d)(2)(ii)(B). Lastly, the investment company is
also required to reasonably believe that the unregistered money market fund operates like a registered
money market fund and that it complies with certain provisions of the Investment Company Act. See rule
12d1-1(b)(2)(i).

a lower cost than registered investment companies. 817 Some of these commenters also argued
that requiring unregistered money market funds to adopt a floating NAV would reduce the
attractiveness of unregistered money market funds and possibly eliminate the unregistered fund
as a cash management tool for an acquiring investment company. 818
Although we recognize the benefits of using unregistered money market funds for these
purposes, we do not believe that these types of funds are immune from the risks posed by money
market funds generally. Several commenters argued that unregistered money market funds
relying on rule 12d1-1 do not present the type of risk that our amendments are designed to
reduce. 819 These commenters also argued that, given that unregistered money market funds often
are created solely for investment by acquiring investment companies and typically have the same
sponsor, there is little concern of unforeseeable large-scale redemptions or runs on these funds. 820
We disagree, and we believe that if registered funds invest in unregistered money market
funds in a different fund complex, these unregistered funds are equally susceptible to the
concerns that our amendments are designed to address, including concerns about the risks of
investors’ incentives to redeem ahead of other investors in times of market stress and the
resulting potential dilution of investor shares. For example, if multiple registered funds are
investing in an unregistered money market fund in a different fund complex, a registered fund in
one fund complex may have an incentive to redeem shares in times of market stress prior to the
redemption of shares by funds in other fund complexes. This redemption could have a

potentially negative impact on the remaining registered funds that are investing in the
unregistered money market and could increase the risk of dilution of shares for the remaining
registered funds.
We also believe that unregistered money market funds that are being used solely as
investments by investment companies in the same fund complex remain susceptible to
redemptions in times of fund and market stress. For example, if multiple registered funds are
invested in an unregistered money market fund in the same fund complex, a portfolio manager of
one registered fund may have an incentive to redeem shares in times of market stress, which
could have a potentially negative impact on the other registered funds that may also be invested
in the unregistered fund. After further consideration regarding the comparability of risk in these
funds, we believe that it is appropriate that our floating NAV amendments apply to unregistered
money market funds that conform their operations to the requirements of rule 12d1-1. 821
Some commenters also argued that our liquidity fees and gates amendments are ill-suited
for unregistered money market funds. 822 Specifically, these commenters noted that under rule
12d1-1, the adviser typically performs the function of the unregistered fund’s board for purposes
of compliance with rule 2a-7. 823 Therefore, these commenters argued, if fees and gates are
implemented, the adviser would be called upon to make decisions about liquidity fees and gates,
which could present a potential conflict of interest in situations when an affiliated investment

821

We note that unregistered money market funds that otherwise meet the definition of a government money
market fund as defined in rule 2a-7(c)(2)(iii) would not be subject to the floating NAV requirement. See
rule 2a-7(a)(16).

company advised by the same adviser would be the redeeming shareholder. 824
We recognize that in many cases the adviser to an unregistered money market fund
typically performs the function of the fund’s board, 825 and that this may create conflicts of
interest. We continue to believe that, as discussed above in section III.A.2.b and given the role
of independent directors, a fund’s board is in the best position to determine whether a fee or gate
is in the best interests of the fund. However, when there is no board of directors, we believe that
it is appropriate for the adviser to the fund to determine when and how a fund will impose
liquidity fees and/or redemption gates. We have previously stated that, in order for a registered
fund to invest in reliance on rule 12d1-1 in an unregistered money market fund that does not
have a board of directors (because, for example, it is organized as a limited partnership), the
unregistered money market fund’s investment adviser must perform the duties required of a
money market fund’s board of directors under rule 2a-7. 826 In addition, we note that investment
advisers are subject to a fiduciary duty, which requires them, when faced with conflicts of
interest, to fully disclose to clients all material information, a duty that is intended “to eliminate,
or at least expose, all conflicts of interest which might include an investment adviser –
consciously or unconsciously – to render advice which was not disinterested.” 827 While we
cannot determine whether a conflict of interest exists in every case of an adviser advising both a
registered fund and unregistered money market fund under rule 12d1-1, we note that the adviser
is subject to the requirement to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably

Master/Feeder Funds – Fees and Gates Requirements

We are adopting, as suggested by a commenter, a provision specifying the treatment of
feeder funds in a master/feeder fund structure under the fees and gates requirements. 829 This
provision will not allow a feeder fund to independently impose a fee or gate in reliance on
today’s amendments. 830 However, under the amended rule, a feeder fund will be required to pass
through to its investors a fee or gate imposed by the master fund in which it invests. 831 In
response to our request for comment on whether particular funds or redemptions should not be
subject to fees and gates, a commenter recommended that we permit a master fund and its board,
but not a feeder fund and its board, to impose and set the terms of a fee or gate. 832 The feeder
fund would then have to “institute” the fee or gate on its redemptions “at the times and in the
amounts instituted by the master fund.” 833 Another commenter suggested, however, that fund
boards should be given discretion to impose fees and/or gates on either or both a master or feeder
fund(s). 834
828

See rule 206(4)-7 of the Advisers Act (making it unlawful for an investment adviser registered with the
Commission to provide investment advice unless the adviser has adopted and implemented written policies
and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the Advisers Act by the adviser or any of its
supervised persons).

268

We have considered the comments received and have been persuaded that a feeder fund
in a master/feeder structure should only be permitted to pass through the fees and gates imposed
by the master fund. 835 The master/feeder structure is unique in that the feeder fund serves as a
conduit to the master fund – the master fund being the fund that actually invests in money market
securities. As a commenter pointed out, “the master feeder structure comprises one pool of
assets, managed by the master fund’s investment adviser, under the oversight of the master
fund’s board of directors.” 836 Because the feeder fund’s investments consist of the master fund’s
securities, its liquidity is determined by the master fund’s liquidity. Accordingly, because a
feeder fund’s liquidity is dictated by the liquidity of the master fund, we believe the master fund
and its board are best suited, in consultation with the master fund’s adviser, to determine whether
liquidity is under stress and a fee or gate should be imposed. We note that we took a similar
approach with respect to master/feeder funds in rule 22e-3. 837
7.

Application of Fees and Gates to Other Types of Funds and Certain
Redemptions

We have determined that all money market funds, other than government money market
funds and feeder funds in a master/feeder fund structure, should be subject to the fees and gates
requirements. We received a number of comments suggesting types of funds that should not be

835

For example, if a master fund’s board determines that the master fund should impose a liquidity fee, a
feeder fund must pass through that liquidity fee to its investors and we would expect it would subsequently
remit such fee to the master fund.

836

See Stradley Ronon Comment Letter. We note that only the master fund has an investment adviser because
a master fund’s shares are the only investment securities that may be held by the feeder fund. See section
12(d)(1)(E).

837

See rule 22e-3(b).

269

subject to the fees and gates requirements. 838 In addition to the comments we received regarding
the application of fees and gates to the types of funds discussed above, commenters also
proposed other specific types of funds or entities that should not be subject to the fees and gates
requirements, including, for example, money market funds with assets of less than $25 billion
under management, 839 or securities lending cash collateral reinvestment pools. 840
Because of the board flexibility and discretion included in the fees and gates amendments
we are adopting today, as well as for the reasons discussed below, 841 we are requiring all funds,
other than government money market funds and feeder funds in a master/feeder structure (for the
reasons discussed above), 842 to comply with the fees and gates requirements. As noted above, the
fees and gates amendments do not require a fund to impose fees and gates if it is not in the fund’s
best interests. Thus, even if a particular type of fund is subject to the fees and gates provisions, it
does not have to impose fees and gates. Rather, a fund’s board may use fees and gates as tools to
limit heavy redemptions and must act in the best interests of the fund in determining whether
fees and gates should be imposed.

838

See, e.g., supra sections III.C.2 and III.C.3 (discussing commenter support for excluding retail and
municipal money market funds); but see, HSBC Comment Letter (“[W]e believe all MMFs should be
required to have the power to apply a liquidity fee or gate so that the MMF provider can manage a low
probability but high impact event.”); U.S. Bancorp Comment Letter.

839

See PFM Asset Mgmt. Comment Letter.

840

See State Street Comment Letter.

841

See also supra sections III.C.2-III.C.5 for a discussion of reasons specific to certain types of funds.

842

See supra sections III.C.1 and III.C.6. As discussed above with respect to feeder funds, we believe feeder
funds in a master/feeder structure are distinguishable from other funds in that their liquidity is dictated by
the liquidity of the master fund. Thus, we believe the flexibility and discretion afforded to boards in
today’s amendments should be limited to a master fund’s board. We note that although feeder funds may
not individually impose fees and gates in reliance on today’s amendments, master funds are subject to
today’s amendments and their imposition of fees and gates will be passed through to feeder funds’
investors.

270

In addition, we note that the fees and gates amendments will not affect a money market
fund’s investors unless the fund’s weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets – i.e., the
fund shows possible signs of heavy redemption pressure – and even then, it is up to the board to
determine whether or not such measures are in the best interests of the fund. Allowing specific
types of money market funds (other than government funds and feeder funds for the reasons
discussed above) to not be subject to the fees and gates requirements could leave funds and their
boards without adequate tools to protect shareholders in times of stress. Also, allowing funds not
to comply with the fees and gates requirements would merely relieve a fund during normal
market conditions of the costs and burdens created by the prospect that the fund could impose a
fee or gate if someday it was subject to heavy redemptions. 843 In considering these risks, costs,
and burdens, as well as the possibility of unprotected shareholders and broader contagion to the
short-term funding markets, we believe it is appropriate to subject all money market funds (other
than government funds and feeder funds for the reasons discussed above) to the fees and gates
requirements.
In addition to the reasons discussed above, we describe more fully below our rationale for
subjecting particular types of funds and redemptions to the fees and gates amendments.
a.

Small Redemptions and Irrevocable Redemptions

Some commenters suggested that small redemptions should not be subject to fees and

843

We noted in the Proposing Release that retail money market funds experienced fewer redemptions than
institutional money market funds during the financial crisis and thus may be less likely to suffer heavy
redemptions in the future. Nonetheless, we cannot predict if this will be the case if there is a future
financial crisis.

271

gates because they are less likely to materially impact the liquidity position of a fund. 844 As
discussed in the Proposing Release, we also have considered whether irrevocable redemption
requests (i.e. requests that cannot be rescinded) that are submitted at least a certain period in
advance should not be subject to fees and gates as the fund should be able to plan for such
liquidity demands and hold sufficient liquid assets. 845 We are concerned, however, that
shareholders could try to “game” the fees and gates requirements if we took such an approach
with respect to these redemptions, for example, by redeeming small amounts every day to fit
under a redemption size limit or by redeeming a certain irrevocable amount every week and then
reinvesting the redemption proceeds immediately if the cash is not needed. 846 We also remain
concerned that allowing certain redemptions to not be subject to fees and gates could add cost
and complexity to the fees and gates requirements both as an operational matter (e.g., fund
groups would need to be able to separately track which shares are subject to a fee or gate and
which are not, and create the system and policies to do so) and in terms of ease of shareholder
understanding without providing substantial benefits. 847
b.

ERISA and Other Tax-Exempt Plans

Many commenters raised concerns regarding the application of fees and gates to funds
offered in Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) and/or other tax-exempt
844

See, e.g., Fin. Info. Forum Comment Letter.

845

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at 200-201.

846

See supra note 315 and accompanying text. Commenters suggested that concerns over gaming could be
addressed by putting additional policies in place, such as placing limits on the number of redemptions in
any given period. See, e.g., Fin. Info. Forum Comment Letter. We believe that such a solution to gaming,
much like an exception to the fees and gates requirements, would create additional cost and complexity to
the amendments without substantial benefit.

847

See supra note 315 and accompanying text.

272

plans. 848 Some commenters expressed concern that fees and gates would create issues for these
plans. 849 For example, commenters were worried about potential violations of certain minimum
required distribution rules that could be impeded by the imposition of a gate, 850 potential taxation
as a result of an inability to process certain mandatory refunds on a timely basis, 851 problems
arising in plan conversions or rollovers in the event of a fee or gate, 852 possible conflicts with the
Department of Labor’s (“DOL”) qualified default investment (“QDIA”) rules, 853 and certain
general fiduciary requirements on plan fiduciaries with respect to adequate liquidity in their
plan. 854
As an initial point, we note that money market funds are currently permitted to use a
redemption gate and liquidate under rule 22e-3, and they still continue to be offered as
investment options under tax-qualified plans. However, in light of the commenters’ concerns,
we have consulted the DOL’s Employee Benefits Security Administration (“EBSA”) regarding
potential issues under ERISA. With respect to general fiduciary requirements on plan fiduciaries
obligating them to prudently manage the anticipated liquidity needs of their plan, EBSA staff

advised our staff that a money market fund’s liquidity and its potential for redemption
restrictions is just one of many factors a plan fiduciary would consider in evaluating the role that
a money market fund would play in assuring adequate liquidity in a plan’s investment portfolio.
Additionally, we believe that certain other potential concerns presented by commenters,
such as concerns regarding QDIAs and the imposition of a fee or gate within 90 days of a
participant’s first investment, are unlikely to materialize. We understand that the imposition of a
liquidity fee or gate would have to relate to a liquidation or transfer request within this 90-day
period in order to create an issue with QDIA fiduciary relief. Even if this occurred with respect
to a specific participant, steps may be taken to avoid concerns with the QDIA. We understand,
for instance, that a liquidity fee otherwise assessed to the account of a plan participant or
beneficiary could be paid by the plan sponsor or a service provider, and not by the participant,
beneficiary or plan. 855 In addition, a plan sponsor or other party in interest could loan funds to
the plan for the payment of ordinary operating expenses of the plan or for a purpose incidental to
the ordinary operation of the plan to avoid the effects of a gate. 856 We understand that if
necessary, other steps may also exist.
DOL staff has also advised the SEC that the “substantial restrictions” requirement,
contained in Prohibited Transaction Exemptions 2004-16 857 and 2006-06 858, does not apply to

money market funds. 859 DOL staff further indicated to us, however, that a liquidity fee could
raise issues under the conditions of these prohibited transaction exemptions that require that the
IRA owner be able to transfer funds to another investment or another IRA “within a reasonable
period of time after his or her request and without penalty to the principal amount of the
investment.” 860 We understand that while a gate of no longer than 10 business days would not
amount to an unreasonable period of time under the conditions, DOL staff has advised us that, in
order for a fiduciary to continue to rely on the exemptions for the prohibited transactions arising
from the initial decision to roll over amounts to a money market fund that is sponsored by or
affiliated with the fiduciary, additional steps would need to be taken to protect the principal
amount rolled over in the event that a liquidity fee is imposed. We understand that examples of
such additional steps would include a contractual commitment by the fiduciary or its affiliate to
pay any liquidity fee otherwise assessed to the IRA, to the extent such fee would be deducted
from the principal amount rolled over. Additionally, to the extent plan fiduciaries do not wish to
take such steps, they can instead select government money market funds, which are not subject
to the fees and gates amendments, or other funds that do not create prohibited transactions issues.
Staff at EBSA have communicated that they will work with staff at the SEC to provide
additional guidance as needed.
With respect to the minimum distribution requirement and the ability to process certain
mandatory distributions or refunds on a timely basis, we understand that although gates can
hypothetically prevent required distributions or refunds, in practice it will be unlikely to occur as

participants are unlikely to have their entire account invested in prime money market funds or,
more precisely, one or more prime money market funds that determine to impose a gate at the
same time. 861 In addition, to the extent a gate does prevent a timely minimum distribution or
refund, we understand that there are potential steps an individual or plan/IRA can take to avoid
the negative consequences that may result from failure to meet the minimum distribution or
refund requirements. For example, with respect to the minimum distribution requirement, an
individual who fails to meet this requirement as a result of a gate is entitled to request a waiver
with respect to potential excise taxes by filing a form with the IRS that explains the rationale for
the waiver. 862 In addition, with respect to plan qualification issues that may arise in the event a
plan does not make timely minimum required distributions or refunds as a result of a gate, we
understand that a plan sponsor may obtain relief pursuant to the Employee Plans Compliance
Resolution System (“EPCRS”). 863

Insurance Funds

variable annuity contracts or other insurance products, citing contractual and state law
restrictions affecting insurance and annuity products that would conflict with the ability of a

In addition, with respect to the minimum distribution requirement, we note that participants could be
encouraged to take required distributions before the deadline to avoid the possibility that a gate could
prevent them from meeting the requirements.

See section 4974(d) of the Tax Code. We understand that to request a waiver, a taxpayer would file Form
5329 with the IRS. Whether to grant a waiver request is within the IRS’s discretion.

See Rev. Proc. 2013-12. We understand that, pursuant to the EPCRS, if a minimum required distribution or
refund timing failure is insignificant or is corrected within a limited time period, and certain other
requirements are satisfied, then the failure can be voluntarily corrected without filing with the IRS.
Otherwise, we understand that a filing is required to correct qualification failures.

money market fund’s board to impose a fee or gate. 864 Some commenters further noted that
money market funds underlying variable contract separate accounts are not prone to runs. 865
Another commenter noted that most insurance products have “free-look” provisions, allowing an
owner to return his/her contract for full value if he/she is not satisfied with its terms. 866 During
such initial periods, insurance companies typically keep client funds in money market funds,
which might be incompatible with fees and gates. 867
We have determined not to provide special treatment for money market funds underlying
variable annuity contracts or other insurance products for the fees and gates requirements. We
recognize money market funds underlying variable annuity contracts or other insurance products
may be indirectly subject to certain restrictions or requirements that do not apply to other money
market funds. We note, however, that these same funds currently are permitted to suspend
redemptions pursuant to rule 22e-3 and their ability to do so has not prevented them from being
offered in connection with variable annuity and other insurance products. In addition, to the
extent today’s fees and gates amendments are incompatible with contractual or state law, or with
free look provisions, we note that an insurance company can instead offer a government money
market fund as an investment option under its contract(s). 868 Moreover, fees and gates will not

during times of potential stress. 869 If the market or a money market fund is experiencing stress, an
insurance company could choose not to place contract holders’ investments into a money market
fund during free look periods, subject to contractual provisions and prospectus disclosures.
D.

Guidance on the Amortized Cost Method of Valuation and Other Valuation
Concerns

After further consideration, and as suggested by a number of commenters, our final rules
will permit stable NAV money market funds (i.e., government and retail money market funds) to
maintain a stable NAV by using amortized cost valuation and/or the penny rounding method of
pricing. 870 In addition, all other registered investment companies and business development
companies (including floating NAV money market funds under our amendments) may, in
accordance with Commission guidance, continue to use amortized cost to value debt securities
with remaining maturities of 60 days or less if fund directors, in good faith, determine that the
fair value of the debt securities is their amortized cost value, unless the particular circumstances
warrant otherwise. 871 Accordingly, even for floating NAV money market funds, amortized cost

application under section 26(c).
869

We note that if, as suggested by commenters, money market funds underlying variable annuity or other
insurance contracts are less prone to runs, then under the terms of our final rule amendments, such funds
may be less likely to reach the liquidity thresholds that would trigger board consideration of fees or gates
and, thus, may be less likely to be affected by today’s amendments. See supra text accompanying note
865.

870

See supra section III.B.5.

871

See ASR 219, Financial Reporting Codification (CCH) section 404.05.a and .b (May 31, 1977), supra note
5. In this regard, the Commission has stated that the “fair value of securities with remaining maturities of
60 days or less may not always be accurately reflected through the use of amortized cost valuation, due to
an impairment of the creditworthiness of an issuer, or other factors. In such situations, it would appear to
be incumbent on the directors of a fund to recognize such factors and take them into account in determining
‘fair value.’”

278

will continue to be an important part of the valuation of money market fund portfolio
securities. 872
We believe the expanded valuation guidance, discussed below, will help advance the
goals of our money market fund reform rulemaking, because, among other things, stronger
valuation practices may lessen a money market fund’s susceptibility to heavy redemptions by
decreasing the likelihood of sudden portfolio write-downs that may encourage financially
sophisticated investors to redeem early. We provide below expanded guidance on the use of
amortized cost valuation as well as other related valuation issues. 873
1.

Use of Amortized Cost Valuation

We consider it important, for a number of reasons, that funds and their investment
advisers and boards of directors have clear guidance regarding amortized cost valuation.
Typically, money market funds hold a significant portion of portfolio securities with remaining
872

For a mutual fund not regulated under rule 2a-7, the Investment Company Act and applicable rules
generally require that it price its shares at the current NAV by valuing portfolio securities for which market
quotations are readily available at market value, or if market quotations are not readily available, at fair
value as determined in good faith by the fund’s board of directors. See section 2(a)(41)(B) and rules 2a-4
and 22c-1. Notwithstanding these provisions, rule 2a-7 currently permits money market funds to use the
amortized cost method of valuation and/or the penny rounding method of pricing. See current rule 2a-7(c).

873

Although discussed here primarily in the context of money market funds, except as noted below, this
guidance is applicable to all registered investment companies and business development companies. For
ease of reference, throughout this section we refer to all of these entities as “funds.” We note that stable
NAV money market funds that qualify as retail or government money market funds may use the amortized
cost method of valuation to compute the current share price provided, among other things, the board of
directors believes that the amortized cost method of valuation fairly reflects the market-based NAV and
does not believe that such valuation may result in material dilution or other unfair results to investors or
existing shareholders. See generally rule 2a-7(c)(1)(i) and rule 2a-7(g)(1)(i)(A)-(C). We also note that
stable NAV money market funds that qualify as retail or government money market funds may not rely on
this guidance to use amortized cost valuation in shadow pricing because rule 2a-7 specifically requires
shadow prices to reflect “the current net asset value per share calculated using available market quotations
(or an appropriate substitute that reflects current market conditions),” and we would not consider amortized
cost valuation to be an appropriate substitute that reflects current market conditions. See also 1983
Adopting Release, supra note 3, at n.44 and accompanying text (“In determining the market-based value of
the portfolio for purposes of computing the amount of deviation, all portfolio instruments, regardless of the
time to maturity, should be valued based upon market factors and not their amortized cost value.”).

279

maturities of 60 days or less, 874 and therefore, a floating NAV money market fund may use the
amortized cost method to value these portfolio securities if the fund’s board determines that the
amortized cost value of the security is fair value. In addition, managers of floating NAV money
market funds may have an incentive to use amortized cost valuation whenever possible in order
to help stabilize the funds’ NAV per share.
As noted above, under existing Commission guidance, funds would not be able to use
amortized cost valuation to value certain debt securities when circumstances dictate that the
amortized cost value of the security is not fair value. 875 The Commission’s guidance in the
Proposing Release construed the statute to effectively limit the use of amortized cost valuation to
circumstances where it is the same as valuation using market-based factors. 876 Some commenters
objected to this interpretation and suggested that the Commission more generally clarify this
guidance. 877

874

For example, we estimate that approximately 56% of prime money market funds’ portfolio securities had
remaining maturities of 60 days or less (not including interest-rate resets) as of February 28, 2014. This
estimate is based on Form N-MFP data.

875

See ASR 219, Financial Reporting Codification (CCH) section 404.05.a and .b (May 31, 1977), supra note
5 (“Although debt securities with remaining maturities in excess of 60 days should not be valued at
amortized cost, the Commission will not object if the board of directors of a money market fund, in good
faith, determines that the fair value of debt securities originally purchased with remaining maturities of 60
days or less shall be their amortized cost value, unless the particular circumstances dictate otherwise. Nor
will the Commission object if, under similar circumstances, the fair value of debt securities originally
purchased with maturities of in excess of 60 days, but which currently have maturities of 60 days or less, is
determined by using amortized cost valuation for the 60 days prior to maturity, such amortization being
based upon the market or fair value of the securities on the 61st day prior to maturity” (footnotes omitted)).

876

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, n.136.

877

See, e.g., Invesco Comment Letter (“one of the footnotes to the Proposed Rule…refers to amortized cost
pricing being available when it is the same as valuation based on market factors, implying that MMF could
be barred from using amortized cost pricing if it differs even minutely from the market value of the
securities. While we believe this implication to have been unintentional, we nevertheless request the
Commission to reaffirm clearly that MMFs, as all other mutual funds, can continue to use amortized cost
pricing for securities with maturities of 60 days and less.” (internal citations omitted)); ICI Comment Letter
(also referring to this footnote and stating “It is unclear whether this means that amortized cost must at all

280

We recognize that existing valuation guidance may not be clear on how frequently funds
should compare a debt security’s amortized cost value to its fair value determined using marketbased factors and what extent of deviation between the two values is permissible. We generally
believe that a fund may only use the amortized cost method to value a portfolio security with a
remaining maturity of 60 days or less when it can reasonably conclude, at each time it makes a
valuation determination, 878 that the amortized cost value of the portfolio security is
approximately the same as the fair value of the security as determined without the use of
amortized cost valuation. Existing credit, liquidity, or interest rate conditions in the relevant
markets and issuer specific circumstances at each such time should be taken into account in
making such an evaluation.
Accordingly, it would not be appropriate for a fund to use amortized cost to value a debt
security with a remaining maturity of 60 days or less and thereafter not continue to review
whether amortized cost continues to be approximately fair value until, for example, there is a
significant change in interest rates or credit deterioration. We generally believe that a fund
should, at each time it makes a valuation determination, evaluate the use of amortized cost for
portfolio securities, not only quarterly or each time the fund produces financial statements. We
note that, under the final rules, each money market fund will be required to value, on a daily
basis, the fund’s portfolio securities using market-based factors and disclose the fund’s share
price (or shadow price) rounded to four decimal places on the fund’s website. As a result, we
times be identical to market-based price, or whether it is just another way of saying funds must use marketbased pricing and not amortized cost. We urge the SEC to clarify that ASR 219 and its interpretations
remain unchanged.”).
878

As discussed below, we believe that, in some circumstances (e.g., intraday), a fund may rely on the last
obtained market-based data to assist it when valuing its portfolio securities using amortized cost.

281

believe that each money market fund should have readily available market-based data to assist it
in monitoring any potential deviation between a security’s amortized cost and fair value
determined using market-based factors. We believe that, in certain circumstances, such as
intraday, a fund may rely on the last obtained market-based data to assist it when valuing its
portfolio securities using amortized cost. To address this, a fund’s policies and procedures could
be designed to ensure that the fund’s adviser is actively monitoring both market and issuerspecific developments that may indicate that the market-based fair value of a portfolio security
has changed during the day, and therefore indicate that the use of amortized cost valuation for
that security may no longer be appropriate.
2.

Other Valuation Matters

Rule 2a-4 under the Investment Company Act provides that “[p]ortfolio securities with
respect to which market quotations are readily available shall be valued at current market value,
and other securities and assets shall be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the
board of directors of the registered company.” As we discussed in the Proposing Release, the
vast majority of money market fund portfolio securities do not have readily available market
quotations because most portfolio securities such as commercial paper, repos, and certificates of
deposit are not actively traded in the secondary markets. 879 Accordingly, most money market
fund portfolio securities are valued largely based upon “mark-to-model” or “matrix pricing”
estimates. 880 In matrix pricing, portfolio asset values are derived from a range of different

879

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at section II.B.1.

880

See, e.g., Harvard Business School FSOC Comment Letter (“secondary markets for commercial paper and
other private money market assets such as CDs are highly illiquid. Therefore, the asset prices used to
calculate the floating NAV would largely be accounting or model-based estimates, rather than prices based

282

inputs, with varying weights attached to each input, such as pricing of new issues, yield curve
information, spread information, and yields or prices of securities of comparable quality, coupon,
maturity, and type. 881 Money market funds also may consider evaluated prices from third-party
pricing services, which may take into account these inputs as well as prices quoted from dealers
that make markets in these instruments and financial models. 882
We received a number of comments regarding the utility of market-based valuation for
money market securities and other securities that do not frequently trade in secondary markets.
We also received comments discussing certain other valuation matters more generally, such as
the use of pricing services in valuing such securities. Together, these comments indicated to us
the need for further guidance in this area, which we provide below.
a. Fair Value for Thinly Traded Securities
First, some commenters suggested that market-based valuations of money market fund
portfolio securities are not particularly meaningful, given the infrequent trading in money market
fund portfolio securities and the use of matrix or model-based pricing or evaluated prices from
third-party pricing services. 883 One commenter stated that “it does not follow that the normal
arguments for using actual market prices for calculating mutual fund NAVs apply to using noisy
on secondary market transactions with sizable volumes.”); Institutional Money Market Funds Association,
The Use of Amortised Cost Accounting by Money Market Funds, available at
http://www.immfa.org/assets/files/IMMFA%20The%20use%20of%20amortised%20cost%20accounting%
20by%20MMF.pdf (noting that investors typically hold money market instruments to maturity and
therefore there are relatively few prices from the secondary market or broker quotes).
881

See, e.g., Federated VI Comment Letter; Hai Jin, et al., Liquidity Risk and Expected Corporate Bond
Returns, 99 J. OF FIN. ECON. 628, at n.4 (2011) (“Matrix prices are set according to some algorithm based
on prices of bonds with similar characteristics”).

Comment Letter.

283

guesstimates of true value of non-traded assets.” 884 Another commenter stated that, with regard
to matrix-priced money market fund portfolio securities, “[m]arket-based valuations are not more
accurate valuations than amortized cost.” 885
We acknowledge that matrix pricing and similar pricing methods involve estimates and
judgments—and thus may introduce some “noise” into portfolio security prices, and therefore
into the fund’s NAV per share when rounded to one basis point. However, we do not agree that
market-based prices of portfolio securities do not provide meaningful information or that
amortized cost generally provides better or more accurate values of securities that do not
frequently trade or that may or may not be held to maturity given the fund’s statutory obligation
to investors to satisfy redemptions within seven days (and a fund’s disclosure commitment to
generally satisfy redemptions much sooner). 886 Indeed, many debt securities held by other types
of funds do not frequently trade, but our long-standing guidance on the use of amortized cost
valuation is limited to debt securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less and even then
only if the amortized cost value of these securities is fair value. 887 This guidance was based on

884

See Angel Comment Letter.

885

See Federated VI Comment Letter (“Pricing experts have confirmed to us that only a small percentage of
money market instruments actually trade daily in secondary markets. While the amortized cost method of
valuing MMF portfolios is a simple and accurate means of valuing these types of high-quality, short-term
instruments that generally are held to maturity, the effort to arrive at market-based valuations for these
types of instruments is time-consuming, complicated and less exact.”).

886

Many money market funds promise in fund disclosures to satisfy redemption requests on the same day as
the request, except in extraordinary conditions. In addition, funds that are sold through broker-dealers seek
to satisfy redemption requests within three business days because broker-dealers are subject to Securities
Exchange Act rule 15c6-1, which establishes three business days as the standard settlement period for
securities trades effected by a broker or a dealer.

887

See ASR 219, Financial Reporting Codification (CCH) section 404.05.a and .b (May 31, 1977), supra note
5. We have said that it is inconsistent with rule 2a-4 to use the amortized cost method of valuation to
determine the fair value of debt securities that mature at a date more than 60 days after the valuation date.

284

our concern that “the use of the amortized cost method i[n] valuing portfolio securities of
registered investment companies may result in overvaluation or undervaluation of the portfolios
of such companies, relative to the value of the portfolios determined with reference to current
market-based factors.” 888 Such guidance is based on a preference embodied in the Investment
Company Act that funds value portfolio securities taking into account current market
information. 889
Because most money market fund portfolio securities are not frequently traded and thus
are not securities for which market quotations are readily available, we understand that they are
typically fair valued in good faith by the fund’s board. 890 As a general principle, the fair value of
a security is the amount that a fund might reasonably expect to receive for the security upon its
current sale. 891 Determining fair value requires taking into account market conditions existing at
that time. Accordingly, funds holding debt securities generally should not fair value these

888

889

Section 22(c) and rules 2a-4 and 22c-1(a).

890

As discussed further below, although a fund’s directors cannot delegate their statutory duty to determine
the fair value of fund portfolio securities, the board may appoint others, such as the fund’s investment
adviser or a valuation committee, to assist them in determining fair value. See infra note 898 and
accompanying text.

891

See Securities and Exchange Commission Codification of Financial Reporting Policies, Statement
Regarding “Restricted Securities,” Investment Company Act Release No. 5847 (Oct. 21, 1969) [35 FR
19989 (Dec. 31, 1970)] (“ASR 113”); Investment Companies, Investment Company Act Release No. 6295
(Dec. 23, 1970) [35 FR 19986 (Dec. 31, 1970)], Financial Reporting Codification (CCH) section 404.03
(Apr. 15, 1982) (“ASR 118”). We generally believe that the current sale standard appropriately reflects the
fair value of securities and other assets for which market quotations are not readily available within the
meaning of section 2(a)(41)(B). The price that an unrelated willing buyer would pay for a security or other
asset under current market conditions is indicative of the value of the security or asset. See also FASB
ASC paragraph 820-10-35-3 and FASB ASC paragraph 820-10-20 (“A fair value measurement assumes
that the asset or liability is exchanged in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell the asset
or transfer the liability at the measurement date under current market conditions.”; Fair Value means “the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date”).

285

securities at par or amortized cost based on the expectation that the funds will hold those
securities until maturity, if the funds could not reasonably expect to receive approximately that
value upon the current sale of those securities under current market conditions. 892 We recognize
that valuing thinly traded debt securities can be more complicated and time-consuming than
valuing liquid equity securities based on readily available market quotations or than valuing debt
securities using the amortized cost method. However, given the redeemable nature of mutual
fund shares and the mandates of the Investment Company Act to sell and redeem fund shares at
prices based on the current net asset values of those shares, we believe it is important for funds to
take steps to ensure that they are properly valuing fund shares and treating all shareholders fairly.
b. Use of Pricing Services
As noted above, many funds, including many money market funds, use evaluated prices
provided by third-party pricing services to assist them in determining the fair values of their
portfolio securities. Some commenters have raised concerns that money market funds will place
undue reliance on a small market of third-party pricing vendors, even though they acknowledge
that they provide only “good faith” opinions on valuation. 893 A few commenters argued that
eliminating amortized cost valuation for money market funds and requiring market-based pricing
could provide third-party pricing services with a much greater degree of influence on fund’s
892

As we have previously stated: “Fair value cannot be based on what a buyer might pay at some later time,
such as when the market ultimately recognizes the security’s true value as currently perceived by the
portfolio manager. Funds also may not fair value portfolio securities at prices not achievable on a current
basis on the belief that the fund would not currently need to sell those securities.” See, e.g., In the Matter
of Jon D. Hammes, et al., Investment Company Act Release No. 26290 (Dec. 11, 2003) at n.5 (settlement).
See also FASB ASC 820, at paragraph 820-10-35-54H (“A reporting entity’s intention to hold the asset or
to settle or otherwise fulfill the liability is not relevant when measuring fair value because fair value is a
market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement.”).

893

286

portfolio valuation, which could increase operational complexity and risks. 894
We recognize that pricing services employ a wide variety of pricing methodologies in
arriving at the evaluated prices they provide, and the quality of those prices may vary widely.
We note that the evaluated prices provided by pricing services are not, by themselves, “readily
available” market quotations or fair values “as determined in good faith by the board of
directors” as required under the Investment Company Act. 895 To the extent that certain money
market funds are no longer permitted to use the amortized cost method to value all of their
portfolio securities and all money market funds will be required to perform daily market-based
valuations, funds may decide to rely more heavily on third parties, such as pricing services, to
provide market-based valuation data. Accordingly, we believe it is important to provide
guidance to funds and their boards regarding reliance on pricing services.
We note that a fund’s board of directors has a non-delegable responsibility to determine
whether an evaluated price provided by a pricing service, or some other price, constitutes a fair
value for a fund’s portfolio security. 896 In addition, we have stated that “it is incumbent upon the
[fund’s] Board of Directors to satisfy themselves that all appropriate factors relevant to the value
of securities for which market quotations are not readily available have been considered,” and

894

See, e.g., Federated VI Comment Letter; Chamber II Comment Letter.

895

See section 2(a)(41)(B) and rule 2a-4.

896

See ASR 118, supra note 891 (“[i]t is incumbent upon the Board of Directors to satisfy themselves that all
appropriate factors relevant to the fair value of securities for which market quotations are not readily
available have been considered and to determine the method of arriving at the fair value of each such
security.” A fund’s directors cannot delegate this responsibility to anyone else). See, e.g., In the Matter of
Seaboard Associates, Inc. (Report of Investigation Pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Exchange Act),
Investment Company Act Release No. 13890 (Apr. 16, 1984) (“The Commission wishes to emphasize that
the directors of a registered investment company may not delegate to others the ultimate responsibility of
determining the fair value of any asset not having a readily ascertainable market value . . . .”).

287

that fund directors “must . . . continuously review the appropriateness of the method used in
valuing each issue of security in the [fund’s] portfolio.” 897 Although a fund’s directors cannot
delegate their statutory duty to determine the fair value of fund portfolio securities for which
market quotations are not readily available, the board may appoint others, such as the fund’s
investment adviser or a valuation committee, to assist them in determining fair value, and to
make the actual calculations pursuant to the fair valuation methodologies previously approved by
the directors. 898
Before deciding to use evaluated prices from a pricing service to assist it in determining
the fair values of a fund’s portfolio securities, the fund’s board of directors may want to consider
the inputs, methods, models, and assumptions used by the pricing service to determine its
evaluated prices, and how those inputs, methods, models, and assumptions are affected (if at all)
as market conditions change. In choosing a particular pricing service, a fund’s board may want
to assess, among other things, the quality of the evaluated prices provided by the service and the
extent to which the service determines its evaluated prices as close as possible to the time as of
which the fund calculates its net asset value. In addition, the fund’s board should generally
consider the appropriateness of using evaluated prices provided by pricing services as the fair
values of the fund’s portfolio securities where, for example, the fund’s board of directors does
not have a good faith basis for believing that the pricing service’s pricing methodologies produce
evaluated prices that reflect what the fund could reasonably expect to obtain for the securities in

Amendments to Disclosure Requirements

We are amending a number of disclosure requirements related to the liquidity fees and
gates and floating NAV requirements adopted today, as well as other disclosure enhancements
discussed in the proposal. These disclosure amendments improve transparency related to money
market funds’ operations, as well as their overall risk profile and any use of affiliate financial
support. In the sections that follow, we first discuss amendments to rule and form provisions
applicable to various disclosure documents, including disclosures in money market funds’
advertisements, the summary section of the prospectus, and the statement of additional
information (“SAI”). 900 Next, we discuss amendments to the disclosure requirements applicable
to money market fund websites, including information about money market funds’ liquidity
levels, shareholder flows, market-based NAV per share (rounded to four decimal places),
imposition of liquidity fees and gates, and any use of affiliate sponsor support.

Required Disclosure Statement
a.

Overview of Disclosure Statement Requirements

As discussed in the Proposing Release, and as modified to reflect commenters’ concerns,
899

See ASR 113 and ASR 118, supra note 891; see also 1983 Adopting Release supra note 3 (“If the [money
market] fund uses an outside service to provide this type of pricing for its portfolio instruments, it may not
delegate to the provider of the service the ultimate responsibility to check the accuracy of the system.”).

900

In keeping with the enhanced disclosure framework we adopted in 2009, the amendments are intended to
provide a layered approach to disclosure in which key information about the new features of money market
funds would be provided in the summary section of the statutory prospectus (and, accordingly, in any
summary prospectus, if used) with more detailed information provided elsewhere in the statutory
prospectus and in the SAI. See Enhanced Disclosure and New Prospectus Delivery Option for Registered
Open-End Management Investment Companies, Investment Company Act Release No. 28584 (Jan. 13,
2009) [74 FR 4546 (Jan. 26, 2009)] (“Summary Prospectus Adopting Release”) at paragraph preceding
section III (adopting rules permitting the use of a summary prospectus, which is designed to provide key
information that is important to an informed investment decision).

289

we are adopting amendments to rule 482 under the Securities Act and Item 4 of Form N-1A to
revise the disclosure statement requirements concerning the risks of investing in a money market
fund in its advertisements or other sales materials that it disseminates (including on the fund
website) and in the summary section of its prospectus (and, accordingly, in any summary
prospectus, if used).
Money market funds are currently required to include a specific statement concerning the
risks of investing in their advertisements or other sales materials and in the summary section of
the fund’s prospectus (and, accordingly, in any summary prospectus, if used). 901 In the
Proposing Release, we proposed to modify the format and content of this required disclosure.
Specifically, we proposed to require money market funds to present certain disclosure statements
in a bulleted format. The content of the proposed disclosure statements would have differed
under each of the proposed reform alternatives. Under each reform alternative, the proposed
statement would have included identical wording changes designed to clarify, and inform
investors about, the primary risks of investing in money market funds generally, including new
disclosure emphasizing that money market fund sponsors are not obligated to provide financial
support. Additionally, the proposed statement under the fees and gates alternative would have
included disclosure that would call attention to the risks of investing in a money market fund that
could impose liquidity fees or gates, and the proposed statement under the floating NAV
alternative would have included disclosure to emphasize the particular risks of investing in a

901

Rule 482(b)(4); Item 4(b)(1)(ii) of Form N-1A. Money market funds are currently required to include the
following statement: An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of
your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the Fund.

290

floating NAV money market fund.
Comments regarding the amended disclosure statement were mixed. Two commenters
generally supported the proposed amendments to the disclosure statement under both
alternatives, and one commenter expressed general support for the proposed disclosure under the
fees and gates alternative. 902 Two commenters generally opposed the proposed disclosure
statement, arguing that it would overstate the risks relative to other mutual funds and overwhelm
investors with standardized mandated legends, which investors might ignore as “boilerplate.” 903
Some commenters expressed concerns with particular aspects of the proposed disclosure, such as
the required disclosure regarding sponsor support. 904 These comments are discussed in more
detail below.
Today we are adopting amendments to the requirements for disclosure statements that
must appear in money market funds’ advertisements or other sales materials, and in the summary
section of money market funds’ statutory prospectus. As discussed in more detail below, these
amendments are being adopted largely as proposed, but with some modifications to the proposed
format and content. These modifications respond to comments we received and also reflect that
we are adopting a liquidity fees and gates requirement for all non-government money market
funds, including municipal money market funds, as well as a floating NAV requirement for
902

See CFA Institute Comment Letter (noting that the proposed disclosures would put investors on notice that
money market funds are not riskless and would provide the information in a clear and succinct manner);

the prospectus’s risk warnings and to make clear fees and gates would be used to protect investors);

Market Funds and Current Requirements of Rule 2a-7) (Sept. 17, 2013) (“Federated VIII Comment
Letter”) (concurring with the risk disclosure under the fees and gates alternative).

291

institutional prime funds. As we stated in the Proposing Release, we are modifying the current
disclosure requirements because we believe that enhancing the disclosure required to be included
in fund advertisements and other sales materials, and in the summary section of the prospectus,
will help change the investment expectations of money market fund investors, including any
erroneous expectation that a money market fund is a riskless investment. 905 In addition, without
such modifications, we believe that investors may not be fully aware of potential restrictions on
fund redemptions or, for floating NAV funds, the fact that the value of their money market fund
shares will, as a result of these reforms, increase and decrease as a result of the changes in the
value of the underlying securities. 906
Specifically, we are requiring money market funds that maintain a stable NAV to include
the following disclosure statement in their advertisements or other sales materials and in the
summary section of the statutory prospectus:
You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to
preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so.
The Fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend
your ability to sell shares if the Fund’s liquidity falls below required minimums because
of market conditions or other factors. 907 An investment in the Fund is not insured or
guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government
agency. The Fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the
Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the

907

Government funds that are not subject to the fees and gates requirements pursuant to rule 2a-7(c)(2)(iii)
may omit the following sentence: “The Fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may
temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund’s liquidity falls below required minimums
because of market conditions or other factors.” See rule 482(b)(4)(iii); Form N-1A Item 4(b)(1)(ii)(C).

292

Fund at any time. 908
Funds with a floating NAV will also be required to include a similar disclosure statement
in their advertisements or other sales materials and in the summary section of the statutory
prospectus, modified to account for the characteristics of a floating NAV, as follows:
You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Because the share price of the
Fund will fluctuate, when you sell your shares they may be worth more or less than what
you originally paid for them. The Fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or
may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund’s liquidity falls below
required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the
Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any
other government agency. The Fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide
financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide

908

See Rule 482(b)(4)(ii); Form N-1A Item 4(b)(1)(ii)(B). Besides the amendments to the disclosure
statement requirements set forth in Rule 482(b)(4)(ii) and Form N-1A Item 4(b)(1)(ii)(B), we also are
adopting non-substantive changes to the text of these rule and form provisions. If an affiliated person,
promoter, or principal underwriter of the fund, or an affiliated person of such person, has contractually
committed to provide financial support to the fund, the fund would be permitted to omit the last sentence
from the disclosure statement in advertisements and sales materials for the term of the agreement. See Note
to paragraph (b)(4), rule 482(b)(4). Likewise, if an affiliated person, promoter, or principal underwriter of
the fund, or an affiliated person of such person, has contractually committed to provide financial support to
the fund, and the term of the agreement will extend for at least one year following the effective date of the
fund’s registration statement, the fund would be permitted to omit the last sentence from the disclosure
statement that appears in the fund’s registration statement. See Instruction to Item 4(b)(1)(ii) of Form
N-1A.
The proposal likewise would have permitted a similar omission from the proposed disclosure statement.
See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at nn.429 and 431. As proposed, such omission would have been
permitted if “an affiliated person, promoter, or principal underwriter of the fund, or an affiliated person of
such person, has entered into an agreement to provide financial support to the fund.” We have modified the
language of the Note to paragraph (b)(4), rule 482(b)(4) and the Instruction to Item 4(b)(1)(ii) of Form
N-1A to clarify that the omission would be permitted only in the case of contractual commitments to
provide financial support, and not in the case of informal agreements that may not be enforceable.
As discussed in more detail below, we are adopting amendments that would require money market funds to
disclose current and historical instances of affiliate financial support on Form N-CR and Form N-1A,
respectively. See infra sections III.F.3, III.E.7.

293

financial support to the Fund at any time. 909
Below we describe in detail the ways in which the format and content of the required disclosure
statement that we are adopting today differ from that which we proposed, as well as the reasons
for these differences.
b.

Format of the statement

We have decided not to adopt the proposed requirement that funds provide the statement
in a bulleted format. One commenter argued that prescribing a specific graphical format is not
necessary and might be difficult to execute in certain forms of advertising, such as social
media. 910 We agree. We also believe that refraining from requiring funds to provide the
disclosure statement in a bulleted format, in combination with other modifications discussed
below that shorten the disclosure statement, addresses concerns raised by commenters that the
length of the proposed disclosure statement could draw attention away from other important
information in an advertisement or sales materials. 911

909

See Rule 482(b)(4)(i); Form N-1A Item 4(b)(1)(ii)(A). Besides the amendments to the disclosure statement
requirements set forth in Rule 482(b)(4)(i) and Form N-1A Item 4(b)(1)(ii)(A), we also are adopting
non-substantive changes to the text of these rule and form provisions. Funds may omit the last sentence
regarding sponsor support under certain circumstances, such as when a fund’s sponsor has contractually
committed to provide support to the fund. See supra note 908; Instructions to Item 4(b)(1)(ii) of Form
N-1A; Note to paragraph (b)(4), rule 482(b)(4). The proposal likewise would have permitted this omission
from the proposed disclosure statement. See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at nn.307 and 313. As
discussed in more detail below, we are adopting amendments that would require money market funds to
disclose current and historical instances of affiliate financial support on Form N-CR and Form N-1A,
respectively. See infra sections III.F.3, III.E.7.

910

See ABA Business Law Section Comment Letter.

911

See NYC Bar Committee Comment Letter (noting that, particularly in inherently brief formats like
advertisements, there is a risk that mandated legends may crowd out material informational content); ABA
Business Law Section Comment Letter (arguing that the proposed disclosure statement could take up so
much of the space available in an advertisement that it will discourage investors from viewing other
important information in the communication).

294

c.

Disclosure concerning general risk of investment loss

As proposed, the required disclosure statement would have included a bulleted statement
providing: “You could lose money by investing in the Fund.” We are adopting identical content
in the required disclosure statement. As discussed in the proposal, we have taken into
consideration investor preferences for clear, concise, and understandable language in adopting
the required disclosure and also have considered whether strongly-worded disclaimer language
would more effectively convey the particular risks associated with money market funds than
more moderately-worded language would. 912 We received one comment on this language
arguing that it is duplicative with other language in the required disclosure statement. 913 We
have responded to this comment by shortening and modifying the required disclosure
statement. 914
d.

Disclosure concerning fees and gates

As proposed, the required disclosure statement would have included bulleted statements
providing: “The Fund may impose a fee upon sale of your shares when the Fund is under
considerable stress” and “The Fund may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares of the
Fund when the Fund is under considerable stress.” Instead of including these bullet points in the
required disclosure, we are adopting similar content in the required disclosure statement
providing: “The Fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend
912

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at nn.316-317.

913

See Federated VIII Comment Letter.

914

As proposed, the required disclosure statement included the statements “You could lose money by
investing in the Fund” and “Your investment in the Fund therefore may experience losses.” As adopted,
the required disclosure statement no longer includes the second statement, which could be construed to be
repetitive with the first.

295

your ability to sell shares if the Fund’s liquidity falls below required minimums because of
market conditions or other factors.” One commenter, while generally supporting the proposed
statement, suggested that the statement be amended to say that the fund could impose a fee or a
gate “in order to protect shareholders of the Fund.” 915 One commenter expressed concerns about
requiring the inclusion of statements about fees and gates in advertisements or other sales
materials, arguing that the description of circumstances and conditions under which fees and
gates might be imposed is difficult to reduce to a brief statement. 916 No commenters explicitly
supported the inclusion of the term “considerable stress,” and several commenters argued that
this term was not clear, and may cause investors to believe that funds could impose fees and
gates arbitrarily or, conversely, only during extreme market events. 917 To address this concern,
one commenter suggested requiring a different term than “considerable stress,” arguing that this
term overstates the prospect for imposing fees or gates. 918 Other commenters suggested that the
disclosure state explicitly that a fee or gate could be imposed as a result of a reduction in the
fund’s liquidity. 919 Commenters also suggested that any disclosure regarding fees and gates
could be combined into a single statement.
After considering the comments, we continue to believe that disclosure about fees or
gates should be included in advertisements, sales materials, and the summary section of the
prospectus. Even some commenters that expressed concerns about including the disclosure in
915

Comment Letter.

296

advertisements acknowledged that the possible imposition of fees and gates is information that is
likely to be important to investors. 920 As we stated in the Proposing Release, we are concerned
that investors will not be fully aware of potential restrictions on fund redemptions. To address
commenters’ concerns regarding the ambiguity of the term “considerable stress,” we have
revised the statement, as suggested by commenters, to make clear that funds could impose a fee
or gate in response to a reduction in the fund’s liquidity. The statement does not include a
reference that a fee or gate could be imposed “to protect investors of the fund,” as suggested by
one commenter. We believe that including the additional suggested language could detract from
the statement’s emphasis that a fee or gate could be imposed, which could in turn diminish
shareholders’ awareness of potential restrictions on fund redemptions. The language we have
adopted reflects commenter suggestions that any disclosure regarding fees or gates be combined
into a single statement. We believe that the adopted language also responds to commenter
concerns about the difficulty of briefly describing the conditions under which fees and gates
might be imposed by providing that fees and gates could be imposed if “the Fund’s liquidity falls
below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors.”
e.

Disclosure concerning sponsor support

As proposed, the required disclosure statement would have included a bulleted statement
providing: “The Fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund,
and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any
time.” We are adopting identical content in the required disclosure statement. Several

920

See ABA Business Law Section Comment Letter; NYC Bar Committee Comment Letter.

297

commenters opposed the inclusion of a reference to sponsor support in the required disclosure
statement. 921 Some commenters argued that the disclosure would raise sponsor support to an
unwarranted level of prominence, noting that there have not been any studies to determine
whether investors actually rely on the potential for sponsor support as a factor when determining
whether to invest in a money market fund. 922 Commenters also were concerned that investors
will not understand the disclosure in fund advertisements, since advertisements will not afford
space or opportunity to explain to investors who the fund’s “sponsor” is and what “financial
support” means. 923
We continue to believe that the disclosure statement should include a statement that the
fund’s sponsor has no obligation to provide financial support. In the Proposing Release, we
recognized that particular instances of sponsor support were not particularly transparent to
investors in past years because sponsor support generally was not immediately disclosed, and
was not required to be disclosed by the Commission. 924 But although investors might not have
known of particular instances of sponsor support, we believe that many investors, particularly
institutional investors, have historically understood that there was a possibility of financial
support from the money market fund’s sponsor and that this possibility has affected investors’
perceptions about the level of risk in investing in money market funds. 925 We therefore disagree

921

See Dreyfus Comment Letter; NYC Bar Committee Comment Letter; ABA Business Law Section
Comment Letter. But see CFA Institute Comment Letter; HSBC Comment Letter (both generally
supporting the proposed disclosure statement, including the language discussing sponsor support).

with the commenter who suggested that investors were generally unaware of this practice
preceding and during the financial crisis. 926 For this reason, we believe that it is important to
emphasize to investors that they should not expect a fund sponsor to provide financial support to
the fund.
For similar reasons, we disagree with one commenter who argued that requiring this
disclosure is at odds with the requirement that funds publicly disclose instances of sponsor
support. 927 As discussed below, we are requiring funds to disclose current and historical
instances of sponsor support because we believe that such disclosure will help investors better
understand the risks of investing in the funds. 928 This reporting, which should help investors
understand instances when the fund has come under stress, provides historical information about
the fund. The required disclosure statement, on the other hand, is a forward-looking risk
statement that reminds current and prospective investors that sponsors do not have an obligation
to provide sponsor support and that investors should not expect that sponsors will provide
support in the future.
Finally, we are not persuaded that the disclosure regarding sponsor support should not
appear in advertisements because this disclosure will not be understood by investors. We
recognize that upon reading the disclosure statement, investors might have questions regarding
40 years, [investors] have relied on the perception that even though there is risk in money market funds,
that risk is owned somehow implicitly by fund sponsors. So once they perceive that they are not able to get
that additional assurance, I believe that was one probably cause of the run.”).

See NYC Bar Committee Comment Letter (arguing that the Commission’s discussion of the lack of
transparency regarding instances of sponsor support shows that the proposed risk statement addresses a
practice that investors were not aware of during the financial crisis).

299

financial support from sponsors, as commenters indicated, including questions regarding who the
fund’s “sponsor” is, or what constitutes “financial support.” 929 We believe, however, that funds
can address this issue through more complete disclosure elsewhere in the fund prospectus if they
believe it is necessary.
f.

Disclosure for floating NAV funds

As proposed, the required disclosure statement for floating NAV funds would have
included bulleted statements providing: “You should not invest in the Fund if you require your
investment to maintain a stable value” and “The value of the Fund will increase and decrease as
a result of changes in the value of the securities in which the Fund invests. The value of the
securities in which the Fund invests may in turn be affected by many factors, including interest
rate changes and defaults or changes in the credit quality of a security’s issuer.” Instead of
including these bullet points in the required disclosure, we are adopting similar content in the
required disclosure statement providing: “Because the share price of the Fund will fluctuate,
when you sell your shares they may be worth more or less than what you originally paid for
them.” While one commenter questioned whether the proposed disclosure was necessary for
investors in institutional prime funds, 930 we believe it is important to emphasize to investors the
potential impact of a floating NAV. 931 In response to suggestions by commenters, 932 we have

929

See ABA Business Law Section Comment Letter; NYC Bar Committee Comment Letter.

930

See Dreyfus Comment Letter (“[W]e also question the Commission's concern that investors will fail to
understand that the value of the [floating NAV] MMF will fluctuate. We question at what point investors
will be given the benefit of the doubt for understanding the product in which they are invested and when
such concerns will cease to drive additional regulatory action.”)

931

Cf. ABA Business Law Section Comment Letter (suggesting that “floating NAV money market funds
include in their advertisements a statement that their principal value will fluctuate so that an investor’s
shares, when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost”); CFA Institute Comment Letter

300

decided not to require that the disclosure statement include the proposed statement that investors
that require a stable value not invest in the fund. We were persuaded by commenters that the
term “stable value” is often used by financial advisers when referring to certain investment
products, at least some of which do have a variable NAV. 933 We are also not including in the
disclosure requirements the proposed statements about the relationship between the fund share
price and the value of the fund’s underlying securities and the risk factors that can affect the
value of the fund’s underlying securities. We were persuaded by one commenter who noted that
discussion of specific risk factors will be addressed in other areas of the prospectus, including the
summary prospectus. 934 We also believe that not including these statements addresses more
general concerns expressed by commenters regarding the length and efficacy of the proposed
disclosure statement. 935
2.

Disclosure of Tax Consequences and Effect on Fund Operations—
Floating NAV

As discussed in the Proposing Release, the requirement that institutional prime money
market funds transition to a floating NAV will entail certain additional tax- and
(stating that “[d]isclosures are needed to alert investors to the potential for loss of principal and interest”).
932

See NYC Bar Committee Comment Letter; ABA Business Law Section Comment Letter.

933

See NYC Bar Committee Comment Letter (noting that “stable value” commonly refers to a “retirement
product that will use a combination of government bonds, guaranteed return insurance wrappers and
potentially other synthetic instruments to deliver a minimum rate of return”).

934

See Dreyfus Comment Letter.

935

See ABA Business Law Section Comment Letter; NYC Bar Committee Comment Letter. The required
disclosure statement that we are adopting today (see supra text accompanying note 909) is about 30%
shorter than the proposed bulleted disclosure statement. (We have modified the proposed bulleted
disclosure statement to encompass the proposed language referencing fluctuating share price as well as the
ability of a fund to impose fees or gates. The Proposing Release conceived of two separate reform
approaches, each with its own disclosure statement, while this Release combines the approaches into a
single reform package, and the disclosure statement we are adopting therefore references both reform
elements, as appropriate.)

301

operations-related disclosure, but these disclosure requirements do not necessitate rule and form
amendments. 936 As noted above, taxable investors in institutional prime money market funds,
like taxable investors in other types of mutual funds, may now experience taxable gains and
losses. 937 Currently, funds are required to describe in their prospectuses the tax consequences to
shareholders of buying, holding, exchanging, and selling the fund’s shares. 938 Accordingly, we
expect that, pursuant to current disclosure requirements, floating NAV money market funds
would include disclosure in their prospectuses about the tax consequences to shareholders of
buying, holding, exchanging, and selling the shares of the floating NAV fund. In addition, we
expect that a floating NAV money market fund would update its prospectus and SAI disclosure
regarding the purchase, redemption, and pricing of fund shares, to reflect any changes resulting
from the fund’s use of a floating NAV. 939 We also expect that a fund that intends to qualify as a
retail money market fund would disclose in its prospectus that it limits investment to accounts
beneficially owned by natural persons. 940 The Proposing Release requested comment on the
disclosure that we expect floating NAV money market funds would include in their prospectuses
about the tax consequences to shareholders of buying, holding, exchanging, and selling shares of
the fund, as well as the effects (if any) on fund operations resulting from the transition to a
floating NAV. We received no comments directly discussing this disclosure.
936

Prospectus disclosure regarding the tax consequences of these activities is currently required by Form
N-1A. See Item 11(f) of Form N-1A.

937

See supra section III.B.6.

938

See Item 11(f) of Form N-1A.

939

We expect that a floating NAV money market fund would include this disclosure (as appropriate) in
response to, for example, Item 11 (“Shareholder Information”) and Item 23 (“Purchase, Redemption, and
Pricing of Shares”) of Form N-1A.

940

See supra note 692 and accompanying text.

302

3.

Disclosure of Transition to Floating NAV

Currently, a fund must update its registration statement to reflect any material changes by
means of a post-effective amendment or a prospectus supplement (or “sticker”) pursuant to rule
497 under the Securities Act. 941 As discussed in the Proposing Release, we would expect that, to
meet this existing requirement, at the time that a stable NAV money market fund transitions to a
floating NAV (or adopts a floating NAV in the course of a merger or other reorganization), it
would update its registration statement to include relevant related disclosure, as discussed in
sections III.E.1 and III.E.2 of this Release, by means of a post-effective amendment or a
prospectus supplement. Two commenters explicitly supported that such disclosures be made
when transitioning to a floating NAV. 942 We continue to believe that a money market fund must
update its registration statement by means of a post-effective amendment or “sticker” to reflect
relevant disclosure related to a transition to a floating NAV.
4.

Disclosure of the Effects of Fees and Gates on Redemptions

As we discussed in the proposal, pursuant to the existing requirements in Form N-1A,
funds must disclose any restrictions on fund redemptions in their registration statements. 943 As
discussed in more detail below, we expect that, to comply with these existing requirements,
money market funds (other than government money market funds that are not subject to the fees
and gates requirements pursuant to rule 2a-7(c)(2)(iii) and that have not chosen to rely on the
ability to impose liquidity fees and suspend redemptions) will disclose in the registration

941

See 17 CFR 230.497.

statement the effects that the potential imposition of fees and/or gates, including a board’s
discretionary powers regarding the imposition of fees and gates, may have on a shareholder’s
ability to redeem shares of the fund. This disclosure should help investors evaluate the costs
they could incur in redeeming fund shares—one of the goals of this rulemaking.
Commenters generally agreed that this disclosure would help investors understand the
effects of fees and gates on redemptions. 944 One commenter specifically agreed that Items
11(c)(1) and 23 of Form N-1A would require money market funds to fully describe the
circumstances under which liquidity fees could be charged or redemptions could be suspended or
reinstated. 945 In addition, two commenters noted that the prospectus should include disclosure of
a board’s discretionary powers regarding the imposition of fees and gates, which would serve to
emphasize further the nature of money market funds as investments subject to risk. 946 The
Proposing Release requested comment on the utility of including additional disclosure about the
operations and effects of fees and redemption gates, including (i) requiring information about the
basic operations of fees and gates to be disclosed in the summary section of the statutory
prospectus (and any summary prospectus, if used) and (ii) requiring details about the fund’s
liquidation process. One commenter argued against the utility of such additional disclosure in

See Federated VIII Comment Letter (suggesting that Form N-1A also would require money market funds to

See Federated VIII Comment Letter (arguing that: (i) requiring disclosure in the summary prospectus about

decided against making any changes to the rule text in this regard.
As discussed in the Proposing Release, we expect money market funds to explain in the
prospectus the various situations in which the fund may impose a liquidity fee or gate. 948 For
example, money market funds would briefly explain in the prospectus that if the fund’s weekly
liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets and the fund’s board determines it is in the best
interests of the fund, the fund board may impose a liquidity fee of no more than 2% and/or
temporarily suspend redemptions for a limited period of time. 949 We also expect money market
funds to briefly explain in the prospectus that if the fund’s weekly liquid assets fall below 10%
of its total assets, the fund will impose a liquidity fee of 1% on all redemptions, unless the board
of directors of the fund (including a majority of its independent directors) determines that
imposing such a fee would not be in the best interests of the fund or determines that a lower or
higher fee (not to exceed 2%) would be in the best interests of the fund. 950
As discussed in the Proposing Release, we expect money market funds to incorporate
additional disclosure in the prospectus or SAI, as the fund determines appropriate, discussing the
operations of fees and gates in more detail. Prospectus disclosure regarding any restrictions on
redemptions is currently required by Item 11(c)(1) of Form N-1A. In addition to the disclosure
required by Item 11(c)(1), we believe that funds could determine that more detailed disclosure
about the operations of fees and gates, as further discussed in this section, would appropriately
prospectuses that are simpler, clearer, and more useful to investors’”; and (ii) no money market funds have
relied on rule 22e-3 to suspend the redemption of shares and liquidate the fund since the rule’s adoption,
and thus suggesting that disclosure about a fund’s liquidation process would not be useful to investors).

appear in a fund’s SAI, and that this more detailed disclosure is responsive to Item 23 of Form
N-1A (“Purchase, Redemption, and Pricing of Shares”). In determining whether and/or to what
extent to include this disclosure in the prospectus or SAI, money market funds should rely on the
principle that funds should limit disclosure in prospectuses generally to information that “would
be most useful to typical or average investors in making an investment decision.” 951 Detailed or
highly technical discussions, as well as information that may be helpful to more sophisticated
investors, dilute the effect of necessary prospectus disclosure and should be placed in the SAI. 952
Based on this principle, we anticipate that funds generally would consider the following
disclosure to be appropriate for the prospectus, as disclosure regarding redemption restrictions
provided in response to Item 11(c)(1) of Form N-1A: (i) means of notifying shareholders about
the imposition and lifting of fees and/or gates (e.g., press release, website announcement);
(ii) timing of the imposition and lifting of fees and gates, including (a) an explanation that if a
fund’s weekly liquid assets fall below 10% of its total assets at the end of any business day, the
next business day it must impose a 1% liquidity fee on shareholder redemptions unless the fund’s
board of directors determines that doing otherwise is in the best interests of the fund, (b) an
explanation that if a fund’s weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets, it may impose
fees or gates as early as the same day, and (c) an explanation of the 10 business day limit for
imposing gates; (iii) use of fee proceeds by the fund, including any possible return to
shareholders in the form of a distribution; (iv) the tax consequences to the fund and its

shareholders of the fund’s receipt of liquidity fees; and (v) general description of the process of
fund liquidation 953 if the fund’s weekly liquid assets fall below 10%, and the fund’s board of
directors determines that it would not be in the best interests of the fund to continue operating. 954
In addition, we expect that a government money market fund that is not subject to the
fees and gates requirements pursuant to rule 2a-7(c)(2)(iii), but that later decides to rely on the
ability to impose liquidity fees and suspend redemptions, would update its registration statement
to reflect the changes by means of a post-effective amendment or a prospectus supplement
pursuant to rule 497 under the Securities Act. In addition, a government fund that later opts to
rely on the ability to impose fees and gates provided in rule 2a-7(c)(2)(iii) should consider
whether to provide any additional notice to its shareholders of that election. 955

Historical Disclosure of Liquidity Fees and Gates

We are amending Form N-1A, generally as proposed, but with certain modifications as
discussed below, to require that money market funds provide disclosure in their SAIs about
historical occasions in which the fund has considered or imposed liquidity fees or gates. 956 As
proposed, we would have required funds to disclose: (i) the length of time for which the fund’s
weekly liquid assets remained below 15%: (ii) the dates and length of time for which the fund’s

953

See supra section III.A.4.

954

One commenter argued that it was unnecessary to describe the process of fund liquidation in either the
prospectus or SAI. See Federated VIII Comment Letter. We note that we are not mandating particular
disclosures, but rather providing examples of the types of disclosures we believe that money market funds
could provide in the prospectus or SAI. We further note that it is important for funds to ensure that
investors are fully aware of the ability of the fund to permanently suspend redemptions and liquidate.

955

We note that 60-day notice is required by our rules for other significant changes by funds, for example,
when a fund changes its name. See rules 35d-1(a)(2)(ii) and (a)(3)(iii).

956

As we proposed, this historical disclosure would only apply to such events that occurred after the
compliance date of the amendments. See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.983.

307

board of directors determined to impose a liquidity fee and/or temporarily suspend the fund’s
redemptions; and (iii) a short discussion of the board’s analysis supporting its decision to impose
a liquidity fee (or not to impose a liquidity fee) and/or temporarily suspend the fund’s
redemptions. 957 As discussed below, we are adopting modified thresholds for imposing fees and
gates from what was proposed; consequently, the amendments we are adopting to Form N-1A to
require historical disclosure of liquidity fees and gates have been modified from the proposed
amendments to conform to these amended threshold levels. In addition, in a change from the
proposed historical disclosure requirements, the Form N-1A amendments we are adopting
require a fund to disclose the size of any liquidity fee imposed during the specified look-back
period. We have also determined not to adopt the proposed requirement to disclose “a short
discussion of the board’s analysis supporting its decision to impose a liquidity fee (or not to
impose a liquidity fee) and/or temporarily suspend the fund’s redemptions” for the reasons
detailed below.
Specifically, we are amending Form N-1A to require that money market funds (other than
government money market funds that are not subject to the fees and gates requirements pursuant
to rule 2a-7(c)(2)(iii)) 958 provide disclosure in their SAIs regarding any occasion during the last
10 years (but not for occasions that occurred before the compliance date of these amended
rules) 959 on which (i) the fund’s weekly liquid assets have fallen below 10%, and with respect to
each such occasion, whether the fund’s board of directors determined to impose a liquidity fee

957

958

Rule 2a-7(c)(2)(iii).

308

and/or suspend the fund’s redemptions, or (ii) the fund’s weekly liquid assets have fallen below
30% (but not less than 10%) and the fund’s board of directors determined to impose a liquidity
fee and/or suspend the fund’s redemptions. 960 With respect to each occasion, we are requiring
funds to disclose: (i) the length of time for which the fund’s weekly liquid assets remained
below 10% (or 30%, as applicable); (ii) the dates and length of time for which the fund’s board
of directors determined to impose a liquidity fee and/or temporarily suspend the fund’s
redemptions; and (iii) the size of any liquidity fee imposed. 961
We proposed to require a fund to provide disclosure in its SAI regarding any occasion
during the last 10 years (but not before the compliance date) in which the fund’s weekly liquid
assets had fallen below 15%, and with respect to each such occasion, whether the fund’s board of
directors determined to impose a liquidity fee and/or suspend the fund’s redemptions. 962 As
discussed previously, the final amendments contain modified thresholds for imposing fees and
gates from what was proposed, 963 and we are therefore modifying the disclosure requirements to
conform to these amended threshold levels.
As proposed, the SAI disclosure requirements would not have directly required a fund to

960

See amended Item 16(g)(1) of Form N-1A. The disclosure required by Item 16(g)(1) should incorporate, as
appropriate, any information that the fund is required to report to the Commission on Items E.1, E.2, E.3,
E.4, F.1, F.2, and G.1 of Form N-CR. See Instruction 2 to Item 16(g)(1). This represents a slight change
from the proposal, in that the required disclosure is now the same as what would be disclosed in the initial
filings of Form N-CR. We have made this change to reduce the burdens associated with such disclosure so
that funds need only prepare this information once in a single manner. For the reasons discussed in section
III.F of this Release, Form N-CR includes a new requirement that funds report their level of weekly liquid
assets at the time of the imposition of fees or gates, and accordingly, we are also requiring similar
disclosure here. See Form N-CR Items E.3 and F.1.

961

See Instructions to amended Item 16(g)(1) of Form N-1A.

962

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at section III.B.8.d.

See supra section III.A.2.

309

disclose the size of any liquidity fee imposed. We are modifying the SAI disclosure
requirements to require a fund to disclose the size of any liquidity fee it has imposed during the
specified look-back period. As discussed below in the context of the Form N-CR disclosure
requirements we are adopting, because we are revising the default liquidity fee from the
proposed 2% to 1%, and thus we expect that there may be instances where liquidity fees are
above or below the default fee (rather than just lower as permitted under the proposal), we are
requiring that funds disclose the size of the liquidity fee, if one is imposed. 964
One commenter specifically supported the proposed 10-year “look-back” period for the
historical disclosure, noting that a 10-year period should capture a number of different market
stresses delivering a meaningful sample. 965 Another commenter suggested limiting SAI
disclosure to a five-year period prior to the effective date of the registration statement
incorporating the SAI disclosure, although this commenter did not provide specific reasons why
this shortened look-back period would be appropriate. 966 After further consideration, and given
that commenters did not provide any specific reasons for implementing a shortened look-back
period, we continue to believe that a 10-year look-back period provides shareholders and the
Commission with a historical perspective that would be long enough to provide a useful
understanding of past events. We believe that this period would provide a meaningful sample of
stresses faced by individual funds and in the market as a whole, and to analyze patterns with
respect to fees and gates, but would not be so long as to include circumstances that may no

310

longer be a relevant reflection of the fund’s management or operations.
As discussed in the Proposing Release, we continue to believe that money market funds’
current and prospective shareholders should be informed of historical occasions in which the
fund’s weekly liquid assets have fallen below 10% and/or the fund has imposed liquidity fees or
redemption gates. While we recognize that historical occurrences are not necessarily indicative
of future events, we anticipate that current and prospective fund investors could use this
information as one factor to compare the risks and potential costs of investing in different money
market funds. The DERA Study analyzed the distribution of weekly liquid assets and found that
83 prime funds per year, corresponding to 2.7% of the prime funds’ weekly liquid asset
observations, saw the percentage of their total assets that were invested in weekly liquid assets
fall below 30%. The DERA Study further showed that less than one (0.6) fund per year,
corresponding to 0.01% of the prime funds’ weekly liquid asset observations, experienced a
decline of total assets that were invested in weekly liquid assets to below 10%. 967 We believe
that funds will, in general, try to avoid the need to disclose decreasing percentages of weekly
liquid assets and/or the imposition of a liquidity fee or gate, as required under the new
amendments to Form N-1A, 968 by keeping the percentage of their total assets invested in weekly
liquid assets at or above 30%. Of those 83 funds that reported a percentage of total assets
invested in weekly liquid assets below 30%, it is unclear how many, if any, would have
attempted to keep the percentage of their total assets invested in weekly liquid assets at or above
30% to avoid having to report this information on their SAI (assuming they were to impose, at

311

their board’s discretion, a liquidity fee or gate).
The required disclosure will permit current and prospective shareholders to assess, among
other things, patterns of stress experienced by the fund, as well as whether the fund’s board has
previously imposed fees and/or redemption gates in light of declines in portfolio liquidity. This
disclosure also provides investors with historical information about the board’s past analytical
process in determining how to handle liquidity issues when the fund experiences stress, which
could influence an investor’s decision to purchase shares of, or remain invested in, the fund. In
addition, the required disclosure may impose market discipline on portfolio managers to monitor
and manage portfolio liquidity in a manner that lessens the likelihood that the fund would need to
implement a liquidity fee or gate. 969 One commenter explicitly supported the utility of these
disclosure requirements in providing investors with useful information regarding the frequency
of the money market fund’s breaching of certain liquidity thresholds, whether a fee or gate was
applied, and the level of fee imposed, stating that “[t]his will allow investors to make informed
decisions when determining whether to invest in [money market funds] and when comparing
different [money market funds].” 970 No commenter argued that disclosure about the historical
fact of occurrence of fees and gates would not be useful to investors. However, some
commenters raised concerns about the potential redundancy of the proposed registration
statement, website, and Form N-CR disclosure requirements. 971
As discussed above, we also have determined not to adopt the proposed requirement for a

fund to disclose “a short discussion of the board’s analysis supporting its decision to impose a
liquidity fee (or not to impose a liquidity fee) and/or temporarily suspend the fund’s
redemptions” in its SAI (or as discussed below, on its website). 972 We note that Form N-CR, as
proposed, also would have required a fund imposing a fee or gate to disclose a “discussion of the
board’s analysis” supporting its decision, and a number of commenters objected to this proposed
requirement. 973 In particular, commenters raised concerns that the disclosures proposed to be
required in Form N-CR and Form N-1A would not be material to investors, would be
burdensome to disclose, would chill deliberations among board members and hinder board
confidentiality, and would encourage opportunistic litigation. 974 Commenters also argued that
disclosure of the board’s analysis is not necessary to disclose patterns of stress in a fund and that
this disclosure is not likely to be a meaningful indication of the board’s analytical process going
forward. 975

972

However, as discussed below in section III.F.5, Form N-CR will require a fund to disclose the primary
considerations or factors taken into account by the fund’s board in its decision to impose a liquidity fee or
gate.

973

See infra section III.F.5.

974

See infra notes 1289-1293 and accompanying text. Most commenters made these arguments in reference to
the proposed Form N-CR disclosure requirement; however, several commenters also specifically
referenced the proposed identical Form N-1A disclosure requirement. See SIFMA Comment Letter;
Stradley Ronon Comment Letter.

975

See SIFMA Comment Letter; Stradley Ronon Comment Letter (both stating that requiring disclosure of the
board’s analysis is not necessary to disclose patterns of stress in a fund, and that patterns of stress will be
apparent via the proposed disclosures of historical sponsor support and liquidity shortfalls). We note that
the Proposing Release does not specifically state that disclosure of the board’s analysis supporting its
decision to impose a liquidity fee or temporarily suspend the fund’s redemptions would permit shareholders
to assess patterns of stress. Rather, the Proposing Release states that the proposed historical disclosure of
liquidity fees and gates (which disclosure would include a discussion of the board’s analysis supporting its
decision to impose a liquidity fee or gate) generally would assist shareholders in assessing patterns of
stress. See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at section III.B.8.d. We continue to believe that historical
disclosure of fees and gates, which would include disclosures of historical liquidity shortfalls, would assist
shareholders in understanding patterns of stress faced by the fund. See supra notes 969-970 and
accompanying text. We believe that this historical disclosure complements the disclosure of historical

313

We discuss these commenters’ concerns in detail in section III.F below and also provide
our analysis supporting our attempt to balance these concerns with our interest in permitting the
Commission and shareholders to understand why a board imposed (or did not impose) a liquidity
fee or gate. As a result of these considerations and the analysis discussed in section III.F below,
we have adopted a Form N-CR requirement to require disclosure of the primary considerations
or factors taken into account by the fund’s board in its decision to impose a liquidity fee or gate.
However, in order to avoid unnecessary duplication in the disclosure that will appear in a fund’s
SAI and on Form N-CR, we have determined not to require parallel disclosure of these
considerations or factors in the fund’s SAI. Instead, a fund will only be required to present
certain summary information about the imposition of fees and/or gates in its SAI (as well as on
the fund’s website 976), and will be required to present more detailed discussion solely on Form
N-CR. 977 To inform investors about the inclusion of this more detailed information on Form
N-CR, funds will be instructed to include the following statement as part of their SAI disclosure
about the historical occasions in which the fund has considered or imposed liquidity fees or
gates: “The Fund was required to disclose additional information about this event [or “these
events,” as appropriate] on Form N-CR and to file this form with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Any Form N-CR filing submitted by the Fund is available on the EDGAR
Database on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Internet site at http://www.sec.gov.” 978
In adopting these modified SAI disclosure requirements, we have attempted to balance concerns
instances of sponsor support in understanding patterns of stress.

about potentially duplicative disclosure 979 with our interest in presenting the primary information
about the fund’s historical imposition of fees or gates that we believe shareholders may find
useful in assessing fund risks.

Prospectus Fee Table

As proposed, we are clarifying in the instructions to Item 3 of Form N-1A (“Risk/Return
Summary: Fee Table”) that the term “redemption fee,” for purposes of the prospectus fee table,
does not include a liquidity fee that may be imposed in accordance with rule 2a-7. 980
Commenters on this aspect of our proposal agreed that the liquidity fee should not be included in
the prospectus fee table. 981 For example, one commenter stated that the fees and expenses table
is intended to show a typical investor the range of anticipated costs that will be borne by the
investor directly or indirectly as a shareholder, but is not an ideal presentation for the kind of
highly contingent cost that would be represented by a liquidity fee. 982
As discussed in the Proposing Release and as adopted today, a liquidity fee will only be
imposed when a fund experiences stress, and because we anticipate that a particular fund would
impose this fee rarely, if at all, 983 we continue to believe that the prospectus fee table, which is
intended to help shareholders compare the costs of investing in different mutual funds, should

979

See supra note 971 and accompanying text. As discussed in more detail in section III.F.5 below, while
similar information is required to be included on Form N-CR and on Form N-1A, we believe each of these
different disclosures to be appropriate because they serve distinct purposes. See infra notes 1308-1309 and
accompanying text.

not include the liquidity fee. 984 We also note, as discussed above, that shareholders will be
adequately informed about liquidity fees through other disclosures in funds’ SAI and summary
section of the statutory prospectus (and, accordingly, in any summary prospectus, if used). 985 If a
fund imposes a liquidity fee, shareholders will also be informed about the imposition of this fee
on the fund’s website 986 and possibly by means of a prospectus supplement. 987 A fund could also
provide complementary shareholder communications, such as a press release or social media
update. 988 Accordingly, we are adopting the clarifying instruction to Item 3 as proposed.
7.

Historical Disclosure of Affiliate Financial Support

As discussed above in section II.B.4, voluntary support provided by money market fund
sponsors and affiliates has played a role in helping some money market funds maintain a stable
share price, and, as a result, may have lessened investors’ perception of the level of risk in
money market funds. Such discretionary sponsor support was, in fact, not unusual during the
financial crisis. 989 Today we are adopting, with certain modifications from the proposal to
address commenter concerns, amendments that require that money market funds disclose current
and historical instances of affiliate “financial support.” The final amendments define “financial
support” in the same way it is defined in Form N-CR, 990 and specify that funds should

984

any redemption of the Fund’s shares, but does not include a deferred sales charge (load) imposed upon
redemption.

address commenter concerns, in section III.F. 992 This represents a slight change from the
proposal, in that the required disclosure is now identical to what would be disclosed in the initial
filings of Form N-CR. We have made this change to reduce the burdens associated with such
disclosure so that funds need only prepare this information once in a single manner. 993
In the Proposing Release, we requested comment on amending rule 17a-9 (which allows
for the discretionary support of money market funds by their sponsors and other affiliates) to
potentially restrict the practice of sponsor support, but did not propose any specific changes to
the rule. While a few commenters suggested, in response to this request for comment, that we
prohibit affiliates from providing discretionary support to maintain a money market fund’s share
value, 994 other commenters opposed making any changes to rule 17a-9, arguing that transactions

“including any (i) capital contribution, (ii) purchase of a security from the Fund in reliance on § 270.17a-9,
(iii) purchase of any defaulted or devalued security at par, (iv) execution of letter of credit or letter of
indemnity, (v) capital support agreement (whether or not the Fund ultimately received support), (vi)
performance guarantee, or (vii) any other similar action reasonably intended to increase or stabilize the
value or liquidity of the Fund’s portfolio; excluding, however, any (i) routine waiver of fees or
reimbursement of Fund expenses, (ii) routine inter-fund lending (iii) routine inter-fund purchases of Fund
shares, or (iv) any action that would qualify as financial support as defined above, that the board of
directors has otherwise determined not to be reasonably intended to increase or stabilize the value or
liquidity of the Fund’s portfolio.”).

facilitated by the rule are in the best interests of shareholders. 995 We continue to believe, as
discussed in the Proposing Release, that permitting financial support (with adequate disclosure)
will provide fund affiliates with the flexibility to protect shareholder interests, and we are not
amending rule 17a-9 at this time. 996 Many commenters supported the various financial support
disclosures we are adopting today. 997 We believe that these disclosure requirements will provide
transparency to shareholders and the Commission about the frequency, nature, and amount of
affiliate financial support.

General requirements

We are adopting, with some changes from the proposal, amendments to Form N-1A to
require a money market fund to disclose in its SAI historical instances in which the fund has
received financial support from a sponsor or fund affiliate. 998 Specifically, each money market
fund will be required to disclose any occasion during the last 10 years (but not for occasions that
occurred before the compliance date of these amended rules) on which an affiliated person,
promoter, or principal underwriter of the fund, or an affiliated person of such person, 999 provided

Rule 2a-7 currently requires a money market fund to notify the Commission by electronic mail, directed to
the Director of Investment Management or the Director’s designee, of any purchase of money market fund
portfolio securities by an affiliated person, promoter, or principal underwriter of the fund, or an affiliated
person of such person, pursuant to rule 17a-9. See current rule 2a-7(c)(7)(iii)(B). As proposed, we are
eliminating this requirement today, as it would be duplicative with the proposed Form N-CR reporting
requirements discussed below. See rule 2a-7(f)(3); see also infra note 1254. However, because the

318

any form of financial support to the fund. For the reasons discussed in the Proposing Release, we
believe that the disclosure of historical instances of sponsor support will allow investors,
regulators, academics, market observers and market participants, and other interested members
of the public to understand better whether a particular fund has required financial support in the
past and the extent of sponsor support across the fund industry. 1000 As proposed, with respect to
each such occasion, funds would have been required to describe the nature of support, the person
providing support, the relationship between the person providing support and the fund, the date
the support provided, the amount of support, 1001 the security supported and its value on the date
support was initiated (if applicable), the reason for support, the term of support, and any
contractual restrictions relating to support. 1002 We are adopting the proposed disclosure
requirements, with the exception of the requirements for a fund to describe the reason for
support, the term of support, and any contractual restrictions relating to support.
While multiple commenters supported the proposed requirement for money market funds
to disclose historical instances of financial support in the fund’s SAI, 1003 other commenters
expressed a number of concerns about this proposed requirement. 1004 For example, one

definition of “financial support” as adopted today includes the purchase of a security pursuant to rule 17a-9
(as well as similar actions), we believe that the scope of the persons covered by the definition should reflect
the scope of persons covered by current rule 2a-7(c)(7)(iii)(B). The term “affiliated person” is defined in
section 2(a)(3) and, in the context of an investment company, includes, among other persons, the
investment adviser of the investment company.

commenter opposed this disclosure, stating that “many investors would extrapolate such
disclosure as an implied guarantee of future support by the sponsor of the fund.” 1005 Another
commenter rejected the notion that past sponsor support is indicative of a sponsor’s management
style and further observed that disclosure of historical support contradicts the proposed
disclosure that a fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide support. 1006 While we
acknowledge these concerns, we believe it is important for investors to understand the nature and
extent that a fund’s sponsor has discretionarily supported the fund in order to allow them to fully
appreciate the risks of investing in the fund. 1007 Although we recognize that historical
occurrences are not necessarily indicative of future events and that support does not equate to
poor fund management, we continue to expect that these disclosures will permit investors to
assess the sponsor’s past ability and willingness to provide financial support to the fund. This
disclosure also should help investors gain a better context for, and understanding of, the fund’s
risks, historical performance, and principal volatility.
A number of commenters stated that any disclosure of financial support, including the
historical disclosures, should only apply to stable NAV funds. 1008 We disagree. Transparency of
financial support is important for stable NAV funds, given the potential for a “breaking the
buck” event absent the receipt of affiliate financial support. It is equally important, for both
floating and stable NAV money market funds, that investors have transparency about the extent

to which the fund’s principal stability or liquidity profile is achieved through financial support as
opposed to portfolio management. This is particularly the case when financial support for a
floating NAV fund could obviate the need for it to impose a liquidity fee or redemption gate. 1009
We therefore believe that transparency of such support will help investors better evaluate the
risks with respect to both stable and floating NAV funds. 1010
Some commenters also suggested we shorten the look-back period. For example, one
commenter proposed a look-back period of 3 to 5 years (rather than 10 years, as proposed). 1011
We believe, however, that a look-back period of less than 10 years would be too short to achieve
our goals. As we noted in the Proposing Release, 1012 the 10-year look-back period will provide
shareholders and the Commission with a historical perspective that is long enough to provide a
useful understanding of past events, and to analyze patterns with respect to financial support
received by the fund, but not so long as to include circumstances that may no longer be a
relevant reflection of the fund’s management or operations. We also note that, historically,

1009

See generally, ABA Business Law Section (with respect to retaining rule 17a-9, stating that “the possibility
of economic support from an affiliated person would remain important to money market funds that have a
floating NAV because […] liquidity concerns [remain] significant to money market funds (and other funds
holding the same investments). [….] In addition, retaining [rule 17a-9] would not undercut the
Commission’s goal of providing transparency of money market fund risks, particularly in light of the
Commission's companion proposals calling for disclosure of historical instances of economic support from
sponsors of money market funds.”).

1010

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at section III.F.1.a (discussing reasons why funds should disclose
historical sponsor support).

1011

See, e.g., Dreyfus Comment Letter (stating that “[s]imilar kinds of information (e.g., management fees and
12b-1 fees paid, officers and directors biographies, financial highlights) generally [are] required in the
registration statement only for a 3-5 year period.”); Federated VIII Comment Letter (recommending five
years). But see Occupy the SEC Comment Letter (explicitly supporting the proposed 10-year look-back
period for disclosing events of financial support).

1012

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at discussion following n.614.

321

episodes of financial support have occurred on average every 5 to 10 years. 1013 Accordingly, a
shorter look-back period would result in disclosure that not does reflect the typical historical
frequency of instances of financial support.
We proposed to limit historical disclosure of events of affiliate financial support to
instances that occur after the compliance date of the amendments to Form N-1A. 1014 Several
commenters generally supported this approach, suggesting that this disclosure requirement
should only apply to events that occur after the compliance date of the disclosure reforms. 1015
We continue to believe that these disclosures should only apply to affiliate financial support
events that occur after the compliance date of the disclosure reforms, in large part because to do
otherwise would require funds and their affiliates to incur significant costs as they reexamine a
variety of past transactions to determine whether such events fit our new definition of affiliate
financial support.
Finally, a few commenters suggested disclosing historical financial support in Form
N-MFP, N-CR, or N-CSR, rather than in the SAI (as proposed). 1016 One commenter noted that to
the extent this disclosure will serve as a reporting function for analysis by regulators, other forms
such as Form N-MFP have been developed for that particular purpose. 1017 Commenters also
raised concerns about the potential redundancy of the proposed registration statement, website,

and Form N-CR disclosure requirements. 1018 Because these historical sponsor support
disclosures are intended to benefit investors, as well as regulators, we believe that the SAI is the
most accessible and efficient format for such disclosure. As discussed in section III.F.3, we note
that the contemplated SAI disclosure would consolidate historical instances of sponsor support
that have occurred in the past 10 years, which would permit investors to view this information in
a user-friendly manner, without the need to review prior form filings to piece together a fund’s
history of sponsor support. We also believe that, to the extent investors may not be familiar with
researching filings on EDGAR, including this disclosure in a fund’s SAI, which investors may
receive in hard copy through the U.S. Postal Service or may access on a fund’s website, as well
as on EDGAR, may make this information more readily available to these investors than
disclosure on other SEC forms that are solely accessible on EDGAR.
As discussed above, we are not adopting the proposed requirements that a fund include
the reason for support, the term of support, and any contractual restrictions relating to support in
its required SAI disclosure. 1019 Instead, a fund will only be required to present certain summary
information about the receipt of financial support in its SAI (as well as on the fund’s website 1020),
and will be required to present more detailed discussion solely on Form N-CR. 1021 To inform
investors about the inclusion of this more detailed information on Form N-CR, funds will be
instructed to include the following statement as part of the historical disclosure of affiliate
financial support appearing in the fund’s SAI: “The Fund was required to disclose additional

information about this event [or “these events,” as appropriate] on Form N-CR and to file this
form with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any Form N-CR filing submitted by the
Fund is available on the EDGAR Database on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s
Internet site at http://www.sec.gov.” 1022 In adopting these modified SAI disclosure requirements,
we have attempted to appropriately consider concerns about potentially duplicative disclosure 1023
as well as our belief, as discussed above, that the SAI is the most accessible and efficient format
for investors to receive historical disclosures about affiliate financial support, and our interest in
presenting the primary information about such financial support that we believe shareholders
may find useful in assessing fund risks.
b.

Historical support of predecessor funds

We also are amending, generally as we proposed, the instructions to Form N-1A to
clarify that funds must disclose any financial support provided to a predecessor fund (in the case
of a merger or other reorganization) within the 10-year look-back period. As discussed in the
Proposing Release, this amendment will provide additional transparency by providing investors
the full extent of historical support provided to a fund or its predecessor. Specifically, except as
noted below, the amended instructions state that if the fund has participated in a merger or other
reorganization with another investment company during the last 10 years, the fund must
additionally provide the required disclosure with respect to the other investment company. 1024

1022

See Instructions to amended Item 16(g)(2) of Form N-1A.

1023

See supra note 1018 and accompanying text. As discussed in more detail in section III.F.3 below, while
similar information is required to be included on Form N-CR and Form N-1A, we believe each of these
different disclosures to be appropriate because they serve distinct purposes. See discussion following infra
notes 1248 and 1249 and accompanying text.

1024

See Instruction 2 to Item 16(g)(2). Additionally, if a fund’s name has changed (but the corporate or trust

324

Rather than require that funds disclose financial support provided to a predecessor fund
in all cases (as proposed), we are revising the instruction to permit a fund to exclude such
disclosure where the person or entity that previously provided financial support to the
predecessor fund is not currently an affiliated person (including the adviser), promoter, or
principal underwriter of the disclosing fund. 1025 A few commenters expressed concern about
historical disclosures with respect to third-party reorganizations, asserting that past financial
support would be irrelevant to shareholders where the surviving fund had a new manager
unaffiliated with the prior manager. 1026 These commenters noted that this disclosure requirement
could adversely affect potential merger transactions with funds that have received sponsor
support. 1027
We agree with these commenters that historical sponsor support information about a
predecessor fund may be less relevant when the fund is not advised by, or otherwise affiliated
with, the entity that had previously provided financial support to the predecessor fund.
Accordingly, we are adopting an exclusion to this disclosure requirement based on whether the
current fund continues to have any affiliation with the predecessor fund’s affiliated persons
(including the predecessor fund’s adviser), promoter, or principal underwriter. 1028 We expect this
approach should mitigate commenter concerns of adverse effects on fund mergers.

the entity or entities identified by the fund’s former name. See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.619.

Economic Analysis

As discussed above, we are adopting a number of amendments to requirements for
disclosure documents that are related to both our fees and gates and floating NAV requirements,
as well as other disclosure enhancements discussed in the proposal. We believe that these
amendments improve transparency and will better inform shareholders about the risks of
investing in money market funds, which should result in shareholders making investment
decisions that better match their investment preferences. We believe that many of these
amendments will have effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation that are similar
to those that are outlined in the Macroeconomic Consequences section below, 1029 but some of the
amendments introduce additional effects.
Many of the new disclosure requirements are designed to make investors aware of the
more substantive amendments discussed earlier in the Release, i.e., the ability of certain funds to
impose redemption fees and gates and the requirement that certain funds float their NAV.
Increasing investor awareness via enhanced disclosure may lead to more efficient capital
allocations because investors will possess greater knowledge of risks and thus will be able to
make better informed investment decisions when deciding how to allocate their assets. Increased
investor awareness also may promote capital formation if investors find a floating NAV and/or
redemption fees and gates attractive and are more willing to invest in this market. For instance,
investors may find fees and gates attractive insofar as imposing fees and gates during a time of
market stress could help protect the interests of shareholders, or could permit a fund manager to
invest the proceeds of maturing assets in short-term securities while the gate is down, thereby
1029

See infra section III.K.

326

helping to protect the short-term financing markets. 1030 Moreover, enhanced investor awareness
of fund risks may incentivize fund managers to hold less risky portfolio securities, which could
also increase capital formation. Capital formation could be negatively impacted if investors find
a floating NAV and/or redemption fees and gates unattractive or too complicated to understand.
For instance, an investor could find it unattractive that imposing a fee or gate would prevent
them from moving their investment into other investment alternatives or using their assets to
satisfy liquidity needs. 1031 Additionally, disclosing a general risk of investment loss may
negatively impact capital formation if this disclosure leads investors to decide that money market
funds pose too great of an investment risk, and investors consequently decide not to invest in
money market funds or to move their invested assets from money market funds. As such, capital
formation could be negatively impacted if investors move their money from these types of funds
to a different style of fund, for example, from an institutional prime fund to a government fund
and thus affecting the short-term funding market. However, if investors move from a money
market fund to a money market fund alternative that invests in similar types of assets, then there
should not be an impact on capital formation with respect to the overall economy, but only
within the money market fund industry.
To the extent that the disclosure amendments increase investor awareness of the more
substantive reforms, there may be an effect on competition because some of the disclosure
requirements are specific to the structure of the funds. As such, these funds will be competing
with each other based on, among other things, what is stated in their advertisements, sales
1030

See supra section III.A.1.b.ii.

1031

See supra section III.A.1.c.iii.

327

materials, and the summary section of their statutory prospectus. Disclosure providing that funds
with a stable NAV seek to preserve the value of their investment at $1.00 per share, that share
prices of floating NAV funds will fluctuate, that taxable investors in institutional prime money
market funds may experience taxable gains or losses, or that non-government funds may impose
a fee or gate may make investors more aware of different investment options, which could
increase competition between funds.
The amendments that require money market funds to disclose current and historical
information about affiliate financial support and historical information about the implementation
of redemption fees and gates may also affect efficiency, competition, and capital formation. As
discussed in the Proposing Release, these amendments may increase informational efficiency by
providing additional information to investors and the Commission about the frequency, nature,
and amount of financial support provided by money market fund sponsors, 1032 as well as the
frequency and duration of redemption fees and gates. This in turn could assist investors in
analyzing the risks associated with particular funds, which could increase allocative efficiency
and could positively affect competition by permitting investors to choose whether to invest in
certain funds based on this information. However, the disclosure of sponsor support could
advantage larger funds and fund groups, if a fund sponsor’s ability to provide financial support to
a fund is perceived to be a competitive benefit. The disclosure of fees and gates also could
advantage larger funds and fund groups if the ability to provide financial support reduces or
eliminates the need to impose fees and/or gates (the imposition of which presumably would be

1032

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at text following n.629.

328

perceived to be a competitive detriment). Additionally, if investors move their assets among
money market funds or decide to invest in investment products other than money market funds
as a result of the proposed disclosure requirements, the competitive stance of certain money
market funds, or the money market fund industry generally, could be adversely affected.
The disclosure of affiliate financial support could have additional effects on capital
formation, depending on whether investors interpret financial support as a sign of money market
fund strength or weakness. If sponsor support (or the lack of need for sponsor support) were
understood to be a sign of fund strength, the requirements could enhance capital formation by
promoting stability within the money market fund industry. On the other hand, the disclosure
requirements could detract from capital formation if sponsor support were understood to indicate
fund weakness and make money market funds more susceptible to heavy redemptions during
times of stress, or if money market fund investors decide to move their money out of money
market funds entirely and not put it into an alternative with similar types of assets as a result.
We did not receive comments on this aspect of our economic analysis. Similarly, the
requirement to disclose historical redemption fees and gates could either promote or hinder
capital formation. Disclosing the prior imposition of fees or gates may negatively impact capital
formation if investors view the imposition of fees and gates unfavorably. Conversely, the
requirement to disclose will allow investors to differentiate funds based on the extent to which
funds have imposed fees and gates in the past, which could increase capital formation if investors
perceive the absence of past fees and gates as a sign of greater stability within the money market
fund industry. Furthermore, these required disclosures could assist the Commission in
overseeing money market funds and developing regulatory policy affecting the money market

329

fund industry, which might affect capital formation positively if the resulting more efficient or
more effective regulatory framework encouraged investors to invest in money market funds. The
Commission cannot estimate the quantitative benefits of the amendments to the disclosure forms
because of uncertainty about how increased transparency may affect different investors’ or
groups of investors’ understanding of the risks associated with money market funds. Uncertainty
regarding how the proposed disclosure may affect different investors’ behavior likewise makes it
difficult for the Commission to measure the quantitative benefits of the proposed requirements.
As a possible alternative, we could have chosen to require disclosure, as suggested by
commenters, of the historical information on Form N-MFP, Form N-CR, or Form N-CSR instead
of through the SAI. Because the historical disclosures are intended to benefit both investors and
regulators, we believe that the SAI is the most suitable format for such disclosure. As discussed
above, we believe that including historical information about affiliate financial support and the
imposition of fees and gates in the fund’s SAI may make this information more readily available
to investors than disclosure on other SEC forms that are solely accessible on EDGAR. We
therefore believe that requiring this disclosure to appear in a fund’s SAI could increase
informational efficiency by facilitating the provision of this information to investors.
We believe that all money market funds will incur one-time and ongoing annual costs to
update their registration statements, as well as their advertising and sales materials. The proposal
estimated the costs that would be incurred under the fees and gates alterative separately from
those that would be incurred under the floating NAV alternative. Under the fees and gates
alternative, the proposal estimated that the average one-time costs for a money market fund
(except government money market funds that are not subject to the fees and gates requirements

330

pursuant to rule 2a-7(c)(2)(iii)) to amend its registration statement and to update its advertising
and sales materials would be $3,092, 1033 and the average one-time costs for a government fund
that is not subject to the fees and gates requirements pursuant to rule 2a-7(c)(2)(iii) would be
$2,204. 1034 The proposal also estimated that the average annual costs for a money market fund
(except government money market funds that are not subject to the fees and gates requirements
pursuant to rule 2a-7(c)(2)(iii)) to amend its registration statement would be $296, 1035 and the
average annual costs for a government fund that is not subject to the fees and gates requirements
pursuant to rule 2a-7(c)(2)(iii) would be $148. 1036

1033

This figure incorporates the costs estimated for each fund to comply with the proposed amendments to
Form N-1A relating to the fees and gates proposal, as well as the Form N-1A requirements relating to the
fees and gates proposal that would not necessitate form amendments ($1,480) + the costs estimated for each
fund to comply with the proposed Form N-1A sponsor support disclosure requirements ($148) = $1,628.
The estimated costs included in section III.B.8 of the Proposing Release inadvertently omitted the costs
estimated for each fund to update the fund’s advertising and sales materials to include the required risk
disclosure statement; however, these costs ($1,464) were discussed in the Paperwork Reduction Act
Analysis section of the Proposing Release. Adding these costs ($1,464) to the costs of complying with the
new requirements of Form N-1A ($1,628) results in total estimated costs of $3,092. See Proposing
Release, supra note 25, at nn.461, 628, 1214 and accompanying text.

historical instances in which the fund has received financial support from a sponsor or fund affiliate ($148).

Under the floating NAV alternative, the proposal estimated that the average one-time
costs that would be incurred for a floating NAV money market fund to amend its registration
statement and update its advertising and sales materials would be $3,092, 1037 and the average
one-time costs for a government or retail money market fund would be $2,204. 1038 The proposal
also estimated that the average annual costs for a money market fund to amend its registration
statement would be $148. 1039
We requested comment on the estimates of the operational costs associated with the
amended disclosure requirements. Certain commenters generally noted that complying with all
of the new disclosure requirements, including the disclosure requirements involving the fund’s
advertisements and sales materials and its registration statement, would involve some additional

costs. 1040 Several commenters provided dollar estimates of the initial costs to implement a fees
and gates or floating NAV regime and noted that these estimates would include the costs of
related disclosure, but these commenters did not specifically break out the disclosure-related
costs in their estimates. 1041 One commenter stated that the costs to update a fund’s registration
statement to reflect the new fees and gates and floating NAV requirements would be “minimal
when compared to other costs.” 1042 Another commenter stated that it did not consider the
disclosure requirements burdensome and noted that it did not believe the disclosure requirements
would impose unnecessary costs. 1043 We have considered the comments we received on the new
disclosure requirements, and we have determined not to change the assumptions we used in our
cost estimates in response to these comments, as the comments provided no specific suggestions
or critiques regarding our methods for estimating these costs. However, our current estimates
reflect the fact that the amendments we are adopting today combine the floating NAV and fees
and gates proposal alternatives into one unified approach, and also incorporate updated industry
data.
We anticipate that money market funds will incur costs to (i) amend the fund’s
advertising and sales materials (including the fund’s website) to include the required risk

See, e.g., Fin. Svcs. Roundtable Comment Letter (noting that the proposed disclosure requirements
generally would produce “significant cost to the fund and ultimately to the fund’s investors”); SSGA
Comment Letter (urging the Commission to consider the “substantial administrative, operational, and
expense burdens” of the proposed disclosure-related amendments); Chapin Davis Comment Letter (noting
that the disclosure- and reporting-related amendments will result in increased costs in the form of fund staff
salaries, or consultant, accountant, and lawyer hourly rates, that will ultimately be borne in large part by
investors and portfolio issuers).

disclosure statement; (ii) amend the fund’s registration statement to include the required risk
disclosure statement, disclosure of the tax consequences and effects on fund operations of a
floating NAV (as applicable), and the effects of fees and gates on redemptions (as applicable);
(iii) amend the fund’s registration statement to disclose post-compliance-period historical
occasions on which the fund has considered or imposed liquidity fees or gates; and (iv) amend
the fund’s registration statement to disclose post-compliance-period historical instances in which
the fund has received financial support from a sponsor or fund affiliate. These costs will include
initial, one-time costs, as well as ongoing costs. Each money market fund in a fund complex
might not incur these costs individually.
We estimate that the average one-time costs for a money market fund (except
government money market funds that are not subject to the fees and gates requirements pursuant
to rule 2a-7(c)(2)(iii), and floating NAV money market funds) to comply with these disclosure
requirements would be $3,059 (plus printing costs). 1044 We estimate that the average one-time
costs for a government money market fund that is not subject to the fees and gates requirements
pursuant to rule 2a-7(c)(2)(iii) to comply with these disclosure requirements would be $2,102
(plus printing costs). 1045 Finally, we estimate that the average one-time costs for floating NAV

costs we estimated for each fund to update the fund’s advertising and sales materials to include the required

paperwork-related costs and are discussed in more detail infra at sections IV.F and IV.G.

costs we estimated for each fund to update the fund’s advertising and sales materials to include the required

334

money market funds to comply with these disclosure requirements would be $4,016 (plus
printing costs). 1046
Ongoing compliance costs include the costs for money market funds periodically to: (i)
review and update the fund’s registration statement disclosure regarding historical occasions on
which the fund has considered or imposed liquidity fees or gates (as applicable); (ii) review and
update the fund’s registration statement disclosure regarding historical instances in which the
fund has received financial support from a sponsor or fund affiliate; and (iii) inform investors of
any fees or gates currently in place (as applicable) or the transition to a floating NAV (as
applicable) by means of a prospectus supplement. Because the required registration statement
disclosure overlaps with the information that a fund must disclose on Parts C, E, F, and G of
Form N-CR, we anticipate that the costs a fund will incur to draft and finalize the disclosure that
will appear in its registration statement and on its website will largely be incurred when the fund
files Form N-CR, as discussed below in section III.F. We estimate that a fund (besides a
government money market fund that is not subject to the fees and gates requirements pursuant to
rule 2a-7(c)(2)(iii)) will incur average annual costs of $319 to comply with these disclosure
requirements. 1047 We also estimate that a government money market fund that is not subject to

risk disclosure statement ($1,464) = $2,102. The costs associated with these activities are all
paperwork-related costs and are discussed in more detail infra at sections IV.F and IV.G.
1046

This figure incorporates the costs we estimated for each fund to update its registration statement to include
the required disclosure statement, the required disclosure about the effects that fees and gates may have on
shareholder redemptions, disclosure about historical occasions on which the fund has considered or
imposed liquidity fees or gates, the required tax- and operations-related disclosure about a floating NAV,
and disclosure about financial support received by the fund ($2,552) + the costs we estimated for each fund
to update the fund’s advertising and sales materials to include the required risk disclosure statement
($1,464) = $4,016. The costs associated with these activities are all paperwork-related costs and are
discussed in more detail infra at sections IV.F and IV.G.

1047

This figure incorporates the costs we estimated for each fund to review and update its registration statement

335

the fees and gates requirements pursuant to rule 2a-7(c)(2)(iii) will incur average annual costs of
$160 to comply with these disclosure requirements. 1048

Website Disclosure
a.

Daily Disclosure of Daily and Weekly Liquid Assets

We are adopting, as proposed, amendments to rule 2a-7 that require money market funds
to disclose prominently on their websites the percentage of the fund’s total assets that are
invested in daily and weekly liquid assets, as of the end of each business day during the
preceding six months. 1049 The amendments we are adopting would require, as proposed, a fund
to maintain a schedule, chart, graph, or other depiction on its website showing historical
information about its investments in daily liquid assets and weekly liquid assets for the previous
six months,1050 and would require the fund to update this historical information each business
day, as of the end of the preceding business day. Several commenters supported the disclosure

disclosure regarding historical occasions on which the fund has considered or imposed liquidity fees or
gates, and to inform investors of any fees or gates currently in place (as appropriate) or the transition to a
floating NAV (as appropriate) by means of a prospectus supplement ($159.5) + the costs we estimated for
each fund to review and update its registration statement disclosure regarding historical instances in which
the fund has received financial support from a sponsor or fund affiliate ($159.5) = $319. The costs
associated with these activities are all paperwork-related costs and are discussed in more detail infra at
section IV.G.
1048

This figure incorporates the costs we estimated for each fund to review and update its registration statement
disclosure regarding historical instances in which the fund has received financial support from a sponsor or
fund affiliate (approximately $160). The costs associated with these activities are all paperwork-related
costs and are discussed in more detail infra at section IV.G.

1049

See rule 2a-7(a)(4). As proposed, a “business day,” defined in rule 2a-7 as “any day, other than Saturday,
Sunday, or any customary business holiday,” would end after 11:59 p.m. on that day.

1050

For purposes of the required website disclosure of daily and weekly liquid assets, the six-month look-back
period for disclosure would encompass fund data that occurs prior to the compliance date. Accordingly, if
a fund were to update its website on the compliance date to include the required schedule, chart, graph, or
other depiction showing historical data for the previous six months, the depiction would show data from six
months prior to the compliance date. See infra note 2201.

336

on a fund’s website of the fund’s daily liquid assets and weekly liquid assets. 1051 Commenters
supporting such disclosure noted that daily disclosure of this information would promote
transparency and help investors better understand money market fund risks. 1052 A few
commenters stated that providing this information could help investors evaluate whether a fund
is positioned to meet redemptions or could approach a threshold where a fee or gate could be
imposed. 1053 A number of commenters suggested that daily disclosure likely would impose
external market discipline on portfolio managers and encourage careful management of daily and
weekly assets. 1054 Finally, several commenters indicated that many money market funds are
already disclosing such information on either a daily or a weekly basis, a fact we noted in the
Proposing Release. 1055
Other commenters, however, opposed certain aspects of the proposed amendment. Two
commenters opposed daily disclosure of this information and thought the information could be
provided on a weekly basis. 1056 We disagree. In times of market stress, money market funds
may face rapid, heavy redemptions, which could quickly affect their liquidity. 1057 Having daily
information in times of market stress can reduce uncertainty, providing investors assurance that a
money market fund has sufficient liquidity to withstand the potential for heavy redemptions.

337

One commenter opposed the six-month look-back because it would require a restructuring of
fund websites that are already disclosing this data. 1058 We recognize, as discussed below, that the
amendments will impose costs on funds. We believe, however, that it is important for funds to
provide historical information for the prior six months, and updating such information daily will
help investors place current information in context and thus have a more complete picture of
current events.
One commenter argued that daily disclosure of this information would not be meaningful
to investors, 1059 while another commenter expressed concern that daily disclosure, in combination
with discretionary fees and gates, could cause reactionary redemptions. 1060 We recognize and
have considered the risk that daily disclosure of weekly liquid assets and daily liquid assets could
trigger heavy redemptions in some situations, particularly the risk of pre-emptive redemptions in
anticipation of a potential fee or gate. However, as discussed in detail above, the board’s
discretion to impose a fee or a gate, among other things, mitigates the concern that investors will
be able to accurately predict such an event which in turn would lead them to pre-emptively
withdraw their assets from the fund. 1061 In addition, as discussed above, other aspects of today’s
amendments further mitigate the risks of pre-emptive runs. We believe that daily disclosure of
weekly liquid assets and daily liquid assets ultimately benefits investors and could both increase
stability and decrease risk in the financial markets. 1062 As mentioned above, while there is a

1060

See Federated VIII Comment Letter; see also supra section III.A.1.c.i.

1061

See supra note 171 and accompanying text.

1062

Although not a principal basis for our decision, we note that certain literature suggests that suspensions of

338

potential for heavy redemptions in response to a decrease in liquidity, the increased transparency
could reduce run risk in cases where it shows investors that a fund has sufficient liquidity to
withstand market stress events. We also agree with commenters and believe that daily disclosure
will increase market discipline, which could ultimately deter situations that could lead to heavy
redemptions. 1063 Also, as noted elsewhere in this Release, we believe that the reforms we are
adopting concerning fees and gates are a tool for handling heavy redemptions once they occur.
Finally, we note that several funds have already voluntarily begun disclosing liquidity
information on their websites. 1064
A few commenters also believed that the proposed disclosures should apply only to stable
NAV funds. 1065 We disagree with these commenters. We believe that the benefits we discuss
throughout this section regarding disclosure apply regardless of whether a fund has a stable or
floating NAV. As we have noted in several instances, a floating NAV may reduce but does not
eliminate the risk of heavy redemptions if the fund comes under stress. Liquidity information
can help investors understand a fund’s ability to withstand heavy redemptions. Additionally, this
information is relevant to investors to understand the potential for either a floating NAV fund or
a stable NAV fund to impose a fee or a gate. We also believe that it is important for all money
market funds, both floating NAV funds and stable NAV funds, to disclose liquidity information
so that investors will easily be able to compare this data point, which could be seen as a risk
withdrawals can prevent bank runs. See, e.g., Diamond, Douglas W., Spring 2007, “Banks and Liquidity
Creation: A Simple Exposition of the Diamond-Dybvig Model,” Economic Quarterly, Volume 93, Number
2, 189-200.

metric, across funds when making investment decisions among types of money market funds
(e.g., comparing an institutional prime money market fund to a government money market fund),
as well as between money market funds of the same type (e.g., comparing two government
money market funds).
We continue to believe that daily website disclosure of a fund’s daily liquid assets and
weekly liquid assets will increase transparency and enhance investors’ understanding of money
market fund risks. This disclosure will help investors understand how funds are managed, as
well as help them monitor, in near real-time, a fund’s ability to satisfy redemptions in various
market conditions, including episodes of market turbulence. We also agree with commenters
and believe that this disclosure will encourage market discipline on fund managers. 1066 In
particular, we believe that this disclosure will encourage fund managers to manage the fund’s
liquidity in a manner that makes it less likely that the fund crosses a threshold where a fee or gate
could be imposed, and also discourage month-end “window dressing” (in this context, the
practice of periodically increasing the daily liquid assets and/or weekly liquid assets in a fund’s
portfolio, such that the fund’s month-end reporting will reflect certain liquidity levels, and then
decreasing the fund’s investment in such assets shortly after the fund’s month-end reporting
calculations have been made).
b.

Daily Disclosure of Net Shareholder Flows

We are also adopting, as proposed, amendments to rule 2a-7 that require money market
funds to disclose prominently on their websites the fund’s daily net inflows or outflows, as of the

1066

See supra note 1054.

340

end of the previous business day, during the preceding six months.1067 As proposed, the
amendments we are adopting would require a fund to maintain a schedule, chart, graph, or other
depiction on its website showing historical information about its net inflows or outflows for the
previous six months, 1068 and would require the fund to update this historical information each
business day, as of the end of the preceding business day. One commenter expressed support for
daily disclosure of a fund’s net inflows and outflows, though it opposed the requirement to report
and continually update historical information. 1069 Several commenters objected to website
disclosure of net shareholder flows, noting that money market funds often have large inflows and
outflows as a normal course of business, and these flows are often anticipated. 1070 A number of
commenters suggested that shareholders could misinterpret large inflows and outflows as a sign
of stress even if the flows are anticipated and the fund’s liquidity is adequate to handle them. 1071
Two commenters also expressed concern that a large net inflow or outflow could signal to the
market that the money market fund would need to buy or sell securities in the market, potentially
facilitating front running. 1072
We continue to believe that daily disclosure of net inflows or outflows will provide
beneficial information to shareholders, and thus we are adopting this requirement as proposed.
1067

See rule 2a-7(h)(10)(ii); see also supra note 1049.

1068

For purposes of the required website disclosure of net fund inflows or outflows, the six-month look-back
period for disclosure would encompass fund data that occurs prior to the compliance date. See supra note
1050.

See U.S. Bancorp Comment Letter; Blackrock II Comment Letter; Dreyfus Comment Letter.

1072

See ICI Comment Letter; Legg Mason & Western Asset Comment Letter.

341

In our view, information on shareholder redemptions can help provide important context to data
regarding the funds’ liquidity, as a fund that is experiencing increased outflow volatility will
require greater liquidity. We understand, as commenters pointed out, that many funds can
experience periodic and expected large net inflows or outflows on a regular basis. We believe
that disclosure of this information over a rolling six-month period, however, will mitigate the
risk that investors will misinterpret this information. Information about the historical context of
fund inflows and outflows, which funds can include on their websites, should help investors
distinguish between periodic large outflows that can occur in the normal course from periods of
increased volatility in shareholder flow. Finally, we are not persuaded by commenters who
suggested that information regarding net shareholder flows will promote front-running because
we believe that front-running concerns are not especially significant for money market funds on
account of the specific characteristics of these funds and their holdings. 1073
c.

Daily Disclosure of Current NAV

We are adopting, as proposed, amendments to rule 2a-7 that would require each money
market fund to disclose daily, prominently on its website, the fund’s current NAV per share
(calculated based on current market factors), rounded to the fourth decimal place in the case of a
fund with a $1.0000 share price or an equivalent level of accuracy for funds with a different

1073

See, e.g., INVESTMENT COMPANY INSTITUTE, REPORT OF THE MONEY MARKET WORKING GROUP, at 93
(Mar. 17, 2009), available at http://www.ici.org/pdf/ppr_09_mmwg.pdf (“Because of the specific
characteristics of money market funds and their holdings … the frontrunning concerns are far less
significant for this type of fund. For example, money market funds’ holdings are by definition very shortterm in nature and therefore would not lend themselves to frontrunning by those who may want to profit by
trading in a money market fund’s particular holdings. Rule 2a-7 also restricts the universe of Eligible
Securities to such an extent that front running, to the extent it exists at all, tends to be immaterial to money
market fund performance.”).

342

share price 1074 (the fund’s “current NAV”) as of the end of the previous business day during the
preceding six months. 1075 The amendments require a fund to maintain a schedule, chart, graph, or
other depiction on its website showing historical information about its daily current NAV per
share for the previous six months, 1076 and would require the fund to update this historical
information each business day as of the end of the preceding business day. 1077 These
amendments complement the current requirement for a money market fund to disclose its
shadow price monthly on Form N-MFP (broken out weekly). 1078 Disclosing the NAV per share
to the fourth decimal would conform to the precision of NAV reporting that funds will be
required to report on Form N-MFP and to what many funds are currently voluntarily
disclosing. 1079
Several commenters supported the proposed disclosure requirement of funds’ current
NAV per share. These commenters suggested that daily disclosure of the current NAV per share
would increase transparency and investor understanding of money market funds. 1080 One
commenter noted that the disclosure could impose discipline on portfolio managers, preventing,
for example, month-end “window dressing.” 1081 Finally, as we noted in the Proposing Release,

E.g., $10,000 or $100.00 per share.

1075

See rule 2a-7(h)(10)(iii).

For purposes of the required website disclosure of the fund’s current NAV per share, the six-month
look-back period for disclosure would encompass fund data that occurs prior to the compliance date. See
supra note 1050.

343

several commenters indicated that many money market funds are already disclosing such
information on either a daily or a weekly basis. 1082
Some commenters opposed certain aspects or questioned the usefulness of the proposed
disclosure requirement. One commenter believed that frequent publication of a fund’s current
NAV per share would increase the risk of heavy redemptions for stable NAV funds during a
period of market stress, noting the incentive for investors to redeem if they see the shadow price
fall. 1083 We recognize and have considered the risk that daily disclosure of the current NAV per
share could encourage heavy redemptions when it declines. We believe, however, that daily
disclosure will not lead to significant redemptions and could, as we describe below, both increase
stability and decrease risk in the financial markets. 1084 In particular, we believe that greater
transparency regarding the current and historical NAV per share could help investors better
assess the effects of market events on a fund’s NAV and understand the context of a fund’s
principal stability during particular market stresses. For example, if an investor believes the
values of one or more securities held by a fund are impaired, but does not see that impairment
reflected in the NAV because it is only required to be disclosed once a month, they may sell their
shares in the funds even though there is no actual impairment. Lack of transparency was one of
the reasons cited in the DERA Study as a possible explanation for the large redemption activity
1082

See, e.g., U.S. Bancorp Comment Letter; Blackrock II Comment Letter; J.P. Morgan Comment Letter. But
see Federated VIII Comment Letter (noting that it has not received many “hits” on its website after it began
voluntarily posting information about the current market-based NAV per share of its funds, suggesting that
allowing market forces to determine when such disclosure is valuable to investors is preferable to a “one
size fits all” regulation).

increase stability and decrease risk in the financial markets, see supra notes 1062-1064 and accompanying
text.

344

during the financial crisis. 1085 As one commenter noted, such disclosure could allay concerns
about how a money market fund might be affected by the occurrence of negative market
events. 1086 We also believe that daily disclosure will increase market discipline, which could
ultimately deter heavy redemptions. Also, as noted elsewhere in this Release, we believe that the
reforms we are adopting concerning fees and gates are a tool for handling heavy redemptions
when they occur. Finally, we note that many funds have voluntarily begun disclosing
information about their current market-based NAV per share on their websites, and such
disclosures have not led to significant redemptions. 1087
As with the proposed requirement regarding daily disclosure of liquidity levels, several
commenters supported daily disclosure of a fund’s current NAV per share only for stable NAV
funds. 1088 We disagree with commenters who suggested that daily website disclosure of the
current NAV per share would only be useful for shareholders of stable NAV funds. We believe
that the benefits we discuss above regarding disclosure apply regardless of whether a fund has a
stable or floating NAV. For example, we believe that it is important for all money market funds,
both floating NAV funds and stable NAV funds, to disclose NAV information so that investors
will easily be able to compare this data point, which could be seen as a risk metric, across funds
when making investment decisions among types of money market funds (e.g., comparing an

See Goldman Sachs Comment Letter.

1087

A number of large fund complexes have begun (or plan) to disclose daily money market fund market
valuations (i.e., shadow prices), including BlackRock, Charles Schwab, Federated Investors, Fidelity
Investments, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Reich & Tang, and State Street Global Advisors. See, e.g.,
Money Funds' New Openness Unlikely to Stop Regulation, WALL ST. J. (Jan. 30, 2013).

345

institutional prime money market fund to a government money market fund), as well as between
money market funds of the same type (e.g., comparing two institutional prime money market
funds). The disclosure of the current NAV per share will enhance investors’ understanding of
money market funds and their inherent risks and allow investors to invest according to their risk
preferences. This information will make changes in a money market fund’s market-based NAV
a regularly observable occurrence, which could promote investor confidence and generally
provide investors with a greater understanding of the money market funds in which they
invest. 1089 We note that this disclosure could make floating NAV money market funds appear to
be volatile compared to alternatives like ultra-short bond funds, which are registered mutual
funds that transact at three decimal places (and disclosure of these alternative funds’ NAV per
share, consequently, would likewise show three and not four decimal places). 1090 It is possible
that investors might be incentivized to move their money to these alternatives because they
appear more stable than money market funds. 1091
The Commission continues to believe that requiring each fund to disclose daily its current
NAV per share and also to provide six months of historical information about its current NAV
per share will increase money market funds’ transparency and permit investors to better

See J.P. Morgan Comment Letter; BlackRock II Comment Letter.

But see supra note 521 and accompanying text (discussing staff analysis showing that, historically, over a
twelve-month period, 100% of ultra-short bond funds have fluctuated in price (using 10 basis point
rounding), compared with 53% of money market funds that have fluctuated in price (using basis point
rounding)).

1091

See infra section III.K, for an in-depth discussion about the macroeconomic consequences of the
amendments, including the extent to which the requirements for institutional prime funds to transact at
prices rounded to the fourth decimal place (and also, like all money market funds, disclose their current
NAV to the fourth decimal place each day) could cause investors to reallocate their investments to
alternatives outside the money market fund industry.

346

understand money market funds’ risks. This information will permit shareholders to reference
funds’ current NAV per share in near real time to assess the effect of market events on funds’
portfolios, and will also provide investors the ability to discern trends through the provision of
the six months of historical data. 1092 While some historical data regarding the current NAV per
share will be available through monthly N-MFP filings, 1093 we believe that requiring funds to
place this data on the fund’s website will allow investors to consider this information in a more
convenient and accessible format. In addition to increasing investors’ understanding of money
market funds’ risks, we believe that this disclosure will encourage market discipline on fund
managers, and particularly discourage month-end “window dressing.”
d.

Daily Calculation of Current NAV per Share for Stable Value
Money Market Funds

We are adopting, generally as proposed, amendments to rule 2a-7 that would require
stable value money market funds to calculate the fund’s current NAV per share (which the fund
must calculate based on current market factors before applying the amortized cost or
penny-rounding method, if used), rounded to the fourth decimal place in the case of funds with a
$1.0000 share price or an equivalent level of accuracy for funds with a different share price (e.g.,
$10.000 per share) as of the end of each business day. 1094 Rule 2a-7 currently requires money
1092

One commenter opposed the disclosure of six months of historical information about a fund’s current NAV
per share because it would require a restructuring of fund websites that are already disclosing data. See
UBS Comment Letter. We estimate the costs of modifications to fund websites in the Economic Analysis
section infra.

1093

See infra note 1179 and accompanying text (discussing our expectation that money market funds will be
able generally to use the same software or service providers to calculate the fund’s current NAV per share
daily that they presently use to prepare and file Form N-MFP).

1094

See rule 2a-7(h)(10)(iii); see also text accompanying supra note 1074 for definition of “current NAV.”
Under rule 2a-7 as amended, a floating NAV money market fund is required, like any mutual fund not
regulated under rule 2a-7, to price its securities at the current NAV by valuing its portfolio instruments at

347

market funds to calculate the fund’s NAV per share, using available market quotations (or an
appropriate substitute that reflects current market conditions), at such intervals as the board of
directors determines appropriate and reasonable in light of current market conditions. 1095 We
believe that daily disclosure of money market funds’ current NAV per share would increase
money market funds’ transparency and permit investors to better understand money market
funds’ risks, and thus we are adopting amendments to rule 2a-7 that would require this
disclosure. 1096 Because we are requiring money market funds to disclose their current NAV daily
on the fund website, we correspondingly are amending rule 2a-7 to require funds to make this
calculation as of the end of each business day, rather than at the board’s discretion. We received
no comments on this calculation requirement separate from comments on the related current
NAV disclosure requirement. As discussed above, many money market funds already calculate
market value or, if market quotations are not readily available, at fair value as determined in good faith by
the fund’s board of directors. See rule 2a-7(c)(1); section 2(a)(41)(B); rules 2a-4 and 22c-1; see also supra
note 5 and accompanying text. In addition, under rule 2a-7 as amended, a floating NAV money market
fund is required to compute its price per share for purposes of distribution, redemption, and repurchase by
rounding the fund’s current NAV per share to a minimum of the fourth decimal place in the case of a fund
with a $1.0000 share price or an equivalent or more precise level of accuracy for money market funds with
a different share price (e.g., $10.000 per share, or $100.00 per share). See rule 2a-7(c)(1)(ii). Therefore,
we did not propose amendments to rule 2a-7 that would specifically require floating NAV money market
funds to calculate their current NAV per share daily, because these funds already would be required to
calculate their current NAV in order to price and sell their securities each day. As proposed, rule 2a-7 as
amended would have permitted stable value funds to compute their current price per share, for purposes of
distribution, redemption, and repurchase, by use of the penny-rounding method but not the amortized cost
method. See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.170. Therefore, the proposed daily current NAV
calculation requirement would have specified that stable value funds calculate their current NAV per share
based on current market factors before applying the penny rounding method. As adopted, rule 2a-7 permits
stable value funds to compute their current price per share, for purposes of distribution, redemption, and
repurchase, by use of the amortized cost method and/or the penny rounding method. See rule 2a-7(c)(1)(i).
Therefore, the daily calculation requirement we are adopting, as discussed in this section III.E.9.d, specifies
that stable value funds calculate their current NAV per share based on current market factors before
applying the amortized cost or penny-rounding method. See rule 2a-7(c)(1)(i).
1095

Current rule 2a-7(c)(1). As adopted today, Items A.20 and B.5 of Form N-MFP will require money market
funds to provide NAV data as of the close of business on each Friday during the month reported.

1096

See supra section III.E.9.c.

348

and disclose their current NAV on a daily basis, and thus we do not expect that requiring all
money market funds to perform a daily calculation should entail significant additional costs. 1097
e.

Harmonization of Rule 2a-7 and Form N-MFP Portfolio Holdings
Disclosure Requirements

Money market funds are currently required to file information about the fund’s portfolio
holdings on Form N-MFP within five business days after the end of each month, and to disclose
much of the portfolio holdings information that Form N-MFP requires on the fund’s website
each month with 60-day delay. We are adopting amendments to rule 2a-7 in order to harmonize
the specific portfolio holdings information that rule 2a-7 currently requires funds to disclose on
the fund’s website with the corresponding portfolio holdings information required to be reported
on Form N-MFP pursuant to amendments to Form N-MFP, with changes to conform to
modifications we are making to Form N-MFP from the proposal. We believe that these
amendments will benefit money market fund investors by providing additional, and more
precise, information about portfolio holdings, which should allow investors to better evaluate the
current risks of the fund’s portfolio investments.
Specifically, in a change from the proposal, we are adopting amendments to the
categories of portfolio investments reported on Form N-MFP, and are therefore also adopting
conforming amendments to the categories of portfolio investments currently required to be
reported on a money market fund’s website. 1098 We are adopting, as proposed, an amendment to
Form N-MFP that would require funds to report the maturity date for each portfolio security
1097

See supra note 1082 and accompanying text. The costs for those funds that do not already calculate and
disclose their market-based NAV on a daily basis are discussed in detail below. See infra note 1179 and

using the maturity date used to calculate the dollar-weighted average life maturity, and therefore
we are also adopting, as proposed, conforming amendments to the current website disclosure
requirements regarding portfolio securities’ maturity dates. 1099 Currently, we do not require
funds to disclose the market-based value of portfolio securities on the fund’s website, because
doing so would disclose this information prior to the time the information becomes public on
Form N-MFP (because of the current 60-day delay before Form N-MFP information becomes
publicly available). Because we are removing this 60-day delay, we are also requiring funds to
make the market-based value of their portfolio securities available on the fund website at the
same time that this information becomes public on Form N-MFP. 1100 One commenter supported
the proposed amendments to harmonize portfolio information on Form N-MFP and information
that funds disclose on their websites. 1101
The information that money market funds currently are required to disclose about the
fund’s portfolio holdings on the fund’s website includes, with respect to each security held by the
money market fund, the security’s amortized cost value. 1102 As part of the reforms to rule 2a-7,
we proposed to eliminate the use of the amortized cost valuation method for stable value money
market funds, and to correspond with that elimination, we also proposed to remove references to
amortized cost from Form N-MFP. 1103 To harmonize the website disclosure of funds’ portfolio
holdings with these changes to Form N-MFP, we additionally proposed amendments to the

current requirement for funds to disclose the amortized cost value of each portfolio security;
instead, funds would be required to disclose the “value” of each portfolio security. 1104 As
discussed previously in section III.B.5, the final amendments will permit the continued use of the
amortized cost valuation method for stable value money market funds, and therefore to conform
the changes to Form N-MFP to the final amendments to rule 2a-7, we are not adopting certain
proposed Form N-MFP amendments that would have removed references to the amortized cost
of securities in certain existing items. 1105 However, as proposed, we are amending Items 13 and
41 of Form N-MFP by replacing amortized cost with “value” as defined in section 2(a)(41) of the
Act (generally the market-based value but can also be the amortized cost value, as
appropriate), 1106 and therefore we are also adopting, as proposed, the requirement for funds to
disclose the “value” (and not specifically the amortized cost value) of each portfolio security on
the fund’s website. Because the new information that a fund will be required to present on its
website overlaps with the information that a fund will be required to disclose on Form N-MFP,
we anticipate that the costs a fund will incur to draft and finalize the disclosure that will appear
on its website will largely be incurred when the fund files Form N-MFP, as discussed below in
section III.G. 1107

This disclosure may largely duplicate the Form N-MFP filing, but merely providing a link to the EDGAR
N-MFP filing of this data would not suffice to meet this requirement. We understand that investors have,
in past years, become accustomed to obtaining money market fund information on funds’ websites (see
infra note 1123 and accompanying text), and providing the disclosure directly on a fund’s website would
permit these investors to view this information in conjunction with other required website disclosure about
the fund’s liquidity and current net asset value (see rule 2a-7(h)(10)(ii) and (iii)) without the need to
independently locate and consolidate the information provided by this disclosure.

Disclosure of the Imposition of Liquidity Fees and Gates

We are adopting, largely as proposed, an amendment to rule 2a-7 that requires a fund to
post prominently on its website certain information that the fund is required to report to the
Commission on Form N-CR 1108 regarding the imposition of liquidity fees, temporary suspension
of fund redemptions, and the removal of liquidity fees and/or resumption of fund redemptions. 1109
The amendment requires a fund to include this website disclosure on the same business day as
the fund files an initial report with the Commission in response to any of the events specified in
Parts E, F, and G of Form N-CR, 1110 and, with respect to any such event, to maintain this
disclosure on its website for a period of not less than one year following the date on which the
fund filed Form N-CR concerning the event. 1111 This amendment requires a fund only to present
certain summary information about the imposition of fees and gates on its website, 1112 whereas

1108

See infra section III.F.

1109

See rule 2a-7(h)(10)(v); Form N-CR Parts E, F, and G; see also infra section III.F (discussing Form N-CR
requirements). With respect to the events specified in Part E of Form N-CR (imposition of a liquidity fee)
and Part F of Form N-CR (suspension of fund redemptions), a fund is required to post on its website only
the preliminary information required to be filed on Form N-CR on the first business day following the
triggering event. See Instructions to Form N-CR Parts E and F. A link to the EDGAR N-CR filing would
not suffice to meet this requirement. We understand that investors have, in past years, become accustomed
to obtaining money market fund information on funds’ websites (see infra note 1123 and accompanying
text), and providing the disclosure directly on a fund’s website would permit these investors to view this
information in conjunction with other required website disclosure about the fund’s liquidity and current net
asset value (see rule 2a-7(h)(10)(ii) and (iii)) without the need to independently locate and consolidate the
information provided by this disclosure.

1110

A fund must file an initial report on Form N-CR in response to any of the events specified in Parts E, F, or
G (generally, the imposition or lifting of liquidity fees or gates) within one business day after the
occurrence of any such event. A fund need not post on its website the additional information required in
the follow-up Form N-CR filing 4 business days after the event, if such a filing is required. For additional
discussion of the filing requirements provided in Parts E, F, and G of Form N-CR, see infra section III.F.5.

1111

See rule 2a-7(h)(10)(v).

1112

A fund also will be required to present summary information about the historical imposition of fees and/or
gates in the fund’s SAI. See supra section III.E.5.

352

the fund will be required to present more detailed discussion solely on Form N-CR. 1113 The
website disclosure requirements we are adopting regarding the imposition of fees and gates are
similar to the proposed requirements in that they, like the proposed requirements, require a fund
to post on its website only that information about the imposition of fees and gates that the fund is
required to disclose in an initial report on Form N-CR. 1114 In addition, the amendments to rule
2a-7 that we are adopting also require a fund to include the following statement as part of its
website disclosure: “The Fund was required to disclose additional information about this event
[or “these events,” as appropriate] on Form N-CR and to file this form with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Any Form N-CR filing submitted by the Fund is available on the
EDGAR Database on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Internet site at
http://www.sec.gov.” 1115
One commenter stated that it supported the proposed requirement that money market
funds should post on their websites certain of the information required by Form N-CR, noting
that although Form N-CR is publicly available upon filing with the SEC, investors will more
readily find and make use of this information if posted on a particular funds’ website. 1116
Another commenter, however, argued that the proposed website disclosure (and proposed Form

1113

See infra section III.F.5.

1114

As discussed below, we have made changes to the proposed requirements of Form N-CR, and the
information that a fund will be required to file on Parts E, F, and G of Form N-CR is therefore different
than that which was proposed. See infra section III.F.5. The information a fund is required to post on its
website mirrors certain of the information that the fund is required to disclose on Form N-CR. To the extent
Form N-CR disclosure requirements that we are adopting have been modified from the proposed
requirements, the website disclosure requirements have also been modified.

N-CR) filings are redundant and that it would be challenging to comply with a one-day time
frame, and also argued that the registration statement and website disclosure to investors should
take priority over the Form N-CR filing. 1117 One commenter also supported a requirement for a
money market fund to notify shareholders individually in order to allow a money market fund to
apply a fee or gate. 1118
As discussed below, we continue to believe that certain information required to be
disclosed on Form N-CR must be filed with the Commission within one business day and that
this information should also be posted on the fund’s website within the same time-frame to help
ensure that the Commission, investors generally, shareholders in each particular fund, and other
market observers are all provided with these critical alerts as quickly as possible. 1119 Because we
believe that these different parties all have a significant interest in receiving this information very
quickly, we do not agree with the commenter who argued that website and registration disclosure
should take priority over the Form N-CR filing. 1120 We believe that it is important for a money
market fund that may impose fees and gates to inform existing and prospective shareholders on
its website when: (i) the fund’s weekly liquid assets fall below 10% of its total assets; (ii) the
fund’s weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets and the board of directors imposes a
liquidity fee pursuant to rule 2a-7; (iii) the fund’s board of directors temporarily suspends the
1117

See Dreyfus Comment Letter; see also infra notes 1308 and 1309 and accompanying text.

1118

See HSBC Comment Letter. We are not imposing such an individual shareholder notification requirement
because we believe the costs of such notification may be extremely high, the notification process might
take significant time, and shareholders should be able to get effective notice on a fund’s website.

fund’s redemptions pursuant to rule 2a-7; or (iv) a liquidity fee has been removed or fund
redemptions have been resumed. This information is particularly meaningful for shareholders to
receive, as it could influence prospective shareholders’ decision to purchase shares of the fund,
as well as current shareholders’ decision or ability to sell fund shares. We also note, as discussed
in more detail in the Paperwork Reduction Act analysis section below, 1121 that we believe the
burdens a fund would incur to draft and finalize the disclosure that would appear on its website
would largely be incurred when the fund files Form N-CR, and therefore we do not believe that
the one-day time-frame for updating the disclosure on the fund’s website should be overly
burdensome.
We maintain our belief that website disclosure provides important transparency to
shareholders regarding occasions on which a particular fund’s weekly liquid assets have dropped
below certain thresholds, or a fund has imposed or removed a liquidity fee or gate, because many
investors currently obtain important fund information on the fund’s website. 1122 We understand
that investors have become accustomed to obtaining money market fund information on funds’
websites, and therefore we believe that website disclosure provides significant informational
accessibility to shareholders and the format and timing of this disclosure serves a different
purpose than the Form N-CR filing requirement. 1123 While we believe that it is important to have

For example, fund investors may access the fund’s proxy voting guidelines, and proxy vote report, as well
as the fund’s prospectus, SAI, and shareholder reports if the fund uses a summary prospectus, on the fund
website.

See, e.g., 2010 Adopting Release, supra note 16 (adopting amendments to rule 2a-7 requiring money
market funds to disclose information about their portfolio holdings each month on their websites);

File No. FSOC–2012–0003) (noting that some industry participants now post on their websites portfolio

355

a uniform, central place for investors to access the required disclosure, we note that nothing in
these amendments would prevent a fund from supplementing its Form N-CR filing and website
posting with complementary shareholder communications, such as a press release or social
media update disclosing a fee or gate imposed by the fund.
We believe that the one-year minimum time frame for website disclosure is appropriate
because this time frame would effectively oblige a fund to post the required information in the
interim period until the fund files an annual post-effective amendment updating its registration
statement, which would incorporate the same information. 1124 Although a fund may inform
prospective investors of any redemption fee or gate currently in place by means of a prospectus
supplement, 1125 the prospectus supplement would not inform prospective and current
shareholders of any fees or gates that were imposed, and then were removed, during the previous
12 months.
In addition, a fund currently must update its registration statement to reflect any material
changes by means of a post-effective amendment or a prospectus supplement (or “sticker”)
pursuant to rule 497 under the Securities Act. In order to meet this requirement, and as discussed
in the Proposing Release, 1126 a money market fund that imposes a redemption fee or gate should
consider informing prospective investors of any fees or gates currently in place by means of a

holdings-related information beyond that which is required by the money market reforms adopted by the
Commission in 2010, as well as daily disclosure of market value per share); see also infra note 1454

shadow prices on the fund website).

Disclosure of Sponsor Support

We are also amending rule 2a-7 to require that a fund post prominently on its website
substantially the same information that the fund is required to report to the Commission on Form
N-CR regarding the provision of financial support to the fund. 1128 The amendments that we are
adopting reflect certain modifications from the proposal to address commenter concerns.
Specifically, the proposal would have required a fund to post on its website substantially the
same information that the fund is required to report to the Commission on Form N-CR regarding
the provision of financial support to the fund. As discussed in more detail below, we are
adopting amendments to rule 2a-7 that would require a fund to post on its website only a subset
of this information. 1129 In addition, the amendments would require a fund to include the
following statement as part of its website disclosure: “The Fund was required to disclose
additional information about this event [or “these events,” as appropriate] on Form N-CR and to
file this form with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any Form N-CR filing submitted
by the Fund is available on the EDGAR Database on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s
Internet site at http://www.sec.gov.” 1130 A fund would be required to maintain this disclosure on
its website for a period of not less than one year following the date on which the fund filed Form

concerning restrictions on fund redemptions. See supra section III.E.4. The costs of filing such a
supplement are discussed in section III.E.8, supra.

N-CR. 1131
For the reasons discussed in the Proposing Release and below, we believe it is important
for money market funds to inform existing and prospective shareholders of any present occasion
on which the fund receives financial support from a sponsor or other fund affiliate. 1132 In
particular, we believe this disclosure could influence prospective shareholders’ decision to
purchase shares of the fund and could inform shareholders’ assessment of the ongoing risks
associated with an investment in the fund. While commenters also raised concerns about the
potential redundancy of the proposed registration statement, website, and Form N-CR disclosure
requirements, 1133 we believe that website disclosure provides significant informational
accessibility to shareholders and that format and timing of this disclosure serves a different
purpose than the Form N-CR filing requirement. 1134
However, in response to commenter concerns about potentially duplicative disclosure
requirements, we have modified the proposed disclosure requirements and are adopting
amendments to rule 2a-7 that would require a fund to post on its website only a subset of the
information that the fund is required to file on Form N-CR. A fund will only be required to
present certain summary information about the receipt of financial support on its website (as well
as in the fund’s SAI 1135), and will be required to present more detailed discussion solely on Form

that the fund is required to file on Form N-CR within one business day after the occurrence of
any one or more of the events specified in Part C of Form N-CR (“Provision of Financial
Support to Fund”). 1137 A fund thus will not be required, as proposed, to disclose the reason for
support, term of support, and any contractual restrictions relating to support on its website,
although a fund will be required to disclose this information on Form N-CR. 1138 We believe that
the disclosure requirements we are adopting appropriately consider commenters’ concerns about
duplicative disclosure as well as our interest in requiring funds to disclose the primary
information about affiliate financial support that we believe shareholders may find useful in
assessing fund risks and determining whether to purchase fund shares. We also address general
commenter concerns 1139 about the possible duplicative effects of the concurrent website and
Form N-CR disclosures in section III.F.3 below, where we discuss how Form N-CR and website
disclosure serve different purposes. 1140
As proposed, we are requiring the website disclosure to be posted for a period of not less
than one year following the date on which the fund filed Form N-CR concerning the event. 1141
As we stated in the Proposing Release, we believe that the one-year minimum time frame for
website disclosure is appropriate because this time frame would effectively oblige a fund to post

Economic Analysis

As discussed above, and in our proposal, we are adopting a number of amendments to
rule 2a-7 to amend a number of requirements that money market funds post certain information
to funds’ websites. These amendments require disclosure of information about money market
funds’ liquidity levels, shareholder flows, market-based NAV per share (rounded to four decimal
places), and the use of affiliate financial support. 1143 The qualitative benefits and costs of these
requirements are discussed above. These amendments should improve transparency and better
inform shareholders about the risks of investing in money market funds, which should result in
shareholders making investment decisions that better match their investment preferences. We
believe that this will have effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation that are
similar to those that are outlined in the Macroeconomic Consequences section below. 1144
We believe that the requirements could increase informational efficiency by providing
1142

See supra notes 1126-1127 and accompanying text. Of course, in the event that the fund files a
post-effective amendment within one year following the provision of financial support to the fund,
information about the financial support would appear both in the fund’s registration statement and on the
fund’s website for the remainder of the year following the provision of support.

1143

We believe that the effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation related to the amendments to
conform the portfolio holdings website disclosure to our amendments to Form N-MFP will be the same as
those described in the section discussing our amendments to Form N-MFP. See infra section III.G. We
also note that the economic effects related to disclosure of information related to the imposition of fees
and/or gates and sponsor support reported on Form N-CR will be similar to economic effects we discuss
relating to new Form N-CR. See infra section III.F.8.

1144

See infra section III.K.2.

360

additional information about money market funds’ liquidity, shareholder flows, market-based
NAV per share, imposition of fees and/or gates, and use of affiliate financial support, to investors
and the Commission. This in turn could assist investors in analyzing the risks associated with
certain funds. In particular, the daily disclosure of daily and weekly liquid assets, along with the
daily disclosure of NAV to four decimal places, should better enable investors to understand the
risks of a specific fund, which could increase allocative efficiency and could positively affect
competition by permitting investors to choose whether to invest in certain funds based on this
information. However, if investors were to move their assets among money market funds or
decide to invest in investment products other than money market funds as a result of the
disclosure requirements, this could adversely affect the competitive stance of certain money
market funds, or the money market fund industry generally.
Certain parts of the disclosure amendments may have other specific effects on
competition. To the extent some money market funds do not currently and voluntarily calculate
and disclose daily market-based NAV per share data (rounded to the fourth decimal place), our
amended disclosure requirements may promote competition by helping to level the associated
costs incurred by all money market funds and neutralize any competitive advantage associated
with determining not to calculate and disclose daily current per-share NAV. We also note that
our amendment to require disclosure of affiliate sponsor support may adversely affect
competition if investors move their assets to larger fund complexes on the theory that they may
be more likely than smaller entities to provide financial support to their funds.
The requirements to disclose certain information about money market funds’ liquidity,
shareholder flows, market-based NAV per share, imposition of fees and/or gates, and use of

361

affiliate financial support also could have effects on capital formation. The required disclosures
may impose external market discipline on portfolio managers, which in turn could create market
stability and enhance capital formation, if the resulting market stability encouraged more
investors to invest in money market funds. However, the requirements could detract from capital
formation by decreasing market stability if investors redeem more quickly during times of stress
as a result of the disclosure requirements, and one commenter noted this increased risk as a
potential cost to the fund. 1145 The required disclosure could assist the Commission in overseeing
money market funds and developing regulatory policy affecting the money market fund industry,
which might affect capital formation positively if the resulting regulatory framework more
efficiently or more effectively encouraged investors to invest in money market funds.
The requirement to disclose the fund’s current NAV to four decimal places should not
have any effect on capital flows because funds will also transact at four decimal places. When
compared to alternatives like ultra-short bond funds, which disclose and transact at three decimal
places, money market prices may appear more volatile on a day-to-day basis if the greater
precision in NAV disclosure leads to a greater frequency of fluctuations in NAV. 1146 This could
incentivize investors to switch to these alternatives. However, over longer horizons like a month
or a year these alternatives are likely to have more volatile NAVs than money market funds. The
disclosure of daily and weekly liquid assets may increase the volatility of capital flows for

1145

See State Street Comment Letter, at Appendix A. The commenter did not provide a quantitative estimate of
such risk.

1146

But see supra note 521 and accompanying text (discussing staff analysis showing that, historically, over a
twelve-month period, 100% of ultra-short bond funds have fluctuated in price (using 10 basis point
rounding), compared with 53% of money market funds that have fluctuated in price (using basis point
rounding)).

362

money market funds, as it may create an incentive for investors to redeem shares when liquid
assets fall or reach the threshold at which the board may impose a redemption fee or gate.
Disclosing levels of liquid assets could lead to pre-emptive redemptions if daily or weekly liquid
assets drop to a level at which investors anticipate that there is a greater likelihood of the fund
imposing a redemption fee or gate. However, as discussed in detail above, the board’s discretion
to impose a fee or a gate mitigates the concern that investors will be able to accurately forecast
such an event, leading them to pre-emptively withdraw their assets from the fund. We discuss
this concern in more detail in section III.A.
A possible alternative suggested by commenters was to only have website disclosure
apply to stable NAV funds. 1147 Allowing floating NAV funds not to disclose information on
their website would lower the costs for these funds. Nevertheless, we rejected this alternative
because we believe that the benefits we discuss above regarding disclosure apply regardless of
whether a fund has a stable or floating NAV. Both types of funds, for example, could impose a
fee or a gate so this information is valuable to both types of investors and, if only offered to one,
could affect competition. For example, if a stable NAV investor has more information than a
floating NAV investor about a possible fee or gate, then it is reasonable to assume that a stable
NAV investor would have more confidence in his or her investment. The added disclosure for
stable NAV funds could also increase market discipline in these funds, leading to investors’
increased willingness to participate in this market and increase capital formation in these funds.
Another alternative would have been to require weekly instead of daily website

1147

See, e.g., Legg Mason & Western Asset Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter; IDC Comment Letter.

363

disclosure of the daily and weekly liquids assets and net shareholder flow. 1148 Being required to
disclose this information weekly instead of daily would lower the costs on funds because they
would not have to report daily. However, we rejected this alternative because, as discussed
above, in times of market stress, money market funds may face rapid, heavy redemptions, which
could quickly affect their liquidity. These stresses could happen over a period of a day. As such,
if investors have confidence that they will have the necessary information to make an informed
decision quickly in a time of stress, then this may lead to additional capital for funds. Likewise,
we also believe that daily disclosure instead of weekly could lead to more market discipline
among funds, resulting in investors’ increased willingness to participate in this market, which
could also lead to additional capital for funds.
i.

Costs of disclosure of daily and weekly liquid assets and
net shareholder flows

Costs associated with the requirement for a fund to disclose information about its daily
liquid assets, weekly liquid assets, and net shareholder flows on the fund’s website include
initial, one-time costs, as well as ongoing costs. Initial costs include the costs to design the
schedule, chart, graph, or other depiction showing historical liquidity and flow information in a
manner that clearly communicates the required information and to make the necessary software
programming changes to the fund’s website to present the depiction in a manner that can be
updated each business day. Funds also would incur ongoing costs to update the depiction of
daily liquid assets and weekly liquid assets and net shareholder flows each business day. 1149 The

1148

See Schwab Comment Letter; Federated VIII Comment Letter.

1149

See State Street Comment Letter

364

Proposing Release estimated that the average one-time costs for each money market fund to
design and present the historical depiction of daily liquid assets and weekly liquid assets, as well
as the fund’s net inflows or outflows, would be $20,150. 1150 The Proposing Release also
estimated that the average ongoing annual costs that each fund would incur to update the
required disclosure would be $9,184. 1151
In the Proposing Release, we stated that we believed funds should incur no additional
costs in obtaining the percentage of daily liquid assets and weekly liquid assets, as funds are
currently required to make such calculation under rule 2a-7. One commenter disagreed, noting
that there would be costs because of additional controls associated with public disclosure, but did
not provide a quantitative estimate of such costs. 1152 Two commenters generally believed that
weekly disclosure of the data, as opposed to daily disclosure, would substantially reduce costs to
funds, but they did not provide a quantitative estimate of the difference between the cost of daily
and weekly disclosure. 1153 Additionally, one commenter objected to including historical
information regarding weekly and daily liquid assets and net shareholder flows on a fund’s
website because of the expense involved in restructuring fund websites and maintaining such
information, but did not provide a quantitative estimate of such expenses. 1154 One commenter
also noted the potential cost of the risk of shareholders making redemption decisions in reliance

365

on the disclosed information. 1155 The commenter, however, did not provide a quantitative
estimate for this risk. 1156
We agree that the costs for certain money market funds to upgrade internal systems and
software, and/or engage third-party service providers if a money market fund does not have
existing relevant systems, could be higher than those average one-time costs estimated in the
Proposing Release. However, because the estimated one-time costs were based on the mid-point
of a range of estimated costs, the higher costs that may be incurred by certain industry
participants have already been factored into our estimates. 1157 While requiring weekly disclosure
instead of daily disclosure could reduce costs for funds, we continue to believe that daily
disclosure would convey important information to shareholders that weekly disclosure may
not. 1158 We also believe that the benefits of increased transparency that would result from the
disclosure requirements at hand outweigh the potential costs of reactionary redemptions resulting
from the disclosure. 1159 The Commission agrees that money market funds may incur additional
costs associated with the enhanced controls required to publicly disseminate daily and weekly
liquid asset data, which costs were not estimated in the Proposing Release. The Commission has
incorporated these additional costs into its new estimates of ongoing annual costs.
Based on these considerations, as well as updated industry data, we now estimate that the
average one-time costs for each money market fund to design and present the historical depiction

of daily liquid assets and weekly liquid assets, as well as the fund’s net inflows or outflows,
would be $20,280. 1160 We also estimate that the average ongoing annual costs that each fund
would incur to update the required disclosure would be $10,274. 1161 Our estimate of average
ongoing annual costs incorporates the costs associated with the enhanced controls required to
publicly disseminate daily and weekly liquid asset data. 1162
ii.

Costs of disclosure of fund’s current NAV per share

Costs associated with the requirement for a fund to disclose information about its daily
current NAV on the fund’s website include initial, one-time costs, as well as ongoing costs.
Initial costs include the costs to design the schedule, chart, graph, or other depiction showing
historical NAV information in a manner that clearly communicates the required information and
to make the necessary software programming changes to the fund’s website to present the
depiction in a manner that will be able to be updated each business day. Funds also would incur
ongoing costs to update the depiction of the fund’s current NAV each business day. Because
floating NAV money market funds will be required to calculate their sale and redemption price
each day, these funds should incur no additional costs in obtaining this data for purposes of the
disclosure requirements. Stable price money market funds, which will be required to calculate
their current NAV per share daily pursuant to amendments to rule 2a-7, likewise should incur no
additional costs in obtaining this data for purposes of the disclosure requirements. The
1160

We estimate that these costs would be attributable to project assessment (associated with designing and
presenting the historical depiction of daily liquid assets and weekly liquid assets and net shareholder
flows), as well as project development, implementation, and testing. The costs associated with these
activities are all paperwork-related costs and are discussed in more detail below. See infra section
IV.A.6.b.

Proposing Release estimated that the average one-time costs for each money market fund to
design and present the fund’s current NAV each business day would be $20,150. 1163 The
Commission also estimated that the average ongoing annual costs that each fund would incur to
update the required disclosure would be $9,184. 1164
Certain commenters generally noted that complying with the new website disclosure
requirements would add costs for funds, including costs to upgrade internal systems and software
relevant to the website disclosure requirements, as well as costs to engage third-party service
providers for those money market fund managers that do not have existing relevant systems. 1165
One commenter noted that these costs could potentially be “significant to [a money market fund]
and higher than those estimated in the Proposal.” 1166 However, another commenter stated that it
agrees that those money market funds that presently publicize their current NAV per share daily

See, e.g., UBS Comment Letter (“The SEC also proposed additional information regarding the posting of:
(i) the categories of a money fund’s portfolio securities; (ii) maturity date information for each of the fund’s
portfolio securities; and (iii) market-based values of the fund’s portfolio securities at the same time as this
information becomes publicly available on Form N-MFP. We believe this information is too detailed to be
useful to most investors and would be cost prohibitive to provide. Complying with these new website
disclosure requirements would add notable costs for each money fund that UBS Global AM advises.”);
Chamber II Comment Letter (“With respect to the website disclosure requirements, internal systems and
software would need to be upgraded or, for those MMF managers that do not have existing systems,
third-party service providers would need to be engaged. The costs (which ultimately would be borne by
investors through higher fees or lower yields) could potentially be significant to an MMF and higher than
those estimated in the Proposal.”); Dreyfus Comment Letter (noting that “several of the new Form
reporting and web site and registration statement disclosure requirements . . . come with . . . material cost
to funds and their sponsors”); see also Fin. Svcs. Roundtable Comment Letter (noting that the disclosure
requirements would produce “significant cost to the fund and ultimately to the fund’s investors”); SSGA
Comment Letter (urging the Commission to consider the “substantial administrative, operational, and
expense burdens” of the proposed disclosure-related amendments); Chapin Davis Comment Letter (noting
that the disclosure- and reporting-related amendments will result in increased costs in the form of fund staff
salaries, or consultant, accountant, and lawyer hourly rates, that will ultimately be borne in large part by
investors and portfolio issuers).

on the fund’s website will incur few additional costs to comply with the proposed disclosure
requirements, and also that it agrees with the Commission’s estimates for the ongoing costs of
providing a depiction of the fund’s current NAV each business day. 1167
We agree that the costs for certain money market funds to upgrade internal systems and
software, and/or engage third-party service providers if a money market fund does not have
existing relevant systems, could be higher than those average one-time costs estimated in the
Proposing Release. However, because the estimated one-time costs were based on the mid-point
of a range of estimated costs, the higher costs that may be incurred by certain industry
participants have already been factored into our estimates. 1168 Based on these considerations, as
well as updated industry data, we now estimate that the average one-time costs for each money
market fund to design and present the fund’s daily current NAV would be $20,280. 1169 We also
estimate that the average ongoing annual costs that each fund would incur to update the required
disclosure would be $9,024. 1170
iii.

Costs of daily calculation of current NAV per share

The primary costs associated with the requirement for a fund to calculate its current NAV
per share each day are the costs for funds to determine the current values of their portfolio

1167

See State Street Comment Letter, at Appendix A; see also HSBC Comment Letter (stating that the
proposed disclosure requirements should not produce any “meaningful cost”).

1168

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.1056.

1169

We estimate that these costs would be attributable to project assessment (associated with designing and
presenting the historical depiction of the fund’s daily current NAV per share), as well as project
development, implementation, and testing. The costs associated with these activities are all
paperwork-related costs and are discussed in more detail below. See infra section IV.A.6.c.

securities each day. 1171 We estimate that 25% of active money market funds, or 140 funds, will
incur new costs to comply with this requirement, 1172 because the requirement will result in no
additional costs for those money market funds that presently determine their current NAV per
share daily on a voluntary basis. 1173 The Proposing Release estimated that the average additional
annual costs that a fund would incur associated with calculating its current NAV daily would
range from $6,111 to $24,444. 1174 One commenter stated that it agrees with the Commission’s
estimates for the ongoing costs of providing a depiction of the fund’s current NAV each business
day. 1175 However, most comments on the proposed current NAV disclosure requirement did not
discuss the Commission’s estimates of the costs a fund would incur to calculate its current NAV
per share daily, separate from their discussion of the general costs associated with the proposed
NAV website disclosure requirement. 1176 After considering these comments, our current methods
of estimating the costs associated with the NAV calculation requirement, described in more
detail below, are the same estimation methods we used in the Proposing Release.
All money market funds are presently required to disclose their market-based NAV per

1171

Additionally, funds may incur some costs associated with adding the current values of the fund’s portfolio
securities and dividing this sum by the number of fund shares outstanding; however, we expect these costs
to be minimal.

1172

The Commission estimates that there are currently 559 active money market funds. This estimate is based
on a staff review of reports on Form N-MFP filed with the Commission for the month ended February 28,
2014. 559 money market funds x 25% = approximately 140 money market funds.

1173

Based on our understanding of money market fund valuation practices, we estimate that 75% of active
money market funds presently determine their current NAV daily.

share monthly on Form N-MFP, and the frequency of this disclosure will increase to weekly. 1177
As discussed below, some money market funds license a software solution from a third party that
is used to assist the funds to prepare and file the information that Form N-MFP requires, and
some funds retain the services of a third party to provide data aggregation and validation services
as part of preparing and filing of reports on Form N-MFP on behalf of the fund. 1178 We expect,
based on conversations with industry representatives, that money market funds that do not
presently calculate the current values of their portfolio securities each day generally would use
the same software or service providers to calculate the fund’s current NAV per share daily that
they presently use to prepare and file Form N-MFP. 1179 For these funds, the associated base
costs of using this software or these service providers should not be considered new costs.
However, the third-party software suppliers or service providers may charge more to funds to
calculate a fund’s current NAV per share daily, which costs would be passed on to the fund.
While we do not have the information necessary to provide a point estimate (as such estimate
would depend on a variety of factors, including discounts relating to volume and economies of
scale, which pricing services may provide to certain funds), we estimate that the average
additional annual costs that a fund would incur associated with calculating its current NAV daily
would range from $6,111 to $24,444. 1180 Assuming, as discussed above, that 140 money market

See Form N-MFP Item A.21 and B.5 (requiring money market funds to provide NAV data as of the close of
business on each Friday during the month reported).

1178

See infra section IV.C.3.

1179

One commenter agreed with this expectation. See State Street Comment Letter, at Appendix A.

1180

We estimate, based on discussions with industry representatives that obtaining the price of a portfolio
security would range from $0.25 - $1.00 per CUSIP number per quote. We estimate that each money
market fund’s portfolio consists of, on average, securities representing 97 CUSIP numbers. Therefore, the
additional daily costs to calculate a fund’s market-based NAV per share would range from $24.25 ($0.25 ×

371

funds do not presently determine and publish their current NAV per share daily, the average
additional annual cost that these 140 funds will collectively incur would range from $855,540 to
$3,422,160. 1181 These costs could be less than our estimates if funds were to receive significant
discounts based on economies of scale or the volume of securities being priced.
iv.

Costs of harmonization of rule 2a-7 and Form N-MFP
portfolio holdings disclosure requirements

Because the new portfolio holdings information that a fund is required to present on its
website overlaps with the information that a fund would be required to disclose on Form N-MFP,
we believe that the costs a fund will incur to draft and finalize the disclosure that will appear on
its website will largely be incurred when the fund files Form N-MFP, as discussed below in
section III.G. The Proposing Release estimated that, in addition, a fund would incur annual costs
of $2,484 associated with updating its website to include the required monthly disclosure. 1182
As discussed above, certain commenters generally noted that complying with the new
website disclosure requirements would add costs for funds, including costs to upgrade internal
systems and software relevant to the website disclosure requirements, as well as costs to engage
third-party service providers for those money market fund managers that do not have existing

97) to $97.00 ($1.00 × 97). The additional annual costs would therefore range from $6,111 (252 business
days in a year × $24.25) to $24,444 (252 business days in a year × $97.00).
1181

This estimate is based on the following calculations: low range of $6,111 x 140 funds = $855,540; high
range of $24,444 x 140 funds = $3,422,160. See supra note 1180. This figure likely overestimates the
costs that stable price funds would incur if the floating NAV proposal were adopted. This is because fewer
than 559 active money market funds would be stable price funds required to calculate their current NAV
per share daily, and thus the estimate of 140 funds (25% x 559 active funds) that would be required to
comply with this requirement is likely over-inclusive.

1182

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.672.

372

relevant systems. 1183 One commenter, however, noted that the portfolio holdings disclosure
requirements “should not cause a significant cost increase . . . as long as the information is made
available from relevant accounting systems,” 1184 and another commenter stated that the proposed
disclosure requirements generally should not produce any meaningful costs. 1185 Another
commenter urged the Commission to harmonize new disclosure requirements so that funds
would face lower administrative burdens, and investors would bear correspondingly fewer
costs. 1186 As described above, the portfolio holdings disclosure requirements we are adopting
have changed slightly from those that we proposed, in order to conform to modifications we are
making to the proposed Form N-MFP disclosure requirements. However, we believe that these
revisions do not produce additional burdens for funds and thus do not affect previous cost
estimates. Because the 2010 money market fund reforms already require money market funds to
post monthly portfolio information on their websites, 1187 funds should not need to upgrade their
systems and software to comply with the new portfolio holdings information disclosure
requirements. The Commission therefore does not believe that comments about the costs
required to upgrade relevant systems and software should affect its estimates of the costs
associated with the portfolio holdings disclosure requirements. Based on these considerations, as
well as updated industry data, we now estimate that each fund would incur annual costs of

$2,724 in updating its website to include the required monthly disclosure. 1188
v.

Costs of disclosure regarding financial support received by
the fund, the imposition and removal of liquidity fees, and
the suspension and resumption of fund redemptions

Because the required website disclosure overlaps with the information that a fund must
disclose on Form N-CR when the fund receives financial support from a sponsor or fund
affiliate, or when the fund imposes or removes liquidity fees or suspends or resumes fund
redemptions, we anticipate that the costs a fund will incur to draft and finalize the disclosure that
will appear on its website will largely be incurred when the fund files Form N-CR, as discussed
below in section III.F. The Proposing Release estimated that, in addition, a fund would incur
costs of $207 each time that it updates its website to include the required disclosure. 1189
While certain commenters generally noted, as discussed above, that complying with the
new website disclosure requirements would add costs for funds, 1190 one commenter stated that the
costs of disclosing liquidity fees and gates and instances of financial support on the fund’s
website would be minimal when compared to other costs, 1191 and another commenter stated that
the proposed disclosure requirements should not produce any meaningful costs. 1192 As described
above, we have modified the required time frame for disclosing information about financial
support received by a fund on the fund’s website. However, this modification does not produce

We estimate that these costs would be attributable to project assessment (associated with designing and
presenting the required portfolio holdings information), as well as project development, implementation,

additional burdens for funds and thus does not affect previous cost estimates. Taking this into
consideration, as well as the fact that we received no comments providing specific suggestions or
critiques about our methods of estimating the burdens associated with the Form N-CR-linked
website disclosure requirements, the Commission has not modified the estimated costs associated
with these requirements, although it has modified its cost estimates based on updated industry
data. We now estimate that a fund would incur costs of $227 each time that it updates its website
to include the required disclosure. 1193
F.

Form N-CR
1.

Introduction

Today we are adopting, largely as we proposed, a new requirement that money market
funds file a current report with us when certain significant events occur. 1194 New Form N-CR
will require disclosure of certain specified events. Generally, a money market fund will be
required to file Form N-CR if a portfolio security defaults, an affiliate provides financial support
to the fund, the fund experiences a significant decline in its shadow price, or when liquidity fees
or redemption gates are imposed and when they are lifted. 1195 In most cases, a money market

1193

The costs associated with these activities are all paperwork-related costs and are discussed in more detail
below. See infra section IV.A.6.d.

1194

As we proposed, this requirement will be implemented through our adoption of new rule 30b1-8, which
requires money market funds to file a report on new Form N-CR in certain circumstances. See rule 30b1-8;
Form N-CR.

1195

See Form N-CR Parts B-H. More specifically, adopted largely as proposed, these events include instances
of portfolio security default (Form N-CR Part B), financial support (Form N-CR Part C), a decline in a
stable NAV fund’s current NAV per share (Form N-CR Part D), a decline in weekly liquid assets below
10% of total fund assets (Form N-CR Part E), whether a fund has imposed or removed a liquidity fee or
gate (Form N-CR Parts E, F and G), or any such other information a fund, at is option, may choose to
disclose (Form N-CR Part H). In addition, as proposed, Form N-CR Part A will also require a fund to
report the following general information: (i) the date of the report; (ii) the registrant’s central index key
(“CIK”) number; (iii) the EDGAR series identifier; (iv) the Securities Act file number; and (v) the name,

375

fund will be required to submit a brief summary filing on Form N-CR within one business day of
the occurrence of the event, and a follow-up filing within four business days that includes a more
complete description and information. 1196
We proposed requiring reporting on Form N-CR under both the floating NAV and fees
and gates reform alternatives, but the Form differed in certain respects depending on the
alternative. 1197 Today we are adopting a combination of the alternatives, and therefore final Form
N-CR is a combined single form. 1198
As we stated in the Proposing Release, 1199 the information provided on Form N-CR will
enable the Commission to enhance its oversight of money market funds and its ability to respond
to market events. The Commission will be able to use the information provided on Form N-CR
in its regulatory, disclosure review, inspection, and policymaking roles. Requiring funds to
report these events on Form N-CR will provide important transparency to fund shareholders, and
also will provide information more uniformly and efficiently to the Commission. It will also

email address, and telephone number of the person authorized to receive information and respond to
questions about the filing. See Form N-CR Part A. As proposed the name, email address, and telephone
number of the person authorized to receive information and respond to questions about the filing will not be
disclosed publicly on EDGAR.
1196

A report on Form N-CR will be made public on the Commission’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis,
and Retrieval system (“EDGAR”) immediately upon filing.

1197

For example, under the liquidity fees and gates alternative, we proposed Form N-CR to include additional
disclosures specifically related to liquidity fees and gates, which we did not propose to under the floating
NAV alternative. See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at section III.G.2; proposed (Fees & Gates) Form
N-CR Parts E, F and G. In addition to other changes we are making today to the form, the final version of
Form N-CR includes these additional Parts. See Form N-CR Parts E, F and G. We are also reconciling the
introduction of Part D, which was worded differently under each of the respective main alternatives. See
proposed (FNAV) Form N-CR Part D; proposed (Fees & Gates) Form N-CR Part D; see also, infra note
1263.

provide investors and other market observers with better and more timely disclosure of
potentially important events.
Commenters generally supported new Form N-CR. 1200 For example, one commenter
noted that Form N-CR would generally “[alert] the SEC to issues the funds may be having” and
“[provide] the public with current information that investors need.” 1201 On the other hand, some
commenters also voiced objections, suggesting that the form may be burdensome or redundant,
and also offered specific improvements. 1202 As discussed in more detail below, we are making
various changes to Form N-CR to address some of these concerns. However, while we
appreciate commenters’ concerns about possible redundancies of Form N-CR in light of the
concurrent website or SAI disclosures, we believe each of these different disclosures to be
appropriate because they serve distinct purposes. 1203
2.

Part B: Defaults and Events of Insolvency

Part B of Form N-CR is being adopted largely as proposed. 1204 We are adopting, as

See, e.g., CFA Institute Comment Letter; American Bankers Ass’n Comment Letter; Vanguard Comment
Letter; Schwab Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter.

1201

See CFA Institute Comment Letter.

1202

See, e.g., Dreyfus Comment Letter; Fidelity Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter; Federated VIII
Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter.

1203

See discussion following infra notes 1248 and 1249 and accompanying text.

1204

See proposed (FNAV) Form N-CR Part B; proposed (Fees & Gates) Form N-CR Part B. In the Proposing
Release, we proposed Form N-CR to require a fund to disclose the following information: (i) the security
or securities affected; (ii) the date or dates on which the defaults or events of insolvency occurred; (iii) the
value of the affected securities on the dates on which the defaults or events of insolvency occurred; (iv) the
percentage of the fund’s total assets represented by the affected security or securities; and (v) a brief
description of the actions the fund plans to take in response to such event. See id.
Among the other changes discussed in this section, in the final amendments we are also adding the clause
“or has taken” to the “brief description of actions fund plans to take, or has taken, in response to the
default(s) or event(s) of insolvency” as required by Item B.5 of Form N-CR. See Form N-CR Item B.5.

377

proposed, the requirement that a money market fund report to us if the issuer or guarantor of a
security that makes up more than one half of one percent of a fund’s total assets defaults or
becomes insolvent. 1205 Such a report will, also as proposed, include the nature and financial
effect of the default or event of insolvency, as well as the security or securities affected. 1206 As
we noted in the Proposing Release, the Commission believes that the factors specified in the
required disclosure are necessary to understand the nature and extent of a default, as well as the
potential effect of a default on the fund’s operations and its portfolio as a whole. 1207

We are clarifying that filers should not omit in Item B.5 any actions that they may have already taken in
response to a default or event of insolvency prior to their filing of Form N-CR. In particular, if a fund were
able to complete all actions in response to a default before the deadline of the follow-up filing, it could
have otherwise effectively omitted its entire response to the default from being disclosed in Item B.5. We
believe such an omission would significantly diminish the informational utility of Form N-CR to the
Commission and investors in understanding how a fund has responded to a default.
1205

See Form N-CR Part B (requiring filing if the issuer of one or more of the fund’s portfolio securities, or the
issuer of a demand feature or guarantee to which one of the fund’s portfolio securities is subject, and on
which the fund is relying to determine the quality, maturity, or liquidity of a portfolio security, experiences
a default or event of insolvency (other than an immaterial default unrelated to the financial condition of the
issuer), and the portfolio security or securities (or the securities subject to the demand feature or guarantee)
accounted for at least ½ of 1 percent of the fund’s total assets immediately before the default or event of
insolvency).

1206

Form N-CR Part B, adopted largely as proposed, will require a fund to disclose the following information:
(i) the security or securities affected, including the name of the issuer, the title of the issue (including
coupon or yield, if applicable) and at least two identifiers, if available; (ii) the date or dates on which the
defaults or events of insolvency occurred; (iii) the value of the affected securities on the dates on which the
defaults or events of insolvency occurred; (iv) the percentage of the fund’s total assets represented by the
affected security or securities; and (v) a brief description of the actions the fund plans to take, or has taken,
in response to such event. As proposed, an instrument subject to a demand feature or guarantee would not
be deemed to be in default, and an event of insolvency with respect to the security would not be deemed to
have occurred, if: (i) in the case of an instrument subject to a demand feature, the demand feature has been
exercised and the fund has recovered either the principal amount or the amortized cost of the instrument,
plus accrued interest; (ii) the provider of the guarantee is continuing, without protest, to make payments as
due on the instrument; or (iii) the provider of a guarantee with respect to an asset-backed security pursuant
to rule 2a-7(a)(16)(ii) is continuing, without protest, to provide credit, liquidity or other support as
necessary to permit the asset-backed security to make payments as due. See Instruction to Form N-CR Part
B. This instruction is based on the current definition of the term “default” in the provisions of rule 2a-7
that require funds to report defaults or events of insolvency to the Commission. See current rule 2a7(c)(7)(iv).

1207

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at text following n.703.

378

As stated above, we proposed to require disclosure of the security or securities affected
by the default. 1208 In a change from the proposal, to help us better identify defaulted portfolio
securities, the final form now requires funds to report the name of the issuer, the title of the issue
and at least two identifiers, if available (e.g., CUSIP, ISIN, CIK, Legal Entity Identifier (“LEI”))
when they file a report under part B of the form. 1209 This requirement is similar to what we
proposed and are adopting with respect to Items C.1 to C.5 of Form N-MFP. 1210 In particular,
better identification of the particular fund portfolio security or securities subject to a default or
event of insolvency at the time of notice to the Commission will facilitate the staff’s monitoring
and analysis efforts, as well as inform any action that may be required in response to the risks
posed by such an event. Fund shareholders and potential investors will similarly benefit from the
clear identification of defaulted fund portfolio securities when evaluating their investments. 1211
One commenter expressed concern that publicly identifying a single security that has
defaulted could be problematic if other contextual information about the quality of the fund’s
other holding is not immediately available. 1212 We note that the Form N-CR report will provide
the value as well as the relative size of any defaulted security compared to the rest of a fund’s
portfolio, providing some context for the default. In addition, as further described in section
III.F.6 below, we are also adopting a new Part H of Form N-CR that will permit money market
1208

Proposed (FNAV) Form N-CR Item B.1; Proposed (Fees & Gates) Form N-CR Item B.1.

1209

See Form N-CR Item B.1. These requirements are similar to Form N-MFP Items C.1 to C.5 but are
reported on a more timely basis on Form N-CR. Much like under Form N-MFP, we note that the
requirement to include multiple identifiers is only required if such identifiers are actually available.

1210

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at nn.754-757 and accompanying text; see supra section III.G.

1211

Although current rule 2a-7(c)(7)(iii)(A) requires money market funds to report defaults or events of
insolvency to the Commission by email, as proposed, we are eliminating this now duplicative requirement.

funds, in their discretion, to discuss any other events or information that they may consider
material or relevant, which should allow for additional context if necessary.
3.

Part C: Financial Support

We are also adopting a requirement that money market funds report instances of financial
support by sponsors or other affiliates on Part C of Form N-CR 1213 with several changes from the
proposal. 1214 We have modified the definition of financial support from the proposal in response
to comments, as discussed below. This revised definition will affect when Part C needs to be
filed. When filed, the Part C report will, as proposed, require disclosure of the nature, amount,
and terms of the support, as well as the relationship between the person providing the support
1213

See Form N-CR Part C. Today, when a sponsor supports a fund by purchasing a security pursuant to rule
17a-9, we require prompt disclosure of the purchase by email to the Director of the Commission’s Division
of Investment Management, but we do not otherwise receive notice of such support unless the fund needs
and requests no-action or other relief. See current rule 2a-7(c)(7)(iii)(B). As proposed, we are eliminating
this requirement, as it would duplicate the Form N-CR reporting requirements discussed in this section. As
we stated in the text following note 711 of the Proposing Release, the Form N-CR reporting requirement
will permit the Commission additionally to receive notification of other kinds of financial support (which
could affect a fund as significantly as a security purchase pursuant to rule 17a-9) and a description of the
reason for the support, and it will also assist investors in understanding the extent to which money market
funds receive financial support from their sponsors or other affiliates.

1214

See proposed (FNAV) Form N-CR Part C; proposed (Fees & Gates) Form N-CR Part C. In particular, in
the Proposing Release we proposed the term “financial support” to include, but not be limited to, (i) any
capital contribution, (ii) purchase of a security from the fund in reliance on rule 17a-9, (iii) purchase of any
defaulted or devalued security at par, (iv) purchase of fund shares, (v) execution of letter of credit or letter
of indemnity, (vi) capital support agreement (whether or not the fund ultimately received support), (vii)
performance guarantee, or (viii) any other similar action to increase the value of the fund’s portfolio or
otherwise support the fund during times of stress. See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at nn.705-712 and
accompanying discussion. We also proposed Form N-CR to require a fund to disclose the following
information: (i) a description of the nature of the support; (ii) the person providing support; (iii) a brief
description of the relationship between the person providing the support and the fund; (iv) a brief
description of the reason for the support; (v) the date the support was provided; (vi) the amount of support;
(vii) the security supported, if applicable; (viii) the market-based value of the security supported on the date
support was initiated, if applicable; (ix) the term of support; and (x) a brief description of any contractual
restrictions relating to support. In addition, if an affiliated person, promoter, or principal underwriter of the
fund, or an affiliated person of such a person, purchases a security from the fund in reliance on rule 17a-9,
we proposed that the money market fund would be required to provide the purchase price of the security, as
well as certain other information. See Instruction to proposed (FNAV) Form N-CR Part C; Instruction to
proposed (Fees & Gates) Form N-CR Part C.

and the fund 1215 except that, in a change from the proposal, the report will also require certain
identifying information about securities that are the subject of any financial support. 1216
As we noted in the Proposing Release, we believe that requiring disclosure of financial
support from a fund sponsor or affiliate will provide important, near real-time transparency to
shareholders and the Commission, and will therefore help shareholders better understand the
ongoing risks associated with an investment in the fund. 1217 The information provided in the
required disclosure is necessary for investors to understand the nature and extent of the sponsor’s
discretionary support of the fund and will also assist Commission staff in analyzing the economic
effects of such financial support. 1218
1215

See id. Form N-CR Items C.1 through C.10 will require, with changes from the proposal, a fund to disclose
the following information: (i) a description of the nature of the support; (ii) the person providing support;
(iii) a brief description of the relationship between the person providing the support and the fund; (iv) the
date the support was provided; (v) the amount of support, including the amount of impairment and the
overall amount of securities supported; (vi) the security supported, including the name of the issuer, the
title of the issue (including coupon or yield, if applicable) and at least two identifiers, if available; (vii) the
market-based value of the security supported on the date support was initiated, if applicable; (viii) a brief
description of the reason for the support; (ix) the term of support; and (x) a brief description of any
contractual restrictions relating to support. We have also rearranged proposed Item C.4 (description of the
reason for the support) to be new Item C.8 in order to better streamline the disclosures required to be filed
within one business day (Items C.1 through C.7) versus four business days (Items C.8 through C.10). See
infra section III.F.7.

1216

See Form N-CR Item C.6 (now requiring, for any security supported, disclosure of the name of the issuer,
the title of the issue (including coupon or yield, if applicable) and at least two identifiers, if available. We
are including the new securities identification requirements for the same reasons we are including it in Part
B, as discussed above.

1217

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.705 and accompanying text. See also, e.g., Schwab Comment
Letter (noting that the “[p]roposed disclosures around instances of sponsor support would provide investors
with useful context for analyzing the stability of the fund”). In addition, as we discussed at n.712 in the
Proposing Release, money market funds’ receipt of financial support from sponsors and other affiliates has
not historically been prominently disclosed to investors, which has resulted in a lack of clarity among
investors about which money market funds have received such financial support.

1218

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at text following n.708. Another commenter also suggested that
disclosure of financial support on Form N-CR may have the effect of reducing the likelihood that funds will
need such support in the future. See American Bankers Ass’n Comment Letter (“[k]nowing that any form
of sponsor support would be required to be disclosed within 24 hours, fund managers would likely do
everything they could to avoid the need for sponsor support.”).

a. Definition of Financial Support
Although a number of commenters generally supported the proposed financial support
disclosure, 1219 many of these supporters and other commenters also argued that the proposed
definition of “financial support” was ambiguous and could trigger unnecessary filings. 1220 Many
commenters suggested that the catchall provision of the proposed definition, which would
require reporting of “any other similar action to increase the value of the Fund’s portfolio or
otherwise support the Fund during times of stress,” was too broad. 1221 Some commenters stated
that the proposed definition would trigger reports on Form N-CR of routine transactions that
occur in the ordinary course of business, which do not indicate stress on the fund. 1222 For
example, a few commenters suggested that the proposed definition would result in Form N-CR
filings with respect to ordinary fee waivers and expense reimbursements, inter-fund lending,
purchases of fund shares, reimbursements made by the sponsor in error, and certain other routine

1219

See, e.g., Oppenheimer Comment Letter (“…we support the SEC’s proposal to require money market funds
to disclose current and historical instances of sponsor support for stable NAV funds […].”); Schwab
Comment Letter; T. Rowe Price Comment Letter; American Bankers Ass’n Comment Letter; Federated
VIII Comment Letter.

1220

See, e.g., Schwab Comment Letter (noting that the “[p]roposed disclosures around instances of sponsor
support would provide investors with useful context for analyzing the stability of the fund, though we
would note that not all instances of sponsor support are indicative of a fund under even mild stress, let
alone nearing the point of breaking the buck.”); ICI Comment Letter (“We are concerned that the definition
of ‘financial support’ for purposes of the required disclosures is overly broad and would include the
reporting of routine fund matters.”); Federated II Comment Letter; Deutsche Comment Letter; UBS
Comment Letter.

1221

See, e.g., Dreyfus Comment Letter, Deutsche Comment Letter, ICI Comment Letter, Fidelity Comment
Letter; UBS Comment Letter.

1222

See, e.g., Dechert Comment Letter (stating that the “definition of ‘financial support’ is over-inclusive and
would capture certain actions taken in the ordinary course of business that would not signal any financial
distress on the part of the money fund.”); SIFMA Comment Letter, ICI Comment Letter, Federated II
Comment Letter, Vanguard Comment Letter.

382

fund transactions. 1223 Because many of the above actions likely would not indicate stress on a
fund, commenters noted that reporting these actions would not enhance investors’ ability to fully
appreciate the risks of investing in a fund, potentially lead to further investor confusion and
possibly even cause “disclosure fatigue” among investors. 1224 We also were asked to clarify what
constitutes financial support in order to standardize disclosures by different funds. 1225
We appreciate these commenters’ concerns, and are today amending the final definition
of “financial support” to minimize unnecessary filings of Form N-CR and reduce inconsistencies
among different filers. In response to these comments, we are, among other things, modifying
the rule text to specify that certain routine actions, and actions not reasonably intended to
increase or stabilize the value or liquidity of the fund’s portfolio, do not need to be reported as
financial support on Form N-CR, as discussed below. 1226 The revised definition should help

1223

See, e.g., PWC Comment Letter (“… an expense waiver is more often than not a means to limit a fund’s
expense ratio, and not to avoid the NAV falling below $1.00 per share.”); BlackRock II Comment Letter
(“[a]ffiliates and fund sponsors often use a fund as a cash management vehicle and routinely purchase fund
shares. These purchases in no way indicate a fund is under stress.”); Fidelity Comment Letter (noting that
“a ‘(iv) purchase of fund shares’ may be interpreted to include a sponsor’s investment of seed money to
launch a new fund and investment by affiliated funds or transfer agents on behalf of either funds using
MMFs as an overnight cash sweep or central funds investing pursuant to the terms of an exemptive order.”
and that other routine items might include “expense caps, inter-fund lending, loans and overdrafts due to
settlement timing issues, and credits that service providers of a MMF may give as a result of cash held at
the service provider”). See also, e.g., Vanguard Comment Letter, Federated VIII Comment Letter, SIFMA
Comment Letter, Deutsche Comment Letter, ICI Comment Letter.

1224

See, e.g., Federated VIII Comment Letter; Fidelity Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter; SIFMA
Comment Letter; Chamber II Comment Letter.

1225

See SIFMA Comment Letter (stating that clarifying the definition of financial support is “necessary to
standardize disclosures across the industry.”). With respect to the “catch-all” provision of the definition,
see discussion infra and cf., e.g., Dreyfus Comment Letter. Certain of our final changes to the definition of
“financial support” are intended to address concerns about inconsistent disclosures by different funds. See,
e.g., infra notes 1226 and 1232 and the respective accompanying discussions.

1226

In addition, in the Proposing Release, we explained that the instructions specified that the term financial
support included, but was not limited to certain examples of financial support. See Proposing Release,
supra note 25, at n.617 and accompanying text. Similarly, in the proposed Form N-CR, we had included
the phrase “for example” before the definition of financial support, suggesting that this definition was a

383

avoid Form N-CR filings that do not represent actions that the Commission, shareholders, and
other market observers would consider significant enough in evaluating or monitoring for
financial support. Each item of financial support in the definition is the same as was proposed,
except we have deleted “purchase of fund shares” from the definition, we have refined the
“catch-all provision,” and we have added several exclusions, all discussed below.
As we are adopting it today, the term “financial support” is defined to include (i) any
capital contribution, (ii) purchase of a security from the fund in reliance on rule 17a-9, (iii)
purchase of any defaulted or devalued security at par, (iv) execution of letter of credit or letter of
indemnity, (v) capital support agreement (whether or not the fund ultimately received support),
(vi) performance guarantee, (vii) or any other similar action reasonably intended to increase or
stabilize the value or liquidity of the fund’s portfolio; excluding, however, any (i) routine waiver
of fees or reimbursement of fund expenses, (ii) routine inter-fund lending, (iii) routine inter-fund
purchases of fund shares, or (iv) any action that would qualify as financial support as defined
above, that the board of directors has otherwise determined not to be reasonably intended to
increase or stabilize the value or liquidity of the fund’s portfolio. 1227
As some commenters suggested, 1228 we are refining the “catch-all” provision of the

non-exhaustive list of actions that constitute financial support. See proposed (FNAV) Form N-CR Part C;
proposed (Fees & Gates) Form N-CR Part C. In the final amendments, we are eliminating these
qualifications in order to reduce any ambiguity over what else might constitute sponsor support. We also
clarify that the final definition encompasses the entire universe of what does (and does not) constitute
financial support for purposes of Form N-CR. We believe these clarifications, in addition to our other
changes to the definition of “financial support,” will provide for more standardized disclosures across the
industry.
1227

See Form N-CR Part C. This definition is the same as the one we are adopting today for purposes of the
website disclosure of sponsor support. See supra section III.F.3. See also, supra note 1214 for a
description of the proposed definition in the Proposing Release.

1228

See, e.g., Dreyfus Comment Letter (“we recommend that ‘or otherwise support the fund during times of

384

financial support definition. 1229 In the Proposing Release, we had proposed to require disclosure
of “any other similar action to increase the value of the fund’s portfolio or otherwise support the
fund during times of stress.” 1230 Under the final definition, we are changing this provision to
read: “any other similar action reasonably intended to increase or stabilize the value or liquidity
of the Fund’s portfolio.” 1231 In particular, we have eliminated the phrases “otherwise support”
and “during times of stress” contained in the proposed definition to address more general
concerns that the “catch-all” provision was too vague and could be subject to different
interpretations by different funds. 1232 We also eliminated the phrase “during times of stress”
because sponsors may also provide support pre-emptively, before a fund is experiencing any
actual stress. Instead, we believe this new intentionality standard 1233 should serve to reduce the
chance that a fund would need to report an action on Form N-CR that does not represent true
financial support that the Commission or investors would likely be concerned with. By focusing
on the primary intended effects of sponsor support – increasing or stabilizing the value or

market stress’ be eliminated from subparagraph (viii), or revised to be made more specific as to actual
financial support provided. As proposed, this broad ‘catch-all’ provision re-opens the door for debate about
what constitutes ‘instances of sponsor support.’”); ICI Comment Letter.

See Dreyfus Comment Letter. See generally, e.g., SIFMA Comment Letter (with respect to definition of
financial support generally, stating that clarifications are “necessary to standardize disclosures across the
industry.”). But cf., ICI Comment Letter (proposing a modified “catch-all” provision that would retain the
phrase “during periods of stress.”).

1233

See Form N-CR Part C. As noted above, if increasing or stabilizing the value or liquidity of the Fund’s
portfolio is an intended effect of an action, even if not the primary purpose, then it would need to be
reported on Form N-CR.

385

liquidity of a fund’s portfolio 1234 – we believe the revised “catch-all” provision will better capture
actions that the Commission, shareholders, and other market observers would consider
significant in evaluating or monitoring for financial support. 1235 Actions that would likely fall
within this “catch-all” provision include, for example, the purchase of a defaulted or devalued
security at a price above fair value, or exchanges of securities with longer maturities for ones
with shorter maturities.
We have also added exclusions to the definition in a change from the proposal. The
revised definition of financial support explicitly excludes routine waivers of fees or
reimbursement of fund expenses, routine inter-fund lending, and routine inter-fund purchases of
fund shares. 1236 We agree with commenters that the actions we are excluding from the final

1234

To that end, we have also added “or stabilize” and “or liquidity” to what we had originally proposed as the
catch-all provision. See supra note 1231 and accompanying text. We are doing so because we believe that
increasing the value of a fund may not be the only primary intended effect of financial support. Rather, we
believe that stabilizing the value of a fund (e.g., where a sponsor provides support to counter foreseeable
adverse market effects that may otherwise depress the fund’s value), as well as increasing or stabilizing the
fund’s liquidity (e.g., where a sponsor might exchange securities with longer maturities for ones of equal
value but with shorter maturities) may also be intended effects of financial support.

1235

We also considered whether to make this “catch-all” provision (or the definition of financial support
generally) subject to a specific threshold or general materiality qualification. See, e.g., T. Rowe Price
Comment Letter (stating that “if the sponsor is investing in its own fund in order to support the NAV, we
agree that the SEC could consider requiring disclosure [on Form N-CR] if a money market fund’s NAV has
dropped below a certain threshold and the sponsor's investment in the fund materially changes the marketbased NAV.”); Cf., e.g., ICI Comment Letter (among other things, proposing to qualify purchases of fund
shares by adding “to support the fund during periods of stress (e.g., when the fund’s NAV deviates by more
than ¼ of 1 percent)” behind it). However, we are not including a specific threshold (e.g., a specific drop
in the fund’s NAV or liquidity) at this time (to the “catch-all” provision or any other part of the definitions)
because not all types of sponsor support (e.g., a capital support agreement or performance guarantee) may
result in an immediate change in a fund’s NAV or liquidity. The utility of the reporting might also be
diminished with such a threshold if sponsors provided support pre-emptively, before the specified threshold
is met.

1236

Cf., e.g., ICI Comment Letter (proposing to add “nonroutine” before “purchase of fund shares” to “make it
clear that routine affiliate purchases normally should not be deemed “financial support.”).

386

definition are not generally indicative of stress at a fund. 1237 Correspondingly, we have also
deleted purchases of fund shares as one of the items that had been explicitly included in the
proposed definition. 1238 We note that these actions must be “routine” meaning that any such
actions are excluded only to the extent they are not reasonably intended to increase or stabilize
the value or liquidity of the fund’s portfolio. 1239
The final definition of financial support also includes a new intentionality exclusion that
may be invoked by boards. 1240 Under this new exclusion, a particular action need not be reported
as financial support under Part C of Form N-CR if the board of directors of the fund finds that
the action was not “reasonably intended to increase or stabilize the value or liquidity of the
Fund’s portfolio.” We are adding this exclusion as a way to address certain remaining concerns
by commenters about the reporting of actions that might otherwise still technically fall within the
definition of financial support, but are not intended as such. 1241 During times of fund or market
stress, however, we believe that boards likely would find it difficult to determine that a particular
action that is otherwise captured by the definition of financial support should be excluded under
this intentionality exception. We recognize that an action may be made for a number of reasons,

1237

See generally, commenters’ concerns at supra note 1223 and accompanying discussion.

1238

See clause (iv) of the proposed definition, supra note 1227.

1239

If increasing or stabilizing the value or liquidity of the Fund’s portfolio is an intended effect of an action,
even if not the primary purpose, then it would need to be reported on Form N-CR.

1240

See Form N-CR Part C.

1241

See, e.g., Fidelity Comment Letter (“For example, ‘(i) any capital contribution’ could be interpreted to
include a reimbursement of error, as a MMF adviser or sponsor may reimburse a MMF for an error that
occurred whether part of investment operations, investment activity or other services provided by a service
provider to the funds.”) In such a case, a fund’s board might be able to determine that such reimbursement
was not “reasonably intended to increase or stabilize the value or liquidity of the Fund’s portfolio” and thus
would not report the action on Form N-CR.

387

but note that if an intent of the action is to increase or stabilize the value or liquidity of the
Fund’s portfolio, even if that is not the primary or sole purpose of the action, then it must be
reported on the Form. 1242 As is the case with any board determination, boards would typically
record in the board minutes the bases of any such determinations by the board. 1243
b. Amount of Support
In the Proposing Release, we proposed that filers disclose, among other things, the
“amount of support” in Part C of Form N-CR. 1244 One commenter asked the Commission to
clarify the “amount” of financial support that they must report under Part C of the form to avoid
misleading disclosures and to facilitate comparability in disclosures across the industry. 1245 For
example, in the case of a purchase of a security from the fund, this commenter believed that it
may be misleading to report the size of the position purchased as the “amount” supported and
rather thought the amount of support should be the increase in the fund’s NAV that results from

1242

For example, a sponsor might purchase a security from a fund (or take another similar action) to eliminate
potential future risk associated with that security, and may engage in such an action primarily out of
concern for their reputation or other reasons. Nonetheless, if any intent of the action, even if it is not the
primary intent, is to increase or stabilize the value or liquidity of the fund’s portfolio (in the present or
future), then such an action would be reportable on Form N-CR. Similarly, one commenter suggested that
we exclude certain capital contributions provided by the sponsor of an acquired fund in the case of a
merger or reorganization from the definition of financial support for purposes of Form N-CR. See
Federated VIII Comment Letter. We have not done so because in some cases such a contribution might be
reasonably intended to increase or stabilize the value or liquidity of the fund’s portfolio, even if the primary
intent was to facilitate the merger or reorganization. In particular, such a contribution may qualify as a
“capital contribution” for purposes of clause (i) of the proposed definition of financial support. Given that
the capital contribution in the commenter’s example was intended to cover “any net losses previously
realized by the acquired fund” or “if the shadow price of the acquired fund differs materially from the
acquiring fund’s shadow price,” the recipient fund’s board would likely find it difficult to conclude that
such a capital contribution was not reasonably intended to increase or stabilize the value or liquidity of the
fund’s portfolio. Id.

388

the purchase. This commenter also asked that the Commission clarify that SEC staff
interpretations relating to reporting the valuation of capital support agreements on Form N-MFP
would be applicable for these purposes. 1246
Below we are providing guidance to clarify what amounts should be reported specifically
with respect to share purchases on Part C of Form N-CR. With respect to share purchases in
particular, we disagree with the commenter that when financial support is provided through the
purchase of a fund portfolio security, the size of the security position purchased is not relevant in
considering the amount of support. When a distressed or potentially distressed security is
purchased out of a fund’s portfolio, support can be provided in two ways. First, if it is purchased
at amortized cost and the security’s market-based value is below amortized cost, one measure of
the amount of support is the amount of the security’s impairment below amortized cost.
However, the purchase of the security position from the fund also removes this entire risk
exposure from the fund and protects the fund from subsequent further price declines in the
security. Accordingly, we believe that the size of the position purchased from the fund is also
relevant when considering the “amount” of financial support. Therefore, in such a case filers
should report under Part C of Form N-CR the following two separate items with respect to the
“amount” of financial support: (i) the amount of the impairment below amortized cost in the
security purchased and (ii) the amortized cost value of the securities purchased.
In the case of a capital support agreement, historically such agreements have supported a
particular security position while others, as noted by a commenter, may support the market-based
1246

This commenter was discussing Staff Responses to Questions about Rule 30b1-7 and Form N-MFP
updated July 29, 2011, available at http://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/guidance/formn-mfpqa.htm.

389

NAV per share of the fund as a whole. 1247 Where a capital support agreement is supporting a
particular security position, we would consider the amount of reportable financial support on
Form N-CR similar to that described above relating to purchases of portfolio securities. That is,
the “amount” of financial support is the amount of security impairment effectively removed
through the capital support agreement as well as the amortized cost value of the overall position
supported (assuming the entire position is subject to the capital support agreement). For a capital
support agreement that supports the fund as a whole, the amount of reportable financial support
is the amount of impairment to the fund’s NAV per share effectively removed through the capital
support agreement with a notation describing that the capital support agreement supports the
value of the fund as a whole (or the extent of the fund’s value that is supported, if less than the
full amortized cost value).
This guidance differs somewhat from the staff guidance relating to capital support
agreement disclosures on Form N-MFP because the context differs. Form N-MFP already
requires reporting on the overall size of the security position reported (and information about the
size of the fund), so the additional capital support agreement reporting focuses on valuing the
impairment effectively removed through the capital support agreement. Our guidance regarding
“amount” of financial support reportable on Form N-CR for capital support agreements thus
provides similar information to that which could be collectively determined by reviewing various
Form N-MFP line items.

1247

See SIFMA Comment Letter.

390

c. Concerns over Potential Redundancy
One commenter argued that the financial support disclosure in Form N-CR is redundant
in light of the corresponding financial support disclosures in the SAI, raising concerns about the
additional preparation costs and burdens on fund personnel. 1248 More generally, commenters
were also concerned about the redundancy of various other Parts of Form N-CR, Form N-CR as
a whole, and even the various proposed disclosures in the aggregate. 1249 While we appreciate
these concerns and have considered the costs and burdens of Form N-CR, 1250 we note that each of
the Form N-CR and the corresponding website and SAI disclosure requirements serves a distinct
purpose. 1251 Therefore, although we acknowledge there will be some textual overlap between
these different formats, we believe there are strong public policy reasons for requiring the
various different disclosures. We also note that we have required other such parallel reporting
for similar reasons. 1252
Most significantly, Form N-CR will alert Commission staff, shareholders and other
market observers about any reportable events on Form N-CR (including any financial support)
on a near real-time basis. 1253 In particular, Form N-CR will enable the Commission and other
1248

See Dreyfus Comment Letter.

1249

See, e.g., Dreyfus Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter; Federated II Comment Letter; Fin. Svcs.
Roundtable Comment Letter.

1250

We consider and estimate the various costs and burdens of Form N-CR in more detail in infra section
III.F.8 as well as in infra section IV.D.2.a.

1251

We note that there are also certain overlapping disclosures with respect to Form N-MFP, which we
generally discuss in supra section III.G.

1252

For example, money market funds are currently required to disclose much of the portfolio holdings
information they disclose on Form N-MFP on the fund’s website as well. See current rule 2a-7(c)(12)(ii);
current rule 30b1-7; Form N-MFP, General Instruction A.

1253

With respect to the need of the Commission staff, shareholders and other market observers to receive the
alerts on Form N-CR on a near real-time basis, cf. infra notes 1329-1333 and the accompanying text for a

391

market observers to better monitor the entire fund industry, as they will be able to locate on
EDGAR all Form N-CR reports specific to any particular time frame without having to search
through the SAIs of all the funds in the industry. We expect financial news services to be among
the market observers who will benefit from Form N-CR, which in turn could then also alert
investors about these important developments more expeditiously. 1254 Although any
corresponding SAI disclosures will also be available on EDGAR, because SAI filings contain
many other disclosures (including those unrelated to financial support or the other reportable
events on Form N-CR), it could take significant amounts of time for the Commission and other
market observers (such as the aforementioned financial news services) to continually review all
SAI filings for any relevant alerts. 1255 Similarly, we believe it would be significantly more
time-consuming, if not impractical, if the Commission and other market observers had to
continually check each fund’s website for any relevant updates. 1256 We therefore believe that the
corresponding website and SAI disclosures alone would not accomplish the primary goal of
Form N-CR in alerting the Commission, investors and other market observers about important
discussion on the importance of the one and four business day deadlines of Form N-CR.
1254

As noted in supra notes 1211 and 1213, with respect to any portfolio defaults or fund share purchases under
rule 17a-9, we are eliminating the corresponding email notifications to the Director of Investment
Management or the Director’s designee under current rules 2a-7(c)(7)(iii)(A) and (B). Among other
reasons, we are replacing them with Form N-CR is because these email notifications are currently not
publicly available to investors and other market observers.

1255

Even where a fund updates its registration statement with equal promptness as Form N-CR, as noted by the
commenter cited below, it would still likely take the Commission and other market observers extensive
effort and time to continually review all SAI filings for any relevant alerts. See Dreyfus Comment Letter
(stating that “[w]hile the Commission may feel that Form N-CR will provide the information on a more
real-time basis, we expect registration statements also will have to be updated with equal promptness with
these disclosures (via Rule 497 filings with the Commission).”). In addition, as discussed below, we note
that certain Parts of Form N-CR as amended today will require more extensive disclosures than either the
corresponding website or SAI disclosures.

1256

Such website monitoring could be particularly burdensome because the presentation of this information
would likely be different on each fund’s website.

392

events in a timely and meaningful manner. Moreover, we note that certain Parts of Form N-CR
as amended today will require more extensive disclosures than either the corresponding website
or SAI disclosures, 1257 which further minimizes the degree to which there would have been any
functionally overlapping disclosures. Finally, Form N-CR filings will also provide a permanent
historical record of any financial support provided to the entire money market fund industry,
which will be accessible on EDGAR.
On the other hand, we believe that the consolidated discussion in the SAI will be the most
accessible format for disclosing historical instances of sponsor support in the past 10 years, as it
would be a significant burden on the Commission, investors and other market observers if they
had to review various prior Form N-CR filings to piece together a specific fund’s history of
sponsor support, 1258 even in light of the additional costs and burdens faced by funds in providing
these SAI disclosures. 1259 We also believe that, to the extent investors may not be familiar with
researching filings on EDGAR, including these disclosures in a fund’s SAI (which investors may
receive in hard copy through the U.S. Postal Service or may access on a fund’s website, as well
as accessing on EDGAR) may make this information more readily available to these investors

1257

For example, with respect to disclosure of any financial support, funds will be required to disclose on their
websites and in their SAIs only that information that the fund is required to report to the Commission on
Items C.1, C.2, C.3, C.4, C.5, C.6, and C.7 of Form N-CR. See supra notes 993 and 1137-1138 and
accompanying text. We also note that Parts E, F, and G of Form N-CR as amended today will require more
extensive disclosures than the rule 2a-7 and Form N-1A provisions requiring funds to disclose certain
information about the imposition of fees or gates on the fund’s website and in the fund’s SAI. See supra
notes 960 and 1112 and accompanying text.

1258

Given that funds will be required to disclose historical instances of sponsor support for the past 10 years,
the corresponding filings on Form N-CR will provide a permanent record for any instances of financial
support that occurred more than 10 years ago in a single place.

1259

We generally consider and estimate the costs and burdens of the SAI disclosures in infra sections III.F.8
and IV.G.

393

than disclosure on other SEC forms that are solely accessible on EDGAR.
Similarly, the website disclosures are intended to be more accessible than Form N-CR for
individual investors interested in information about particular funds, in particular to the extent
such investors may not be familiar with researching filings on EDGAR. 1260 Given that individual
investors are typically most interested in information about their own (or potential) investments
and do not necessarily monitor the entire fund industry, visiting the websites of a few particular
funds would likely not become overly time-consuming or burdensome for these investors. 1261

Part D: Declines in Shadow Price

Part D of Form N-CR will, as proposed, require funds that transact at a stable price to file
a report when the fund’s current NAV per share deviates downward from its intended stable
price (generally, $1.00) by more than ¼ of 1 percent (i.e., generally below $0.9975). 1262 Today
we are adopting Part D of Form N-CR largely as proposed. 1263 As we discussed in the Proposing

1260

See CFA Institute Comment Letter (“We particularly endorse the proposed requirement that money market
funds would have to post on their websites much of the information required in Form N-CR. While Form
N-CR information is publicly available upon SEC filing, investors will more readily find and make use of
this information if posted on a particular fund’s website.”)

1261

We also generally consider and estimate the costs and burdens of the related website disclosures in infra
section III.F.8 as well as in infra section IV.A.6.

1262

Form N-CR Part D. As stated in the introduction to Part D, with some changes from the proposal, the
disclosure requirement under Part D is triggered “[if] a retail money market fund’s or a government money
market fund’s current net asset value per share deviates downward from its intended stable price per share
by more than ¼ of 1 percent […].” In turn, for each day the fund’s current NAV is below this threshold,
Part D will require, with some changes from the proposal, a fund to disclose the following information: (i)
the date or dates on which such downward deviation exceeded ¼ of 1 percent; (ii) the extent of deviation
between the fund’s current NAV per share and its intended stable price; and (iii) the principal reason or
reasons for the deviation, including the name of any security whose market-based value or sale price, or
whose issuer’s downgrade, default, or event of insolvency (or similar event) has contributed to the
deviation.

1263

See proposed (FNAV) Form N-CR Part D; proposed (Fees & Gates) Form N-CR Part D. Under either
main alternative, in the Proposing Release we proposed Form N-CR to require an applicable fund, if its
current NAV (rounded to the fourth decimal place in the case of a fund with a $1.00 share price, or an

394

Release, 1264 this requirement will not only permit the Commission and others to better monitor
indicators of stress in specific funds or fund groups and in the industry, but also will help
increase money market funds’ transparency and permit investors to better understand money
market funds’ risks. 1265 To better understand the cause of such a decline in the fund’s shadow
price, we are also requiring, largely as proposed, funds to provide the principal reason or
reasons 1266 for the reduction, which would involve identifying the particular securities or events
that prompted the decline. 1267 In a change from the proposal, we are also requiring the disclosure
of the same identifying information included in other parts of the Form. 1268 In particular, the

equivalent level of accuracy for funds with a different share price) deviates downward from its intended
stable price per share by more than ¼ of 1 percent, to disclose the following information: (i) the date or
dates on which such deviation exceeded ¼ of 1 percent; (ii) the extent of deviation between the fund’s
current NAV per share and its intended stable price; and (iii) the principal reason for the deviation,
including the name of any security whose market-based value or sale price, or whose issuer’s downgrade,
default, or event of insolvency (or similar event) has contributed to the deviation. See Proposed (FNAV)
Form N-CR Part D; Proposed (Fees & Gates) Form N-CR Part D. In addition to the other change discussed
in this section, we are making various conforming and clarifying changes in the final amendments to Part
D. In the introduction to Part D, in a conforming change to the other amendments we are adopting today,
we are now referring to retail and government money market funds instead of just to “Fund” as proposed
under the floating NAV alternative or to funds “subject to the exemption provisions of rule 2a-7(c)(2) or
rule 2a-7(c)(3)” as proposed under the liquidity fees and gates alternative). We are also pluralizing the
“principal reason” in Item D.3 to principal reason or reasons,” as there may be several successive or
concurrent causes that resulted in a reduction in the shadow NAV. Furthermore, as another conforming
change, we are inserting the word “downward” before “deviation” in Item D.1 to remove any doubt that
only downward deviations need to be reported, consistent with the introduction of Part D (which already
includes a reference to “downward”).
1264

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at text accompanying n.714.

1265

See generally, supra section III.B.8.a (discussing the potential benefits and costs of the requirement for a
money market fund to disclose its current NAV on its website).

1266

In a change from the Proposing Release, we are pluralizing the “principal reason” in Item D.3, as there may
be several successive or concurrent causes that resulted in a reduction in the shadow NAV.

1267

Form N-CR Item D.3. This item would not require additional analysis or explanation of the principal
reason or reasons for the deviation, beyond identifying the particular securities or events that prompted the
deviation.

1268

See Form N-CR Item D.3 (requiring, for any such security, disclosure of the name of the issuer, the title of
the issue (including coupon or yield, if applicable) and at least two identifiers, if available); see Form N-CR
Item B.1.

395

final amendments to Item D.3 also now require funds to report the name of the issuer, the title of
the issue and at least two identifiers, if available. 1269 In particular, better identification of the
particular fund portfolio security or securities that may have prompted a shadow price decline
will facilitate the staff’s monitoring and analysis efforts, which we expect to help us better
understand the nature and extent of the shadow price decline, the potential effect on the fund,
potential contagion risk across funds more broadly, as well as inform any action that may be
required in response to the risks posed by such an event. Fund shareholders and potential
investors will similarly benefit from the clear identification of a fund portfolio security or
securities that may have prompted a shadow price decline when evaluating their investments. 1270
Some commenters expressed concerns about the reporting of shadow price declines on
Form N-CR. For example, commenters argued that it would be redundant and unduly
burdensome in light of funds’ concurrent website disclosure of the shadow price. 1271 However,
as already discussed with respect to the various concurrent disclosures of financial support in
section III.F.3 above, while we are sensitive to commenters’ concerns about duplication, we
believe it appropriate given the different audiences and uses for such information. 1272
With respect to the particular deviation threshold of ¼ of 1 percent that we are adopting
1269

These changes are similar to what we proposed and are adopting with respect to Items C.1 to C.5 of Form
N-MFP. See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at nn.754-757 and accompanying text; see supra section
III.G.2.f. As under Form N-MFP and with respect to Item B.1, we note that the requirement to include
multiple identifiers is only required if such identifiers are actually available.

1270

With respect to our corresponding changes to Parts B and C of Form N-CR, see also, supra notes 1209 and
1216 and the accompanying discussions.

1271

See Federated VIII Comment Letter (stating that “so long [a]s the current shadow price is publicly
available, Federated does not view such a deviation as a material event that necessitates a separate
reporting.”); Dreyfus Comment Letter.

1272

See discussion following supra notes 1248 and 1249 and accompanying text.

396

today as proposed, one commenter considered this level of deviation to be arbitrary, “as there are
no other implications under Rule 2a-7 for the money market fund if it has a 25 basis point
deviation.” 1273 However, as noted in the Proposing Release, 1274 we continue to believe that a
deviation of ¼ of 1 percent is sufficiently significant that it could signal future, further deviations
in the fund’s NAV that could require a stable price fund’s board to consider re-pricing the fund’s
shares (among other actions). We note that we previously have similarly determined that a ¼ of
one percent decline in the shadow price from its intended stable price is an appropriate threshold
requiring money market funds to report to us. 1275 Moreover, if a Form N-CR filing were not
triggered until a higher threshold such as after a fall in the NAV that would require the re-pricing
of fund shares (such as 0.5%), 1276 the disclosures would come too late to meaningfully allow the
Commission and others to effectively monitor and respond to indicators of stress. We also
believe a threshold of ¼ of 1 percent strikes an appropriate balance with respect to the frequency
of filings, because during periods of normal market activity we would expect relatively few
Form N-CR filings for this part of the form. 1277 In fact, our staff has analyzed Form N-MFP data
from November 2010 to February 2014 and found that only one fund had a ¼ of 1 percent
1273

See Federated VIII Comment Letter.

1274

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.715 and accompanying text.

1275

See rule 30b1-6T (interim final temporary rule (no longer in effect) requiring money market funds to
provide the Commission certain weekly portfolio and valuation information if their market-based NAV
declines below 99.75% of its stable NAV).

1276

See Federated VIII Comment Letter (proposing a deviation of 0.5% as the reporting trigger).

1277

Cf., e.g., State Street Comment Letter at Appendix A (“During the September 2008 failure of Lehman
Brothers Holdings, a large number of money market funds had a ¼ of 1% or greater deviation between the
amortized-cost NAV and the market NAV. During times of market stress similar to the 2008 crisis, our
expectation is that the percentages would be similar. However, during times of normal market activity, our
expectation is that [a ¼ of 1%] or greater deviation between stable NAV and market NAV would be
infrequent.”)

397

deviation from the stable $1.00 per share NAV, suggesting the burden to funds would be
minimal during normal market activity. We note that funds may also provide additional context
about the circumstances leading to the shadow price decline in Part H of Form N-CR, discussed
below.
Another commenter suggested that disclosure of a deviation in the NAV might result in
an increase in pre-emptive run risk, as shareholders could come to use these filings as a trigger
for redemptions. 1278 Although we cannot predict individual shareholder actions with certainty, as
discussed previously, we believe that the transparency provided by this information is important
to the ability of money market fund shareholders to understand and assess the risks of their
investments. Furthermore, while we acknowledge the possibility of pre-emptive redemptions,
some of the other reforms we are adopting today (such as liquidity fees and redemption gates)
will provide some fund managers additional tools for managing such redemptions, if they were
to occur. We also note that some of our responses in section III.A.1.c.i to concerns over
pre-emptive run risk related to the liquidity fees and gates requirement would similarly apply to
run risk concerns over the disclosure of a deviation in the NAV in Part D of Form N-CR. 1279
More generally, we expect that Form N-CR could decrease, rather than increase, redemption risk

1278

See Federated VIII Comment Letter.

1279

For example, as discussed in further detail in section III.A.1.c.i, we expect that the additional discretion we
are granting fund boards to impose a fee or gate at any time after the fund’s weekly liquid assets have fallen
below the 30% required minimum should substantially mitigate the risk of pre-emptive redemptions. As
discussed in supra note 171 and the accompanying text, board discretion concerning when to impose a fee
or gate may reduce shareholder incentive to pre-emptively redeem shares, because shareholders will be less
able to accurately predict specifically when, and under what circumstances, fees and gates will be imposed.
See Wells Fargo Comment Letter; see also Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.362. For similar reasons,
we believe that it is less likely that investors would use these filings under Part D of Form N-CR as a
trigger for redemptions in the first place.

Parts E, F, and G: Imposition and Lifting of Liquidity Fees and Gates

Today we are adopting a requirement that a money market fund file a report on Form
N-CR when a fund imposes or lifts a liquidity fee or redemption gate, or if a fund does not
impose a liquidity fee despite passing certain liquidity thresholds. 1281 As discussed in more detail
below, we are making some changes from what we proposed. 1282 This report, as adopted, will

1280

See American Bankers Ass’n Comment Letter (noting that certain disclosures including Form N-CR
“would exert a discipline on fund advisers to manage assets so conservatively as to avoid raising concerns
among investors about the credit quality of fund investments that could lead to heavy redemptions.”). See
also, infra note 1346-1350 and the accompanying text for our additional discussion of concerns over
widespread redemption risk as a result of Form N-CR.

1281

See Form N-CR Parts E, F, and G.

1282

See proposed (Fees & Gates) Form N-CR Parts E, F, and G. In particular, in the Proposing Release, if, at
the end of a business day, a fund (except any government money market fund that has chosen to rely on the
proposed (Fees & Gates) rule 2a-7 exemption) has invested less than 15% of its total assets in weekly
liquid assets, we proposed to require the fund to disclose the following information: (i) the initial date on
which the fund’s weekly liquid assets fell below 15% of total fund assets; (ii) if the fund imposes a liquidity
fee pursuant to proposed (Fees & Gates) rule 2a-7(c)(2)(i), the date on which the fund instituted the
liquidity fee; (iii) a brief description of the facts and circumstances leading to the fund’s weekly liquid
assets falling below 15% of total fund assets; and (iv) a short discussion of the board of directors’ analysis
supporting its decision that imposing a liquidity fee pursuant to proposed (Fees & Gates) rule 2a-7(c)(2)(i)
(or not imposing such a liquidity fee) would be in the best interests of the fund. Proposed Part E further
included instructions that a fund must file a report on Form N-CR responding to items (i) and (ii) above on
the first business day after the initial date on which the fund has invested less than fifteen percent of its
total assets in weekly liquid assets, and that a fund must amend its initial report on Form N-CR to respond
to items (iii) and (iv) above by the fourth business day after the initial date on which the fund has invested
less than fifteen percent of its total assets in weekly liquid assets. See proposed (Fees & Gates) Form N-CR
Part E.
Similarly, a fund (except any government money market fund that has chosen to rely on the proposed (Fees
& Gates) rule 2a-7 exemption) that has invested less than 15% of its total assets in weekly liquid assets (as
provided in proposed (Fees & Gates) rule 2a-7(c)(2)) suspends the fund’s redemptions pursuant to rule 2a7(c)(2)(ii), we proposed that the fund disclose the following information: (i) the initial date on which the
fund’s weekly liquid assets fell below 15% of total fund assets; (ii) the date on which the fund initially
suspended redemptions; (iii) a brief description of the facts and circumstances leading to the fund’s weekly
liquid assets falling below 15% of total fund assets; and (iv) a short discussion of the board of directors’
analysis supporting its decision to suspend the fund’s redemptions. Proposed Part F further included
instructions providing that a fund must file a report on Form N-CR responding to items (i) and (ii) above on
the first business day after the initial date on which the fund suspends redemptions, and that a fund must
amend its initial report on Form N-CR to respond to items (iii) and (iv) by the fourth business day after the

399

require a description of the primary considerations the board took into account in taking the
action (modified from the proposal and discussed below), as well as certain additional basic
information, such as the date when the fee or gate was imposed or lifted, the fund’s liquidity
levels, and the size of the fee. 1283 Except for the change to the requirement to describe the
primary considerations the board took into account in taking the action, the other changes to
Parts E, F and G generally derive from the amendments to the liquidity fees and gates
requirements that are being adopted today and are designed to conform these Parts of Form
N-CR to those operative requirements. These changes are discussed below. 1284
As we noted in the Proposing Release, we believe that the items required to be disclosed
are necessary for investors and us better to understand the circumstances leading to the
imposition or removal of a liquidity fee or redemption gate, or the decision not to impose one
despite a reduction in liquidity. 1285 We believe such a better understanding will in turn enhance
the Commission’s oversight of the fund and regulation of money market funds generally, 1286 and

initial date on which the fund suspends redemptions. See proposed (Fees & Gates) Form N-CR Part F.
Finally, if a fund (except any government money market fund that has chosen to rely on the proposed (Fees
& Gates) rule 2a-7 exemption) that has imposed a liquidity fee and/or suspended the fund’s redemptions
pursuant to proposed (Fees & Gates) rule 2a-7(c)(2) determines to remove such fee and/or resume fund
redemptions, we proposed to require funds to disclose, as applicable, the date on which the fund removed
the liquidity fee and/or resumed fund redemptions. See proposed (Fees & Gates) Form N-CR Part G.
1283

See Form N-CR Parts E, F, and G. We note that a fund would file a new Part E filing of Form N-CR if it
were to change the size of its liquidity fee after its initial imposition. Observers will also be able to
determine the duration of any gate by comparing initial filings of Part F (suspension of redemptions) with
filings of Part G (lifting of such suspensions).

1284

Also see infra note 1313 for a discussion of our related conforming changes and clarification to Form NCR.

1285

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at text following n.719.

1286

For example, by knowing the reason(s) for why a board imposed a liquidity fee or gate, we expect to be
able to better understand the potential cause(s) that led to a fund experiencing stress, which could inform
our determination as to whether further regulatory or other action on our part is warranted.

could inform investors’ decisions to purchase shares of the fund or remain invested in the
fund. 1287
a. Board Disclosures
A number of commenters objected to the proposed requirement that funds provide a
“short discussion of the board of director’s analysis supporting its decision” 1288 whether or not to
impose liquidity fees or when imposing redemption gates. 1289 Many of these commenters raised
concerns that the disclosures might chill deliberations among board members, hinder board
confidentiality and encourage opportunistic litigation. 1290 More generally, commenters also
challenged the materiality or usefulness of the board disclosures to investors. 1291 For example,
one commenter stated that although “whether the fund is imposing a liquidity fee or suspending
redemptions” would be material, the board’s underlying analysis would not be. 1292 Some
commenters also expressed concern that such disclosure would set a precedent for board

1287

Government money market funds which are not subject to our fees and gates requirements and which have
not opted to apply them are exempt from the reporting requirements of parts E, F, and G of Form N-CR.

opportunistic litigation that follows any financial crisis.”); Legg Mason & Western Asset Comment Letter;
MFDF Comment Letter; Stradley Ronon Comment Letter. In addition, one commenter stated that
“[o]utside of the advisory contract approval process, for which there is a statutory basis under Section 15(c)
of the 1940 Act, the Commission has respected the confidentiality of board deliberations and findings that
are recorded in board minutes.” See Dreyfus Comment Letter.

401

disclosures in other contexts.1293
We appreciate these concerns, but we believe that the imposition of a fee or gate is likely
to be a very significant event for a money market fund 1294 and information about why it was
imposed may prove pivotal to shareholders, many of whom may be evaluating their investment
decision in the money market fund at that time. 1295 Accordingly, as discussed in the Proposing
Release, we continue to believe that shareholders have a strong interest in understanding why a
board determined to impose (or not to impose) a liquidity fee or gate. 1296 For example, this
information may enable investors to better understand the events that are affecting and
potentially causing stress to the fund. 1297 This information may also permit investors to confirm
that the board is, as our rule requires, acting in the best interests of the fund. 1298 And given that

1293

See, e.g., SIFMA Comment Letter (stating that “a requirement to disclose the board’s analysis that is
otherwise memorialized in fund minutes is unique, outside of advisory contract approval. We oppose
setting a precedent that could imply that board analysis must be publicly disclosed for each important
decision made for a fund.”); MFDF Comment Letter; Dreyfus Comment Letter.

1294

Our conclusion that the imposition of a fee or gate may often be a significant event for a money market
fund is supported by the view of many commenters that the imposition of a fee or gate could have
significant implications for a fund that takes this step and that investors may engage in heavy redemptions
after a fee is imposed or a gate is lifted. See, e.g., supra notes 189 and 190 and accompanying text.

1295

We note that disclosure of board reasoning is not uncommon in context where shareholders may be
evaluating their investment decision, such as when a fund engages in a merger or acquisition. In those
circumstances, a fund board usually provides a recommendation to shareholders and the reasons for their
recommendation. C.f., e.g., Independent Directors Council, BOARD CONSIDERATION OF FUND MERGERS,
(June 2006), available at http://www.idc.org/pdf/ppr_idc_fund_mergers.pdf (“Directors typically explain
the reasons for their decision to recommend that shareholders approve a merger in the fund’s proxy
statement.”). We note that mergers and acquisitions can also be the subject of litigation and nevertheless
board disclosure of their primary reasons for their recommendation is commonplace.

1296

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at section III.G.2.

1297

Cf., e.g., MFDF Comment Letter (acknowledging that “[d]epending on the situation, fund investors may
well have an interest in better understanding the circumstances that led to the imposition of redemption fees
or gates.”).

1298

See, e.g., ABA Business Law Section Comment Letter (with respect to the liquidity fees and gates
proposal, stating that the “Commission would assign the money market fund’s board of directors
substantial new responsibilities over ‘life and death’ decisions in the event of a run on the fund.”).

402

under our final rules a board can impose a fee or gate as soon as the fund’s weekly liquid assets
fall below the 30% regulatory minimum (and thus different boards may impose fees or gates at
different times), investors’ interest in understanding the board’s reasoning is likely to be even
more important. 1299 For these reasons, we believe this disclosure will convey material
information to those investors who are considering whether to redeem their shares in response to
a fee or gate.
With respect to concerns that the board disclosures set a precedent implying that the
reasoning underlying every other important decision taken by the board should be similarly
disclosed, 1300 we disagree. As discussed in section II.A, ready access to liquidity is one of the
hallmarks that has made money market funds popular cash management vehicles for both retail
and institutional investors. Because liquidity fees and redemption gates could affect this core
feature by potentially limiting the redeemability of money market fund shares under certain
conditions, 1301 we believe the decision whether to impose those measures is sufficiently different
in kind from most other significant decisions a board could make that the disclosures required by
the rule would not be a precedent for broadly requiring the disclosure of boards’ rationales in
other contexts.
In addition, we have amended this disclosure requirement to address some of the
commenters’ concerns, while still eliciting useful information for the Commission and investors.
More specifically, we are revising Form N-CR to require disclosure of a brief discussion of the
1299

See supra section III.A.1.b.iii.

See discussion of SIFMA Comment Letter at supra note 1293.

1301

See supra section III.A.1.b.iii. See also supra notes 196-199 and the accompanying text for a discussion of
commenters’ concerns of the potentially detrimental effects of a liquidity fee or gate.

403

“primary considerations or factors taken in account by the board of directors in its decision” to
impose or not impose a liquidity fee or gate. 1302 One commenter suggested we make a similar
change, requiring disclosure of “a list of material factors considered by the board in making its
determination.”1303 Rather than just a list of material factors, however, we believe it important
that funds provide a more substantive, but brief, discussion of the primary considerations or
factors taken in account by the board, so that our staff and investors better understand why the
board determined they were important. This report would not need to include every factor
considered by the board, only the most important or primary ones that shaped the determination
of the board’s action. This should help alleviate commenters’ concerns that funds would need to
provide lists of all possible factors or dissect a board’s internal deliberations. Instead, we would
expect only a description of the primary considerations or factors leading to the action taken by
the board, and a brief discussion of each.
That said, we caution that in preparing these board disclosures, funds should avoid
“boilerplate” summaries of all possible factors in addition to or in lieu of a more substantive
narrative. 1304 Instead, filers generally should provide information that is tailored to their fund’s
particular situation and the context in which their board’s decision was made. In preparing these
filings, funds should consider discussing present circumstances as well as any potential future
risks and contingencies to the extent the board took them into account. We also note that we

See Form N-CR Part E.6 and Part F.4.

1303

See NYC Bar Committee Comment Letter.

1304

Cf., e.g., SIFMA Comment Letter (stating that the discussion of the board’s analysis “will likely be tailored
to preempt shareholder plaintiffs’ counsel who might target boards for liability in connection with their
decisions.” which “… may encourage lengthy, but not necessarily useful, disclosure.”).

404

provided a non-exhaustive list of possible factors that a board may have considered in imposing
a liquidity fee or gate in section III.A.2.b above. 1305
Another commenter argued that the board disclosures themselves might incite widespread
redemptions, particularly where the board considered but chose not to impose a liquidity fee. 1306
As discussed in section III.A.1.c above, we acknowledge the possibility that the prospect of a
liquidity fee or gate may cause pre-emptive redemptions, but we believe that several aspects of
our final reforms both make pre-emptive runs less likely and substantially mitigate their broader
effects if they occur. In addition, we believe disclosure of a board’s reasoning is particularly
important in times of stress in order to mitigate against investor flight to transparency that might
otherwise occur. 1307
Finally, we received comments discussing concerns about potentially duplicative
disclosures, in particular the possible redundancy of the board disclosures on a fund’s website as
well as Form N-CR. 1308 However, as already discussed with respect to the various concurrent
disclosures of financial support in section III.F.3 above, while we are sensitive to commenters’
1305

See supra section III.A.2.b.

1306

See Federated V Comment Letter. But cf., e.g., American Bankers Ass’n Comment Letter (arguing that the
disclosures of Form N-CR more generally will decrease redemption risk by heightening self-discipline at
funds).

1307

Moreover, with respect to a fund whose weekly liquid assets have dropped below 10%, we might be
concerned that such a fund may imminently become unable to meet redemptions. Such a relative lack of
liquidity at one fund could also be an indicator of larger effects that might spread to other funds. Either
scenario may raise concerns that further action by the Commission is warranted. However, if the particular
fund’s board waived the liquidity fee, the related disclosure thereof (e.g., because the drop in liquidity is
temporary and only related to the particular fund) could inform our determination that no further action by
the Commission would be required.

1308

See Dreyfus Comment Letter. See also, generally, SIFMA Comment Letter (noting that the “fund’s actions
and the triggering event for the Form N-CR filing may require prospectus disclosure or notification to the
Commission under other rule provisions, so that in many cases the Form N-CR filing will be duplicative of
existing disclosure and notice requirements.”).

405

concerns about duplication, we believe it appropriate given the different audiences and uses for
such information. 1309
b. Conforming and Related Changes
As discussed earlier, the final amendments lower the weekly liquid asset threshold for
triggering the default liquidity fee from 15% to 10% of total assets, and accordingly, we are
making corresponding changes that would require reporting under Form N-CR at the lower
weekly liquid asset threshold. 1310 In addition, in a change from the proposal, the final
amendments permit money market fund boards to institute a liquidity fee or impose a gate at any
time once weekly liquid assets fall below 30% if they find that doing so is in the best interests of
the fund. 1311 We are therefore amending Form N-CR to reflect these changes. 1312 We are making
certain additional changes to Form N-CR for clarity and to be consistent with our final
amendments to the liquidity fees and gates requirement. 1313 Accordingly, under the revised

1309

See discussion following supra notes 1248 and 1249 and accompanying text.

1310

See supra section III.A.2.a.ii; see also, Form N-CR Part E, (where applicable, now referencing 10% instead
of 15% of weekly liquid assets).

1311

See supra section III.A.2.

1312

See Form N-CR Parts E and F.

1313

In particular, for clarity, in the introduction to Part E we now define any affected fund as “a fund (except a
government money market fund that is relying on the exemption in rule 2a-7(c)(2)(iii))” as opposed to “a
Fund (except any Fund that is subject to the exemption provisions of rule 2a-7(c)(2)(iii) and that has chosen
to rely on the rule 2a-7(c)(2)(iii) exemption provisions” as proposed. See proposed (Fees & Gates) Form
N-CR Part E, Introduction. Similarly, for clarity and because of fund’s additional flexibility under our final
amendments to the liquidity fees and gates requirement, in the introduction to Part F we now simply refer
to “fund” as opposed to “a Fund (except any Fund that is subject to the exemption provisions of rule 2a7(c)(2)(iii) and that has chosen to rely on the rule 2a-7(c)(2)(iii) exemption provisions) that has invested
less than fifteen percent of its Total Assets in weekly liquid assets (as provided in rule 2a-7(c)(2)).” In
addition, we received no comments on Part G of Form N-CR (requiring reporting when a liquidity fee or
redemption gate is removed) and are adopting it unchanged from the proposal. See Form N-CR Part G.
However, in the Proposing Release, the introduction to Part G contained a parenthesis specifying that
certain exempt funds are not subject to Part G. See proposed (FNAV) Form N-CR Part G; proposed (Fees
& Gates) Form N-CR Part G. Because we no longer consider this parenthesis to be necessary, we have

406

reporting standard, Parts E and/or F of Form N-CR must be filed: (i) when a fund, at the end of a
business day, has invested less than 10% of its portfolio in weekly liquid assets and is required to
impose a liquidity fee (unless the board determines otherwise), or (ii) when a fund voluntarily
imposes a liquidity fee or redemption gate any time it has invested less than 30% of its portfolio
in weekly liquid assets. 1314
In addition, revised Form N-CR includes a new requirement that funds report their level
of weekly liquid assets at the time of the imposition of fees or gates. 1315 We believe this new
requirement will allow the Commission and investors to better track and understand funds’
liquidity levels when boards impose a fee or gate using their discretion, which we expect will
enhance the Commission’s and investors’ ability to evaluate the extent to which a fund is
experiencing stress as well as the context in which the board made its decision. Similarly,
because we are revising the default liquidity fee from the proposed 2% to 1%, and thus we
expect that there may be instances where liquidity fees are above or below the default fee (rather

deleted it in the final amendments to enhance the clarity of the instructions of Part G.
1314

See Form N-CR Part E, clauses (i) and (ii) of the Introduction (generally triggering disclosure under Part E
of Form N-CR if a non-exempt fund (i) at the end of a business day, has invested less than 10% of its total
assets in weekly liquid assets, or (ii) has invested less than 30% of its total assets in weekly liquid assets
and imposes a liquidity fee pursuant to rule 2a-7(c). Correspondingly, we are also adding “if applicable” to
Item E.1 (requiring disclosure of the initial date on which the fund invested less than 10% of its total assets
in weekly liquid assets, if applicable), and amending Item E.5 (requiring a brief description of the facts and
circumstances leading to the fund’s investing in the amount of weekly liquid assets reported in Item E.3).
See Form N-CR Items E.1, E.3 and E.5.

1315

Form N-CR Items E.3 and F.1. In the Proposing Release we did not explicitly require funds to disclose
their size of weekly liquid assets at the time of the imposition of fees or gates, given that as proposed funds
could only impose a fee or gate once they crossed the 15% weekly liquid asset threshold. Proposed (Fees
& Gates) Form N-CR Parts E and F. Item F.1 as originally proposed required disclosure of the initial date
on which the fund invested less than 15% in weekly liquid assets. See proposed (Fees and Gates) Form NCR Item F.1. Today we are not requiring an analogous disclosure of the initial date on which the fund
invested less than 10% in weekly liquid assets, because this threshold does not have any impact on the
imposition of a gate and, in any event, would be disclosed in Item E.1.

407

than just lower as permitted under the proposal), we are requiring that funds disclose the size of
the liquidity fee, if one is imposed. 1316 In particular, we expect the particular size of the liquidity
fee to be highly relevant to an investor determining whether to redeem fund shares, as it has a
direct impact on the particular costs that such a shareholder would have to bear for redeeming
fund shares. These changes are closely tailored to our final amendments to the liquidity fees and
gate requirement, which we expect will enhance the quality and usefulness of Form N-CR to the
Commission and investors.
6.

Part H: Optional Disclosure

We are also adopting a new Part H in Form N-CR which allows money market funds the
option to discuss any other events or information that they may wish to disclose. We intend new
Part H to clarify and expand the scope and range of formats of any additional information that a
fund may wish to provide. In particular, we are adopting Part H to address commenter concerns
that the information provided in the other parts of Form N-CR may become outdated or lack
context. 1317 We believe that this new optional disclosure could address some of these concerns.
This optional disclosure is intended to provide money market funds with additional
flexibility to discuss any other information not required by Form N-CR, or to supplement and
clarify other required disclosures. 1318 This optional disclosure does not impose on money market

1316

See Form N-CR Item E.4.

1317

For example, one commenter cautioned “in a rapidly changing environment, the reasons for which the
board acted may well change within a period of four days or significant amounts of additional information
may be available to the fund and its board. In this context, a filing requirement focused on a prior decision
risks inadvertently misleading fund investors and others about the state of the fund’s operations.” See
MFDF Comment Letter.

1318

See Form N-CR Item H.1, Instructions.

408

funds any affirmative obligation. Rather, this is solely intended as a discretionary forum where
funds, if they so choose, can disclose any other information they deem helpful or relevant. In
addition, although we expect that funds would typically file Part H along with a filing under
another part of Form N-CR, we are not imposing any particular deadline for these filings, and
thus a fund may file an optional disclosure on Part H of Form N-CR at any time.
7.

Timing of Form N-CR

We are requiring initial filings of Form N-CR to be submitted within one business day of
the triggering event, and in some cases, requiring a follow-up amendment with additional detail
to be submitted four days after the event with some modifications from the proposal. A number
of commenters requested additional time for Form N-CR filings, expressing concern over the
timing requirements for specific items of Form N-CR, 1319 as well as objecting to the timing
requirements more generally. 1320 For example, one commenter recommended that the filing
deadline for the initial filing be extended from one to three business days and the follow-up filing
from four to seven business days. 1321 Commenters argued that providing additional time would

1319

See, e.g., Fidelity Comment Letter, Schwab Comment Letter.

1320

Commenters proposed a range of alternative deadlines. See, e.g., SSGA Comment Letter (generally extend
time frame), Dechert Comment Letter (extend one-day filing deadline from 5:30pm to 10pm on the next
business day), Schwab Comment Letter (four business days for filings related to a default or insolvency
under Part B of Form N-CR), Dreyfus Comment Letter (2-3 day time frame), Stradley Ronon Comment
Letter (seven business days for certain items), SIFMA Comment Letter (three and seven business days
respectively for the initial and follow-up filings), IDC Comment Letter (two weeks for the second filing).
Others proposed moving parts of Form N-CR to other annual or periodic reports altogether. See, e.g.,
MFDF Comment Letter (move the discussion of the circumstances that led to a fee or gate to a new annual
management discussion of fund performance.), NYC Bar Committee Comment Letter (proposing to revise
and move the discussion of the board’s analysis to the report to shareholders covering the relevant period).

1321

SIFMA Comment Letter.

409

permit funds to ensure that filings are prepared accurately and thoughtfully 1322 while also better
enabling fund personnel to prioritize other exigent matters during times of crisis. 1323 They also
argued that it may not be feasible or may be extremely costly for a fund in times of crisis to
formulate within one business day the actions it may take in response to an event of default and
prepare a corresponding description, as required under the proposal. 1324 We are not changing the
filing deadlines of Form N-CR. The Commission and shareholders have a significant interest in
knowing about the events reported on Form N-CR as soon as possible, to be able to effectively
monitor events and to respond as necessary. We believe the longer reporting periods or entirely
alternative reporting format (such as periodic reports, which might not be filed until significantly
later) as proposed by commenters would frustrate the intent of Form N-CR in alerting the
Commission, investors and other market observers about such important events in a timely and
meaningful manner.
We appreciate commenters’ concerns, however, and to help ease the filing burden we are
revising Form N-CR to move certain disclosures in Items B, C and D that may take longer to
prepare from the initial filing due within a single day to the follow-up filing due in four business

1322

Comment Letter, MFDF Comment Letter.

1323

See SIFMA Comment Letter. See also, e.g., Dreyfus Comment Letter.

1324

See, e.g., Schwab Comment Letter (noting that “[s]ome of the requested information can be provided in one
business day, such as the securities affected, the date or dates on which the default or event of insolvency
occurred, the value of the affected securities, and the percentage of the fund’s total assets represented by
the affected security. But we believe it is unreasonable to require a fund’s board to determine in a single
day what actions it should take in response to the event.”). Commenters also noted that it may be
extremely costly to provide some of the reported information in a single business day. See, e.g., Fidelity
Comment Letter (stating that “[i]t would be difficult for MMFs to produce validated data ready for public
dissemination within one business day …. Further, providing data within a short timeframe would come at
an estimated cost of $300,000-$500,000 […].”).

410

days. 1325 In particular, the items moved to the follow-up filing are the description of actions the
fund plans to take, or has taken, in response to a default (Item B.5), the explanation for the
reasons and terms of any financial support provided (Item C.8), the term of any financial support
provided (Item C.9), the brief description of any contractual restrictions relating to any financial
support (Item C.10), and the principal reason or reasons for a decline in a fund’s shadow price
(Item D.3). 1326 We appreciate commenters’ concerns that disclosures such as these may take
additional time to prepare. 1327 We believe these specific disclosure items may be more labor
intensive and take longer to prepare because they generally solicit qualitative and analytical
information, whereas the other items in Parts B through D generally focus more on initially
alerting the Commission and shareholders about a particular event and other key quantitative
data. 1328
Reducing the number of items included in the initial filing and moving the more time
consuming and complicated disclosures to a second filing is designed to help address
commenters’ concerns about the one-day deadline of the initial filing, 1329 while still ensuring that

1325

In particular, filers are required to respond to Items B.5, C.8, C.9, C.10, and D.3 in an amendment to the
initial report within four business days. All other Items in Parts B, C, and D must be disclosed in the initial
report within one business day. We have made corresponding changes to the instructions to the form. See
Form N-CR Part B, C, D, Instructions. In addition, we have rearranged what used to be proposed Item C.4
in the Proposing Release to be new Item C.8 in order to better streamline the disclosures required to be
filed within one business day (Items C.1 through C.7) versus four business days (Items C.8 through C.10).
See Proposing Release, proposed (Fees & Gates) Form N-CR Item C.4, Form N-CR Item C.8.

1326

See Fidelity Comment Letter (suggesting “that the SEC simplify the filing requirements for the first
business day following the event to focus on shareholder notification of the event and key quantitative
data,” while “providing the remaining qualitative information (proposed Form N-CR Item B.5, C.4, C.9,
C.10, D.3, E.3, E.4, F.3, F.4) on the second filing.”

1327

1329

411

the Commission, shareholders and other market observers are provided with these critical alerts
as quickly as possible. We expect the information filed on the initial report will be sufficient to
alert the Commission, investors and other interested parties about certain significant events.
While important, we also believe that the Items we are moving to the follow-up filing of Form
N-CR may be of less immediate concern to the Commission and shareholders.
We are not, however, generally changing the one-day deadline of the initial filing, 1330 nor
are we extending the four-day deadline for the follow-up filing of Form N-CR. 1331 We are
concerned that extending the initial filing deadline beyond one business day could substantially
diminish the informational utility of Form N-CR. The Commission and shareholders have a
significant interest in knowing about the events reported on Form N-CR as soon as possible, to
effectively monitor events and respond as necessary. We need this information to be reported
promptly to effectively monitor money market funds that have come under stress and respond as
necessary. A longer reporting period would frustrate the intent of Form N-CR in alerting the
Commission, investors and other market observers about such important events in a timely and
meaningful manner. 1332

1330

We have, however, revised the instructions on timing of the one-day deadline of the initial filing in each of
Parts B through F to conform them to the wording used in the instruction on timing generally in General
Instruction A. See Form N-CR Part B, C, D, E, F, Instructions.

1331

We proposed to allow the discussion of the boards’ analysis related to imposing fees or gates be included in
the follow-up filing, and we are adopting that requirement as proposed, as modified by the amendments to
the board reporting discussed above. See supra section III.F.5 (Board Disclosures); Form N-CR Item E.5,
E.6, F.3, F.4.

1332

For example, if funds were permitted three business days to prepare an initial filing, a fund that experienced
a portfolio security default on a Friday would not be required to make an initial filing under Part B of Form
N-CR until just before the close of business the following Wednesday. Depending on the circumstances,
such a delay could prevent investors from taking into account this disclosure when making an investment
decision until the next morning on Thursday (such as with respect to potential investors evaluating whether
to purchase fund shares). Similarly, such a long delay would hinder our ability to effectively monitor

412

We also remain unpersuaded that the benefits of extending the follow-up filing beyond
four business days is justified in light of the corresponding reduction in the utility of the
information reported on Form N-CR to the Commission, shareholders and other market
observers. Extending the follow-up filing deadline could lead to a prolonged lack of material
information about the triggering event. Such a delay could hinder investors’ ability to evaluate
their investments and undermine investor confidence. 1333 Furthermore, it could frustrate the
Commission’s ability to effectively monitor and take any appropriate response with respect to
money market funds that have come under stress. 1334
Because we expect that the information required to be provided in follow-up reports on
Form N-CR should be readily accessible, we continue to believe four business days should be a
sufficient amount of time for funds to prepare the report, even in light of the likely competing
priorities on fund personnel during times of stress. We also recognize that some of the
preparatory burdens faced by fund personnel could (and likely will) 1335 be shifted to legal counsel
to the extent a fund chooses to engage legal counsel to assist in the drafting of a Form N-CR
filing. Accordingly, we are adopting a deadline of one business day for an initial report and four
money market funds that have come under stress and respond as necessary (in particular in light of our
elimination of rule 2a-7(c)(7)(iii)(A), which currently requires money market funds to report defaults or
events of insolvency to the Commission by email. See supra note 1211).
1333

For example, a prolonged lack of material information may undermine investors’ expectations that they are
making investment decisions in a transparent market, which may lead to increased market volatility in
affected money market funds as a result of the relative lack of accurate and timely information.

1334

For example, the Commission has a strong interest in knowing why a fund imposed a fee or gate.
Depending on whether the reasons for such a gate were unique to the particular fund or related to broader
market events, further action on the part of the Commission may be required to protect other investors and
markets. Accordingly, given that the Commission generally needs this information as quickly as possible,
we do not think the marginal benefits to funds of extending the deadline beyond what we believe to be
reasonably required to prepare a follow-up filing is justified.

Economic Analysis

As discussed above and in our proposal, 1337 we believe that the Form N-CR reporting
requirements will provide important transparency to investors and the Commission, and also
should help investors better understand the risks associated with a particular money market fund,
or the money market fund industry generally. The Form N-CR reporting requirements will
permit investors and the Commission to receive information about certain money market fund
material events consistently and relatively quickly. As discussed above, we believe that
investors and the Commission have a significant interest in receiving this information in this
format and with this timing because it will permit investors and the Commission to monitor
indicators of stress in specific funds or fund groups, as well as the money market fund industry,
and also to analyze the economic effects of certain material events. The Form N-CR reporting
requirements will give investors and the Commission a greater understanding of the
circumstances leading to stress events, and how a fund manages them. We believe that investors
may find this information to be meaningful in determining whether to purchase fund shares or
remain invested in a fund.
However, we recognize that the Form N-CR reporting requirements have operational
costs (discussed below), and also may result in opportunity costs, in that personnel of a fund that
has experienced an event that requires Form N-CR reporting may lose a certain amount of time
1336

See Form N-CR General Instruction, A; Form N-CR Part B, C, D, E, F, Instructions which specify that
responses to Items B.5, C.8, C.9, C.10, D.3, E.5, E.6, F.3 and F.4 may be filed within four business days.

1337

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at section III.G.3.

414

that could be used to respond to that event because of the need to comply with the reporting
requirement. 1338 For example, as discussed with respect to timing in section III.F.7 above,
commenters argued that providing additional time would permit funds to ensure that filings are
prepared accurately and thoughtfully1339 while also better enabling fund personnel to prioritize
other exigent matters during times of crisis. 1340 They also argued that it may not be feasible or
may be extremely costly for a fund in times of crisis to formulate within one business day the
actions it may take in response to an event of default and prepare a corresponding description, as
required under the proposal. 1341 As discussed in section III.F.7 above, to help ease the filing
burden we have revised Form N-CR to move certain disclosures that may take longer to prepare
from the initial filing due within one day to the follow-up filing due in four business days. We
therefore believe that the final deadlines adopted today for Form N-CR balance the exigency of
the report with the time and cost it will reasonably take a fund to compile the required
information.
We believe that the proposed Form N-CR reporting requirements may complement the
1338

Various commenters expressed concern that preparing Form N-CR would likely compete with other
priorities that fund personnel would be handling during a crisis. See, e.g., SIFMA Comment Letter,
Dreyfus Comment Letter.

See, e.g., Schwab Comment Letter (noting that “[s]ome of the requested information can be provided in one

day what actions it should take in response to the event.”). Commenters also noted that it may be
extremely costly to provide some of the reported information in a single business day. See, e.g., Fidelity

benefits of increased transparency of publicly available money market fund information that
have resulted from the requirement that money market funds report their portfolio holdings and
other key information on Form N-MFP each month. The DERA Study noted that the additional
disclosures that money market funds are required to make on Form N-MFP improve fund
transparency (although funds file the form on a monthly basis with no interim updates, and the
Commission currently makes the information public with a 60-day lag). 1342 The DERA Study
also noted that this “increased transparency, even if reported on a delayed basis, might affect a
fund manager’s willingness to hold securities whose ratings are at odds with the underlying risk,
especially at times when credit conditions are deteriorating.” 1343 Additionally, the availability of
public, standardized, money market fund-related data that has resulted from the Form N-MFP
filing requirement has assisted both the Commission and the money market fund industry in
various studies and analyses of money market fund operations and risks. 1344
The Form N-CR reporting requirement should enhance our understanding of the money
market fund industry that the Commission has gained from analyzing Form N-MFP data by
providing complementary data and additional transparency about money market funds’ risks on a
near real-time basis that is not currently available on Form N-MFP. This requirement may, like
Form N-MFP disclosure, help impose market discipline on portfolio managers 1345 and provide

See American Bankers Ass’n Comment Letter (for example, stating that “[k]nowing that any form of
sponsor support would be required to be disclosed within 24 hours, fund managers would likely do

416

additional data that would allow investors to make investment decisions, and allow the
Commission and the money market fund industry to conduct risk- and operations-related
analyses.
We believe that the reporting requirements we are adopting today may positively affect
regulatory efficiency because all money market funds would be required to file information
about certain material events on a standardized form. This will improve the consistency of
information disclosure and reporting, and assist the Commission in overseeing individual funds,
and the money market fund industry generally, more effectively. The requirements also could
positively affect informational efficiency. This should assist investors in understanding various
risks associated with certain funds, and risks associated with the money market fund industry
generally, which in turn should assist investors in choosing whether to purchase or redeem shares
of certain funds. Currently, funds compete on information provided on a fund’s website and
Form N-MFP, as well as on more traditional competitive factors such as price and yield.
Implicitly, investors have also relied on sponsors to step in and support a fund when there is an
adverse event. However, as we observed with the Reserve Primary Fund, this does not always
happen. As such, the requirements should positively affect competition because funds may
compete with each other based on information required to be disclosed on Form N-CR. For
instance, investors might view a fund that invests in securities whose issuers have never
experienced a default as a more attractive investment than another fund that frequently files
reports in response to Form N-CR Part B (“Default or Event of Insolvency of portfolio security

everything they could to avoid needing sponsor support.”).

417

issuer”). However, it is also possible that investors may move their assets to larger fund
complexes if, based on Form N-CR disclosures, they determine that such fund complexes are
more likely than smaller entities to provide financial support to their funds. Also, if investors
move their assets among money market funds or decide to invest in investment products other
than money market funds as a result of the Form N-CR reporting requirements, this could
negatively affect the competitive stance of certain money market funds, or the money market
fund industry generally.
The filing of Form N-CR could have additional effects on capital formation. The
information filed on Form N-CR could improve capital formation if investors better understand
that a fund is not sufficiently addressing the cause that led to the Form N-CR filing. One
commenter 1346 suggested that certain Form N-CR disclosures would make money market funds
more susceptible to heavy redemptions during times of stress. While we acknowledge the
possibility of pre-emptive redemptions, as discussed in detail above, several aspects of today’s
amendments are designed to mitigate this risk. In addition, the other reforms we are adopting
today (such as liquidity fees and redemption gates) will provide some fund managers additional
tools for managing such redemptions, if they were to occur. 1347 Moreover, the additional
information should assist investors in making a more informed investment decision, which leads
to improved efficiency and capital formation. Furthermore, commenters have also argued that
1346

See, e.g., Federated V Comment Letter (“The goal of reform should be not to have the filing of a Form NCR cause the widespread redemptions the Reform Proposal seeks to avoid.”); Federated VIII Comment
Letter.

1347

In addition, as discussed in more detail in sections III.F.4 and III.F.5 above, we note that some of our
responses in section III.A.1.c.i to concerns over pre-emptive run risk related to the liquidity fees and gates
requirement would similarly apply to run risk concerns with respect to certain specific disclosures in Form
N-CR.

418

the proposed Form N-CR disclosures will actually decrease redemption risk by heightening selfdiscipline at funds, which would also increase capital formation. 1348 In addition, it is possible
that investors will react positively to the information on Form N-CR if they feel the fund is
sufficiently addressing the cause of the Form N-CR filing. For example, as noted in section
III.F.5, we believe disclosure of a board’s reasoning is particularly important in times of stress in
order to mitigate against investor flight to transparency that might otherwise occur.
If money market fund investors decide to move all or a substantial portion of their money
out of the market, this could negatively affect capital formation. 1349 On the other hand, capital
formation could be positively affected if the Form N-CR reporting requirements were to assist
the Commission in overseeing and regulating the money market fund industry, and the resulting
regulatory framework would allow investors to more efficiently or more effectively invest in
money market funds. Additional effects of these filing requirements on efficiency, competition,
and capital formation would vary according to the event precipitating the Form N-CR filing, and
they are substantially similar to the effects of other disclosure requirements, as discussed in more
detail above. 1350
The Commission is unable to measure the quantitative benefits of these requirements

For an analysis of the potential macroeconomic effects of our main reforms, see supra section III.K.

1350

We believe that the effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation of filing Form N-CR in
response to Part B or C overlap significantly with the effects of the disclosure requirements regarding the
financial support provided to money market funds. See discussion in supra section III.F. We believe that
the effects of filing Form N-CR in response to Part D overlap significantly with the effects of the disclosure
requirements regarding a money market fund’s daily market-based NAV per share. See discussion in supra
section III.F.4. We believe that the effects of filing Form N-CR in response to Parts E, F, and G overlap
significantly with the effects of the disclosure requirements regarding current and historical instances of the
imposition of liquidity fees and/or gates. See supra section III.F.5.

because of uncertainty about how increased transparency may affect different investors’
behavior, their understanding of the risks associated with money market funds, and the potential
effects of the disclosure on market discipline.
a. Alternatives Considered
As a possible alternative, we could have chosen to not adopt Form N-CR or any of its
disclosures (as well as any of the corresponding SAI or website disclosures). A variation of this
alternative would have been to eliminate Form N-CR but adopt the corresponding SAI and/or
website disclosures. As discussed above, commenters expressed concern about the potential
redundancy of Form N-CR or parts thereof in light of the corresponding website and SAI
disclosures. 1351 If we did not adopt Form N-CR and/or any of the corresponding SAI and website
disclosures, affected funds would not incur the additional costs related to Form N-CR that we
discuss in more detail below. 1352 In addition, with respect to the board disclosure requirements in
Parts E and F for Form N-CR, fund boards would not be concerned about the loss of board
confidentiality or the possibility of opportunistic shareholder litigation. 1353 However, we rejected
this set of alternatives for a number of reasons, including the following. First, each of the
disclosures in Form N-CR serves to alert Commission staff, investors, and other market
observers (such as news services, which in turn may alert investors) about important events in a
timely manner. 1354 Second, as discussed in more detail in section III.F.3 (Concerns over Potential

1351

See supra note 1249 and accompanying discussion.

1352

Similarly, if we also had not adopted the corresponding SAI or website disclosures, funds would further not
incur their related costs previously described. See supra sections III.E.8 and III.E.9.h.

1353

See our discussion about commenters’ concerns in supra note 1290 and accompanying discussion.

See also supra section III.F.8 for our discussion of the other economic benefits of Form N-CR.

420

Redundancy), although we acknowledge there will be some textual overlap between these
different forms, we believe each serves a distinct purpose. 1355 Moreover, as discussed in section
III.F.5 (Board Disclosure) above, we have revised the board disclosure requirements in a number
of ways in order to minimize any concerns over board confidentiality or opportunistic litigation.
Another alternative suggested by a number of commenters is to extend the deadline for
filing Form N-CR by up to two weeks. 1356 A variation of this alternative would have been to
move all or certain parts of Form N-CR to other (and typically later) periodic reports. For
example, one commenter recommended that the board disclosure requirements under Parts E and
F of Form N-CR “be provided in the report to shareholders covering the relevant period.” 1357
Extending the deadline or moving these disclosures to a later periodic report or other filing could
lower the cost for funds since funds may have additional cost due to the short time period to
prepare the initial filings within one day and the follow-up within four days. Such additional
preparation time may also lower opportunity costs for the fund, in that personnel of a fund can
spend the initial time responding to the event that requires Form N-CR reporting rather than
filing the Form N-CR. However, we rejected this set of alternatives because, as discussed above,
in times of market stress the purpose of Form N-CR is to alert the Commission, shareholders and
other market observers about significant events that affect the fund. 1358 If investors feel that they
will have the necessary information to make an informed decision in times of stress, then this
1355

See supra section III.F.3. (Concerns over Potential Redundancy).

filings deadlines.

circumstances that led to a fee or gate to a new annual management discussion of fund performance.).

421

may lead to additional capital for funds. Likewise, we also believe that having the initial filing
within one business day and the follow-up within four business days may lead to more market
discipline among funds, resulting in increased investor willingness to participate in this market,
which could also lead to additional capital for funds.
We also considered making the definition of financial support subject to a specific
threshold or general materiality qualification, such as a specific drop in the NAV or liquidity. 1359
For example, such a threshold might apply if a fund’s NAV drops by more than ¼ of 1 percent
and the sponsor’s investment in the fund causes the fund’s NAV to recover. We rejected this
alternative for several reasons. First, some types of sponsor support like a sponsor support
agreement or a performance guarantee, which is included in the definition, does not necessarily
or immediately result in a change in NAV or liquidity. Second, it is possible that sponsors would
provide financial support to their funds before reaching the particular threshold, thereby avoiding
the reporting requirement. As one commenter stated, “[k]nowing that any form of sponsor
support would be required to be disclosed within 24 hours, fund managers would likely do
everything they could to avoid the need for sponsor support.” 1360
We also considered various other refinements that specifically related to one of the
particular disclosure items in Form N-CR, such as commenters’ proposal to increase the
deviation in the NAV triggering a report on Part D of Form N-CR from 0.25% to 0.5%. 1361 We
generally consider and address these other suggestions in our discussion of the final amendments

above.
b. Operational Costs: Overview
The operational costs of filing Form N-CR in response to the events specified in Parts B
though H of Form N-CR are discussed below. 1362 Our estimates of operational costs below
generally reflect the costs associated with an actual filing of Form N-CR. We continue to expect
that the operational costs to money market funds to report the new information will generally be
the same costs we discuss in the Paperwork Reduction Act analysis in section IV.D.2.a below. 1363
We recognize that there could also be some advance discussions and preparation within
the industry and at money market funds about having the necessary monitoring systems and
controls in place to detect relevant issues immediately, escalate them quickly and get the form
approved and filed. While we acknowledge these potential additional costs, we are unable to
estimate them with any specificity, 1364 largely because we do not have the necessary information
on how prepared funds may already be or how much advance preparation is needed in regards to
filing a report in Form N-CR. For example, because certain disclosures such as Part B and C of

1362

These costs incorporate the costs of responding to Part A (“General information”) of Form N-CR. We
anticipate that the costs associated with responding to Part A will be minimal, because Part A requires a
fund to submit only basic identifying information.

1363

As discussed in more detail in infra section IV.D.2.a, we have revised our cost estimates associated with
filing a report with respect to each Part of Form N-CR. The Proposing Release originally estimated that a
fund would spend on average approximately 5 burden hours and total time costs of $1,708 to prepare,
review, and submit a report under any Part of Form N-CR. See Proposing Release, supra note 24, at
nn.1203 and 1204 and accompanying text. This resulted in a total annual burden of approximately 301
burden hours and total annual time costs of approximately $102,765 under the floating NAV alternative
and approximately 341 burden hours and total annual time costs of approximately $116,429 under the
liquidity fees and gates alternative. See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at nn.1113 and 1205 and
accompanying text.

1364

No commenters provided concrete cost estimates specifically in regards to these potential preparatory costs.
For a more general discussion of commenters’ comments on the burdens of Form N-CR, see, e.g., supra
note 1363 and III.F.8.

423

Form N-CR will in part replace existing email notification requirements, 1365 we expect that many
funds may already be prepared to detect and respond to these particular items. Moreover, in
particular with respect to the disclosures about any liquidity fee or gate on Parts E through G of
Form N-CR, we question the extent to which any advance preparation would be useful in light of
the highly fact-specific nature of these disclosures. 1366 Accordingly, some funds may engage in
very little or no advance preparation. In addition, we believe that most (if not all) preparational
costs related to an event reportable on Parts E through G of Form N-CR, such as planning
appropriate processes for the consideration of a liquidity fee or gate by the board, are more
directly attributable to the liquidity fees and gates requirement itself, 1367 rather than the
corresponding disclosure requirement on Form N-CR. 1368
As discussed in sections III.F.2 – III.F.6 above, we are making a number of changes in
our final amendments, a number of which we expect to impact the costs associated with filing a
report on Form N-CR. 1369 For example, with respect to Parts B, C and D, we are now permitting
filers to split their response into an initial and follow-up filing, 1370 similar to what we had already
proposed for Parts E and F in the Proposing Release. Accordingly, in addition to our new
estimate for Part H, we are updating and providing a more nuanced estimate of the costs

1365

See supra notes 1211 and 1213.

1366

For similar reasons, our cost estimates in the PRA analysis in infra section IV.D.2 generally presume no
particular advance preparation when preparing a filing on Form N-CR.

1367

See, e.g., SIFMA Comment Letter (estimating costs of implementing the ability to impose liquidity fees
and gates).

See supra section III.A.1.

1370

See supra section III.F.7.

424

associated with filing a report with respect to each of Parts B through G of Form N-CR.
In updating our estimates, we also considered comments about the operational costs
related to Form N-CR. One commenter estimated that requiring disclosure of certain Items in
Form N-CR within one business day could cost $300,000 to $500,000. 1371 However, our final
amendments incorporate this commenter’s proposed solution by shifting Items B.5, C.4, C.9,
C.10, and D.3 from the initial filing to the follow-up filing. 1372 Because today’s amendments
permit funds to file a response to these Items within four business days instead of just one
business day, we expect the costs of filing Form N-CR to be notably less than what this
commenter originally estimated. 1373 Although we received no other specific cost estimates from
commenters with respect to Form N-CR, we also took into account commenters’ general
concerns and suggestions about the timing and various costs and burdens of Form N-CR. 1374 For
example, we noted that commenters particularly cited the burdens and the role of the board in
drafting and reviewing the board disclosures in Parts E and F. 1375
1371

See Fidelity Comment Letter (stating that “[i]t would be difficult for MMFs to produce validated data ready
for public dissemination within one business day, particularly for items such as B.5, C.4, C.9, and C.10.
Providing quantitative data within one business day would not only call for the coordination of information
and its sources, but also its review and verification to ensure accuracy and completeness. Accordingly, we
do not believe that this strict filing deadline is operationally feasible. Further, providing data within a short
timeframe would come at an estimated cost of $300,000-$500,000, without factoring in the costs of
ongoing compliance and filing, all of which greatly exceeds the SEC’s estimated cost of $1,700 and five
hours to prepare and review information.”).

1372

See supra note 1326 and accompanying text.

1373

We are generally unable, however, to fully evaluate the basis or validity of this commenter’s cost estimate,
as we do not have all the data or assumptions on which this commenter’s estimate is based. See supra note
1324 and accompanying text; Fidelity Comment Letter.

1374

See, e.g., Dreyfus Comment Letter, Federated VIII Comment Letter, Legg Mason & Western Asset
Comment Letter, MFDF Comment Letter.

1375

See, e.g., IDC Comment Letter (“Any public disclosure about a board’s decision-making process would
require careful and thoughtful drafting and multiple layers of review (by board counsel, fund counsel, and
the directors, among others).”); Stradley Ronon Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter.

425

We also updated our estimates to reflect the likelihood that some funds may engage legal
counsel to assist with the drafting and review of Form N-CR, by which they would incur
additional external costs. For example, as noted above, commenters cited the particular burdens
and the role of various parties in drafting and reviewing the board disclosures in Parts E and
F. 1376 In addition, given commenters’ concern about timing as noted in section III.F.7, we take
these various concerns to be an indicator that some funds may engage legal counsel.
Accordingly, we estimate, in particular with respect to the follow-up reports under Parts B
through F as well as any reports on Part H, that certain funds will engage legal counsel to assist
with the drafting and review of Form N-CR, thereby incurring additional external costs. 1377
c. Operational Costs of Part B: Default Events
As noted in the Proposing Release, 1378 we have estimated that the costs of filing a report
in response to an event specified on Part B of Form N-CR will be higher than the costs that
money market funds currently incur in complying with the rule 2a-7 provision which currently
requires money market funds to report defaults or events of insolvency to the Director of
Investment Management or the Director's designee by e-mail. 1379
In updating our estimates for Part B of Form N-CR, we estimate the costs of filing and
1376

See id.

1377

See infra note 2386 and accompanying discussion.

1378

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.730 and accompanying text.

1379

The requirements of current rule 2a-7(c)(7)(iii)(A) and the requirement of Part B of Form N-CR are
substantially similar, although Part B on its face specifies more information to be reported than current rule
2a-7(c)(7)(iii)(A). However, we understand that funds disclosing events of default or insolvency pursuant
to current rule 2a-7(c)(7)(iii)(A) already have historically reported substantially the same information
required by Part B. As noted, we are eliminating the existing email notification requirements in rule 2a-7
and are replacing it with the notification requirements of Form N-CR. See supra note 1211. We discuss
the impact on costs of this elimination in sections III.F.8 and III.N.3.

426

amending the report in response to an event specified on Part B of Form N-CR to include time
costs of $4,830 and external costs of $1,000, for total costs of $5,830 for each set of initial and
follow-up reports, 1380 and we expect, based on our estimate of the average number of
notifications of events of default or insolvency that money market funds currently file each year,
that the Commission would receive approximately 20 such filings per year. 1381 Therefore, we
expect that the annual costs relating to filing a report on Form N-CR in response to an event
specified on Part B would be $116,600. 1382
d. Operational Costs of Part C: Financial Support
In addition to the general discussion above, in updating our estimate for Part C we also
considered certain changes from the proposal specifically related to Part C of Form N-CR, 1383
most notably our changes to the definition of financial support, 1384 which we estimate will impact
the frequency of filings on Part C of Form N-CR. As we noted in the Proposing Release, 1385 we
have estimated the costs of filing a report in response to an event specified on Part C of Form
N-CR in part by reference to the costs that money market funds currently incur in complying
1380

The costs associated with filing Form N-CR in response to an event specified on Part B of Form N-CR are
paperwork-related costs and are discussed in more detail in infra section IV.D.2.b.

1381

The Commission estimates this figure based in part by reference to our current estimate of an average of 20
notifications to the Commission of an event of default or insolvency that we previously estimated money
market funds to file pursuant to current rule 2a-7(c)(7)(iii) each year. See Submission for OMB Review,
Comment Request, Extension: Rule 2a-7, OMB Control No. 3235-0268, Securities and Exchange
Commission 77 FR 236 (Dec. 7, 2012). We believe that this estimate is likely to be high, in particular
when markets are not in crisis as they were during 2008 or 2011. However, we are continuing to use this
higher estimate to be conservative in our analysis.

1382

These estimates are based on the following calculations: $5,830 (cost per complete filing) x 20 filings per
year = $116,600 per year. See supra notes 1380 and 1381 and accompanying text.

1383

See supra section III.F.3. (Definition of Financial Support).

See supra section III.F.3 and note 1242.

with the rule 2a-7 provision that requires disclosure to the Director of Investment Management
or the Director's designee by e-mail when a sponsor supports a money market fund by
purchasing a security in reliance on rule 17a-9. 1386 However, because Part C of Form N-CR is
more extensive and defines “financial support” more broadly than the current requirements, we
expect that the costs associated with filing a report in response to a Part C event would be higher
than the current estimated costs of compliance with the current notification requirement. 1387
In updating our proposed estimates for Part C of Form N-CR, we estimate the costs of
filing and amending the report in response to an event specified on Part C of Form N-CR to
include time costs of $6,660 and external costs of $1,400, for total costs of $8,060 for each set of
initial and follow-up reports, 1388 and we expect, based in part by reference to our estimate of the
average number of notifications of security purchases in reliance on rule 17a-9 that money
market funds currently file each year, that the Commission would receive approximately 30 1389
such filings per year. 1390 Therefore, we expect that the annual costs relating to filing a report on
Form N-CR in response to an event specified on Part C would be $241,800. 1391

1386

Current rule 2a-7(c)(7)(iii)(B).

1387

As previously noted, we are eliminating the existing email notification requirements in rule 2a-7 and are
replacing it with the notification requirements of Form N-CR. See supra note 1213. We discuss the impact
on costs of this elimination in sections III.F.8 and III.N.3.

1388

The costs associated with filing Form N-CR in response to an event specified on Part C of Form N-CR are
paperwork-related costs and are discussed in more detail in infra section IV.D.2.c.

1389

In the Proposing Release, we originally estimated 40 filings per year under Part C of Form N-CR. See
Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.735 and accompanying text. As discussed in supra section III.F.3,
today we are adopting certain exclusions from the definition of financial support that will narrow the
definition to a certain degree. Correspondingly, in anticipation of a slight reduction in instances that meet
the definition as amended today, we predict an estimated 30 filings per year under Part C of Form N-CR.

1390

See Submission for OMB Review, Comment Request, Extension: Rule 2a-7, OMB Control No. 3235-0268,
Securities and Exchange Commission [77 FR 236 (Dec. 7, 2012)].

1391

These estimates are based on the following calculations: $8,060 (cost per complete filing) x 30 filings per

428

e. Operational Costs of Part D: Shadow Price Declines
In an event of filing, we continue to believe a fund’s particular circumstances that gave
rise to a reportable event under Part D would be the predominant factor in determining the time
and costs associated with filing a report on Form N-CR, in particular with respect to the followup filing amending the initial report. 1392
In updating our proposed estimates for Part D of Form N-CR, we estimate the costs of
filing and amending the report in response to an event specified on Part D of Form N-CR to
include time costs of $4,830 and external costs of $1,000, for total costs of $5,830 for each set of
initial and follow-up reports, 1393 and we expect, based in part by reference to our estimate of the
average number of instances in which the shadow price for a non-institutional money market
fund has deviated downward by more than ¼ of 1 percent from its stable per share NAV price
each year, that we will receive approximately 0.3 such filings per year. 1394 Therefore, we expect
that the annual costs relating to filing a report on Form N-CR in response to an event specified
on Part D would be $1,749. 1395

year = $241,800 per year. See supra note 1388-1390 and accompanying text.
1392

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at paragraph following n.736.

1393

The costs associated with filing Form N-CR in response to an event specified on Part D of Form N-CR are
paperwork-related costs and are discussed in more detail in infra section IV.D.2.d.

1394

Our staff has analyzed form N-MFP data from November 2010 to February 2014 and found that only one
non-institutional fund had a ¼ of 1 percent deviation from the stable $1.00 per share NAV. 1 fund in over
39 months is equivalent to less than 1 (1 x 12 ÷ 39 = 0.31) funds per year. In the Proposing Release, we
had estimated 0.167 reports filed per year in respect of Part D. See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at
n.1205. We revised this estimate to reflect more accurate accounting and updated data.

1395

These estimates are based on the following calculations: $5,830 (cost per complete filing) x 0.3 filings per
year = $1,749 per year. See supra note 1393 and 1394 and accompanying text.

429

f. Operational Costs of Part E and F: Imposition of Fees and Gates
In addition to the general discussion above, in updating our estimates we also considered
certain changes from the proposal specifically related to Parts E and F of Form N-CR, 1396 most
notably our changes to the board disclosure requirements 1397 and the weekly liquid asset
thresholds permitting or triggering board consideration of a liquidity fee or gate. 1398 Moreover, in
particular with respect to the board disclosures, we expect that most if not all funds may engage
legal counsel to assist with the drafting and review of Form N-CR, thereby incurring additional
external costs. 1399 We have also revised our estimates of the frequency of filings under Parts E
and F. 1400 In an event of filing, we continue to believe a fund’s particular circumstances that gave
rise to a reportable event under Parts E or F would be the predominant factor in determining the
time and costs associated with filing a report on Form N-CR, in particular with respect to the
follow-up filing amending the initial report. 1401
In revising our estimates for Part E of Form N-CR, 1402 we estimate the costs of filing and
amending the report in response to an event specified on Part E of Form N-CR to include time

1396

See supra section III.F.5.

1397

See supra section III.F.5. (Board Disclosures).

1398

See supra section III.F.5. (Conforming and Related Changes).

1399

For example, commenters cited the particular burdens and the role of the board in drafting and reviewing
the board disclosures in Parts E and F. See, e.g., IDC Comment Letter (“Any public disclosure about a
board’s decision-making process would require careful and thoughtful drafting and multiple layers of
review (by board counsel, fund counsel, and the directors, among others).”); Stradley Ronon Comment
Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter.

1400

See infra notes 1410-1414 and accompanying text.

1401

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at paragraph following n.736.

1402

The Proposing Release estimated that a fund would spend on average approximately 5 burden hours and
total time costs of $1,708 to prepare, review, and submit a report under any Part of Form N-CR, including
Part E. See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at nn.1203 and 1204 and accompanying text.

430

costs of $10,910 and external costs of $3,600, for total costs of $14,510 for each set of initial and
follow-up reports. 1403 The Proposing Release and the DERA Study analyzed the distribution of
weekly liquid assets to determine how often a prime fund’s weekly liquid asset percentage fell
below the 30% and 10% thresholds. The analysis found that on average 6.9 out of 253 prime
funds, or 2.7% of the funds, had their monthly weekly liquid assets percentages fall below
30%. 1404 This corresponds to 83 funds per year. 1405 The analysis also found that on average 0.05
out of 253 prime funds, or 0.02% of the funds, had their monthly weekly liquid assets
percentages fall below 10%. 1406 This corresponds to 0.6 funds per year. 1407 As a result of the new
reporting requirements, we believe that funds will in general try to avoid having to file Form
N-CR by keeping their weekly liquid asset percentages above 10%. 1408 In addition, of the 83
funds per year that reported a weekly liquid assets value below 30%, it is unclear how many
would have decided to impose a fee, but we expect it to be lower than 83 funds given that not all
boards would have likely imposed such a discretionary fee. As such, we expect, based on our
calculation of the average number of instances in which a fund would breach the 10% and 30%
weekly liquid asset threshold each year, that the Commission would receive between 0.6 and 83

1403

The costs associated with filing Form N-CR in response to an event specified on Part E of Form N-CR are
paperwork-related costs and are discussed in more detail in infra section IV.D.2.e.

1404

See the table in the Proposing Release, supra note 25, referencing n.384; DERA Study, supra note 24, at
22.

1405

We estimate 83 funds per year as follows: 6.9 funds per month x 12 months = 83 funds per year.

1406

See the table in the Proposing Release, supra note 25, referencing n.384; DERA Study, supra note 24, at
22.

1407

We estimate 0.6 funds per year as follows: 0.05 funds per month x 12 months = 0.6 funds per year.

1408

See generally, e.g., SIFMA Comment Letter (“[Some members] believe the existence of the liquidity
trigger for the fee and gate will motivate fund managers to maintain fund liquidity well in excess of the
trigger level, to avoid triggering the fee or gate.”);

431

such filings per year. For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act section below, 1409 we
estimate that 0.6 funds per year would file a report triggered by the 10% weekly liquid asset
threshold 1410 and an additional 0.6 funds per year would file a report because they crossed the
30% weekly liquid asset threshold and their board determined to impose a liquidity fee, 1411 for a
total average of 1.2 instances per year. Therefore, we expect that the annual costs relating to
filing a report on Form N-CR in response to an event specified on Part E will be $17,412. 1412
In revising our estimates for Part F of Form N-CR, 1413 we estimate the costs of filing and
amending the report in response to an event specified on Part F of Form N-CR of Form N-CR to
include time costs of $10,910 and external costs of $3,600, for total costs of $14,510 for each set
of initial and follow-up reports. 1414 As stated above, the DERA study found that 83 prime funds
per year had their weekly liquid asset percentages fall below 30%. 1415 Of these 83 funds, it is
1409

See infra section IV.D.2.e. In the Proposing Release, we had previously estimated a total of 4 reports in
response to Parts E and F based on the previously proposed 15% weekly liquid asset trigger. See Proposing
Release, supra note 25, at n.1202. For a more detailed discussion of the reasons for our changed estimates,
see also infra note 2408.

1410

As noted above, as a result of the new reporting requirements, we believe that funds will in general try to
avoid having to file Form N-CR by keeping their weekly liquid asset percentages above 10%.
Accordingly, we believe our estimates of the frequency of filings in response to Part E of Form N-CR are
likely to be high. However, we are using these higher estimates to be conservative in our analysis.

1411

As discussed in section IV.D.2.e, we estimate that funds will voluntarily impose a liquidity fee at most as
often as they will be required to consider a liquidity fee based on the 10% weekly liquid asset trigger.
Accordingly, the Commission conservatively estimates that 0.6 additional funds per year would file a
report in response to Part E because it breached the 30% weekly liquid asset threshold and their board
determined to impose such a discretionary liquidity fee.

1412

These estimates are based on the following calculations: $14,510 (cost per complete filing) x [0.6+0.6]
filings per year = $17,412 per year. See supra notes 1403-1410 and accompanying text.

1413

The Proposing Release estimated that a fund would spend on average approximately 5 burden hours and
total time costs of $1,708 to prepare, review, and submit a report under any Part of Form N-CR, including
Part F. See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at nn.1203 and 1204 and accompanying text.

1414

The costs associated with filing Form N-CR in response to an event specified on Part F of Form N-CR are
paperwork-related costs and are discussed in more detail in infra section IV.D.2.f.

1415

See DERA Study, supra note 24, at 22.

432

unclear how many would have decided to impose a gate, but we expect it to be lower than 83
funds given that not all boards would have likely imposed such a discretionary gate. Thus, we
expect, based on our calculation of the average number of instances in which a fund would
breach the 30% weekly liquid asset threshold each year, that the Commission would receive
between zero and 83 such sets of initial and follow-up reports per year. For purposes of the
Paperwork Reduction Act section below, 1416 we conservatively estimate that 0.6 funds per year
would file a report because they breached the 30% weekly liquid asset threshold and their board
determined to impose a gate. 1417 Therefore, we expect that the annual costs relating to filing a
report on Form N-CR in response to an event specified on Part F would be $8,706. 1418
g. Operational Costs of Part G: Lifting of Fees and Gates
As discussed in the Proposing Release, we continue to believe the frequency of filings
under Part G on Form N-CR to be closely correlated to the frequency of filings under Parts E and
F. 1419 Given our revised estimates of the number of filings under Parts E and F, 1420 we are

1416

See infra section IV.D.2.f. In the Proposing Release, we had previously estimated a total of 4 reports in
response to Parts E and F based on the previously proposed 15% weekly liquid asset trigger. See Proposing
Release, supra note 25, at n.1202. For a more detailed discussion of the reasons for our changed estimates,
see also infra note 2421.

1417

As discussed and estimated in more detail in infra section IV.D.2.f, we conservatively estimate the number
of instances in which a fund breached the 30% weekly liquid asset threshold and its board determined to
impose a voluntary gate to be equal to the number of instances in which a fund breached the 30% weekly
liquid asset threshold and its board determined to impose a voluntary fee, or 0.6 instances per year.

1418

These estimates are based on the following calculations: $14,510 (cost per complete filing) x 0.6 filings per
year = $8,706 per year. See supra notes 1414-1417.

1419

See, e.g., Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.1202 and accompanying discussion. We expect there to be
a close correlation because Part G requires disclosure of the lifting of any liquidity fee or gate imposed in
connection with Part E or F.

1420

See supra notes 1410 and 1417 and accompanying discussions.

433

correspondingly revising our estimate of the number of filings under Part G. 1421 We are further
revising our estimates for Part G, because we expect the cost per filing associated with
responding to Part G to be lower than for Parts E or F. 1422 Unlike Parts B through F and H, for
which we have included estimated external costs to account for the possibility that funds may
engage legal counsel to assist in the preparation and review of Form N-CR, 1423 we have not done
so here because of the relative simplicity of Part G.
In revising our estimates for Part G of Form N-CR, 1424 we estimate the costs of filing a
report in response to an event specified on Part G of Form N-CR to include time costs of $695
per filing, 1425 and we expect, based in part by reference to our estimate of how often funds would
file Form N-CR under Part E or F each year, that the Commission would receive between zero
and 83 such filings per year. 1426 For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act section below, we

1421

See infra section IV.D.2.g. The Proposing Release estimated a total of 4 reports in response to Part G. See
Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.1202. For a more detailed discussion of the reasons for our revised
estimates, see also infra notes 2433-2437 and accompanying text.

1422

In the Proposing Release, our staff originally estimated that a fund would spend on average approximately
5 burden hours and total time costs of $1,708 to prepare, review, and submit a report under any Part of
Form N-CR. See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at nn.1203 and 1204 and accompanying text.
However, we expect a response to Part G to be shorter than under Parts E or G, given that Part G only
requires disclosure of the date on which a fund removed a liquidity fee and/or resumed Fund redemptions.
See Form N-CR Item G.1. In addition, unlike Part E or F, Part G would not require any follow-up report.

1423

See supra sections IV.D.2.b – IV.d.2.f; see also infra section IV.D.2.h.

1424

The Proposing Release estimated that a fund would spend on average approximately 5 burden hours and
total time costs of $1,708 to prepare, review, and submit a report under any Part of Form N-CR, including
Part F. See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at nn.1203 and 1204 and accompanying text.

1425

The costs associated with filing Form N-CR in response to an event specified on Part G of Form N-CR are
paperwork-related costs and are discussed in more detail in infra section IV.D.2.g.

1426

For purposes of this estimate of filings under Part G, we conservatively assume that there would be a filing
under Part G for every filing under either Parts E or F. Given that some affected funds may liquidate
instead of ever lifting the respective liquidity fee or gate, we therefore expect this estimate of the frequency
of Part G filings may be high.

434

estimate that 1.8 funds per year would file a report because they lifted a liquidity fee or gate. 1427
Therefore, we expect that the annual costs relating to filing a report on Form N-CR in response
to an event specified on Part G would be $1,251. 1428
h. Operational Costs of Part H: Optional Disclosure
Given the broad scope and voluntary nature of the optional disclosure under Part H of
Form N-CR, we believe that, in an event of filing, a fund’s particular circumstances that led it to
decide to make such a voluntary disclosure would be the predominant factor in determining the
time and costs associated with filing a report on Form N-CR. In estimating costs, we expect that
some funds may engage legal counsel to assist with the drafting and review of Form N-CR,
thereby incurring additional external costs. 1429
Accordingly, we estimate the costs of a filing in response to an event specified on Part H
of Form N-CR to include time costs of $1,390 and external costs of $800, for a total cost of
$2,190 per filing, 1430 and we expect that the Commission will receive approximately 18 such
filings per year. 1431 Therefore, we expect that the annual costs relating to filing a report on Form

1427

See infra section IV.D.2.g.

1428

These estimates are based on the following calculations: $695 (cost per complete filing) x 1.8 filings per
year = $1,251 per year. See supra notes 1425-1427 and accompanying text.

1429

In particular, we expect that funds are more likely to file a report on Part H when there are more complex
events that need to be addressed, which we believe will make it correspondingly more likely that funds will
engage legal counsel.

1430

The costs associated with filing Form N-CR in response to an event specified on Part H of Form N-CR are
paperwork-related costs and are discussed in more detail in infra section IV.D.2.h.

1431

For purposes of our estimate in section IV.D.2.h below, we conservatively estimate that funds would
include a disclosure under Part H in about a quarter of the instances they submit a follow-up filing under
Parts B through F, as well as with respect to a quarter of all filings under Part G. Because of the timing
constraints, we generally would not expect funds would to make a Part H disclosure in an initial filing. We
also would not generally expect funds to make a Form N-CR filing under Part H alone. However, given the
possibility that funds might make a Part H disclosure in the initial filing or on a stand-alone basis, we

435

N-CR in response to an event specified on Part H will be $32,850. 1432
i. Aggregate Operational Costs
In the aggregate, we estimate that compliance with new rule 30b1-8 and Form N-CR
would result in total annual time costs of approximately $339,588 1433 and total external costs of
$80,780. 1434 Given an estimated 559 money market funds that would be required to comply with
new rule 30b1-8 and Form N-CR, 1435 this would result in average annual time costs of
approximately $607 and average annual external costs of $145 on a per-fund basis. 1436
G.

Amendments to Form N-MFP Reporting Requirements

The Commission is today adopting amendments to Form N-MFP, the form that money
market funds use to report their portfolio holdings and other key information to us each month.
We use the information to monitor money market funds and support our examination and
regulatory programs. Each fund must file the required information on Form N-MFP
electronically within five business days after the end of each month. Currently, we make the
information public 60 days after the end of the month. 1437 Money market funds began reporting
this information to us in November 2010. 1438

conservatively estimate one additional Part H filing per year under each scenario. As calculated in in
section IV.D.2.h below, we therefore estimate an annual total of 15 filings in response to Part H.
1432

These estimates are based on the following calculations: $2,190 (cost per complete filing) x 15 filings per
year = $32,850 per year. See supra notes 1430 and 1431 and accompanying text.

1433

See infra note 2446.

1434

See infra note 2447.

1435

See supra note 2448.

1436

See infra note 2449.

1437

See current rule 30b1-7(b).

1438

On average, 575 money market funds (excluding feeder funds) filed Form N-MFP with us each month

436

Today we are amending Form N-MFP to reflect the amendments to rule 2a-7 discussed
above. In addition, we are requiring the reporting of certain new information that will be useful
for our oversight of money market funds, and making other improvements to the form based on
our previous experience with filings submitted to us. Most commenters generally supported the
proposed amendments to Form N-MFP, agreeing that the improved reporting would be useful to
the Commission and investors. 1439 Although these commenters generally supported the proposed
amendments, many of them raised concerns with certain specific changes and additional
reporting items. 1440 We did not receive any comment on a number of the proposed amendments,
and are generally adopting those amendments as proposed.
To respond to comments we received, the final form amendments differ in some respects
from what we proposed, such as not adopting the lot level security and shareholder concentration
reporting requirements, as well as certain other refinements which are discussed below. We are
adopting many of the other proposed amendments unchanged, including eliminating the 60-day
delay on public availability of the data. As proposed, we are not changing the requirement that
funds continue to file reports on Form N-MFP once each month (as they do today), but are
adopting a requirement that certain limited information (such as the NAV per share, liquidity
throughout 2013. Funds reported information on approximately 67,000 securities on average each month.
1439

See, e.g., Wells Fargo Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter (“We generally support the proposed
amendments…”); Boston Federal Reserve Comment Letter. One commenter opposed the amendments
generally, suggesting that Form N-MFP is a tool for the Commission, not investors, and argued that the
cost of the greater reporting requirements is not justified by the usefulness of the information to the
Commission. See Dreyfus Comment Letter. We discuss the usefulness of the information reported on
Form N-MFP to investors throughout this section, and similarly discuss the costs of compliance in section
III.G.5. below.

1440

See, e.g., Wells Fargo Comment Letter (objecting to shareholder flow reporting); Fidelity Comment Letter
(objecting to lot level purchase and sale data); SIFMA Comment Letter (objecting to shareholder
concentration reporting).

437

levels, and shareholder flow) be reported on a weekly basis within the monthly filing. 1441
We are adopting these changes to Form N-MFP because they further support the
Commission’s efforts to oversee the stability of money market funds and compliance with rule
2a-7, 1442 and should assist money market fund shareholders in better understanding the risks of
their investments. As proposed, in connection with these amendments, we are renumbering the
items of Form N-MFP to separate the items into four separate sections and are making other
minor reformatting changes. 1443 These amendments will apply to all money market funds, with
both stable value and floating NAV money market funds reporting on Form N-MFP as amended.
1.

Amendments Related to Rule 2a-7 Reforms

We proposed a number of changes to Form N-MFP designed to conform it with the
general reforms of rule 2a-7. 1444 Commenters generally did not object to these proposed
amendments, and we are adopting them largely as proposed, with some revisions to reflect the
revised approach we are taking to the primary reforms.
a.

Amortized Cost

As part of the primary reforms to rule 2a-7, we proposed to eliminate the use of the

1441

We requested comment on potentially requiring filing of Form N-MFP on a weekly, rather than a monthly
basis. Commenters generally opposed such an increase in frequency of filing of the form, and we are
retaining the requirement to file the form on a monthly basis at this time. See, e.g., Dreyfus Comment
Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter.

1442

References to amended Form N-MFP will be to “Form N-MFP Item” or to “Item” and references to Form
N-MFP as it was proposed to be amended in 2013 will be to “Proposed Form N-MFP Item.” We are not
amending items in Form N-MFP that reference credit ratings at this time.

1443

See Form N-MFP: (i) general information (Items 1 – 8); (ii) information about each series of the fund
(Items A.1 – A.21; (iii) information about each class of the fund (Items B.1 – B.8); and (iv) information
about portfolio securities (Items C.1 – C.25). Our renumbering of the items will enable us to add or delete
items in the future without having to re-number all subsequent items in the form.

1444

See Proposing Release supra note 25, at section III.H.1.

438

amortized cost valuation method for stable value money market funds, and to correspond with
that elimination, we also proposed to remove references to amortized cost and shadow prices
from Form-N-MFP. However, as discussed previously in section II.B.5, the final amendments
will permit the continued use of the amortized cost valuation method for stable value money
market funds. 1445 Accordingly, to conform the changes to Form N-MFP to the final amendments
to rule 2a-7, we are not adopting the Form N-MFP amendments that would have removed
references to the amortized cost of securities in certain existing items, although we are moving
and rephrasing the references where appropriate to be consistent with the final amendments to
rule 2a-7. 1446
Because we proposed to eliminate amortized cost valuation (which would have required
all money market funds to value their shares at market-based values even if they transacted at a
dollar through penny rounding), we had correspondingly proposed to eliminate the reporting
requirements related to money market fund “shadow prices” from Form N-MFP and instead
require funds to report their market-based NAV. As a result of the final amendments to rule 2a-7
permitting the continued use of amortized cost for certain money market funds, the final
1445

See supra section II.B.5.

1446

Form N-MFP currently requires that each series of a fund disclose the total amortized cost of its portfolio
securities (Item 13) and the amortized cost for each portfolio security (Item 41). As we proposed, we are
amending Items 13 and 41 by replacing amortized cost with “value” as defined in section 2(a)(41) of the
Act (generally the market-based value). See Form N-MFP Items A.14.b and C.18, and Form N-MFP
General Instructions, E. Definitions. As a result, we are removing current Form N-MFP Items 45 and 46,
which require that a fund disclose the value of each security using available market quotations, both with
and without the value of any capital support agreement. Form N-MFP Item C.18 would require that money
market funds report portfolio security market values both including and excluding the value of any sponsor
support. As we proposed, to improve transparency of MMF’s risks, we are also clarifying that money
market funds must disclose the value of “any sponsor support” applicable to a particular portfolio security,
rather than “capital support agreements” as stated in current Form N-MFP Items 45 and 46. We are also
continuing to require, as proposed, reporting of the amortized cost value of money market funds that use
that method to value securities for all or any portion of their portfolio. See Form N-MFP Item A.14.b.i .

439

amendments to Form N-MFP also continue to require reporting of fund shadow prices (on a
series and class level) for funds that use the amortized cost method of valuation. 1447 This
requirement would be part of the requirement to report the fund’s NAV on a class and series
level.
b.

Weekly Reporting Within Monthly Filing

The final rules also require reporting of a money market fund’s NAV per share (and
shadow price), daily and weekly liquid assets, and shareholder flows on a weekly basis within
the monthly filing of the form, as we proposed. 1448 Two commenters generally objected to the
proposed requirements for weekly reporting within a monthly form. 1449 These commenters
argued that weekly information gathering will increase fund costs and suggested that the benefits
are speculative. They also noted that this weekly reported information would be available on the
fund’s website, resulting in redundant disclosure. 1450 We appreciate these concerns, but disagree.
Form N-MFP and website disclosure have different purposes. Under our final disclosure
amendments, as discussed above funds will be required to report market-based NAV per share
information daily on their websites (as well as the liquidity and shareholder flow information), so
the weekly information should be readily available at little additional cost. Including this weekly
information on the fund’s filing will allow Commission staff to better monitor risks and trends in
1447

See Form N-MFP Items A.20 and B.5. These requirements are moved and reformatted from the existing
form as part of the overall renumbering and re-organizing of the form.

1448

Form N-MFP Items A.13, A.20, B.5 and B.6. As discussed in section IV.A.6.c funds would also be
required to report their NAV per share and shadow price on a daily basis on their website.

1449

Dreyfus Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter. These commenters objected to all of the proposed
weekly items, including reporting on the funds’ NAV per share, levels of daily and weekly liquid assets,
and shareholder flows.

1450

Id.

440

fund valuation (as well as liquidity and shareholder flow) in an efficient and more precise
manner without requiring frequent visits to the websites of many different funds, and will be a
useful resource for investors and others as well. Because it will be housed in a central repository
of data, this information can be aggregated and analyzed across the fund industry and can be
used in a standardized manner to enhance comparability. 1451 The additional data points we
collect will enable us to better monitor trends and risks on a more granular time level for
individual funds and money market funds as a whole. In contrast, the website disclosures are
intended to be more accessible and “user-friendly” than Form N-MFP for individual investors
trying to research particular funds. We have required other such parallel reporting for similar
reasons. 1452
c.

NAV per share (and shadow price) reporting to Fourth Decimal
Place

Today on Form N-MFP, funds report, both for each series and each class, shadow price
of their NAV, rounded to the fourth decimal place for a fund with a $1.00 share price (or an
equivalent level of accuracy for funds with a different share price). 1453 Under the proposed
amendments to the Form, we proposed to keep this reporting requirement (although in a different
place within the Form consistent with the general reformatting). This reporting is consistent with
the rounding convention that was proposed for floating NAV money market funds to price and
transact in our rule proposal. No commenters specifically addressed this current Form N-MFP
1451

See also supra section III.F.

1452

For example, money market funds are currently required to disclose much of the portfolio holdings
information they disclose on Form N-MFP on the fund’s website as well. See current rule 2a-7(c)(12)(ii);
Form N-MFP General Instruction A.

1453

Form N-MFP Items 18 and 25. See also Proposing Release supra note 25, at section III.H.1.

441

requirement, or its reformatting. As discussed in section III.B.3.c above we are adopting a
requirement for floating NAV funds to transact at this “basis point rounding” level of accuracy.
As when we originally adopted this requirement in 2010, we continue to believe that information
about a fund’s NAV priced to a basis point rounding level of accuracy will be relevant and useful
for the Commission and investors when monitoring money market fund risks and trends. 1454 This
information will be used by the Commission and others to identify money market funds that
continue to seek to maintain a stable price per share 1455 and help us better evaluate any potential
deviations in their unrounded share price. Reporting the NAV per share to the fourth decimal
place on Form N-MFP is also consistent with the precision of NAV reporting that funds would
be required to provide on their websites under our final amendments. Accordingly, the Form
continues to require reporting of a money market fund’s NAV to the fourth decimal place, as is
required today and under the proposal. 1456
d.

Category Reporting

As we proposed, we are also amending the category options at the series level that money
market funds use to identify themselves to include exempt government fund as an option. 1457 We
are also adding a sub question, new from the proposal, asking if the fund is an exempt retail fund

1454

See 2010 Adopting Release, supra note 81, at section II.E.2. We note that many large fund complexes
already disclose on their websites the daily money market fund market valuations (i.e., shadow prices) of at
least some of their money market funds, rounded to four decimal places (“basis point” rounding), for
example, BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, and J.P. Morgan. See, e.g., Money Funds' New Openness
Unlikely to Stop Regulation, WALL ST. J. (Jan. 30, 2013). See also sections III.B and IV.A.6.

1455

We are also adopting, as proposed, a new item requiring reporting for funds that seek to maintain a stable
price per share to state the price that the fund seeks to maintain. See Form N-MFP Item A.18.

1456

Form N-MFP Items A.20 and B.5.

1457

See Form N-MFP, Item A.10.

442

under rule 2a-7. 1458 This new subsection is necessary to help identify whether a fund is exempt
because it is a government fund or if it is exempt because it is a retail fund which will be
important in our ongoing monitoring efforts. These new categories will allow us to better
identify the types of funds operating.
e.

Economic Analysis

Consistent with the proposal, any effect resulting from these amendments (except as
noted below), including the requirement that each monthly report include information on a
weekly basis, is included in our economic analysis of our amendments that require money
market funds to disclose NAV, liquidity and shareholder flow daily on fund websites. 1459
Accordingly, we do not believe that the proposed amendments would impose other costs not
discussed in that section on money market funds other than those required to modify systems
used to aggregate data and file reports on Form N-MFP, as discussed below. We expect, as
discussed previously in this section, that the revised forms will benefit investors by enhancing
their understanding of money market funds, and will enhance our monitoring and regulatory
programs.
We believe that the revised form will be easier for investors to understand because the
amendments will allow investors to better focus on a single market-based valuation for
individual portfolio securities and the fund’s overall NAV per share. Accordingly, we expect
that the overall effects will be to increase efficiency for investors. Because we believe that
investors are likely to make at least incremental changes to their trading patterns in money
1458

See Form N-MFP, Item A.10.a.

1459

See supra section III.E.9.h.

443

market funds due to the changes to Form N-MFP, it is likely that the changes will affect
competition and capital formation. Although it is difficult to quantify the size of these effects
without better knowledge about how investors will respond, we believe that the effects from the
changes to Form N-MFP will be small relative to the effects of the underlying reforms.
2.

New Reporting Requirements

We are also adopting several new items to Form N-MFP that we believe will improve our
(and investors’) ability to monitor money market funds. As discussed further below, these final
amendments include some, but not all of the new reporting requirements that we had proposed.
For example, as proposed, the final amendments include additional information about fair value
categorization and LEIs (if available). We are also adopting, with some changes from the
proposal, revisions to several other items, including revised investment categories for portfolio
securities and repurchase agreement collateral. However, we are not adopting the lot level
portfolio security disclosure, top 20 shareholder information, and security identifier level
reporting on repo collateral that we had proposed. These amendments we are adopting should
help address gaps in data that have become apparent from analysis of Form N-MFP filings that
we have received to date. As discussed further below, each amendment requires reporting of
additional information that should be readily available to the fund and, in many cases, should
infrequently change from report to report.
a. Security Identifiers
Certain of the final amendments we are adopting today are designed to help us and

444

investors better identify fund portfolio securities. 1460 To facilitate monitoring and analysis of the
risks posed by funds, it is important for Commission staff to be able to identify individual
portfolio securities. Fund shareholders and potential investors that are evaluating the risks of a
fund’s portfolio will similarly benefit from the clear identification of a fund’s portfolio securities.
Currently, the form requests information about the CUSIP number of a security, which the staff
uses as a search reference. The staff has found that some securities reported by money market
funds lack a CUSIP number, and this absence has reduced the usefulness of other information
reported. 1461 To address this issue, we are adopting as proposed the requirement that funds also
report the LEI that corresponds to the security, if available. 1462 We are also adopting as proposed
final amendments that require that funds report at least one other security identifier, if

1460

We also are also adopting, as proposed, a requirement that a fund provide the name, e-mail address, and
telephone number of the person authorized to receive information and respond to questions about Form
N-MFP from Commission staff. We will exclude this information from Form N-MFP information that is
made publicly available through EDGAR. See Form N-MFP Item 8.

1461

Our inability to identify specific securities, for example, limits our ability to compare ownership of the
security across multiple funds and monitor issuer exposure. As discussed in the proposal, during the month
of February 2013, funds reported 6,821 securities without CUSIPs (approximately 10% of all securities
reported on the form).

1462

See Form N-MFP Item C.4; Form N-MFP General Instructions, E. Definitions (defining “LEI”). To ensure
accurate identification of Form N-MFP filers and update the Form for pending industry-wide changes, we
are also requiring, as proposed, that each registrant provide its LEI, if available. See Form N-MFP Item 3.
The Legal Entity Identifier is a unique identifier associated with a single corporate entity and is intended to
provide a uniform international standard for identifying counterparties to a transaction. The Commission
has begun to require disclosure of the LEI, once available. See, e.g., Form PF, Reporting Form for
Investment Advisers to Private Funds and Certain Commodity Pool Operators and Commodity Trading
Advisors, available at http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2011/ia-3308-formpf.pdf. A global LEI standard is
currently in the implementation stage. See Frequently Asked Questions: Global Legal Entity Identifier
(LEI) (Feb. 2013), U.S. Treasury Dept., available at
http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/ofr/data/Documents/LEI_FAQs_February2013_FINAL.pdf. Consistent
with staff guidance provided in a Form PF Frequently Asked Questions, available at
http://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/pfrd/pfrdfaq.shtml, funds that have been issued a CFTC Interim
Compliant Identifier (“CICI”) by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission may provide this identifier
in lieu of the LEI until a global LEI standard is established.

445

available. 1463 One commenter suggested that the proposed requirement to include multiple
securities identifiers might not be possible for certain securities, such as municipal securities,
which may only have a single identifier available. 1464 We note that the requirement to include
multiple identifiers is only required if such identifiers are actually available. 1465
b.

Fair Value Categorization

We are also adopting, with certain modifications from the proposal described below,
amendments that are designed to help the staff and investors better identify certain risk
characteristics that the form currently does not capture. Responses to these new items, together
with other information reported, would improve the staff and investors’ understanding of a fund
and its potential risks by providing information about how the fund is valuing its investments.
We proposed to require funds to report whether a security is categorized as a level 1,
level 2, or level 3 measurement in the fair value hierarchy under U.S. GAAP. 1466 We noted in the
Proposing Release that we understood that most money market fund portfolio securities are
categorized as level 2, and that although we understood that very few of a money market fund’s

See Form N-MFP Item C.5 (requiring that, in addition to the CUSIP and LEI, a fund provide at least one
additional security identifier, if available). Security identifiers should be readily available to funds. See,
e.g., http://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/cik.htm (providing a CIK lookup that is searchable by company
name). We are also requiring that a fund provide the LEI (if available) for a security subject to a
repurchase agreement (but unlike under the proposal, not the CUSIP). See Form N-MFP Items C.8.

1466

See Accounting Standards Codification 820, “Fair Value Measurement”; Proposed Form N-MFP Item
C.20. Level 1 categorized measurements include quoted prices for identical securities in an active market.
Level 2 categorized measurements include: (i) quoted prices for similar securities in active markets;
(ii) quoted prices for identical or similar securities in non-active markets; and (iii) pricing models whose
inputs are observable or derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through
correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the security. Security measurements
categorized as level 3 are those whose value cannot be determined by using observable measures (such as
market quotes and prices of comparable instruments) and often involve estimates based on certain
assumptions.

446

portfolio securities are currently valued using significant unobservable inputs, and thus
categorized as level 3, information about any such securities would enable our staff to identify
individual securities that may be more susceptible to wide variations in pricing. 1467 We also
discussed how Commission staff could use this information to monitor for increased valuation
risk in these securities, and to the extent there is a concentration in the security across the
industry, identify potential outliers that warrant additional monitoring or investigation. One
commenter objected to the requirement to report the fair value level of portfolio securities,
arguing that because most money market fund securities are categorized as level 2, a more
efficient approach would be to only require disclosure if a security is categorized as level 3. 1468
We agree that because most money market fund securities are categorized as level 2, the relevant
information for us and investors is whether the security is categorized as level 3, and that it
would be simpler and less costly for funds to report whether a security is categorized as level 3,
rather than the level used for each security in the fund’s portfolio. Accordingly, the final
amendments require funds to disclose whether a security is categorized at level 3, not the fair
value level of each security. 1469 We believe that most funds directly evaluate the fair value level
measurement categorization when they acquire the security and reassess the categorization when
they perform portfolio valuations. 1470 Accordingly, we continue to believe that funds should have

ready access to the nature of the portfolio security valuation inputs used.
c.

Lot Level Reporting

We proposed to require funds to report additional information about each portfolio
security, including, in addition to the total principal amount, the purchase date, the yield at
purchase, the yield as of the Form N-MFP reporting date (for floating and variable rate
securities, if applicable), 1471 and the purchase price. 1472 This information would have been
required to be reported separately for each lot purchased. 1473 In addition, we proposed to require
that money market funds disclose the same information for any security sold during the reporting
period. 1474 In the Proposing Release, we suggested that because money market funds often hold
multiple maturities of a single issuer, each time a security is purchased or sold, price discovery
occurs and an issuer yield curve could be updated and used for revaluing all holdings of that
particular security. Therefore, our proposed amendments, if adopted, could have had the
incidental benefit of facilitating price discovery and would have enabled the Commission,
1471

We understand that the yields on variable rate demand notes, for example, may vary daily, weekly, or
monthly. Our amendments would have provided Commission staff and others with a way to monitor the
market’s response to changes in credit quality, as well as identify potential outliers.

1472

See proposed N-MFP Item C.17. Because yield at purchase would be disclosed in a separate item, we
proposed to delete the reference to “(including coupon or yield)” from current Form N-MFP Item 27 (Form
N-MFP Item C.2). Because as discussed below, we are not adopting the lot level reporting requirements
we proposed, we are retaining the reference to coupon in the title of the issue. However, to facilitate use of
the data collected and to clarify the time that the yield of the security must be calculated (as of the Form NMFP reporting date), we are moving the question about yield out of the title question and adopting it as a
standalone response. See proposed N-MFP Item C.17. When disclosing a security’s coupon or yield (as
required in proposed Form N-MFP Items C.2 or C.8.e), funds generally should report (i) the stated coupon
rate, where the security is issued with a stated coupon, and (ii) the coupon rate as of the Form N-MFP
reporting date, if the security is floating or variable rate. Because we not adopting the lot level reporting
requirement, funds would not need to report, as discussed in the proposal, the interest rate at purchase.
Finally, funds generally should disclose the name of the collateral issuer (and not the name of the issuer of
the repurchase agreement).

investors, and others to evaluate pricing consistency across funds (and identify potential
outliers). 1475
A number of commenters strongly opposed this proposed new lot level reporting
requirement. 1476 They noted that the number of reporting line items could go up tenfold under
this requirement, and that costly new systems would need to be built to effectively report this
information on an ongoing basis. 1477 Commenters also noted that the lot level security
information is proprietary, and could be used to the disadvantage of funds and shareholders. 1478
They also questioned the value of this information to the Commission, noting the high costs of
providing it. 1479 We appreciate the concerns of commenters, and are modifying the final
amendments to eliminate the proposed lot level security reporting requirement. Although
collecting data on the purchase and sale of money market fund securities could improve pricing
transparency, and allow us to better monitor risks and valuation issues, we are persuaded by
commenters that reporting this information at the lot level may be costly and could disclose
proprietary information about security purchase prices that could harm funds, and therefore their
shareholders. We also believe that this data might be more useful if collected on a systematic,

No. FSOC–2012–0003) (‘‘Federal Reserve Bank Presidents FSOC Comment Letter’’), supra note 48

yields, and 11 of those were Treasury securities).

market-wide basis which may both provide more comprehensive and consistent coverage and
mitigate the concerns about proprietary data disclosure. 1480 Accordingly, we are not adopting the
lot level purchase and sale data reporting requirements that we proposed.
d.

Liquidity and Shareholder Flow Data

We are also adopting amendments, with certain modifications from the proposal as
described below, that require funds to report the amount of cash they hold, 1481 the fund’s daily
liquid assets and weekly liquid assets, 1482 and whether each security is considered a daily liquid
asset or weekly liquid asset. 1483 Unlike the other items of disclosure on Form N-MFP that must
be disclosed on a monthly basis, as discussed previously, we are requiring that funds report their
Daily Liquid Assets and Weekly Liquid Assets on a weekly basis. 1484 One commenter suggested
that we align reporting of fund liquid assets on Form N-MFP (which is dollar based) with the
reporting of liquid assets on fund websites (which is percentage based). 1485 We agree that such
alignment would provide better consistency and comparability of information between

other methods, such as increasing the categories of securities reported through the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority’s Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) system.” Wells Fargo

See Form N-MFP Item A.14.a and Form N-MFP General Instructions, E. Definitions (requiring, as
proposed, disclosure of the amount of cash held and defining “cash” to mean demand deposits in insured
depository institutions and cash holdings in custodial accounts, respectively). We are also amending, as
proposed, Item 14 of Form N-MFP (total value of other assets) to clarify that “other assets” excludes the
value of assets disclosed separately (e.g., cash and the value of portfolio securities). See Form N-MFP Item
A.14.c. This amendment would ensure that reported amounts are not double counted.

information on fund’s website and the information reported on Form N-MFP. Accordingly, the
final amendments to Form N-MFP require reporting of fund daily and weekly liquid assets on
both a dollar and percentage basis. 1486 Because the percentages are already reported on fund
websites, this information should be readily available. The information should help us and
others to better understand the relative liquidity of fund portfolios.
Similarly, we are adopting the proposed amendments to require that money market funds
disclose the weekly gross subscriptions (including dividend reinvestments) and weekly gross
redemptions for each share class, once each week during the month reported. 1487 As discussed
earlier, money market funds would continue to file reports on Form N-MFP once each month,
but certain information (including disclosure of daily and weekly liquid assets) would be
reported weekly within the form. Several commenters objected to the requirement to disclose
shareholder flow data, arguing that such disclosure could be confusing to shareholders, and is not
necessarily indicative of stress. 1488 One commenter also suggested that if shareholder flow data
was reported, it should be on a net rather than gross basis. 1489
We agree that shareholder flows do not necessarily indicate stress in a fund, but they can
be informative in monitoring fund activity and evaluating the potential risks. We believe gross

1486

Form N-MFP Items A.13.a – A.13.d. As discussed in section III.G.2.i, we are not requiring disclosure of
liquid assets on fund websites on a dollar basis because we believe that the most relevant information to
investors is the percentage of fund assets that are liquid.

1487

See Form N-MFP Item B.6. We also are continuing to require that money market funds disclose the
monthly gross subscriptions and monthly gross redemptions for the month reported. See current Form NMFP Item 23.

1488

See, e.g., Legg Mason & Western Asset Comment Letter; Dreyfus Comment Letter; Wells Fargo Comment
Letter.

451

rather than net flow data is more useful for us and investors because it allows more transparency
into the particular redemption and purchase patterns at a fund. We do not believe this additional
information would confuse investors, because they can compare the gross inflows to the gross
outflows if they believe that the net data is the relevant information in their decision making
process. We continue to believe that these amendments would provide Commission staff and
others with additional relevant data to efficiently monitor fund risk (such as monitoring the risk
that a fund might cross the 10% liquidity-based fee threshold under the liquidity fee amendments
we are adopting today), and correlated risk shifts in liquidity across the industry. 1490 Increased
periodic disclosure of the daily and weekly liquid assets on Form N-MFP would provide
increased transparency into how funds manage their liquidity, and it may also impose market
discipline on portfolio managers. In addition, increased disclosure of weekly gross subscriptions
and gross redemptions (reported weekly, in addition to monthly) would improve the ability of the
Commission, investors, and others to better understand the significance of other liquidity
disclosures required by our proposals (e.g., daily and weekly liquid assets). It will also allow the
Commission to better understand patterns of shareholder flows over time and how funds respond
to those shareholder flows, and compare those flows to funds’ liquid assets, and we may use
them in connection with our examination and regulatory efforts. Accordingly, we are adopting
the amendments to disclose weekly gross subscriptions and weekly gross redemptions as
proposed.

1490

As discussed in section III.E.9.a, money market funds would also be required to disclose each day on its
website the fund’s Daily Liquid Assets and Weekly Liquid Assets and shareholder flows.

452

e.

Fee Waivers

We are today also adopting the proposed requirement that each fund must disclose
whether its adviser or a third party paid for or waived all or part of its operating expenses or
management fees during a given reporting period. 1491 One commenter objected to this proposed
requirement, arguing that fee waivers are not necessarily indicative of an adviser’s financial
position, and that such information may confuse investors and leave an incorrect impression of
the health of the adviser because waivers are just one aspect of the financial ability of an adviser
to support a fund. 1492
We agree that fee waivers are not necessarily dispositive information about an adviser’s
financial position or its willingness to potentially support a fund. We do not agree that this
information would confuse investors, in part because fee waivers are already disclosed in the
fund’s prospectus (as discussed below), and interested investors may wish to use this information
in their investment decision making process, even if it is not the sole or even most dispositive
piece of information used in evaluating the financial health of the adviser or the ability of the
adviser to support the fund in times of stress. We continue to believe, as stated in the proposal,
that information about expense waivers is relevant and will help both investors and the
Commission better evaluate money market fund performance and risk and respond accordingly.
To the extent that money market funds waive fees to boost performance and attract assets, the
new disclosure requirement should help investors better understand the basis of fund

1491

Form N-MFP Item B.8 (requiring that funds provide the name of the person and describe the nature and
amount the expense payment or fee waiver, or both (reported in dollars)).

1492

453

performance so they can make more informed investment choices. 1493 In addition, the
Commission will be better able to evaluate and respond to financial strains on fund advisers. In
low interest rate environments, money market fund yields can become sufficiently small that
advisers must waive fees to offer investors positive returns. 1494 It may also help us better monitor
the overall financial impact of fee waivers on money market fund advisers and the effect of such
waivers on the industry as a whole. Accordingly, we are adopting the fee waiver reporting
requirement as proposed.
f.

Percentage of Shares Held by Top 20 Shareholders

We proposed to amend Form N-MFP to require funds to disclose the total percentage of
shares outstanding held by the twenty largest shareholders of record. At the time, we noted that
this information could help us (and investors) identify funds with significant potential
redemption risk stemming from shareholder concentration, and evaluate the likelihood that a
significant market or credit event might result in a run on the fund or the imposition of a liquidity

1493

We recognize fee waivers are also required to be disclosed in a fund’s fee table, but believe it is useful to
have them reported on Form N-MFP as well, for the same reasons discussed in the section on weekly
reporting within a monthly filing above, as each set of disclosures may reach different audiences who may
be seeking out the information for different purposes (i.e. an investor looking at fee waivers in the fee table
may be looking at them for purposes of whether fees on their investments may go up later, while investors
looking in Form N-MFP may be looking to help determine the potential impact on the adviser).

1494

In some cases, fee waivers can have similar effects as capital support. Since 2009, MMFs have
dramatically increased fee waivers to keep yields positive in a low interest rate environment. In 2011,
MMFs waived more fees ($5.2 billion) than they collected ($4.7 billion). See Investment Company
Institute, “Submission by the Investment Company Institute Working Group On Money Market Fund
Reform Standing Committee on Investment Management International Organization of Securities
Commissions,” Feb 7, 2012. Moreover, more money was forfeited in fee waivers from 2009-2011 ($13.3
billion) than was spent during the financial crises from 2007-2009 by fund advisers on capital support
events ($12.0 billion) to stabilize the NAVs of the largest 100 (US and European) prime funds. See
Moody’s Sponsor Support Report, supra note 54.

454

fee or gate. 1495
A number of commenters objected to this proposed reporting requirement, arguing that
such data could be confusing to shareholders because investments through omnibus accounts
would be counted as single shareholders of record, potentially portraying a misleading portrait of
the concentration level of the fund. 1496 A commenter also suggested that the appearance of
higher shareholder concentration levels as a result of omnibus accounts does not necessarily
correlate with higher run risk and may mislead the public. 1497 We recognize this, and agree that
because of the prevalence of omnibus accounts, the proposed shareholder concentration
disclosure may not succeed in achieving its purpose as the information provided may portray an
incorrect and misleading picture of the level of shareholder concentration in a fund. This
disclosure may create confusion if certain funds appear more concentrated than they actually are,
as a result of those omnibus accounts appearing to be a single shareholder. For the same reasons,
we expect that the information would similarly not be particularly useful for us in our monitoring
efforts. Accordingly, upon further consideration of these concerns, we are not adopting the
requirement to report the percentage of fund shares held by the top 20 shareholders.
g.

Investment Categories

We are also adopting, with some changes in response to comments, certain amendments
to Form N-MFP’s investment categories for portfolio securities. The new investment categories
should help Commission staff identify particular exposures that otherwise are often reported in

1495

Form N-MFP Item A.19.

1496

See, e.g., Schwab Comment Letter; Federated VIII Comment Letter.

1497

Dreyfus Comment Letter.

455

other less descriptive categories (e.g., reporting sovereign debt as “treasury debt” or reporting
asset-backed securities (that are not commercial paper) as “other note” or “other instrument”). 1498
Several commenters suggested revisions to the investment categories we proposed, noting that
these changes would better match investment categories that are used more broadly and
consistently in the industry. 1499 After reviewing these comments, we have revised the final
investment categories to better align the categories with typical industry categorizations and
provide a more precise description of fund investments. 1500 We expect that the revised categories
should not pose an additional burden compared to the categories we proposed, as they are very
similar, with minor changes to better reflect our understanding of common industry practice.
h.

Other Amendments

In addition, we are adopting, as we proposed, the amendments that would require funds

1498

Currently N-MFP requires funds to categorize their investments from among the following categories:
“Treasury Debt; Government Agency Debt; Variable Rate Demand Note; Other Municipal Debt; Financial
Company Commercial Paper; Asset Backed Commercial Paper; Other Commercial Paper; Certificate of
Deposit; Structured Investment Vehicle Note; Other Note; Treasury Repurchase Agreement; Government
Agency Repurchase Agreement; Other Repurchase Agreement; Insurance Company Funding Agreement;
Investment Company; Other Instrument. If Other Instrument, include a brief description.” Current Form
N-MFP Item 31. We proposed to amend the investment categories in proposed Form N-MFP Item C.6 to
include new categories: “Non U.S. Sovereign Debt,” “Non-U.S. Sub-Sovereign Debt,” “Other AssetBacked Security,” “Non-Financial Company Commercial Paper” (instead of “Other Commercial Paper”),
and “Collateralized Commercial Paper,” and amend “U.S. Government Agency Debt” and “Certificate of
Deposit (including Time Deposits and Euro Time Deposits).”

1499

See Wells Fargo Comment Letter; Fidelity Comment Letter.

1500

The final rules would amend the amend the investment categories in Form N-MFP Item C.6 to include the
following selections: “U.S. Treasury Debt; U.S. Government Agency Debt; Non-U.S. Sovereign, SubSovereign and Supra-National debt; Certificate of Deposit; Non-Negotiable Time Deposit; Variable Rate
Demand Note; Other Municipal Security; Asset Backed Commercial Paper; Other Asset Backed Securities;
U.S. Treasury Repurchase Agreement, if collateralized only by U.S. Treasuries (including Strips) and cash;
U.S. Government Agency Repurchase Agreement, collateralized only by U.S. Government Agency
securities, U.S. Treasuries, and cash; Other Repurchase Agreement, if any collateral falls outside Treasury,
Government Agency and cash; Insurance Company Funding Agreement; Investment Company; Financial
Company Commercial Paper; Non-Financial Company Commercial Paper; or Tender Option Bond. If
Other Instrument, include a brief description.”

456

to report the maturity date for each portfolio security using the maturity date used to calculate the
dollar-weighted average life maturity (“WAL”) (i.e., without reference to the exceptions in rule
2a-7(i) regarding interest rate readjustments). 1501 As we discussed in our proposal, this
information will assist the Commission in monitoring and evaluating this risk, at the security
level, as well as help evaluate compliance with rule 2a-7’s maturity provisions. 1502 In addition,
our amendments would make clear that funds must disclose for each security all three maturity
calculations as required under rule 2a-7: WAM, WAL, and the legal maturity date. 1503
We are also adopting, as proposed, a requirement that a fund disclose the number of
shares outstanding, to the nearest hundredth, at both the series level and class level. 1504 This
information would permit us to verify or detect errors in information provided on Form N-MFP,
such as NAV. We are also adopting, as proposed, a requirement that a fund disclose, where
applicable, the period remaining until the principal amount of a security may be recovered
through a demand feature and whether a security demand feature is conditional. 1505 As we
discussed in the proposal, these amendments will improve the Commission’s and (investors’)
ability to evaluate and monitor a security’s credit and default risk. We did not receive comment
1501

Form N-MFP Item C.12.

1502

We are also newly clarifying that the maturity date required to be reported in current Form N-MFP Item 35
is the maturity date used to calculate WAM under rule 2a-7(d)(1)(ii) (see Form N-MFP Item C.11) and the
maturity date required to be reported in current Form N-MFP Item 36 is the ultimate legal maturity date,
i.e., the date on which, in accordance with the terms of the security without regard to any interest rate
readjustment or demand feature, the principal amount must unconditionally be paid (see Form N-MFP Item
C.13). The ultimate legal maturity date, as clarified, will help us distinguish between debt securities that
are issued by the same issuer.

1503

Form N-MFP Items C.11, C.12 and C.13. In a modification from the proposal, we have changed the term
“final legal maturity date” in Item C.13of Form N-MFP to “ultimate legal maturity date” to clarify the
reporting date for securities that may have varying maturity dates.

on these other amendments and are adopting them as proposed.
i.

Economic Analysis

As detailed above and discussed in the proposal, these new reporting requirements are
intended to address gaps in the reporting regime that Commission staff has identified through our
experience with Form N-MFP and to enhance the ability of the Commission and investors to
monitor funds. Although the benefits are difficult to quantify, they will improve the ability of
the Commission and investors to identify and analyze a fund’s portfolio securities (e.g., by
requiring disclosure of LEIs and an additional security identifier, if available, already required).
In addition, many of our new reporting requirements will enhance the ability of the Commission
and investors to evaluate a fund’s risk characteristics (by requiring that funds disclose, for
example, the following data: security categorizations, whether a security is valued using level 3
measurements; more detailed information about securities at the time of purchase; and liquidity
metrics). We believe that the additional information required is readily available to funds as a
matter of general business practice and therefore will not impose costs on money market funds
other than those required to modify systems used to aggregate data and file reports on Form NMFP. These costs are discussed in section IV.C.2 below.
These new reporting requirements will improve informational efficiency by improving
the transparency of potential risks in money market funds and promoting better-informed
investment decisions, which, in turn, will lead to a better allocation of capital. Similarly, the
increased transparency may promote competition among funds as fund managers are exposed to
external market discipline and better-informed investors who may be more likely to select an
alternative investment if they are not comfortable with the risk-return profile of their fund. As

458

we discussed in the Proposing Release, the newly disclosed information may cause some money
market fund investors to move their assets among different money market funds, but we do not
have the information necessary to provide a reasonable estimate of this possibility. In addition,
some investors may move assets among money market funds and alternative investments (e.g.,
private liquidity funds, separately managed accounts, or certificates of deposit) or other segments
of the short-term financing markets, but we are unable to estimate how frequently this will
happen with specificity and we do not know how the other underlying assets compare with those
of money market funds. In addition, it is difficult to establish the extent to which any such
exchanges would be a result of the broader amendments we are making or a marginal effect of
the amendments we are making to Form N-MFP. In addition, no commenters suggested ways
for us to quantify these exchanges with specificity. Thus, we continue to remain unable to
estimate the amount of such asset movements with specificity. Therefore, we are unable to
estimate the overall net effect on capital formation or competition. Nevertheless, we believe that
the net effect will be small, especially during normal market conditions, in part because such
asset movements would generally be among investment alternatives, rather than avoiding
investment entirely.
3.

Clarifying Amendments

We are adopting, as proposed, several amendments to clarify current instructions and
items of Form N-MFP. Revising the form to include these clarifications should improve the
ability of fund managers to complete the form and improve the quality of the data they submit to

459

us. 1506 We believe that many of our clarifying amendments are consistent with current filing
practices. 1507
We understand that some fund managers compile their funds’ portfolio holdings
information as of the last calendar day of the month, even if that day falls on a weekend or
holiday. To provide flexibility, we are amending, as proposed, the instructions to Form N-MFP
to clarify that, unless otherwise specified, a fund may report information on Form N-MFP as of
the last business day or any later calendar day of the month. 1508 We are also revising, as
proposed, the definition of “Master-Feeder Fund” to clarify that the definition of “Feeder Fund”
includes unregistered funds (such as offshore funds). 1509 Our final amendments also would
clarify, as proposed, that funds should calculate the WAM and WAL reported on Form N-MFP
using the same methods they use for purposes of compliance with rule 2a-7. 1510 We also are
1506

We are also adopting, as proposed, technical changes to the “General Information” section of the form that
will clarify the circumstances under which a money market fund must complete certain question sub-parts.
See Form N-MFP Items 6 and 7.

1507

As discussed below, the final amendments are consistent with written guidance our staff has provided to
money market fund managers and service providers completing Form N-MFP.

1508

See Form N-MFP General Instruction A (Rule as to Use of Form N-MFP); rule 30b1-7. Our approach is
also consistent with a previous interpretation provided by our staff. See Staff Responses to Questions about
Rule 30b1-7 and Form N-MFP, Question I.B.1 (revised July 29, 2011), available at
http://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/guidance/formn-mfpqa.htm.

1509

See Form N-MFP General Instruction E (defining “Master-Feeder Fund,” and defining “Feeder Fund” to
include a registered or unregistered pooled investment vehicle). Form N-MFP requires that a master fund
report the identity of any feeder fund. Our amendment is designed to address inconsistencies in reporting
of master-feeder fund data that we have observed in filings, and will help us determine the extent to which
feeder funds, wherever located, hold a master fund’s shares. The change will also reflect how we
understand data from master-feeder funds is collected by the ICI for its statistical reports. We are also
making grammatical and conforming amendments to Form N-MFP Items A.7 and A.8, as proposed.

1510

See Form N-MFP Items A.11 and A.12 (defining “WAM” and “WAL” and cross-referencing the maturity
terms to rule 2a-7). We are also amending the 7-day gross yield to require that the resulting yield figure be
carried to (removing the words “at least”) the nearest hundredth of one per cent and clarify that master and
feeder funds should report the 7-day gross yield (current Form N-MFP Item 17) at the master fund level.
Form N-MFP Item A.19. These amendments are intended to achieve consistency in reporting and remove
potential ambiguity for feeder funds when reporting the 7-day gross yield.

requiring, as proposed, that funds disclose in Part B (Class-Level Information about the Fund)
the required information for each class of the series, regardless of the number of shares
outstanding in the class. 1511
We also are amending, with certain modifications from the proposal discussed below, the
reporting requirements for repurchase agreements by restating the item’s requirements as two
distinct questions. 1512 The amendment would make clear that information about the securities
subject to a repurchase agreement must be disclosed regardless of how the fund treats the
acquisition of the repurchase agreement for purposes of rule 2a-7’s diversification
requirements. 1513 As part of these amendments, we proposed to amend form N-MFP to require
reporting of a security identifier of collateral securities underlying repurchase agreements. 1514
One commenter objected to this revision, arguing that this level of detail would publicly disclose
proprietary information about broker-dealer inventories, which may negatively affect allocations
of repurchase agreements to money market funds. 1515 We appreciate this concern and are not

1511

See text before Form N-MFP Item B.1. Our staff has found that funds inconsistently report fund class
information, for example, when a fund does not report a fund class registered on Form N-1A because the
fund class has no shares outstanding. Our amendment is intended to clarify a fund’s reporting obligations
and provide Commission staff (and investors) with more complete information about each fund’s capital
structure.

1512

See Form N-MFP Item C.7 (requiring that a fund disclose if it is treating the acquisition of a repurchase
agreement as the acquisition of the underlying securities (i.e., collateral) for purposes of portfolio
diversification under rule 2a-7). See Form N-MFP Item C.8. (requiring that a fund describe the securities
subject to the repurchase agreement). This information should be readily available to funds and would
enhance the ability of Commission staff and others to evaluate the risks (e.g., rollover risk or the duration
of the lending) presented by investments in repurchase agreements. See Form N-MFP Item C.8.a.

1513

We are also making several other non-substantive clarifications to other items. See Form N-MFP Item 1
(amending the format of reporting date provided by funds); and Form N-MFP Item A.10 (modifying, for
consistency, the names of money market fund categories).

adopting the requirement to report a security identifier of the collateral securities underlying
repurchase agreements for that reason. 1516 In addition, the same commenter objected to the
revised investment categories we proposed regarding this collateral, arguing that we should
instead use the categories used to report tri-party repurchase agreement information to the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York (“NY Fed”). 1517 We agree that conforming these categories
to those used in other reporting contexts will ease reporting burdens and enhance comparability,
and accordingly have modified the proposed investment categories to conform them to the
categories used by the NY Fed. 1518
Finally, we are amending, as proposed, the items in Form N-MFP that require
information about demand features, guarantors, or enhancement providers to make clear that
funds should disclose the identity of each demand feature issuer, guarantor, or enhancement
provider and the amount (i.e., percentage) of fractional support provided, which should help us
monitor funds diversification. 1519 Our amendments also clarify, as proposed, that a fund is not
required to provide additional information about a security’s demand feature(s) or guarantee(s)
unless the fund is relying on the demand feature or guarantee to determine the quality, maturity,
or liquidity of the security. 1520

1518

See Form N-MFP Item C.8.h.

1519

See Form N-MFP Items C.14 – C.16.

1520

Form N-MFP already requires that a fund disclose only security enhancements on which the fund is relying
to determine the quality, maturity, or liquidity of the security. See current Form N-MFP Item 39.
Similarly, we are amending, as proposed, current Form N-MFP Items 37 (demand features) and 38
(guarantees) to make clear that funds are required to disclose information relating to demand features and
guarantees only when the fund is relying on these features to determine the quality, maturity, or liquidity of
the security. See Form N-MFP Items C.14 and C.15.

462

As discussed above, and in the proposal, these clarifying amendments are intended to
improve the quality of the data we receive on Form N-MFP by clarifying a number of reporting
obligations so that all funds report information on Form N-MFP in a consistent manner.
Accordingly, we do not believe that these clarifying amendments would impose any new costs
on funds other than those required to modify systems used to aggregate data and file reports on
Form N-MFP, to the extent that funds in the past may have reported this information differently.
These costs are discussed in section III.G.5 below. Because these clarifying amendments will
not change funds’ current reporting obligations, we believe there will be no effect on efficiency,
competition, or capital formation.
4.

Public Availability of Information

As we proposed, we are today eliminating the 60-day delay on public availability of
Form N-MFP data. 1521 Currently, each money market fund must file information on Form
N-MFP electronically within five business days after the end of each month and that information
is made publicly available 60 days after the end of the month for which it is filed.
Several commenters objected to our proposed elimination of the 60-day delay,
particularly considering the sensitivity of the new lot level security reporting that we had
proposed (but, as discussed above, are not adopting). 1522 Other commenters supported shortening
the delay to five or ten days (primarily to permit amendments to fix problems in the data if
needed), 1523 or eliminating it entirely. 1524

1521

See rule 30b1-7 (eliminating subsection (b), public availability).

1522

See, e.g., BlackRock II Comment Letter; Legg Mason & Western Asset Comment Letter.

1523

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter; Federated II Comment Letter; Vanguard Comment Letter.

463

This delay, which we instituted when we adopted the form in 2010, responded to
commenters’ concerns regarding potential reactions of investors to the extent of the additional
disclosure of funds’ portfolio information and shadow NAVs in the form. 1525 Although we
expected that, over time, investors and analysts would become more accustomed to the
information disclosed about fund portfolios and thus there may be less need in the future to keep
the portfolio information private for 60 days, we believed then that the shadow price data should
not be made public immediately, at least initially. 1526 However, with experience, we now believe
that the immediate release of the shadow price data and other money market fund portfolio
security data would not be harmful and that investors may benefit from more timely access to the
data. This is based, in part, on our understanding that many money market funds now disclose
their shadow prices every business day on their websites, and frequently provide lists of holdings
and information about liquidity to the public as well.
Several commenters requested that if we eliminated the public availability delay that we
lengthen the 5-day filing time period in light of the increased reporting requirements under the
amended form, in order to provide additional time to fix any potential errors. 1527 As discussed
above, we are not adopting some of the more extensive reporting requirements that we proposed
(such as lot level security reporting) and we have streamlined and revised other requirements to
better ease the filing burden. In addition, the longer the filing period provided, the more it

to require a 60-day delay).

464

increases the risk of staleness in the reported data and thereby reduces its usefulness to the
Commission and to the public. We do not believe providing a filing period of longer than 5 days
is necessary, in part because we are not adopting some of the more onerous reporting
requirements we proposed, and in part because in our experience, less than 0.5% of money
market funds have needed to make amendments to Form N-MFP filings after the reporting
deadline to fix reporting issues in their filings. This leads us to believe that the value of
immediate public access to the data justifies the risk of needing to make amendments.
Accordingly, we are not changing the current 5-day reporting period at this time.
Eliminating the 60-day delay will provide more timely information to the public and
greater transparency of money market fund information, which could promote efficiency. This
disclosure could also make the monthly disclosure on Form N-MFP more relevant to investors,
financial analysts, and others by improving their ability to more timely assess potential risks and
make informed investment decisions. In other words, investors may be more likely to use the
reported information because it is more timely and informative. Because, as discussed above,
shadow prices (which were a primary reason why we adopted the 60-day delay in making filings
public) have been disclosed by a number of money market funds since February 2013 apparently
without incident, we do not believe that eliminating the 60-day delay would affect capital
formation.
5.

Operational Implications of the N-MFP Amendments

We anticipate that fund managers would incur costs relating to reporting the new items of
information we are requiring on Form N-MFP. To reduce costs, we have decided to make
needed improvements to the form at the same time we are making amendments necessitated by

465

the amendments to rule 2a-7 we are adopting. 1528 We note that the clarifying amendments should
not affect, or should only minimally affect, current filing obligations or the information content
of the filings.
As we discussed in the proposal, we expect that the operational costs to money market
funds to report the information required in proposed Form N-MFP would be the same costs we
discuss in the Paperwork Reduction Act analysis in section IV of the Release, below, and we
requested comment on that belief. 1529 No commenters provided specific data or estimates
regarding the cost estimates we provided in the Proposing Release for the amendments to Form
N-MFP, although some suggested that the costs of some amendments could be significant. 1530 As
discussed above, we have revised the final amendments from our proposal in a number of ways
in order to reduce costs to the extent feasible and still achieve our goals of enhancing and
improving the monitoring of money market fund risks. Accordingly, we continue to expect that
the operational costs to money market funds to report the information required in Form N-MFP
would be the same costs we discuss in the Paperwork Reduction Act analysis in section IV.C.3
of the Release, below, which have been reduced to account for the changes we are making from
the proposal, as discussed in that section. As discussed in more detail in that section, we
estimate that our amendments to Form N-MFP will result in first-year aggregate additional
47,515 burden hours at a total time cost of $12.3 million plus $356,256 in total external costs for

One commenter noted the benefit of consolidating changes to the form at a single time, noting that each
time they have to amend their systems to report new information to the Commission on Form N-MFP they
incur significant technology related costs. See Dreyfus Comment Letter.

all funds, and 33,540 burden hours at a total time cost of $8.7 million plus $356,256 in total
external costs for all funds each year hereafter. 1531
H.

Amendments to Form PF Reporting Requirements

Today the Commission is also amending Form PF, the form that certain investment
advisers registered with the Commission use to report information regarding the private funds
they manage. Among other things, Form PF requires advisers to report certain information about
the “liquidity funds” they manage, which are private funds that seek to maintain a stable NAV
(or minimize fluctuations in their NAVs) and thus can resemble money market funds. 1532 In the
proposal, we noted a concern that some of the proposed reforms could result in assets shifting
from registered money market funds to unregistered products such as liquidity funds, and we
proposed amendments to Form PF to, in part, help the Commission and FSOC track any such
potential shift in assets and better understand the risks associated with it. 1533
Most commenters who addressed the proposed PF amendments supported them, agreeing
that they would help track such a potential shift, 1534 and one commenter objected, urging the
Commission to consider the significant costs, and questioning the potential benefits. 1535 As
discussed in greater detail below, we have considered the costs of filing this information with us,
and believe that they are justified by the significant benefits to the Commission and FSOC in

1531

See infra section IV.C.3.

1532

For purposes of Form PF, a “liquidity fund” is any private fund that seeks to generate income by investing
in a portfolio of short term obligations in order to maintain a stable net asset value per unit or minimize
principal volatility for investors. See Form PF: Glossary of Terms.

1533

467

better enabling us to track and respond to potential shifts in assets from registered money market
funds into unregistered alternatives. Accordingly, today we are adopting the Form PF
amendments largely as proposed, with some revisions to respond to comments and correspond
the reporting as much as possible to the amendments we are making to Form N-MFP.
We adopted Form PF, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, 1536 to assist in the monitoring
and assessment of systemic risk; to provide information for FSOC’s use in determining whether
and how to deploy its regulatory tools; and to collect data for use in our own regulatory
program. 1537 As discussed in more detail below, the Commission and FSOC have recognized the
potentially increased significance of cash management products other than money market funds,
including liquidity funds, after the money market fund reforms we are adopting today are
effective. 1538 Therefore, to enhance the ability to monitor and assess the short-term financing
markets and to facilitate our oversight of those markets and their participants, we are today
requiring large liquidity fund advisers—registered advisers with $1 billion or more in combined
money market fund and liquidity fund assets—to file virtually the same information with respect
to their liquidity funds’ portfolio holdings on Form PF as money market funds are required to file

1536

See Reporting by Investment Advisers to Private Funds and Certain Commodity Pool Operators and
Commodity Trading Advisors on Form PF, Investment Advisers Act Release No. 3308 (Oct. 31, 2011) [76
FR 71128 (Nov. 16, 2011)] (“Form PF Adopting Release”) at section I. Form PF is a joint form between
the Commission and the CFTC only with respect to sections 1 and 2 of the Form; section 3, which we are
amending today, and section 4 were adopted only by the Commission. Id.

Although Form PF is primarily intended to assist FSOC in its monitoring obligations under the Dodd-Frank
Act, we also may use information collected on Form PF in our regulatory program, including examinations,
investigations, and investor protection efforts relating to private fund advisers. See Form PF Adopting
Release, supra note 1536, at sections II and VI.A.

1538

See infra note 1565 and accompanying text.

468

on Form N-MFP. 1539
As discussed in the Proposing Release, we share the concern expressed by some
commenters that, if the money market fund reforms we are adopting today cause investors to
seek alternatives to money market funds, including private funds that seek to maintain a stable
NAV but that are not registered with the Commission, this shift could increase risk by reducing
transparency of the potential purchasers of short-term debt instruments. 1540 We discuss in detail
the potential for money market fund investors to reallocate their assets to alternative investments
in section III.A.1.c.iv above.
The amendments that we are adopting to Form PF today are designed to achieve two
primary goals. First, they are designed to ensure to the extent possible that any further money
market fund reforms do not decrease transparency in the short-term financing markets, which
will better enable FSOC to monitor and address any related systemic risks and better enable us to
develop effective regulatory policy responses to any shift in investor assets. Second, the
amendments to Form PF are designed to enable more effective administration of relevant
1539

As we proposed, we are incorporating in a new Question 63 in section 3 of Form PF the substance of
virtually all of the questions on Part C of Form N-MFP as amended, except that we have modified the
questions where appropriate to reflect that liquidity funds are not subject to rule 2a-7 (although some
liquidity funds have a policy of complying with rule 2a-7’s risk-limiting conditions) and have not added
questions that would parallel Items C.7 and C.9 of amended Form N-MFP. As we proposed, we are not
including a question that would parallel Item C.7 because that item relates to whether a money market fund
is treating the acquisition of a repurchase agreement as the acquisition of the collateral for purposes of rule
2a-7’s diversification testing; liquidity funds, in contrast, are not subject to rule 2a-7’s diversification
limitations, and the information on repurchase agreement collateral we are collecting through new Question
63(g) on Form PF would allow us to better understand liquidity funds’ use of repurchase agreements and
their collateral. Item C.9 asks whether a portfolio security is a rated first tier security, rated second tier
security, or no longer an eligible security. As we proposed, we are not including a parallel question in
Form PF because these concepts would not necessarily apply to liquidity funds, and we believe the
additional questions on Form PF would provide sufficient information about a portfolio security’s credit
quality and the large liquidity fund adviser’s use of credit ratings.

1540

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, n.803.

469

regulatory programs even if investors do not shift their assets as a result the amendments we are
adopting today, as the increased transparency concerning liquidity funds, combined with
information we already collect on Form N-MFP, will provide a more complete picture of the
short-term financing markets in which liquidity funds and money market funds both invest.
1.

Overview of Proposed Amendments to Form PF

Our Form PF amendments apply only to large liquidity fund advisers, which generally
are SEC-registered investment advisers that advise at least one liquidity fund and manage,
collectively with their related persons, at least $1 billion in combined liquidity fund and money
market fund assets. 1541 Large liquidity fund advisers today are required to file information on
Form PF quarterly, including certain information about each liquidity fund they manage. 1542
Under our final amendments, for each liquidity fund it manages, a large liquidity fund adviser
would be required to provide, quarterly and with respect to each portfolio security, the following

1541

An adviser is a large liquidity fund adviser if it has at least $1 billion combined liquidity fund and money
market fund assets under management as of the last day of any month in the fiscal quarter immediately
preceding its most recently completed fiscal quarter. See Form PF: Instruction 3 and Section 3. This $1
billion threshold includes assets managed by the adviser’s related persons, except that an adviser is not
required to include the assets managed by a related person that is separately operated from the adviser. Id.
An adviser’s related persons include persons directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under
common control with the investment adviser. See Form PF: Glossary of Terms (defining the term “related
person” by reference to Form ADV). Generally, a person is separately operated from an investment adviser
if the adviser: (1) has no business dealings with the related person in connection with advisory services the
adviser provides to its clients; (2) does not conduct shared operations with the related person; (3) does not
refer clients or business to the related person, and the related person does not refer prospective clients or
business to the adviser; (4) does not share supervised persons or premises with the related person; and (5)
has no reason to believe that its relationship with the related person otherwise creates a conflict of interest
with the adviser’s clients. See Form PF: Glossary of Terms (defining the term by reference to Form ADV).

1542

See Form PF Instruction 3 and section 3. This in contrast to Form N-MFP, which is filed on a monthly
basis. As discussed below, we currently believe that quarterly filing of this information most appropriately
balances our need for this information with the burdens of filing the data, especially considering that large
liquidity fund advisers file information quarterly already about the funds they advise, but do not currently
file portfolio information about those funds.

470

information for each month of the reporting period: 1543
•

the name of the issuer;

•

the title of the issue;

•

certain security identifiers;

•

the category of investment 1544 (e.g., Treasury debt, U.S. government agency debt,
asset-backed commercial paper, certificate of deposit, repurchase agreement 1545);

•

if the rating assigned by a credit rating agency played a substantial role in the
liquidity fund’s (or its adviser’s) evaluation of the quality, maturity or liquidity of
the security, the name of each credit rating agency and the rating each credit
rating agency assigned to the security;

•

the maturity date used to calculate weighted average maturity;

•

the maturity date used to calculate weighted average life;

•

the ultimate legal maturity date; 1546

1543

See Form PF Question 63. Advisers will be required to file this information with their quarterly liquidity
fund filings with data for the quarter broken down by month. Advisers will not be required to file
information on Form PF more frequently as a result of today’s proposal because large liquidity fund
advisers already are required to file information each quarter on Form PF. See Form PF Instruction 9.

1544

As under amended Form N-MFP, we are revising the investment categories form the proposal in the same
way to more accurately reflect the investment categories commonly used today. See supra section
III.G.2.g.

1545

For repurchase agreements we are also requiring large liquidity fund advisers to provide additional
information regarding the underlying collateral and whether the repurchase agreement is “open” (i.e.,
whether the repurchase agreement has no specified end date and, by its terms, will be extended or “rolled”
each business day (or at another specified period) unless the investor chooses to terminate it). As under
amended Form N-MFP, we are not adopting the proposed CUSIP reporting requirement, and we are
amending the proposed repurchase agreement collateral investment categories to better align with the
categories used by the NY Fed. See supra section III.G.3.

1546

We are changing this from “final” as proposed to “ultimate” for the same reasons we are making this
change in Form N-MFP. See supra note 1503.

471

•

whether the instrument is subject to a demand feature, guarantee, or other
enhancements, and information about any of these features and their providers;

•

the value of the fund’s position in the security and, if the fund uses the amortized
cost method of valuation, the amortized cost value, in both cases with and without
any sponsor support;

•

the percentage of the liquidity fund’s assets invested in the security;

•

whether the security is categorized as a level 3 asset or liability on Form PF; 1547

•

whether the security is an illiquid security, a daily liquid asset, and/or a weekly
liquid asset, as defined in rule 2a-7; and

•

any explanatory notes. 1548

These amended reporting requirements are largely the same as the reporting requirements
for registered money market funds under amended Form N-MFP, with some modifications to
better tailor the reporting to private liquidity funds. As we proposed, the final amendments will
also remove current Questions 56 and 57 on Form PF. These questions generally require large
liquidity fund advisers to provide information about their liquidity funds’ portfolio holdings
broken out by asset class (rather than security by security). We will be able to derive the
information currently reported in response to those questions from the new portfolio holdings
information we propose to require advisers to provide. The amendments will also require, as
proposed, large liquidity fund advisers to identify any money market fund advised by the adviser
1547

See Form PF Question 14. See also infra notes 1466-1470 and accompanying and following text.

1548

We are also defining the following terms in Form PF, as proposed: conditional demand feature; credit
rating agency; demand feature; guarantee; guarantor; and illiquid security. See Form PF: Glossary of
Terms.

472

or its related persons that pursues substantially the same investment objective and strategy and
invests side by side in substantially the same positions as a liquidity fund the adviser reports on
Form PF. 1549
After considering the comments received and the importance and utility of the
information that would be reported on amended Form PF (as discussed further below), we are
today adopting the Form PF amendments substantially as proposed. As noted above, most
commenters who discussed the Form PF amendments generally supported them, 1550 although one
commenter objected, suggesting that the costs of compliance would outweigh the benefits. 1551
We have made a number of modifications to the Form PF reporting requirement, such as
removing lot level purchase and sale reporting, that should help minimize costs and ease the
burden. Nonetheless, we recognize that there are costs to filing this information with us which
are discussed in detail below, and believe that they are justified by the significant benefits to
FSOC and the Commission in better enabling tracking and responding to potential shifts in assets
from registered money market funds into unregistered alternatives.
Another commenter suggested that we reorganize and consolidate the questions in the
proposed form amendments to minimize the system changes necessary to file the form. 1552 We
agree with this commenter and the final amendments have been organized to minimize system

1549

See Form PF Question 64. This question is based on the current definition of a “parallel fund structure” in
Form PF. See Form PF: Glossary of Terms (defining a “parallel fund structure” as “[a] structure in which
one or more private funds (each, a ‘parallel fund’) pursues substantially the same investment objective and
strategy and invests side by side in substantially the same positions as another private fund”).

473

changes and costs as much as possible. 1553
Consistent with our proposed amendments to Form N-MFP, we proposed to require large
liquidity fund advisers to provide lot level information about any securities purchased or sold by
their liquidity funds during the reporting period, including sale and purchase prices. 1554 As
discussed in section III.G.2.c above, we have been persuaded by commenters that the costs of
such reporting do not justify the potential benefits at this time, and that the data may be better
collected on a more systematic market wide basis. Accordingly, we are not today adopting the
proposed lot level reporting for Form PF. 1555
One commenter suggested that Form PF be filed monthly like N-MFP, rather than on a
quarterly basis, to better align the information in the two forms, 1556 although another comment
opposed such a monthly filing requirement. 1557 We are not requiring monthly filing of Form PF
at this time because we believe the ongoing costs and system changes necessary for large
liquidity funds to make such a monthly filing would not be justified by the utility of more
1553

By eliminating lot level sale data reporting (proposed question 64 of Form PF) and accordingly
renumbering proposed question 65 (parallel funds) as question 64, we have restructured the amendments to
Form PF so that the amendments keep the same numbering range as the current form like the commenter
suggested. See Form PF Question 64.

1554

See proposed Form PF Question 64. See also supra notes 1474-1475 and accompanying text.

1555

See supra note 1476 and accompanying text. Although as discussed above, we are not adopting the lot
level reporting requirements generally, we are adopting a requirement to report the coupon or yield of the
security as of the reporting date. We proposed to include this reporting requirement with the other lot level
reporting questions. See proposed Form PF Question 63(o). Reporting this information would not require
the use of lot level data, and thus should not pose the same difficulties as the other reporting requirements
we are not adopting. Much like under the final amendments to Form N-MFP, the final Form PF
amendments would include reporting of the coupon in the title of the issue but information about yield
would be in a standalone question. See proposed Form PF Questions 63(c) and 63(o). As a result of not
adopting question 64 about lot level sales, we are also renumbering proposed question 65 on parallel funds
as question 64 and relabeling the Item as F rather than Item G. See Form PF Item F, Question 64.

474

frequent filing, especially in light of the fact that these funds currently file Form PF on a
quarterly basis and these amendments are an enhancement to that filing. To require large
liquidity advisers to move to a monthly reporting schedule would impose significant new costs,
over and above the costs associated with the Form PF amendments we are adopting today,
requiring these advisers to change systems and processes designed for quarterly reporting to a
monthly schedule. As noted above, several reporting requirements do ask for information on a
monthly basis within the quarterly filed Form PF, which should allow an effective comparison of
the data to the information collected on Form N-MFP and will allow for effective oversight of
investment activities of large liquidity advisers.
Another commenter asked that we exempt unregistered money market funds from filing
the Form PF amendments if the unregistered money market fund is exclusively owned by
registered funds investing in an unregistered fund pursuant to rule 12d1-1 under the Investment
Company Act. 1558 Rule 12d1-1 permits a registered fund to invest in an unregistered money
market fund in excess of the limits of section 12(d)(1) of the Act, provided, among other things,
that the unregistered fund operates in compliance with rule 2a-7 of the Act. The commenter
argued that because these funds are exclusively owned by registered funds, any shift in assets to
these unregistered money market funds would not represent the kind of shift that the Form PF
amendments are designed to monitor, and thus such 12d1-1 funds should not be required to bear
the burdens of filing the Form PF amendments. Our amendments to Form PF are designed, in
part, to allow better monitoring of risks associated with investments in money market

1558

See Wells Fargo Comment Letter.

475

instruments and to generally track and monitor money market asset flows. Exempting such
funds from filing amended Form PF would not be consistent with this goal, and could leave a
significant gap in our ability to monitor and track money market instrument holdings. In the
absence of the Form PF portfolio security reporting requirements, if there was a shift in assets
from registered money market funds that file portfolio holdings reports under Form N-MFP to
unregistered 12d1-1 funds that do not file such information about their holdings, we and FSOC
would lose significant transparency and monitoring ability. Accordingly, we are not adopting
such an exemption.
2.

Utility of New Information, Including Benefits, Costs, and Economic
Implications

As discussed in the 2013 Proposing Release, the information that advisers must report on
Form PF (both currently and under the final amendments) concerning their liquidity funds is
designed to assist FSOC in assessing the risks undertaken by liquidity funds, their susceptibility
to runs, and how their investments might pose systemic risks either among liquidity funds or
through contagion to registered money market funds. 1559 The information that advisers must
report is intended to aid FSOC in its determination of whether and how address issues related to
systemic risk. 1560 Finally, the information that advisers must report is designed to assist FSOC
and the Commission in assessing the extent to which a liquidity fund is being managed
consistent with restrictions imposed on registered money market funds that might mitigate their
likelihood of posing systemic risk.

We believe, based on our staff’s consultations with staff representing the members of
FSOC, that the additional information we are requiring advisers to report on Form PF will assist
FSOC in carrying out these responsibilities. Several commenters agreed that the Form PF
amendments will assist FSOC and the Commission in these responsibilities. 1561 FSOC and the
Commission have recognized the risks that may be posed by cash management products other
than money market funds, including liquidity funds, and the potentially increased significance of
such products after we adopt the money market fund reforms we are making today. 1562 FSOC has
also stated that it and its members “intend to use their authorities, where appropriate and within
their jurisdictions, to address any risks to financial stability that may arise from various products
within the cash management industry in a consistent manner,” as “[s]uch consistency would be
designed to reduce or eliminate any regulatory gaps that could result in risks to financial stability

Council in fulfilling its responsibilities and better enable the Commission to develop effective regulatory
policy responses to any shift in investor assets from money funds to private liquidity funds.”); ICI

See Proposed Recommendations Regarding Money Market Mutual Fund Reform, Financial Stability
Oversight Council [77 FR 69455 (Nov. 19, 2012)] (the “FSOC Proposed Recommendations”), at 7 (“The
Council recognizes that regulated and unregulated or less-regulated cash management products (such as
unregistered private liquidity funds) other than MMFs may pose risks that are similar to those posed by
MMFs, and that further MMF reforms could increase demand for non-MMF cash management products.
The Council seeks comment on other possible reforms that would address risks that might arise from a
migration to non-MMF cash management products.”) We, too, have recognized that “[l]iquidity funds and
registered money market funds often pursue similar strategies, invest in the same securities and present
similar risks.” See Form PF Adopting Release, supra note 1536, at section II.A.4. See also Reporting by
Investment Advisers to Private Funds and Certain Commodity Pool Operators and Commodity Trading
Advisors on Form PF, Investment Advisers Act Release No. 3145 (Jan. 26, 2011) [76 FR 8068 (Feb. 11,
2011)] (“Form PF Proposing Release”), at note 68 and accompanying text (explaining that, “[d]uring the
financial crisis, several sponsors of ‘enhanced cash funds,’ a type of liquidity fund, committed capital to
those funds to prevent investors from realizing losses in the funds,” and noting that “[t]he fact that sponsors
of certain liquidity funds felt the need to support the stable value of those funds suggests that they may be
susceptible to runs like registered money market funds”).

if cash management products with similar risks are subject to dissimilar standards.” 1563 We
expect, therefore, that requiring advisers to provide additional information on Form PF will
enhance the ability to monitor and assess risk in the short-term financing markets.
We are requiring only large liquidity fund advisers to report this additional information
for the same reason that we previously determined to require only larger private fund advisers to
provide more comprehensive information on their respective industries on Form PF: because a
relatively small group of advisers represents a substantial portion of the assets. 1564 Based on
information filed on Form PF and Form ADV, as of the end of 2013, we estimate that there were
approximately 24 large liquidity fund advisers (out of 43 total advisers that advise at least one
liquidity fund), with their aggregate liquidity fund assets under management representing
approximately 91% of liquidity fund assets managed by all advisers registered with the
Commission.
This threshold also should minimize the costs of our amendments because large liquidity
fund advisers already are required to make quarterly reports on Form PF and, as of the end of
2013, virtually all either advise a money market fund or have a related person that advises a
money market fund. Requiring large liquidity fund advisers to provide substantially the same
information required by Form N-MFP therefore may reduce the burdens associated with our
1563

See FSOC Proposed Recommendations, supra note 1562, at 7. The President’s Working Group on
Financial Markets reached a similar conclusion, noting that because vehicles such as liquidity funds “can
take on more risks than MMFs, but such risks are not necessarily transparent to investors…, unregistered
funds may pose even greater systemic risks than MMFs, particularly if new restrictions on MMFs prompt
substantial growth in unregistered funds.” See PWG Report, supra note 506, at 21. The potentially
increased risks posed by liquidity funds were of further concern because these risks “are difficult to
monitor, since [unregistered cash management products like liquidity funds] provide far less market
transparency than MMFs.” Id. at 35.

1564

See Form PF Adopting Release, supra note 1536, at n.88 and accompanying text.

478

amendments, which we discuss below, because large liquidity fund advisers generally already
have (or may be able to readily obtain access to) the systems, service providers, and/or staff
necessary to capture and report the same types of information for reporting on Form N-MFP.
These same systems, service providers, and/or staff may allow large liquidity fund advisers to
comply with our changes to Form PF more efficiently and at a reduced cost than if we were to
require advisers to report information that differed materially from that which the advisers must
file on Form N-MFP.
In addition to our concerns about the ability to assess risks associated with money market
fund investments, we also are concerned about losing transparency regarding money market fund
investments that may shift into liquidity funds as a result of the other reforms we are adopting
today and our ability effectively to formulate policy responses to such a shift in investor
assets. 1565 We noted in the proposal that a run on liquidity funds could spread to money market
funds because, for example, both types of funds often invest in the same securities as noted
above. 1566 Our ability to formulate a policy response to address this risk could be diminished if

1565

See, e.g., DERA Study, supra note 24, at section 4.C (analysis of investment alternatives to money market
funds, considering, among other issues, the potential for investors to shift their assets to money market fund
alternatives, including liquidity funds, in response to further money market fund reforms and certain
implications of a shift in investor assets).

1566

Liquidity funds may generally have a higher percentage of institutional shareholders than money market
funds because liquidity funds rely on exclusions from the Investment Company Act’s definition of
“investment company” provided by section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act. See section 202(a)(29) of the
Advisers Act (defining the term “private fund” to mean an issuer that would be an investment company, as
defined in section 3, but for section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act). Funds relying on those exclusions sell
their shares in private offerings which in many cases are restricted to investors who are “accredited
investors” as defined in rule 501(a) under the Securities Act. Investors in funds relying on section 3(c)(7),
in addition, generally must be “qualified purchasers” as defined in section 2(a)(51) of the Investment
Company Act. Having a larger institutional shareholder base may increase the potential for a run to
develop at a liquidity fund. As discussed in greater detail in section II.C of this Release, redemption data
from the financial crisis suggest that some institutional money market fund investors are likely to redeem
from distressed money market funds more quickly than other investors and to redeem a greater percentage

479

we had less transparency concerning the portfolio holdings of liquidity funds as compared to
money market funds, and thus were not able as effectively to assess the degree of correlation
between various funds or groups of funds that invest in the short-term financing markets, or if we
were unable proactively to identify funds that own distressed securities. Several commenters
agreed that the Form PF amendments would reduce the chance that these reforms will diminish
transparency in the short-term financing markets. 1567 Indeed, Form PF, by defining large
liquidity fund advisers subject to more comprehensive reporting requirements as advisers with $1
billion in combined money market fund and liquidity fund assets under management today
reflects the similarities between money market funds and liquidity funds and the need for
comprehensive information concerning advisers’ management of large amounts of short-term
assets through either type of fund. The need for this comprehensive data will be heightened if
money market fund investors shift their assets to liquidity funds in response to the amendments
we are adopting today.
Finally, this increased information on liquidity funds managed by large liquidity fund
advisers also will be useful even absent a shift in money market fund investor assets resulting
from these reforms. Collecting this information about these liquidity funds will, when combined
with information collected on Form N-MFP, provides a more complete picture of the short-term
financing markets, allowing the SEC and FSOC to more effectively fulfill our respective
statutory mandates. For example, we discuss the contagion risk above. But it may be difficult to
of their holdings. This may be indicative of the way institutional investors in liquidity funds would behave,
particularly liquidity funds that more closely resemble money market funds.
1567

See, e.g., Goldman Sachs Comment Letter (“Finally, GSAM generally supports the amendments to Form
PF, which will ensure that further money market fund reforms do not decrease transparency in the shortterm financing markets…’); ICI Comment Letter.

480

assess this risk fully today without more detailed information about the portfolio holdings of the
liquidity funds managed by advisers who manage substantial amounts of short-term investments
and the ability to combine that data with the information we collect on Form N-MFP.
For example, if a particular security or issuer were to come under stress, without these
amendments, our staff would be unable to determine which liquidity funds, if any, held that
security, much like before we adopted Form N-MFP for registered money market funds. This is
because advisers currently are required only to provide information about the types of assets their
liquidity funds hold, rather than the individual positions. 1568 Our staff could see the aggregate
value of all of a liquidity fund’s positions in unsecured commercial paper issued by non-U.S.
financial institutions, for example, but could not tell whether the fund owned commercial paper
issued by any particular non-U.S. financial institution. If a particular institution were to come
under stress, the aggregated information available today would not allow us or our staff to
determine the extent to which liquidity funds were exposed to the financial institution; lacking
this information, neither we nor our staff would be able as effectively to assess the risks across
the liquidity fund industry and, by extension, the short-term financing markets.
Position level information for liquidity funds managed by large liquidity fund advisers
also will allow our staff more efficiently and effectively to identify longer-term trends in the
industry and at particular liquidity funds or advisers. The aggregated position information that
advisers provide today may obscure the level of risk in the industry or at particular advisers or
liquidity funds that, if more fully understood by our staff, could allow the staff to more
1568

See Form PF Question 56 (requiring advisers to provide exposures and maturity information, by asset class,
for liquidity fund assets under management); Form PF Question 57 (requiring advisers to provide the asset
class and percent of the fund’s NAV for each open position that represents 5% or more of the fund’s NAV).

481

efficiently and effectively target our examinations efforts of these advisers, and could better
inform the staff’s policy recommendations.
As we discussed in the proposal, our experience with the portfolio information money
market funds report on Form N-MFP—which was limited at the time we adopted Form PF—has
proved useful in our regulation of money market funds in these and other ways and has informed
the amendments we are adopting today. 1569 During the 2011 Eurozone debt crisis, for example,
we and our staff benefitted from the ability to determine which money market funds had
exposure to specific financial institutions (and other positions) and from the ability to see how
funds changed their holdings as the crisis unfolded. This information was useful in assessing
risk across the industry and at particular money market funds. Given the similarities between
money market funds and liquidity funds and the possibility for risk to spread between the types
of funds, our experience with portfolio information filed on Form N-MFP suggests that receiving
virtually the same information for liquidity funds managed by large liquidity fund advisers will
provide significant benefits to oversight efforts.
For all of these reasons and as discussed above, we expect that requiring large liquidity
fund advisers to report their liquidity funds’ portfolio information on Form PF as we are
requiring today will provide substantial benefits for us and FSOC, including positive effects on
efficiency and capital formation. As we explained in more detail when we initially adopted
Form PF, requiring advisers to report on Form PF is intended to positively affect efficiency and

1569

Money market funds were required to begin filing information on Form N-MFP by December 7, 2010. See
2010 Adopting Release, supra note 17 at n.340 and accompanying text. Form PF was proposed shortly
thereafter on January 26, 2011, and adopted on October 31, 2011. See Form PF Proposing Release, supra
note 1562; Form PF Adopting Release, supra note 1536.

482

capital formation, in part by enhancing our ability to evaluate and develop regulatory policies
and to more effectively and efficiently protect investors and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient
markets. 1570
The additional information on Form PF should better inform our understanding of the
activities of liquidity funds and their advisers and the operation of the short-term financing
markets, including risks that may arise in liquidity funds and harm other participants in those
markets or those who rely on them—including money market funds and their shareholders and
the companies and governments that seek financing in the short-term financing markets. The
additional information that advisers will report on Form PF, particularly when combined with
similar data reported on Form N-MFP, therefore should enhance our ability to evaluate and
develop regulatory policies and enable us to more effectively and efficiently protect investors
and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets.
As discussed in detail in the proposal, we recognize that large liquidity fund advisers may
have concerns about reporting information about their liquidity funds’ portfolio holdings and
may regard this as commercially sensitive information, but noted that such data may be not be as
sensitive in this context when compared to other private funds, largely because of the types of

1570

See generally Form PF Adopting Release, supra note 1536, at section V.A (explaining that, in addition to
assisting FSOC fulfill its mission, “we expect this information to enhance [our] ability to evaluate and
develop regulatory policies and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our efforts to protect investors
and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets”). We explained, for example, that Form PF data was
designed to allow us to more efficiently and effectively target our examination programs and, with the
benefit of Form PF data, to better anticipate regulatory problems and the implications of our regulatory
actions, and thereby to increase investor protection. See id. We also explained that Form PF data could
have a positive effect on capital formation because, as a result of the increased transparency to regulators
made possible by Form PF, private fund advisers might assess more carefully the risks associated with
particular investments and, in the aggregate, allocate capital to investments with a higher value to the
economy as a whole. See id. at text accompanying and following n.494.

483

securities that liquidity funds invest in. 1571 No commenters on the proposed Form PF
amendments objected to the amendments on the basis of the information being sensitive or
proprietary. As we discussed in the Form PF Adopting Release, we do not intend to make public
Form PF information identifiable to any particular adviser or private fund, and indeed, the DoddFrank Act amended the Advisers Act to preclude us from being compelled to reveal this
information except in very limited circumstances. 1572
We note that although the increased transparency to regulators provided by our
amendments could positively affect capital formation as discussed above, increased
transparency, as we observed when adopting Form PF, also may have a negative effect on capital
formation if it increases advisers’ aversion to risk and, as a result, reduces investment in
enterprises that may expose the fund to more risk but be beneficial to the economy as a whole. 1573
Nevertheless, the information collected generally will be non-public, it should not affect large
liquidity fund advisers’ ability to raise capital. To the extent that our amendments were to cause
changes in investment allocations that lead to reduced economic outcomes in the aggregate, our
amendments may result in a negative effect on capital available for investment.
We also do not believe that our amendments to Form PF will have a significant effect on
competition because the information that advisers report on Form PF, including the new
information we are requiring, generally will be non-public and similar types of advisers will have

1573

See id. at text accompanying and following n.537.

484

comparable burdens under the form as we propose to amend it. 1574 We do not believe the
amendments’ effect on capital formation discussed above will be significant, again because the
information collected generally will be non-public and, therefore, should not affect large
liquidity fund advisers’ ability to raise capital. 1575
j. Alternatives Considered
We considered whether we and FSOC would be able as effectively to carry out our
respective missions as discussed above using the information large liquidity fund advisers
currently must file on Form PF. But as we discuss above, we expect that requiring large liquidity
funds advisers to provide portfolio holdings information will provide a number of benefits and
will allow better understanding of the activities of large liquidity fund advisers and their liquidity
funds than would be possible with the higher level, aggregate information that advisers file today
on Form PF (e.g., the ability to determine which liquidity funds own a distressed security).
For the reasons discussed above we also considered, but ultimately chose not to adopt,
changes requiring advisers to file portfolio information about their liquidity funds that differs
from the information money market funds are required to file on Form N-MFP. Generally, given
our experience with Form N-MFP data, we believe that not only could different portfolio
holdings information be less useful than that required by Form N-MFP, it also could be more
difficult to combine with Form N-MFP data. Requiring advisers to file on Form PF virtually the
same information money market funds file on Form N-MFP also should be more efficient for
advisers and reduce the costs of reporting from a systems standpoint, because many large
1574

See id. at text accompanying and following n.535.

1575

See id.

485

liquidity advisers also manage money market funds and already have the systems in place to
report the data.
Finally, we considered whether to require large liquidity fund advisers to provide their
liquidity funds’ portfolio information more frequently than quarterly, but as discussed in greater
detail above, chose not to adopt this requirement. 1576 Monthly filings, for example, would
provide more current data and could facilitate our combining the new information with the
information money market funds file on Form N-MFP (which money market funds file each
month). We balanced the potential benefits of more frequent reporting against the costs it would
impose and believe, at this time, that quarterly reporting is more appropriate. 1577
k.

Operational Costs

We recognize, however, that our amendments to Form PF, while limited to large liquidity
fund advisers, will create some costs for those advisers, and also could affect competition,
efficiency, and capital formation. We continue to expect that the operational costs to advisers to
report the new information will be the same costs we discuss in the Paperwork Reduction Act
analysis in section IV.H.3 below, as reduced by the lower costs associated with the changes we
are making from the proposal discussed in that section. As discussed in more detail in that
section, we estimate that our amendments to Form PF would result in an annual aggregate
additional burden per large liquidity fund adviser of 298 burden hours, at a total time cost of
$79,566, and external costs of $17,104. This will result in increased aggregate burden hours
1576

See supra note 1556.

1577

Large liquidity fund advisers already are required to make quarterly filings on Form PF. See Form PF
Instruction 9. Requiring large liquidity fund advisers to provide the new portfolio holdings information on
a quarterly basis should therefore be more cost effective for the advisers.

486

across all large liquidity fund advisers of 8,344 burden hours, 1578 at a time cost of $2,227,848,
and $478,912 in external costs. 1579
These estimates are based on our estimates of the paperwork burdens associated with our
final amendments to Form N-MFP because advisers will be required to file on Form PF virtually
the same information about their large liquidity funds as money market funds will be required to
file on Form N-MFP as we are amending it. We therefore expect that the paperwork burdens
associated with Form N-MFP (as we are amending it) are representative of the costs that large
liquidity fund advisers will incur as a result of our amendments to Form PF. We note, however,
that this is a conservative approach for several reasons. Large liquidity fund advisers may
experience economies of scale because, as discussed above, virtually all of them advise a money
market fund or have a related person that advises a money market fund. Large liquidity fund
advisers therefore likely will pay a combined licensing fee or fee to retain the services of a third
party that covers filings on both Forms PF and Form N-MFP. We expect that this combined fee
likely will be less than the combined estimated Paperwork Reduction Act costs associated with
Forms PF and Form N-MFP.
I.

Diversification

We are amending the rule 2a-7 diversification provisions as proposed, with certain
modifications as discussed below. Under the current rule, money market funds generally must
limit their investments in: (i) the securities of any one issuer of a first tier security (other than

1578

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 298 estimated additional burden hours per large
liquidity fund adviser x 28 large liquidity fund advisers = 8,344.

1579

See infra section IV.H.3.

487

with respect to government securities and securities subject to a guarantee issued by a noncontrolled person) to no more than 5% of fund assets; and (ii) securities subject to a demand
feature or a guarantee to no more than 10% of fund assets from any one provider. 1580 Under our
diversification amendments, we are requiring that money market funds treat certain entities that
are affiliated with each other as single issuers when applying rule 2a-7’s 5% issuer
diversification limit. 1581 As discussed further below, the amended diversification provisions
exclude certain majority equity owners of asset-backed commercial paper (“ABCP”) conduits
from the requirement to aggregate affiliates for purposes of the 5% issuer diversification limit.
The diversification provisions that we are adopting today also require that a money market fund
treat the sponsors of asset-backed securities (“ABS”) as guarantors subject to rule 2a-7’s 10%
diversification limit applicable to guarantees and demand features, unless the fund’s board makes
certain findings. 1582 Lastly, we have decided to adopt (i) as proposed, the removal of the twentyfive percent basket, under which as much as 25% of the value of securities held in a money
market fund’s portfolio may be subject to guarantees or demand features from a single institution
for money market funds other than tax-exempt money market funds, and (ii) the reduction to
15%, rather than the elimination of, the twenty-five percent basket for tax-exempt money market
funds, including single state money market funds. Under our amendments, up to 15% (as
compared to 10%, which was proposed) of the value of securities held in a tax-exempt money
1580

See current rules 2a-7(c)(4)(i) and (c)(4)(iii). The current rule also provides a “twenty-five percent basket,”
under which as much as 25% of the value of securities held in a fund’s portfolio may be subject to
guarantees or demand features from a single institution. See current rule 2a-7(c)(4)(iii). A money market
fund may currently use a twenty-five percent basket to invest in demand features or guarantees that are first
tier securities issued by non-controlled persons. See id.

market fund’s portfolio may be subject to guarantees or demand features from a single
institution. 1583

Treatment of Certain Affiliates for Purposes of Rule 2a-7’s Five Percent
Issuer Diversification Requirement

As noted above, today we are amending rule 2a-7’s diversification provisions to provide
that money market funds limit their exposure to affiliated groups, rather than to discrete
issuers. 1584 As discussed in the Proposing Release, financial distress at an issuer can quickly
spread to affiliates and the valuations and creditworthiness of the issuer may depend, in large
part, on the financial well-being of other firms within the same corporate family. 1585 By requiring
diversification of exposure to entities that are affiliated with each other, the rule mitigates credit
risk to a money market fund by limiting the fund from assuming a concentrated amount of risk in
a single economic enterprise. Commenters generally supported the proposal to treat certain
entities that are affiliated with each other as single issuers when applying rule 2a-7’s 5% issuer
diversification limit. 1586 Commenters also confirmed our understanding that money market funds
today generally attempt to identify and measure their exposure to entities that are affiliated with

1583

See rule 2a-7(d)(3)(iii)(B). We note that amended rule 2a-7(d)(3)(iii)(B), which provides a basket for taxexempt money market funds, has been revised from current rule 2a-7(c)(4)(iii). The revised rule text is
intended to be a clarifying change from the current rule text and is not designed to have any substantive
effect other than to reduce the twenty-five percent basket to a fifteen percent basket for tax-exempt funds.

1584

As discussed below, entities are “affiliated” with one another if one controls the other entity or is controlled
by it or is under common control with it. “Control” for this purpose, is defined to mean ownership of more
than 50% of an entity’s voting securities. Rule 2a-7(d)(3)(ii)(F)(1). We note that we are not amending rule
2a-7’s diversification requirements to require that money market funds treat affiliates as a single entity for
purposes of the 10% diversification limit on investments in securities subject to a demand feature or
guarantee.

489

each other as part of their risk management processes. 1587 Based on the comments we received,
we continue to believe that requiring diversification of exposure to affiliated entities will
mitigate a money market fund’s credit risk.
a.

Definition of control

We are adopting as proposed that, for purposes of applying the amended rule, entities are
affiliated with one another if one controls the other entity or is controlled by it or is under
common control with it. 1588 For this purpose only, control is defined to mean ownership of more
than 50% of an entity’s voting securities. 1589 By using a more than 50% test (i.e., majority
ownership), we continue to believe the alignment of economic interests and risks of the affiliated
entities is sufficient to justify aggregating their exposures for purposes of rule 2a-7’s 5% issuer
diversification limit. As discussed in the Proposing Release, we considered several alternative
approaches to delineating a group of affiliates. We requested comment as to whether we should
use any of these alternative approaches or whether there are other approaches we should
consider. A number of commenters supported the proposed majority ownership test. 1590 Some
commenters also agreed with us that other approaches to defining control could limit a money
market fund’s investment flexibility unnecessarily. 1591 One commenter noted that while the
1587

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter; U.S. Bancorp Comment Letter; Goldman Sachs Comment Letter; Dreyfus
Comment Letter; Vanguard Comment Letter; Federated II Comment Letter.

1588

See rule 2a-7(d)(3)(ii)(F).

1589

See id. We note that the definition of control we are adopting today with respect to the treatment of
affiliates for purposes of issuer diversification under rule 2a-7 is not the same as the definition of control in
section 2(a)(9) of the Investment Company Act.

1590

See, e.g., ABA Business Law Section Comment Letter; Wells Fargo Comment Letter.

1591

See ICI Comment Letter (stating that a definition of control that would include more attenuated
relationships or lower ownership levels could limit a money market fund’s investment opportunities to
issuers whose risks are not necessarily correlated to the issuer’s parents). See also Wells Fargo Comment

490

proposed definition of control would not generally limit money market funds’ investment
flexibility or be difficult to apply, incorporating the definition of a “majority-owned subsidiary”
from section 2(a)(24) of the Investment Company Act, rather than introducing a new definition
of control, would be more desirable. 1592 Under the section 2(a)(24) definition, a “majority-owned
subsidiary” of a person means a company 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of
which are owned by such person, or by a company which is a majority-owned subsidiary of such
person. 1593 We note however, that the section 2(a)(24) definition is not in itself a definition of
control and only includes the circumstances in which an entity is a majority-owned subsidiary of
another entity. Although we requested comment as to whether we should incorporate the section
2(a)(24) definition of majority-owned subsidiaries into our definition of control, we believe that
a more than 50% test is indicative of circumstances in which an entity controls another entity or
is controlled by it as opposed to circumstances in which an entity owns half of another entity’s
voting securities. The definition of control we are adopting today is used to define entities that
are required to be consolidated for purposes of our diversification requirements. Therefore, we
believe it is appropriate to look at the circumstances in which entities generally are required to be
consolidated because they represent exposure to a single economic entity. We continue to
believe that the approach we are adopting today is preferable because it is consistent with various
circumstances under which affiliated entities must be consolidated on financial statements
prepared in accordance with GAAP, under which a parent generally must consolidate its
Letter (supporting the decision to not require money market funds to treat as affiliates all entities that must
be consolidated on a balance sheet).
1592

See ICI Comment Letter.

1593

See Section 2(a)(24).

491

majority-owned subsidiaries. 1594 These majority-owned subsidiaries generally must be
consolidated under GAAP because the operations of the group are sufficiently related such that
they are presented under GAAP as if they “were a single economic entity.”
b.

Majority equity owners of asset-backed commercial paper conduits

We requested comment as to whether the exposures to risks of issuers that would be
treated as affiliated under our proposal would be highly correlated and whether our proposed
approach to delineating affiliates was too broad or too narrow. 1595 After further consideration,
based on the comments we received in response to our proposal, we recognize that the majority
ownership definition of control that we proposed may encompass certain affiliated parties that
are not part of the same economic enterprise and therefore should be excluded from the
definition. Accordingly, as discussed further below, the majority ownership definition of control
that we are adopting today excludes certain equity owners of ABCP conduits from the
requirement to aggregate affiliates for purposes of the 5% issuer diversification limit.1596
Without an exclusion from the amended rule, money market funds would be required to

One commenter suggested that we also exclude TOBs from the amended rule, noting that under certain
circumstances liquidity providers may own more than 50 percent of the securities issued by a TOB but may
not be part of the same corporate family. See SIFMA Comment Letter. We believe that excluding TOBs
from the amended rule is unnecessary in light of the fact that an owner of TOB-issued securities would not
likely have voting rights in a TOB trust and therefore would not fall under the definition of affiliate for
purposes of the 5% issuer diversification limit. We note that the Volcker Rule may likely have an impact
on TOB program structures.

purposes of the 5% issuer diversification limit. One commenter argued that we should exclude
equity owners of ABCP conduits from the proposed affiliate aggregation rule to allow money
market funds to treat each special purpose entity (“SPE”) issuing ABCP as a separate issuer for
purposes of issuer diversification, even if the same entity or affiliate group controls the voting
equity of multiple ABCP conduits. 1597 This commenter noted that voting equity of an ABCP
conduit is typically almost entirely owned by an otherwise unaffiliated third party that is in the
business of owning such entities and providing management and administrative services, and not
by the ABCP conduit sponsor, and that requiring money market funds to aggregate conduits on
the basis of common equity ownership would unnecessarily restrict the amount of ABCP
available for purchase by money market funds. 1598 We agree that if certain independent equity
owners are simply providing services in a management and administrative capacity and are
concentrated in the ABCP industry, failure to provide an exception to those equity owners could
unnecessarily limit ABCP investment or reduce economies of scale in ABCP administration with
no diversification benefit to money market funds.
The purpose of treating affiliated parties as a single issuer when applying the
diversification limit is to mitigate risk to a money market fund by limiting the fund from
assuming a concentrated amount of risk in a single economic enterprise, not to limit the exposure
to entities that might fall under the definition of “affiliated” but are otherwise independent and
not part of the same economic enterprise. In light of these considerations, we have decided to
provide an exception from the amended rule for certain independent equity owners of ABCP

conduits. The commenter that argued we should exclude equity owners of ABCP conduits
recommended that we provide that money market funds need not aggregate an ABCP conduit
and its independent equity owners if owning equity interests in SPEs is a primary line of business
of such owner. 1599 This commenter also noted that the voting equity of an ABCP conduit is
typically owned by an unaffiliated third party that provides certain management services to the
ABCP conduit. In addition, this commenter suggested limiting the exception to those equity
owners that are not originating qualifying assets to the ABCP conduits. 1600 We agree with the
commenter’s statements above and we are providing an exception, which we expect addresses
the concerns regarding the current marketplace organization of ABCP conduits. Accordingly,
under the exception, money market funds will be subject to the 5% issuer diversification limit on
the ABCP conduit and any ten percent obligors, 1601 but need not aggregate an ABCP conduit and
its independent equity owners for purposes of the 5% issuer diversification limit provided that a
primary line of business of those independent equity owners is owning equity interests in SPEs
and providing services to SPEs, the independent equity owners’ activities with respect to the
SPEs are limited to providing management or administrative services, and no qualifying assets of
the ABCP conduit were originated by the equity owners. 1602 Subject to the exception for certain
majority equity owners of ABCP conduits, we continue to believe that the majority ownership
test appropriately requires a money market fund to limit its exposure to particular economic
enterprises without unnecessarily limiting a fund’s investments.

Treatment of affiliates for ten percent obligor determinations

One commenter expressed concern regarding the impact of the proposed diversification
amendments on the treatment of ten percent obligors 1603 for ABS. 1604 The commenter noted that
currently each ABS issued by a separate entity is analyzed separately, and an ABCP conduit
typically represents to money market funds that it does not intend to purchase any ABS which
would result in a ten percent obligor. 1605 The commenter expressed concern that, if the proposed
treatment of affiliates is made applicable to the ten percent obligor, it is likely that some of the
ABS held by an ABCP conduit will need to be aggregated, resulting in ten percent obligors. 1606
This commenter argued that such a result may create legal and practical issues for sponsors,
given confidentiality restrictions that may prevent funds from determining which obligors are
affiliated, and may not reflect actual risks if such obligors are not part of the same economic
enterprise. 1607 In addition, this commenter noted that conduits may restructure their programs to
avoid having consolidated affiliate ten percent obligors, which would potentially reduce funding
capacity to those obligors. 1608
We acknowledge that the application of our diversification amendments on the treatment

1603

Generally, ABS acquired by a money market fund (“primary ABS”) are deemed to be issued by the SPE
that issued the ABS (e.g., the trust, corporation, entity organized for sole purpose of issuing the ABS). See
rule 2a-7(d)(3)(ii)(D)(1). However, if obligations of any issuer constitute 10% or more of the qualifying
assets of the primary ABS, that issuer will be deemed to be the issuer of that portion of the primary ABS
that is comprised of its obligations (“ten percent obligor”). See rule 2a-7(d)(3)(ii)(D)(1)(i).

of ten percent obligors may cause certain sponsors to conduct additional due diligence and also
may mean that some conduits would have to restructure their programs, which could result in
reduced funding capacity from money market funds. However, we understand that these
affiliated obligors generally represent exposure to the same economic enterprise. Therefore,
after further consideration, we continue to believe that requiring aggregation of obligors in
determining whether an obligor is a ten percent obligor reflects our objective. 1609 We continue to
believe that by using a more than 50% test, the alignment of economic interests and risks of
affiliated obligors is sufficient to justify aggregating their exposures for purposes of applying
rule 2a-7’s 5% issuer diversification limit. Requiring aggregation of obligors in determining ten
percent obligors will require diversification of exposure to obligors that are affiliated with each
other, thereby mitigating the credit risk to a money market fund when taking a highly
concentrated position in ABS with affiliated obligors.

Issuers of securities subject to a guarantee issued by a noncontrolled person

Under current rule 2a-7, a money market fund is not required to be diversified with
respect to issuers of securities that are subject to a guarantee issued by a non-controlled
person. 1610 Under our proposed rule 2a-7 amendments, non-ABS that are subject to a guarantee
by a non-controlled person would be subject to rule 2a-7’s 10% diversification limit applicable to
guarantees and demand features but would continue to have no issuer diversification limit.

1609

See rule 2a-7(d)(3)(ii)(F)(3).

1610

Current rule 2a-7(a)(18). A guarantee issued by a non-controlled person means a guarantee issued by: (i) a
person that, directly or indirectly, does not control, and is not controlled by or under common control with
the issuer of the security subject to the guarantee (control for these purposes means “control” as defined in
section 2(a)(9); or (ii) a sponsor of an SPE with respect to ABS. Current rule 2a-7(a)(18)(i) and (ii).

496

However, we proposed that a presumed guarantee issued by a sponsor of an SPE with respect to
ABS would no longer qualify as a guarantee issued by a non-controlled person, thereby creating
a disparity between treatment because ABS and non-ABS would be treated differently under the
proposal. 1611 Therefore, as proposed, ABS would be subject to both a 5% issuer diversification
limit on the SPE and any ten percent obligors, and a 10% limit on the sponsor as the presumed
guarantor. One commenter mentioned this potential discrepancy and argued that the portion of
ABS presumed to be guaranteed by the sponsor should not be subject to the issuer diversification
limitations and thus treated parallel with other money market fund portfolio securities subject to
a guarantee issued by a non-controlled person. 1612 After further consideration of this disparity in
treatment, we preliminarily believe that the approach that most advances our diversification
reform goal of limiting concentrated exposure of money market funds to particular economic
enterprises is to eliminate the exclusion from the 5% issuer diversification requirement for both
ABS and non-ABS that are subject to a guarantee by a non-controlled person. Therefore, instead
of creating a disparity in treatment between ABS and non-ABS by adopting the proposed
definition of a guarantee issued by a non-controlled person, we are retaining the current
definition of a guarantee issued by a non-controlled person, and we are proposing in our Release
issued today regarding removing references to credit ratings in rule 2a-7 that the 5% issuer
diversification limit be imposed on all securities with a guarantee by a non-controlled person. 1613

1611

See proposed (Fees and Gates) rule 2a-7(a)(17). Under the proposed rule, ABS that are subject to a
guarantee by a non-controlled person that meets the definition in current rule 2a-7(a)(18)(i) would continue
to have no issuer diversification limit.

Additional economic analysis

As discussed in the Proposing Release, these amendments are intended to more
efficiently achieve the diversification of risk contemplated by the rule’s current 5% issuer
diversification limit. The treatment of affiliates for purposes of rule 2a-7’s 5% issuer
diversification limit, and our diversification amendments collectively, are designed to diversify
the risks to which money market funds may be exposed and thereby reduce the impact of any
single issuer’s (or guarantor’s or demand feature provider’s) financial distress on a fund. Except
to the extent that money market funds choose to reinvest some or all of their excess exposure in
securities of higher risk, requiring money market funds to more broadly diversify against credit
risk should reduce the volatility of fund returns (and hence NAVs) and limit the impact of an
issuer’s distress on fund liquidity, which should mitigate the risk of heavy shareholder
redemptions from money market funds in times of financial distress and may promote capital
formation by making money market funds a more stable source of financing for issuers of shortterm credit instruments. Reducing money market funds’ volatility and making their liquidity
levels more resilient also could cause money market funds to attract further investments,
increasing their role as a source of capital in the short-term financing markets for issuers. We are
not able to quantify these benefits (although we do provide quantitative information concerning
certain impacts), primarily because we continue to believe it is impractical, if not impossible, to
identify with sufficient precision the marginal decrease in risk and increase in stability we expect

Requirement in the Money Market Fund Rule, Investment Company Act Release No. _____ (July 23,
2014).

498

these diversification amendments to provide. We received no comments providing
quantification of benefits.
More fundamentally, as discussed in the Proposing Release, these amendments are
designed to more effectively achieve the diversification of risk contemplated by the rule’s
current 5% issuer diversification limit. As discussed in the Proposing Release, we explained that
“[d]iversification limits investment risk to a fund by spreading the risk of loss among a number
of securities.” 1614 Requiring funds to purchase “a number of securities” rather than a smaller
number of concentrated investments will only “spread . . . the risk of loss” if the performance of
those securities is not highly correlated. That is, a fund’s investments in Issuers A, B and C are
no less risky (or only marginally so) than a single investment in Issuer A if Issuers A, B, and C
are likely to experience declines in value simultaneously and to approximately the same extent.
This may indeed be likely if Issuers A, B and C are affiliated with each other. In addition, if
Issuers A, B and C are affiliated with each other, they likely would share financial resources in
the event of a crisis, which would make it more likely that they would experience declines in
value simultaneously and to approximately the same extent. Prime money market funds’
concentrated exposures to financial institutions increase these concerns because prime money
market funds’ portfolios already appear correlated to some extent. 1615
As discussed in the Proposing Release, we recognize, however, that the amendments
could impose costs on money market funds and could affect competition, efficiency, and capital
formation. We expect that the requirement to aggregate affiliates for purposes of the 5% issuer
1614

1615

499

diversification limit will increase the diversification of at least some money market funds. 1616 A
money market fund that had invested more than 5% of its assets in a parent or corporate group
would, when those investments matured, have to reinvest some of the proceeds in a different
parent or corporate group (or in unrelated issuers). 1617 We requested comment on how the
amendment would affect competition, efficiency and capital formation, and the ways in which
money market funds may invest in response to the amendment. One commenter stated that the
requirement to treat affiliates as a single issuer for purposes of the 5% issuer diversification limit
could impede a money market fund’s ability to purchase high quality securities, and that, as a
result, money market funds could be forced to purchase securities of issuers with credit ratings
lower than those of the affiliated issuers. 1618 As noted above and discussed further below, we
believe that any effect caused by a money market fund investing in securities with higher credit
risk will be minimal due to the substantial risk-limiting provisions of rule 2a-7. 1619
As discussed above, we acknowledge that the application of our diversification
1616

(July 10, 2013), available at http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-03-13/s70313-20.pdf. The Division of
Risk, Strategy, and Financial Innovation (“RSFI”) is now known as the Division of Economic and Risk
Analysis (“DERA”), and accordingly we are no longer referring to this study as the “RSFI Diversification
Memo” as we did in the Proposing Release, but instead as the “DERA Diversification Memo.” The DERA
Diversification Memo shows, among other things, that some money market funds invested more than 5% of
their assets in the issuances of specific corporate groups, or “parents” (as defined in the DERA
Diversification Memo) between November 2010 and November 2012. For example, our staff’s analysis
shows that 30 money market funds, on average, invest at least 5% of their portfolios in the issuances of the
largest parent. Our staff’s analysis also shows that the largest fund-level exposure of at least 7% to the
issuances of one parent is 14 while the largest average fund-level exposure of at least 10% of the issuances
of one parent is 3.

Money market funds will not be required to sell any of their portfolio securities as a result of any of our
diversification amendments because rule 2a-7’s diversification limits are measured at acquisition.

500

amendments on the treatment of ten percent obligors may cause certain sponsors to conduct
additional due diligence and also may mean that some conduits would have to restructure their
programs, particularly if information regarding the identity of obligors is unavailable, which
could result in reduced funding capacity from money market funds. To the extent ABCP
conduits may decide to restructure their programs, we expect that the ABCP conduits might
incur costs associated with the restructuring, although we are unable to quantify any such costs
as we do not know to what extent ABCP conduits will decide to restructure, and we also did not
receive any comments regarding costs that ABCP conduits may incur.
We acknowledge that, as a result of our amendments, it is possible that some money
market funds may purchase securities of issuers with lower credit quality, although we note that
money market funds will continue to be required to meet the minimum credit risk standards set
forth in rule 2a-7. 1620 It also seems reasonable to expect that a divestment by one money market
fund (because its exposure to a particular group of affiliates is too great) might become a
purchasing opportunity for another money market fund whose holdings in that affiliated group
does not constrain it. If the credit qualities of the investments were similar, there should be no
net effect on fund risk and yield, although we discuss below how fund risk and yield may be
affected if money market funds choose to invest in securities of higher or lower credit risk than
they do currently. In the Proposing Release we discussed ways in which a money market fund
may reallocate its investments under our amendments to the diversification provisions of rule 2a7 as well as possible ways in which the amendment might affect capital formation. We discuss

1620

See rule 2a-7(d)(2) (portfolio quality).

501

above that requiring money market funds to more broadly diversify against credit risk may
promote capital formation by making money market funds a more stable source of financing for
issuers of short-term investments. However, the rule amendment could also reduce capital
formation if money market funds choose to reinvest some or all of their excess exposure in
securities of higher risk. In these instances, a money market fund’s portfolio risk would increase,
its NAV and fund liquidity may become more volatile and yields would rise. Money market
funds in this scenario could become less stable than they are today, investor demand for the
funds could fall (to the extent increased volatility in money market funds is not outweighed by
any increase in fund yield), and capital formation could be reduced. Alternatively, money
market funds might choose to reinvest excess exposure in securities of lower risk. In these
instances, portfolio risk (e.g., credit risk, counterparty risk) would decrease, fund NAVs and
liquidity would likely become less volatile and yields would fall. In this scenario, money market
funds would become more stable than they are today, investor demand for the funds could rise
(to the extent increased stability in money market funds is not outweighed by any decrease in
fund yield), and capital formation might be enhanced.
As stated in the Proposing Release, we cannot predict how money market funds will
invest in response to our amendments and we thus do not have a basis for determining money
market funds’ likely reinvestment strategies. We also did not receive comment on this issue.
We note that money market funds’ current exposures in excess of what our amendments will
permit may reflect the overall risk preferences of their managers. To the extent that these
amendments reduce the concentration of issuer risk, fund managers that have particular risk
tolerances or preferences may shift their funds’ remaining portfolio assets, within rule 2a-7’s

502

minimal credit risk requirements, 1621 to higher risk assets. If so, portfolio risk, although more
diversified, would increase (or remain constant), and we would expect portfolio yields to rise (or
to remain constant). If yields were to rise, money market funds might be able to compete more
favorably with other short-term investment products (to the extent the increased yield is not
outweighed by any increased volatility).
We continue to be unable to predict or quantify the precise effects this amendment will
have on competition, efficiency, or capital formation and did not receive comments addressing
the precise effects. The effects depend on how money market funds, their investors, and
companies that issue securities to money market funds will adjust on a long-term basis to our
amendment. The ways in which these groups could adjust, and the associated effects, are too
complex and interrelated to allow us to predict them with specificity or to quantify them. For
example, if a money market fund must reallocate its investments under our amendment, whether
that will affect capital formation depends on whether there are available alternative investments
the money market fund could choose and the nature of any alternatives. Assuming there are
alternative investments, the effects on capital formation will depend on the amount of yield the
issuers of the alternative investments will be required to pay as compared to the amount they
would have paid absent our amendments. For example, our amendment could cause money
market funds to seek alternative investments and this increased demand could allow their issuers
to pay a lower yield than they would absent this increase in demand. This would decrease
issuers’ financing costs, enhancing capital formation. But it also could decrease the yield the

1621

See id.

503

money market fund paid to its shareholders, potentially making money market funds less
attractive and leading to reduced aggregate investments by the money market fund which, in
turn, could increase financing costs for issuers of short-term debt.
The availability of alternative investments and the ease with which they could be
identified could affect efficiency, in that money market funds might find their investment process
less efficient if they were required to expend additional effort identifying alternative investments.
These same factors could affect competition if more effort is required to identify alternative
investments under our amendments and larger money market funds are better positioned to
expend this additional effort or to do so at a lower marginal cost than smaller money market
funds. These factors also could affect capital formation in other ways, in that money market
funds could choose to invest in lower quality securities under our proposal if they are not able to
identify alternative investments with levels of risk equivalent to the funds’ current investments.
As discussed in the Proposing Release, the amendments could require money market
funds to update the systems they use to monitor their compliance with rule 2a-7’s 5% issuer
diversification limit in order to aggregate exposures to affiliates. Although we understand, as
discussed above, that most money market funds today consider their exposures to entities that are
affiliated with each other for risk management purposes, any systems money market funds
currently have in place for this purpose may not be suitable for monitoring compliance with a
diversification requirement, as opposed to a risk management evaluation (which may entail less
regular or episodic monitoring).
We requested comment as to whether funds expect that they would incur operational
costs in addition to, or that differ from the costs estimated in the Proposing Release. We did not

504

receive comments regarding specific costs, although one commenter stated that it did not believe
that the amendments would have a significant impact on the operations of most money market
funds. 1622 Another commenter stated that additional time and data costs may be required to
determine issuer affiliations, but also stated that it did not see a significant increase in costs
related to complying with our amended issuer diversification requirements. 1623
Based on the activities typically involved in making systems modifications, and
recognizing that money market funds’ existing systems currently have varying degrees of
functionality, we estimated in the Proposing Release, and continue to estimate, that the one-time
systems modifications costs (including modifications to related procedures and controls) for a
money market fund associated with these amendments would range from approximately
$600,000 to $1,200,000. 1624 As we stated in the Proposing Release, we do not expect that
money market funds will incur material ongoing costs to maintain and modify their systems as a
result of this amendment because we expect modifications required by this amendment will be
incremental changes to existing systems that already perform similar functions (track exposures
for purposes of monitoring compliance with rule 2a-7’s 5% issuer diversification limit).
Although we have estimated the costs that a single money market fund could incur as a
result of this amendment, we expect that these costs will be shared among various money market
funds in a complex. As discussed in the Proposing Release, we do not expect that money market
1622

Staff estimates that these costs will be attributable to the following activities: (i) planning, coding, testing,
and installing system modifications; (ii) drafting, integrating, and implementing related procedures and
controls; and (iii) preparing training materials and administering training sessions for staff in affected
areas. See also supra section III.A.5.a.

505

funds will be required to spend additional time determining affiliations under our amendments,
or if an additional time commitment is required, we expect that it would be minimal. We
estimated in the Proposing Release that the costs of this minimal additional time commitment to
a money market fund, if it were to occur, will range from approximately $5,000 to $105,000
annually. 1625 We did not receive comments on these particular estimates, although we have
updated our estimates based on more recent data, and now estimate that the costs of this minimal
additional time commitment to a money market fund, if it were to occur, will range from
approximately $6,700 to $109,500 annually. 1626

1625

In arriving at this estimate in the Proposing Release, we expected that any required additional work
generally would be conducted each time a money market fund determined whether to add a new issuer to
the approved list of issuers in which the fund may invest. The frequency with which a money market fund
makes these determinations would depend on its size and investment strategy. To be conservative, and
based on Form N-MFP data concerning the number of securities held in money market funds’ portfolios,
we estimated that a money market fund could be required to make such a determination between 33 and
339 times each year. This was based on our staff’s review of data filed on Form N-MFP as of February 28,
2013, which showed that the 10 smallest money market funds by assets had an average of 33 investments
and the 10 largest money market funds by assets had an average of 339 investments. The number of a
money market fund’s investments should be a rough proxy for the number of times each year that a money
market fund could add an issuer to its approved list, although this will overstate the frequency of these
determinations (e.g., a fund may have a number of separate investments in a single issuer). We estimated
that the additional time commitment imposed by our amendments, if any, would be an additional 1-2 hours
of an analyst’s time each time the fund determined whether to add an issuer to its approved list. The
estimated range of costs, therefore, was calculated as follows: (33 evaluations x 1 hour of a junior business
analyst’s time at $155 per hour = $5,115) to (339 evaluations x 2 hours of a junior business analyst’s time
at $155 per hour = $105,090). Finally, we recognize that some money market funds do not use an
approved list, but instead evaluate each investment separately. We believe that the number of a money
market fund’s investments also should be a rough proxy for the number of times such a money market fund
would evaluate each investment. Such funds may be on the higher end of the range, however, because the
extent to which a fund’s average number of investments reflects the number of times such a fund purchases
securities would depend on the rate of the fund’s portfolio turnover. Whether any additional analysis
would be required as a result of our amendments for such a fund also would depend on whether the fund
invested proceeds from maturing securities in issuers for which a new credit risk analysis was required or in
issuers of securities owned by the fund for which the analysis may already have been done.

ABS – Sponsors Treated as Guarantors

We are amending rule 2a-7, as proposed, to require that money market funds treat the
sponsors of ABS as guarantors subject to rule 2a-7’s 10% diversification limit applicable to
guarantees and demand features, unless the money market fund’s board of directors (or its
delegate) determines that the fund is not relying on the sponsor’s financial strength or its ability
or willingness to provide liquidity, credit or other support to determine the ABS’s quality or
liquidity. 1627 As discussed in the Proposing Release, money market funds’ reliance on and
exposure to sponsors of ABCP, a type of ABS, specifically during 2007, suggests that current

market fund could be required to make such a determination between 42 and 342 times each year. This is
based on our staff’s review of data filed on Form N-MFP as of February 28, 2014, which showed that the
10 smallest money market funds (not including government or Treasury funds) by assets had an average of
42 investments and the 10 largest money market funds (not including government or Treasury funds) by
assets had an average of 342 investments. The number of a money market fund’s investments should be a
rough proxy for the number of times each year that a money market fund could add an issuer to its
approved list, although this will overstate the frequency of these determinations (e.g., a fund may have a
number of separate investments in a single issuer). We estimate that the additional time commitment
imposed by our amendments, if any, will be an additional 1-2 hours of an analyst’s time each time the fund
determined whether to add an issuer to its approved list. The estimated range of costs, therefore, is
calculated as follows: (42 evaluations x 1 hour of a junior business analyst’s time at $160 per hour =
$6,720) to (342 evaluations x 2 hours of a junior business analyst’s time at $160 per hour = $109,440).
Finally, we recognize that some money market funds do not use an approved list, but instead evaluate each
investment separately. We believe that the number of a money market fund’s investments also should be a
rough proxy for the number of times such a money market fund would evaluate each investment. Such
funds may be on the higher end of the range, however, because the extent to which a fund’s average
number of investments reflects the number of times such a fund purchases securities would depend on the
rate of the fund’s portfolio turnover. Whether any additional analysis would be required as a result of our
amendments for such a fund also would depend on whether the fund invested proceeds from maturing
securities in issuers for which a new credit risk analysis was required or in issuers of securities owned by
the fund for which the analysis may already have been done.
1627

As a result, subject to an exception, a money market fund cannot invest in ABS, if immediately after the
investment it would have invested more than 10% of its total assets in securities issued by or subject to
demand features or guarantees from the ABS sponsor. See rule 2a-7(a)(18)(ii) and rule 2a-7(d)(3)(iii).
Current rule 2a-7 applies a 10% diversification limitation on demand features and guarantees to 75% of
money market funds’ total assets. As discussed in infra section III.I.3, we are amending rule 2a-7 to apply
the 10% diversification limitation to 85% of a tax-exempt money market fund’s assets and to 100% of a
fund’s assets for money market funds other than tax-exempt funds.

507

rule 2a-7 potentially permits money market funds to become overexposed to ABCP sponsors. 1628
Our amendments today therefore provide that, subject to an exception, money market funds
investing in ABS rely on the sponsor’s financial strength or its ability or willingness to provide
liquidity, credit, or other support to the ABS, and require diversification against such reliance
and exposure to ABS sponsors. 1629
A number of commenters generally supported the requirement to treat sponsors of ABS
as guarantors. 1630 For example, one commenter noted that ABS sponsors have provided explicit
as well as implicit credit and liquidity support for the vehicles they have sponsored and that it is
therefore appropriate that such support be presumed for purposes of applying rule 2a-7
diversification limitations. 1631 Several commenters however, generally opposed the proposed
requirement. 1632 Some of these commenters argued that the requirement to treat sponsors of ABS
as guarantors is not consistent with the current practice of money market funds. 1633 For example,

1628

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at section III.J.2.

1629

Under the amended rule, the sponsor of an ABS will be deemed to guarantee the entire principal amount of
those ABS, except that the sponsor will not be deemed to have provided such a guarantee for purposes of
the following paragraphs of rule 2a-7: (a)(12)(iii) (definition of eligible security); (d)(2)(iii) (credit
substitution); (d)(3)(iv)(A) (fractional guarantees); and (e) (guarantees not relied on). We also are adopting
a number of conforming amendments to other provisions of rule 2a-7 to implement the treatment of ABS
sponsors as guarantors. See rule 2a-7(f)(4)(iii) (defining defaults for purposes of rule 2a-7(f)(2) and (3) as
applied to guarantees issued by ABS sponsors); rule 2a-7(g)(7) (requiring periodic re-evaluations of any
finding that the fund is not relying on the sponsor’s financial strength or ability or willingness to provide
support in determining the quality or liquidity of ABS); and rule 2a-7(h)(6) (recordkeeping requirements
for the periodic re-evaluations).

one commenter stated that while money market funds cannot usually review information about
the particular assets underlying ABS, 1634 money market funds nevertheless base their credit
decisions on a multitude of factors other than the sponsor’s financial strength. 1635 Some
commenters also argued that money market funds look to the legal requirement for a sponsor to
provide a guarantee rather than relying on an implicit guarantee by the sponsor, 1636 and that
partial or incidental reliance on the financial strength of an ABS sponsor should not require
treatment of the sponsor as a 100% guarantor of the ABS. 1637 Another commenter argued that
the requirement to treat the sponsor of an SPE issuing ABS as a guarantor of ABS would require
money market funds to expand diversification of ABS sponsors at the same time many of these
sponsors are exiting the market. 1638 While we recognize that in many cases a money market fund
is not basing its investment decision solely on the financial strength of the sponsor or on an
implicit guarantee by the sponsor, we understand, as discussed in the Proposing Release, that
money market funds often make investment decisions based, at least in part, on the presumption
1634

mismatch in ABCP conduits causes ABCP investors to analyze the structure of the ABCP conduits more so

underlying assets). See also Federated VIII Comment Letter (discussing its evaluation of ABCP before
investing, noting that only a portion of their analysis is based on the sponsor, and that significant emphasis
is placed on the qualifying assets); SSGA Comment Letter (stating that it believes credit analysis with
regard to ABS should not solely rely upon sponsor support).

1636

See, e.g., Federated II Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter (arguing that because the proposed
requirement would treat a sponsor as a guarantor of the entire amount of the ABS even when the sponsor
has no legal obligation to support its ABS, the amendment seems to endorse the practice of relying on an
“implicit” guarantee when assessing the credit risk of ABS). See also Federated VIII (arguing that the
amendment would encourage investors that are assessing the credit risk of ABS to rely on an unproven
assumption that a sponsor will voluntarily assume losses on its financial products, and that because such
“implicit guarantees” are not reliable, endorsing this practice would only increase risks to money market
funds that invest in ABS.)

that the sponsor will take steps to prevent the ABS from defaulting. 1639 However, money market
funds are generally not required to diversify against ABS sponsors because the support that ABS
sponsors provide, implicitly or explicitly, which money market funds often rely on, typically
does not meet the current rule’s definition of “guarantee” or “demand feature.” 1640
We acknowledge that if sponsor supply were to become limited, it may be more difficult
for money market funds to obtain ABS. However, after further consideration, we continue to
believe it is appropriate to amend rule 2a-7 to require diversification against such support to limit
a money market fund’s concentration in a single sponsor because a fund could seek to rely on
liquidity or capital support from that sponsor, if necessary. When a money market fund is
determining the ABS’s quality or liquidity based, at least in part, on the ABS sponsor’s financial
strength or its ability or willingness to provide liquidity, credit or other support, limiting a money
market fund’s concentration in that sponsor mitigates the risk that a money market fund would
face in the case where such ABS sponsor would be unable to support the value of the fund’s
investments in times of severe market stress because it reduces the amount of a money market
fund’s investments that would be impacted by the inability of the sponsor to support the value of
those investments.

conduits are provided by their financial institution sponsors.”). But see SFIG Comment Letter (describing
that a subset of ABCP conduits are administered by entities that are not financial institutions and that credit
or liquidity support to the ABCP conduit is provided by financial institutions that are not affiliated with the
administrator); ICI Comment Letter (suggesting that there is no reason to require diversification against
sponsors as opposed to other service providers such as servicers and liquidity providers). Although persons
other than the sponsor, such as servicers and liquidity providers, could support ABS, we understand that, to
the extent ABS have explicit support, it typically is provided by the sponsor. We also understand that
investors in ABS without explicit support may view the sponsor as providing implicit support. See, e.g.,
Goldman Sachs Comment Letter.

1640

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, n.868 and accompanying text.

510

As discussed further below, we recognize that in certain cases an ABS sponsor should not
be deemed to guarantee the ABS. An ABS sponsor therefore will not be deemed to guarantee
the ABS if the money market fund’s board of directors (or its delegate) determines that the fund
is not relying on the ABS sponsor’s financial strength or its ability or willingness to provide
liquidity, credit, or other support to determine the ABS’s quality or liquidity. We also discuss
below that an ABS sponsor will not be deemed to guarantee the full amount of ABS in cases of
fractional guarantees.
Commenters noted that under current rule 2a-7, if a company guarantees or provides a
demand feature of a portion of the qualifying assets, only that portion of the ABS is counted
towards the diversification limit.1641 These commenters expressed concern that amended rule
2a-7 would change this result by treating a company that sponsors ABS as a guarantor of the
entire amount held by a fund, even if the company’s guarantee or demand feature is limited to a
smaller amount. 1642 As proposed, in cases where a security is subject to a fractional demand
feature or guarantee by the sponsor, as defined in rule 2a-7, a money market fund may count the
fractional demand feature or guarantee in place of deeming the sponsor as a guarantor of the
entire principal amount of the ABS. 1643 However, in cases where a money market fund is
partially or incidentally relying on the financial strength of the ABS sponsor, but such partial or
incidental reliance does not fall under the definition of a fractional guarantee, the money market

See rule 2a-7(d)(3)(iv)(A) (calculation of fractional demand features or guarantees) and rule 2a-7(a)(18)(ii)
(providing an exception from the requirement to deem a sponsor of an SPE as providing a guarantee with
respect to the entire principal amount of ABS in the case of fractional guarantees).

511

fund will be required to treat the sponsor as a guarantor of the entire principal amount of the
ABS. In this case, even though a sponsor may not be providing a full guarantee, the fund would
not be able to readily determine the actual portion of assets for which the guarantor is providing
structural support. Therefore, except in cases of fractional guarantees as discussed above, we
continue to believe that, unless the board of directors determines that the fund is not relying on
the financial strength of the sponsor, it is appropriate to require diversification against such
sponsor with respect to all the qualifying assets in order to mitigate the risk that an ABS sponsor
would be unable to support the value of a money market fund’s investments in times of severe
market stress.
One commenter suggested that explicit support would not always be dispositive in
determining the sponsor’s identity and that treating certain entities as sponsors would not reflect
actual economic risks to the fund. 1644 This commenter also recommended that we define the term
sponsor in our final amendments, noting that otherwise it may be difficult for certain money
market funds to determine the entity that is providing the deemed guarantee. 1645 Although
providing a specific definition of ABS sponsor may exclude certain entities that should otherwise
be treated as a sponsor, and may not allow for future flexibility with regards to new types of
ABS structures, we understand that determining the ABS sponsor in certain cases may present
difficulties. We recognize that in some cases where the administrator of an ABCP conduit,
which may otherwise be commonly thought of as the sponsor, is not providing liquidity or credit
1644

SFIG Comment Letter (recommending that we define a provider of credit and liquidity support to an ABCP
conduit that equals or exceeds fifty percent of the outstanding face amount of the ABCP of such conduit as
the sponsor).

1645

Id.

512

support, the administrator would not appropriately be defined as a sponsor for purposes of our
amended diversification requirements. In this case, requiring diversification against entities that
do not, or could not, provide liquidity, credit or other support to the ABCP conduit would not
reflect the actual risks of a fund’s exposure to such an entity. For ABCP, we believe that the
sponsor will typically be the financial institution that provides explicit liquidity and/or credit
support and also provides administrative services to the ABCP conduit. 1646 The amended
diversification requirements we are adopting today aim to diversify against the risks of
concentration of exposure to entities that a fund may be relying on, whether explicitly or
implicitly, in determining the ABS’s quality or liquidity. Therefore, if a money market fund is
relying on an entity’s financial strength or its ability or willingness to provide liquidity, credit, or
other types of support to determine the ABS’s quality or liquidity, such entity would
appropriately be defined as a sponsor for purposes of our amended diversification requirements.
As proposed, our amended rule requires that, unless the board (or its delegate) determines
otherwise, all ABS sponsors are deemed to guarantee their ABS. We are applying this
requirement to all ABS sponsors because we are concerned that applying the requirement only to
sponsors of certain types of ABS could become obsolete as new forms of ABS are introduced.
Because we recognize that it may not be appropriate to require money market funds to treat ABS
sponsors as guarantors in all cases, under amended rule 2a-7, an ABS sponsor would not be

For TOB programs in which the liquidity provider for the TOB program or its affiliate holds the residual
interest in the TOB trust, we believe the entity that provides both the liquidity support and holds the
residual interest typically will be the sponsor. For TOB programs in which the liquidity provider or its
affiliate does not also own the residual interest in the TOB trust, we believe the financial institution that
sets up the TOB program, markets and remarkets the TOBs, transfers the municipal security into the TOB
trust and/or provides liquidity typically will be the sponsor.

513

deemed to guarantee the ABS if the money market fund’s board of directors (or its delegate)
determines that the fund is not relying on the ABS sponsor’s financial strength or its ability or
willingness to provide liquidity, credit, or other support to determine the ABS’s quality or
liquidity. 1647 In determining whether a money market fund is relying on the ABS sponsor’s
financial strength or its ability or willingness to provide liquidity, credit, or other support, the
money market fund board of directors may want to consider, among other things, whether the
fund considers the ABS sponsor’s financial strength or its ability or willingness to provide
liquidity, credit, or other support as a factor when determining the ABS’s quality or liquidity.
While one commenter specifically supported the exception to the ABS sponsor
designation through money market fund board of directors (or delegate) action, 1648 other
commenters expressed concern that overseeing determinations that a money market fund is not
relying on ABS sponsors would impose further burdens on money market fund directors. 1649
However, a board can, and likely will, delegate this responsibility. 1650 While we recognize that a
board will, at a minimum, need to provide oversight and establish procedures 1651 if it delegates its
responsibility, we believe that any incremental burden to make a determination (by the board or
its delegate) regarding reliance on an ABS sponsor should be minimal, as the money market fund
would already have analyzed the security’s credit quality and liquidity when assessing whether

rule 2a-7(g)(7) and rule 2a-7(h)(6).

the security posed minimal credit risks and whether the fund could purchase the security
consistent with rule 2a-7’s limits on investments in “illiquid securities.” 1652 One commenter
supported a board exception that applied when a money market fund board (or its delegate)
determines that a sponsor’s financial strength or its ability or willingness to provide liquidity,
credit or other support did not play a substantial role in the money market fund’s assessment of
the ABS’s quality or liquidity. 1653 On balance however, we believe that even when a money
market fund board of directors (or its delegate) determines that a sponsor’s financial strength or
its ability or willingness to provide liquidity, credit or other support plays a less than substantial
role in the money market fund’s assessment of the ABS’s quality or liquidity, it is beneficial to
require diversification against such sponsor because it limits a money market fund’s
concentration in a single sponsor on which the fund could still seek to rely. In addition,
requiring diversification against such sponsor also mitigates the possible effect of an ABS
sponsor being unable to support the value of the ABS because a money market fund will be
required to diversify against its investments in ABS with such sponsor. We are therefore
adopting the board exception as proposed.
Several commenters argued that a board should not have to make a finding in certain
situations where the ABS is fully supported by a guarantee or demand feature provided by a third
party. 1654 One of these commenters argued that if an issuance of ABS has a contractual guarantee
of support by a third party, we should require money market funds to count the third-party

1652

Rule 2a-7(a)(12) (definition of “eligible security”) and rule 2a-7(d)(4) (portfolio liquidity).

1653

515

guarantor, rather than the sponsor, for purposes of the diversification limit. 1655 This commenter
noted that for ABS that carry contractual guarantees of support by third parties, a fund manager
often looks to financial strength and creditworthiness of the third-party guarantor to evaluate the
creditworthiness or liquidity of the ABS. 1656 We recognize that in certain cases, ABS may be
fully supported by a guarantee or demand feature provided by a third party where the board (or
its delegate) would determine that the money market fund is not relying on the ABS sponsor’s
financial strength or its ability or willingness to provide liquidity, credit, or other support to
determine the ABS’ quality or liquidity. However, some money market funds may view the
third-party guarantee as a “layered guarantee” on top of the sponsor’s guarantee, which today are
both subject to a 10% diversification limit under rule 2a-7. We believe it is appropriate to allow
for instances of layered guarantees when a third-party guarantor is present, and therefore believe
that in cases where a money market fund is relying only on the third-party guarantor the board
(or its delegate) can determine that it is not relying on the sponsor, and in cases where a money
market fund views the third-party guarantor as providing a layered guarantee, the amended rule
will provide that the money market fund treat the guarantee by the sponsor and the guarantee by
the third-party guarantor as layered guarantees.
Commenters also argued that the board should not have to make the required findings for
certain types of ABS, such as TOBs. Commenters argued that diversification from TOB
sponsors is unnecessary because TOBs have dedicated liquidity providers and frequently have

1655

1656

Id.

516

credit enhancement, and the TOB sponsor may not necessarily be the provider of either. 1657
Commenters also stated that tax-exempt money market funds in particular would suffer if TOBs
were not excluded because the amended diversification requirements would further restrict a
money market fund’s ability to hold TOBs. 1658 One commenter recommended excluding
sponsors of all types of ABS (other than ABCP) from the proposed ABS sponsor rule, noting
that sponsors of non-ABCP ABS do not typically provide explicit credit or liquidity support. 1659
We recognize that in some cases diversification from non-ABCP ABS sponsors, including TOB
sponsors may be unnecessary if the fund is not relying on the sponsor’s financial strength or its
ability or willingness to provide liquidity, credit or other support to determine the ABS’s quality
or liquidity.
Although commenters suggested providing an exclusion from the amended rule, we
believe that non-ABCP ABS, including TOBs, are more appropriately addressed through the
board exception to the diversification requirement. Because at least in some instances a fund
may be looking to the sponsor’s financial strength or its ability or willingness to provide
liquidity, credit or other support to determine the ABS’s quality or liquidity, we have decided to
retain the presumption for ABS generally. In addition, we believe that it would be inefficient to
attempt to anticipate every type of ABS sponsor that should be excluded now or in the future,
and designating particular exclusions in the amended rule may not provide for innovation of new
types of ABS over time. The rebuttable presumption we are adopting today however, does allow

See, e.g., Fidelity Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter (noting that TOBs already have a limited
number of sponsors).

for flexibility in instances where the fund is not looking to the sponsor, irrespective of the actual
type of ABS, where the board of directors determines that the fund is not relying on the sponsor
to make determinations about quality or liquidity.
3.

The Twenty-Five Percent Basket

We proposed amending rule 2a-7 to eliminate the “twenty-five percent basket,” under
which as much as 25% of the value of securities held in a money market fund’s portfolio may be
subject to guarantees or demand features from a single institution. 1660 After further consideration,
and in light of the comments received, our final amendments (i) remove the twenty-five percent
basket for money market funds other than tax-exempt money market funds, and (ii) reduce to
15%, rather than eliminate, the twenty-five percent basket for tax-exempt money market funds,
including single state money market funds. 1661

1660

Current rule 2a-7 applies a 10% diversification limit on guarantees and demand features only to 75% of a
money market fund’s total assets. See current rule 2a-7(c)(4)(iii)(A). A money market fund, however, may
only use the twenty-five percent basket to invest in demand features or guarantees that are first tier
securities issued by non-controlled persons. See rules 2a-7(c)(4)(iii)(B) and (C). Although we proposed to
delete current rule 2a-7(a)(10) (definition of demand feature issued by a non-controlled person) because the
term is used only in connection with the twenty-five percent basket, we are retaining the definition because
our amendments provide a fifteen percent basket for tax-exempt money market funds. See rule 2a-7(a)(10).
We also are adopting certain amendments to clarify that a fund must comply with this 10% diversification
limit immediately after it acquires a security directly issued by, or subject to guarantees or demand features
provided by, the institution that issued the security or provided the demand feature or guarantee. See rules
2a-7(d)(3)(i) and (iii). We believe this amendment reflects funds’ current practices and is consistent with
rule 2a-7’s current requirements.

1661

We note that Investment Company Act rule 12d3-1 also refers to a twenty-five percent basket. See rule
12d3-1(d)(7)(v). That rule generally permits investment companies to purchase certain securities issued by
companies engaged in securities-related activities notwithstanding section 12(d)(3)’s limitations on these
kinds of transactions. Among other things, rule 12d3-1 provides that the acquisition of a demand feature or
guarantee as defined in rule 2a-7 will not be deemed to be an acquisition of the securities of a securitiesrelated business provided that “immediately after the acquisition of any Demand Feature or Guarantee, the
company will not, with respect to 75 percent of the total value of its assets, have invested more than 10
percent of the total value of its assets in securities underlying Demand Features or Guarantees from the
same institution.” We requested comment as to whether we should revise rule 12d3-1 to apply this
diversification requirement with respect to all of an investment company’s total assets, rather than just 75%
of assets, for consistency with the proposed elimination of the twenty-five percent basket in rule 2a-7. We

518

As discussed in the Proposing Release, a number of recent events have highlighted the
risks to money market funds caused by their substantial exposure to providers of demand
features and guarantees. 1662 For example, during the financial crisis, many funds were heavily
exposed to bond insurers and a few major financial institutions that served as liquidity providers.
This concentration led to considerable stress in the municipal markets when some of these bond
insurers and financial institutions came under pressure during the financial crisis. We continue
to believe that tightening diversification requirements with respect to a money market fund’s
exposure to securities subject to guarantees or demand features from a single guarantor or
demand feature provider will reduce this risk. However, we are concerned that removing the
twenty-five percent basket entirely for tax-exempt money market funds would inhibit the ability
of these funds to be fully invested in securities subject to guarantees or demand features or may
force them to invest in securities that have weaker credit than the securities they might otherwise
purchase, due to the more limited availability of guarantors and demand feature providers for
tax-exempt money market funds as compared to non-tax-exempt money market funds. 1663
Accordingly, under our amendments, as much as 15% of the value of securities held in a taxexempt money market fund’s portfolio may be subject to guarantees or demand features from a

received no comments regarding rule 12d3-1. At this time we are not amending rule 12d3-1 to reflect our
amendments to rule 2a-7’s diversification provisions because although rule 12d3-1 provides a twenty-five
percent basket for purposes of section 12(d)(3) limitations, this twenty-five percent basket is not directly
associated with the twenty-five percent basket in rule 2a-7.
1662

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at section III.J.3.

As discussed in more detail below, this concern primarily applies to tax-exempt funds, the largest users of
the basket, as they face a significantly more constrained supply of investable securities than other types of
money market funds.

i. Non-tax-exempt money market funds
To help us evaluate the possible effects of removing the twenty-five percent basket on
non-tax-exempt money market funds, DERA staff analyzed the exposure that money market
funds have to guarantors, as described in detail in the DERA Guarantor Diversification
Memo. 1665 As demonstrated below, DERA staff found that the majority of money market funds
do not use the twenty-five percent basket.
As presented in the figure below, DERA staff examined the number of money market
funds for which guarantors compose more than 10%, 15% and 20% of their portfolios,
respectively. 1666

DERA Guarantor Diversification Memo, the term “guarantors” is used to refer both to the ultimate parent

guarantees and demand features.

In addition to showing that the majority of money market funds do not use the basket, the

1668

1669

522

data analyzed in the DERA Guarantor Diversification Memo also shows that money market
funds that do use the twenty-five percent basket use the basket to a limited extent for purposes of
gaining a high level of exposure to any one particular guarantor or demand feature provider. 1670
In fact, commenters noted that although a money market fund may use the full twenty-five
percent basket to gain exposure to one guarantor or demand feature, money market funds will
often use the twenty-five percent basket to gain a smaller amount of exposure to two guarantors
or demand feature providers above the 10% diversification limit, for a total of up to twenty-five
percent. 1671
As noted by commenters, currently, a money market fund can use the twenty-five percent
basket in two ways. First, a money market fund can apply the basket to one guarantor where the
guarantor can account for as much as 25% of the portfolio’s guarantees. The figures above show
that $260 million or 0.01% of the industry dollars are above the 20% threshold as of November
2012 and $740 million or 0.03% of the industry dollars are above the 15% threshold as of
November 2012, suggesting that few funds are using the basket this way. Second, a money
market fund can apply the basket to two guarantors where each guarantor has between 10% and
15% of the portfolio guarantees and the sum equals 25% or less. The difference between the

15% diversification threshold is relatively small, amounting to 0.03% of the assets in the entire money
market fund industry as of November 2012.

1671

See, e.g., Wells Fargo DERA Comment Letter; Comment Letter of Federated Investors, Inc. (Municipal
Money Market Funds) (Apr. 23, 2014) (“Federated DERA III Comment Letter”); SIFMA DERA Comment
Letter. For example, money market funds may use the twenty-five percent basket to obtain exposure for
two demand feature providers or guarantors above the 10% diversification limit, in which case the exposure
to any one demand feature provider or guarantor would have to be less than 15%, and the average exposure
to any one demand feature provider or guarantor could not exceed 12.5%. See Federated DERA III
Comment Letter.

523

15% and the 10% threshold amounts in the above illustrations represents the usage under this
scenario. As of November 2012, $6.02 billion or 0.2% of the industry dollars are used this way,
suggesting that most funds use the twenty-five percent basket divided up among two guarantors
with exposures up to 15%. 1672 If we assume an even split of 12.5% between two guarantors, then
instead of having to reduce exposure from 25% to 10% for one guarantor, most money market
funds will be required to reduce exposure from 12.5% to 10% for two guarantors. Thus, because
most money market funds are not today using the twenty-five percent basket to gain high levels
of exposure to any one particular guarantor or demand feature provider, we believe that any
negative effects for these money market funds that would be associated with reducing exposure
to guarantors would generally be minimal.
One commenter suggested that the figures we provided in the Proposing Release (which
were derived from monthly Form N-MFP filings) only captured the funds that used the twentyfive percent basket on one particular day, but that the basket is regularly relied upon during the
course of the fund’s operations. 1673 The DERA Guarantor Diversification Memo addresses the
commenter’s concern by reviewing the use of the twenty-five percent basket over a period of two
years. 1674 After further review, our staff found that the data we provided in the Proposing
Release is comparable with the use of the twenty-five percent basket when we analyze money

1672

As discussed below, the DERA analysis further shows that the usage of the twenty-five percent basket is
predominantly used by tax-exempt money market funds.

market funds regularly rely on the twenty-five percent basket during the course of their operations and that

hold securities in their twenty-five percent basket).

market funds’ use over two years. 1675 Therefore, although commenters suggest that the use of the
twenty-five percent basket may vary considerably during the course of operation, and
commenters did not provide any specific data suggesting otherwise, our staff found that the use
of the twenty-five percent basket over a longer period was in fact relatively constant.
The data and figures provided above, which show that most funds that are using the
basket are using the basket between the 15% and 10% thresholds, suggest that eliminating the
basket for all money market funds (other than tax-exempt money market funds), as opposed to
providing a fifteen percent basket, most effectively addresses our concerns about a money
market fund’s exposure to a single guarantor or demand feature provider because eliminating the
basket provides a significant mitigation of the risks to money market funds caused by their
substantial exposure to these providers. After further consideration, we continue to believe that
removing the twenty-five percent basket for money market funds (other than tax-exempt money
market funds) instead of providing a fifteen percent basket (or other size basket), more
appropriately addresses the risk that a fund faces when it is heavily exposed to a single guarantor
or demand feature provider.
ii. Tax-exempt money market funds
As discussed in greater detail in the DERA Guarantor Diversification Memo, and as
discussed further below, DERA staff also analyzed data and figures regarding the use of the
twenty-five percent basket by tax-exempt money market funds. DERA staff found that taxexempt money market funds in general, and single state money market funds in particular, use

1675

the twenty-five percent basket to a higher degree than money market funds as a whole. As set
forth below, DERA staff examined the number of other tax-exempt funds and single state funds
for which guarantors compose more than 10%, 15%, and 20% of their portfolios, respectively. 1676

Id. The DERA Guarantor Diversification Memo divides municipal money market funds into two
categories, consistent with the two types of municipal money market funds on Form N-MFP (Item 10),
“single state funds” and “other tax-exempt funds.”

DERA staff analyzed, among other things: (i) the percentage of tax-exempt money
market fund assets exposed to guarantors above the 10% threshold, which shows the percentage
of assets that would need to be reinvested if we eliminated the twenty-five percent basket, as
proposed; and (ii) the percentage of tax-exempt money market fund assets exposed to guarantors
above the 15% threshold, which shows the percentage of assets that will need to be reinvested as
a result of the fifteen percent basket that we are adopting today for tax-exempt money market
funds. We believe that our staff’s analysis of the percentage of assets invested in securities
subject to demand features or guarantees in excess of the 10% and 15% guarantor diversification
limits, respectively, provides an accurate reflection of the potential impact that elimination or
reduction of the twenty-five percent basket would have on other tax-exempt funds and single
state funds. We also believe that looking to the percentage of assets, as opposed to the number
of funds or excess amount of assets in dollars (which only show absolute numbers), most
accurately shows the corresponding level of assets that will need to be reinvested.

529

The above data shows that the percentage of other tax-exempt funds and single state fund
assets exposed to guarantors above the 10% and 15% guarantor diversification limits are
relatively small when compared to other municipal money market funds and the money market
fund industry as a whole, although the data also shows that other tax-exempt funds and single
state funds use the basket to a greater extent than money market funds generally. In addition to
acknowledging that the proposed elimination of the basket would have a greater effect on taxexempt money market funds because of their higher use of the basket, we have also taken into
account commenters’ concerns, as discussed below, regarding the limited availability of
guarantor and demand feature providers for tax-exempt money market funds as opposed to nontax-exempt money market funds.
b. Additional Considerations
i. Non-tax-exempt money market funds
Several commenters generally supported the removal of the twenty-five percent
basket. 1680 For example, one commenter argued that eliminating the twenty-five percent basket
for all money market funds would be an appropriate step to further reducing concentration risk in
money market funds. 1681 Other commenters, however, opposed the removal of the twenty-five
percent basket. 1682 Commenters argued that the elimination of the twenty-five percent basket

See, e.g., Barnard Comment Letter; CFA Institute Comment Letter. See also U.S. Bancorp Comment
Letter (supporting the removal of the twenty-five percent basket for all money market funds); Wells Fargo
Comment Letter (supporting the removal of the twenty-five percent basket only for taxable money market
funds); Schwab Comment Letter (supporting the removal of the twenty-five percent basket, but
recommending that state-specific municipal money market funds be allowed to continue using the basket to
some extent).

would increase money market funds’ reliance on lower quality investments with higher credit
risk, particularly due to the limited number of providers of guarantees and demand features. 1683
One commenter argued that since the financial crisis, fewer issuers have been providing
guarantees and other credit support for securities to be purchased by money market funds, and
that removing the twenty-five percent basket could force managers to purchase paper of lower
quality issuers that are unable or unwilling to obtain third-party demand features. 1684 Another
commenter stated that consolidation in the banking industry has substantially reduced the pool of
high-quality demand feature and guarantee providers, and increased regulatory capital
requirements will likely further reduce the number of available providers in coming years. 1685
As discussed below, we do not believe that the removal of the twenty-five percent basket
for non-tax-exempt money market funds will cause money market funds to use lower credit
quality guarantors and demand feature providers or potentially reduce liquidity and flexibility for
money market funds, and if any such impact were to occur, we expect that it would be limited.
As noted above, the data analyzed in the DERA Guarantor Diversification Memo shows, among
other things, that most funds, especially non-tax-exempt money market funds, do not use the
twenty-five percent basket, and thus we believe that most money market funds will likely not be

Most of the commenters that opposed the removal of the twenty-five percent basket focused specifically on
the consequences for tax-exempt money market funds. We address their particular concerns regarding taxexempt money market funds below.

forced to use lower credit quality guarantors and demand feature providers. 1686 Under today’s
amendments, non-tax-exempt money market funds will not be required to include more than 10
guarantors or demand feature providers in their portfolios if each one maximized the 10%
diversification limit. DERA staff evaluated the exposure to guarantors and found that the top
five guarantor parents accounted for a combined total of 43% of the exposure across all money
market funds. DERA staff measured the credit risk for each guarantor by credit default swap
(CDS) spreads and composite credit ratings (NRSROs) and found that the credit quality of
guarantors among the top twenty guarantors is similar to that of the top five guarantors. 1687 Thus,
we believe that, if today’s amendments cause non-tax-exempt money market funds to include
additional guarantors or demand feature providers in the funds’ portfolios, there exists a supply
of guarantors and demand feature providers that have similar credit quality as the top five
guarantors used by funds. As such, we believe that, for non-tax-exempt money market funds that
are currently using the twenty-five percent basket, it is likely that these money market funds
would be able to use these additional guarantors and demand feature providers and will not be
forced to resort to low credit quality guarantors or demand feature providers because of the
amended rule.
A few commenters argued that composite credit ratings from NRSROs are not a reliable
standalone metric to assess credit quality. 1688 We agree. This is why the DERA memo also
assessed credit risk through CDS spreads, which are the market’s current assessment of a

532

guarantor’s future financial capacity to provide the necessary support. A few commenters also
argued that money market funds analyze the credit quality of guarantors using a variety of
factors other than CDS spreads and composite credit ratings. 1689 While we recognize that money
market funds’ internal analysis of the credit quality of guarantors and demand feature providers
might be different, we believe that using a combination of the objective factors, CDS spreads and
composite credit ratings, for the purpose of our staff’s analysis is an acceptable alternative to
conducting an individual credit risk analysis of guarantors and closely approximates the credit
risk of such guarantors and demand feature providers. Thus, after further review, we believe our
staff’s findings support the conclusion that, to the limited extent a money market fund may need
to engage new institutions as providers of guarantees and demand features, there will be a
sufficient supply of first tier guarantors in the market. We therefore believe that, even with a
10% guarantor limit for non-tax-exempt money market funds, any increase in guarantor
diversification should not lead to deterioration in credit quality.
ii. Tax-exempt money market funds
Although a number of commenters opposed the removal of the twenty-five percent basket
generally, many commenters specifically opposed the removal of the twenty-five percent basket
for tax-exempt money market funds, and single state money market funds in particular. 1690 Some
commenters argued that the twenty-five percent basket has not been the reason tax-exempt

Comment Letter; Vanguard Comment Letter; BlackRock II Comment Letter.

533

money market funds have experienced credit events in the past. 1691 For example, one commenter
argued that the twenty-five percent basket did not have an adverse impact on tax-exempt money
market funds and their shareholders and that significant disruptions should not justify removal of
the twenty-five percent basket for tax-exempt money market funds. 1692 However, as we
discussed in the Proposing Release, in 2008, the concentration of tax-exempt money market
funds in guarantee and demand feature providers led to considerable stress in the municipal
markets. 1693 During this time municipal issuers had to quickly find substitutes for demand
features on which they relied to shorten their securities’ maturities. 1694 In addition, at least one
provider of demand features and guarantees for many municipal securities held by money market
funds avoided bankruptcy in part due to substantial support received from various entities. 1695
We believe the risk that a money market fund faces in cases where the guarantor or demand
feature provider comes under significant strain is substantial and that possible external support is
unreliable in cases when guarantors or demand feature providers may become stressed. We
therefore continue to believe that it is appropriate to amend rule 2a-7 to enhance the
diversification requirements by reducing the twenty-five percent basket to a fifteen percent
basket, in order to limit a tax-exempt money market fund’s exposure to any one guarantor or
demand feature provider, thereby mitigating the risk the fund faces when it heavily relies on a

market funds weathered problems by relying on the credit of the underlying obligor or working with the
obligor to substitute another guarantor).

single guarantor or demand feature provider.
As discussed above and in the Proposing Release, when evaluating money market funds
in the aggregate, most money market funds do not use the twenty-five percent basket and those
funds that do use the twenty-five percent basket do not make significant use of it. 1696
Commenters, however, argued that tax-exempt money market funds in particular do regularly
rely on the twenty-five percent basket. 1697 For example, one commenter stated that as of June 30,
2013, 75% of municipal money market funds made use of the twenty-five percent basket. 1698
Another commenter noted that nine of the top 10 largest tax-exempt money market funds, which
represent approximately 40% of the tax-exempt money market fund assets, use the twenty-five
percent basket. 1699 As previously discussed, commenters noted that besides using a single
guarantor in the twenty-five percent basket, money market funds may also use two guarantors to
fill the twenty-five percent basket by having, for example, a 13% exposure to one guarantor and
a 12% exposure to another. 1700 The DERA Guarantor Diversification Memo found, as shown
above, that 10.8% and 2.6% of “single state funds” and “other tax-exempt funds” had at least one
guarantor above the 20% threshold as of November 2012, respectively. 1701 The DERA Guarantor
Diversification Memo also found that 30.6% and 7.7% of single state funds and other tax-exempt

535

funds had at least one guarantor above the 15% threshold as of November 2012, respectively. In
addition, the memo shows that 80.2% and 50.0% of single state and other tax-exempt funds had
at least one guarantor above the 10% threshold as of November 2012, respectively. 1702 DERA
staff’s findings are consistent with the data provided by the commenters above, which suggest
that tax-exempt money market funds use the twenty-five percent basket to a greater extent than
non-tax-exempt money market funds.
One commenter argued that although the DERA staff analysis demonstrates that most
tax-exempt money market funds use the twenty-five percent basket, the sample period (20102012) is not appropriate because there were no events during this time period that caused stress
on money market funds. 1703 We note, however, that another commenter stated that it was
beneficial for money market funds to have the flexibility of the twenty-five percent basket during
the Eurozone concerns in 2011, 1704 which occurred during our sample time period. As discussed
above, the data analyzed in the DERA Guarantor Diversification Memo shows that over the
course of two years, the use of the twenty-five percent basket remained steady and there was
minimal variability in the use of the basket over time, even when certain events during this time
period caused stress on money market funds. 1705
Many commenters expressed concern regarding the impact of the proposed removal of
the twenty-five percent basket for tax-exempt money market funds, and single state money
market funds in particular, due to the limited availability of demand feature providers and

536

guarantors for these types of funds. Commenters argued that the elimination of the twenty-five
percent basket would limit a tax-exempt money market fund’s flexibility to obtain greater
exposure to strong credit sources in times when high credit quality may be scarce. 1706 A number
of commenters also argued that the removal of the twenty-five percent basket will make it
difficult for tax-exempt money market funds to acquire sufficient liquid assets. 1707 Commenters
argued that there is a relatively narrow group of banks and other financial institutions that
provide much of the liquidity in the short-term municipal and TOB markets, 1708 and that single
state funds in particular have even fewer issuers available to them. 1709
One commenter stated that with a constrained supply of securities with diverse
guarantors, a twenty-five percent basket may actually allow a manager to reduce risk by avoiding
or reducing exposure to the relatively weakest guarantors. 1710 Some commenters also argued that
the twenty-five percent basket is an important tool that money market funds may use to
accommodate the variability and unpredictability of supply and demand in the municipal
market. 1711 We recognize commenters’ concerns regarding the proposed removal of the twentyfive percent basket for tax-exempt money market funds, and single state money market funds in

particular, due to the limited availability of demand feature providers and guarantors for these
types of funds. As noted above, we believe that requiring tax-exempt money market funds to
limit exposure to any one guarantor or demand feature provider while still providing tax-exempt
money market funds with a fifteen percent basket, will address many of the commenters’
concerns regarding the limited supply of demand feature providers and guarantors for tax-exempt
money market funds.
Several commenters suggested we reduce the twenty-five percent basket to a fifteen
percent basket for tax-exempt money market funds. 1712 One commenter stated that, although the
twenty-five percent basket may not have been heavily used recently by money market funds, the
availability of a basket would provide useful flexibility to money market funds on occasion. 1713
A second commenter argued that a fifteen percent basket would achieve the objective of
balancing diversification and flexibility, while reducing the potential for unintended
consequences. 1714 After further consideration, and in light of the data for tax-exempt money
market funds and commenters’ concerns and recommendations regarding the removal of the
basket for tax-exempt money market funds, we have decided to allow tax-exempt money market

1712

See, e.g., Goldman Sachs Comment Letter; Fidelity DERA Comment Letter. See also Schwab Comment
Letter (recommending that single state money market funds be allowed to continue using the twenty-five
percent basket except that within the basket no single guarantor or demand feature provider could represent
more than 15% of the fund’s assets). Some commenters suggested we reduce the twenty-five percent
basket to a fifteen percent basket for all money market funds (both tax-exempt funds and non-tax-exempt
funds). See Goldman Sachs Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter; Fidelity Comment Letter. See also
J.P. Morgan Comment Letter (recommending that instead of eliminating the basket, we mandate a
maximum guarantee and/or demand feature exposure that can be held within the basket in any one entity,
such as at a 15% cap).

538

funds, including single state funds, to rely on a fifteen percent basket, under which as much as
15% of the value of securities held in a tax-exempt money market fund’s portfolio may be
subject to guarantees or demand features from a single institution. Although eliminating the
basket for tax-exempt money market funds would reduce concentration risk by requiring taxexempt money market funds to lessen their exposure to a single guarantor or demand feature
provider, we are concerned that eliminating the basket entirely could cause these funds to invest
in weaker credits. We believe that a reduction of the twenty-five percent basket to a fifteen
percent basket for tax-exempt money market funds, which the DERA Guarantor Diversification
Memo shows use the basket more than non-tax-exempt money market funds, appropriately
addresses the concerns related to heavy concentration in a single guarantor or demand feature
provider as well as the concerns that eliminating the twenty-five percent basket for tax-exempt
money market funds could lead to an overall deterioration of credit quality or liquidity because
tax-exempt funds may have to obtain guarantees or demand features from less creditworthy
institutions due to a limited supply of guarantees and demand features.
We believe for several reasons that reducing the twenty-five percent basket to a fifteen
percent basket should not significantly restrict the ability of guarantors to fill the needed capacity
as the guarantors become more diversified. First, the data analyzed in the DERA Guarantor
Diversification Memo shows 0.5% and 0.2% of the guarantor’s dollars are excess dollars above
the 15% threshold when single state funds and other tax-exempt funds, respectively, are
considered separately in November 2012, meaning little if any additional capacity has to be

539

developed. 1715 Second, it is reasonable to expect that a reduction by one money market fund
(because its exposure to a particular guarantor is too high) could become a purchasing
opportunity for another money market fund whose exposure to a particular guarantor is below
the 15% threshold. Third, should any of the top guarantors listed in the DERA Guarantor
Diversification Memo choose to increase their capacity, this could become a purchasing
opportunity for a money market fund since the amount of excess dollars above the 15% threshold
is smaller than the amount needed for the remaining funds to reach the 10% or 15% threshold for
the same guarantor. Lastly, it is also reasonable to expect that if a reduction by any of the top
guarantors does occur, this could become an opportunity for another guarantor to step in. We
therefore believe that, although other tax-exempt funds and single state funds may currently use
the twenty-five percent basket to a higher degree than money market funds generally and may
face greater supply constraints than non-tax-exempt funds, because these funds will be permitted
to use a fifteen percent basket, any increase in guarantor diversification should not lead to
deterioration in credit quality and any negative effects for tax-exempt money market funds that
currently use the twenty-five percent basket will be minimal. 1716
A couple of commenters argued that VRDNs provide a significant source of liquidity for
money market funds and that the proposed removal of the twenty-five percent basket would
therefore have a negative impact on a fund’s ability to access liquidity through VRDNs. 1717 In

1715

See DERA Guarantor Diversification Memo, supra note 1665.

1716

See supra note 1665 and accompanying text (discussing level of assets and supply of providers).

1717

Legg Mason & Western Asset Comment Letter; Invesco Comment Letter. The interest rates on VRDNs
are typically reset either daily or every seven days. VRDNs include a demand feature that provides the
investor with the option to put the issue back to the trustee at a price of par value plus accrued interest.
This demand feature is supported by a liquidity facility such as letters of credit, lines of credit, or standby

540

addition, one of these commenters argued that the combination of regulatory requirements and
the diminishing number of financial guaranty companies and highly rated banks has significantly
reduced the number of entities offering credit support for VRDNs, 1718 noting that in late 2012,
tax-exempt money market funds had an average of 83% of total assets invested in VRDNs. 1719
As discussed in the Proposing Release, and as discussed further below, concerns about the
creditworthiness of guarantors and demand feature providers have reduced the amount of
VRDNs outstanding since 2010. 1720 We expect that reducing the twenty-five percent basket to a
fifteen percent basket instead of eliminating the basket will alleviate commenters’ concerns
regarding the availability of VRDNs. In addition, because the amount of outstanding VRDNs
and other short-term municipal debt has decreased 47% between 2008 and 2013, the top
guarantors will have some additional capacity built in should the overall demand for such
securities continue to decrease into the future. 1721 Rule 2a-7 restricts money market funds to

Additional economic analysis

Our diversification amendments, including (i) the amendment to require that money
market funds treat the sponsors of ABS as guarantors subject to rule 2a-7’s 10% diversification
limit applicable to guarantees and demand features, unless the money market fund’s board of
directors (or its delegate) determines that the fund is not relying on the sponsor’s financial
strength or its ability or willingness to provide liquidity, credit or other support to determine the
ABS’s quality or liquidity (“ABS amendment”) and (ii) the amendment to remove the twentyfive percent basket for money market funds other than tax-exempt money market funds and to
reduce to fifteen percent, rather than eliminate, the twenty-five percent basket for tax-exempt
money market funds, including single state money market funds (“twenty-five percent basket

MFP filings, using aggregate amortized values from November 2010 to December 2013, found that these
funds held approximately 71% in VRDNs and 18% in other municipal debt.

The Federal Reserve Board’s Flow of Funds of the United States provides the amount of municipal
securities held by money market funds and the overall market. It ranged from about $270 billion in 2002 to
a maximum of $520 billion in 2008 only to decline to approximately $305 billion by 2013. The decrease
shows that $215 billion ($520 - $305) or 39% exited the money market fund industry since the financial
crisis. One can closely approximate these money market fund holdings by summing the amount of
outstanding VRDNs (Source: Securities Market and Financial Markets Association website) with the
amount of outstanding short term municipal debt (Source: Federal Reserve Board’s Flow of Funds of the
United States), suggesting that money market funds hold nearly all the VRDNs and short-term municipal
debt. This sum has nearly halved from a high of $500 billion in 2008 to $265 billion in 2013. This
corresponds to a decrease of $235 billion, or 47%, of short term municipal debt and VRDNs money market
funds holdings. We note, as well, that the overall municipal debt market has absorbed these large money
market fund outflows, and, in fact, the overall municipal debt market has grown approximately $200 billion
during this same time period. See Federal Reserve Board, Flow of Funds of the United States, available at

amendment”), 1724 are designed to provide a number of benefits, as discussed in more detail
below. DERA staff’s review of data suggests that our ABS amendment and twenty-five percent
basket amendment (treating only ABCP sponsors as guarantors for purposes of this analysis) 1725
would have little impact on the majority of money market funds, which do not make use of the
twenty-five percent basket, and would likely have a minimal impact on those funds that do.
Because tax-exempt money market funds make greater use of the basket than non-tax-exempt
money market funds and may face greater constraints regarding the availability of demand
feature providers and guarantors, we have provided tax-exempt money market funds with the
ability to use a fifteen percent basket. DERA staff’s review of data suggests that the effect of our
twenty-five percent basket amendment on tax-exempt money market funds would thus also have
little impact on the majority of tax-exempt money market funds.
Based on the data analyzed in the DERA Guarantor Diversification Memo, our staff
found that approximately 131 funds, or 21.9% of all funds submitting Form N-MFP for
November 2012, reported that they made use of the twenty-five percent basket for guarantees
and demand features, even when we treat sponsors of ABCP as guarantors (and thus subject to a
10% diversification limitation). Thus, although a minority does use the twenty-five percent
basket, the majority of money market funds do not. Furthermore, money market funds as of

1724

See infra note 1660.

1725

Our staff assumed when reviewing the Form N-MFP data that any fully or partially supported ABCP
owned by a fund would result in the sponsor guaranteeing the ABCP. For this purpose, our staff
considered an ABCP conduit to be fully supported when the program’s investors are protected against asset
performance deterioration and primarily rely on the ABCP sponsor to provide credit, liquidity, or some
other form of support to ensure full and timely repayment of ABCP, and considered an ABCP conduit to be
partially supported when the ABCP sponsor, although not fully supporting the program, provided some
form of credit, liquidity, or other form of support. See also infra note 1726.

543

February 28, 2014, had invested 16.5% of their assets in ABS and securities subject to demand
features or guarantees, suggesting that issuers have a ready supply of money market fund
investors eligible to purchase their securities. The 131 funds that used the twenty-five percent
basket had, on average, $31.4 billion of their assets invested in excess of the 10% diversification
limitation we are adopting today (i.e., in the twenty-five percent basket) as of November
2012. 1726 Furthermore, data as of November 2012, shows that 98.9% of total money market fund
assets are not in funds’ twenty-five percent baskets. Thus, because most money market funds are
not using the twenty-five percent basket to gain high levels of exposure to any one particular
guarantor or demand feature provider and because a very high percentage of money market fund
assets are not in a twenty-five percent basket, we believe any negative effects for these non-taxexempt money market funds will generally be minimal. In addition, we believe that, if today’s
amendments cause non-tax-exempt money market funds to include additional guarantors or
demand feature providers in the funds’ portfolios, there exists a sufficient supply of guarantors
and demand feature providers.

1726

This estimate likely overstates the number of funds and the amount of money market funds’ assets that
could be affected by our ABS amendments for three reasons. First, it assumes that any fully or partially
supported ABCP owned by a fund would result in the sponsor guaranteeing the ABCP. Under our
amendments, however, an ABCP (or other ABS) sponsor would not be deemed to guarantee the ABCP if
the board (or its delegate) determines the fund is not relying on the sponsor’s financial strength or its ability
or willingness to provide support to determine the ABCP’s quality or liquidity. We did not assume
sponsors of other types of ABS guaranteed those ABS because we understand that other forms of ABS
offered to money market funds either do not typically have sponsor support or, if they are supported, the
support typically is in the form of a guarantee or demand feature, which would already be included in our
calculation of exposure to providers of demand features and guarantees. Second, Form N-MFP data does
not differentiate between funds that would have had exposure in excess of 10% upon the acquisition of a
demand feature or guarantee (which will not be permitted under our amendments) and those funds that
were under that level of exposure at the time of acquisition but the fund later decreased in size, increasing
the fund’s exposure above the 10% limit (which will be permitted under our amendments). Third, where a
fund owned securities issued by or subject to demand features or guarantees from affiliated institutions, we
treated the separate affiliated institutions as single institutions for purposes of these estimates.

544

As discussed above, and as addressed by certain commenters, we recognize that taxexempt money market funds, and in particular, single state tax-exempt money market funds, use
the twenty-five percent basket to a greater degree than other types of money market funds.
DERA staff found that approximately 128 tax-exempt funds, or 67.7% of all tax-exempt funds
submitting Form N-MFP for November 2012, made use of the twenty-five percent basket. For
single state funds, our staff found that approximately 89 single state funds, or 80.2% of single
state funds submitting Form N-MFP for November 2012 made use of the twenty-five percent
basket. However, tax-exempt money market funds, including single state funds, that do use the
twenty-five percent basket generally do not make significant use of it. The 128 tax-exempt
money market funds that used the twenty-five percent basket had, on average, 2.4% of their
assets invested in excess of the 10% diversification limitation we are adopting today (i.e., in the
twenty-five percent basket), and the 89 single state money market funds that used the twenty-five
percent basket had, on average, 0.5% of their assets invested in access of the 15% diversification
limitation as of November 2012. 1727 In addition, the 128 tax-exempt money market funds that
used the twenty-five percent basket had, on average, 0.3% of their assets invested in excess of
the 15% diversification limitation we are adopting today, and the 89 single state money market
funds that used the twenty-five percent basket had, on average, 0.5% of their assets invested in
excess of the 15% diversification limitation as of November 2012. 1728
Although we understand that non-tax-exempt money market funds, and tax-exempt
money market funds in particular, may have made greater use of the twenty-five percent basket

545

in the past (and might do so in the future if we fully retained the twenty-five percent basket), we
are concerned that funds were previously exposed to concentrated risks inconsistent with the
purposes of rule 2a-7’s diversification requirements as discussed above. We continue to believe
that amending rule 2a-7 to tighten diversification limits for securities subject to guarantees or
demand features from a single institution for both non-tax-exempt money market funds and taxexempt money market funds will mitigate some of the risk that a money market fund faces by
limiting a fund’s exposure to any one guarantor or demand feature provider.
The principal effect of the ABS amendment and twenty-five percent basket amendment
we are adopting today may be to restrain some managers of money market funds from being
heavily exposed to an individual ABS sponsor and from making use of the twenty-five percent
basket in the future, under perhaps different market conditions. 1729 Our diversification
amendments may deny fund managers some flexibility in managing fund portfolios and could
decrease fund yields. To assess our amendment’s effect on yield, our staff examined whether the
7-day gross yields of funds that use the twenty-five percent basket were higher than the 7-day
gross yields for those funds that do not. 1730 Our staff found: (i) for other tax-exempt funds, the
average yield for funds using the twenty-five percent basket was 0.0893% as compared to the

1729

One commenter suggested that compliance with our amendments would require it to reallocate or sell its
money market fund portfolio securities. See Fidelity Comment Letter (also suggesting that we extend our
nine-month implementation period for modifying the twenty-five percent basket due to the need for
additional time for transactions). However, funds with investments in excess of those permitted under the
revised rule are not required to sell the excess investments to come into compliance. The amendments
require a fund to calculate its exposure to issuers of demand features and guarantees as of the time the fund
acquires a demand feature or guarantee or a security directly issued by the issuer of the demand feature or
guarantee. See rules 2a-7(d)(3)(i) and (iii).

We assumed that any fully or partially supported ABCP owned by a fund would result in the sponsor
guaranteeing the ABCP. See supra note 1726.

average yield for other tax-exempt funds that did not use the twenty-five percent basket of
0.0987% and the average yield for funds using the twenty-five percent basket above the 15%
threshold was 0.0736% as compared to the average yield for other tax-exempt funds that either
did not use the twenty-five percent basket or used the twenty-five percent basket below the 15%
threshold of 0.0951%; (ii) for single state funds, the average yield for funds using the twenty-five
percent basket was 0.0886% as compared to the average yield for single state funds that did not
use the twenty-five percent basket of 0.0754% and the average yield for single state funds using
the twenty-five percent basket above the 15% threshold was 0.1075% as compared to the
average yield for singe state funds that either did not use the twenty-five percent basket or used
the twenty-five percent basket below the 15% threshold of 0.0790%; and (iii) for prime money
market funds, the average yield for funds using the twenty-five percent basket was 0.1740% as
compared to the average yield for prime money market funds that did not use the twenty-five
percent basket of 0.1875%. 1731 The prime money market fund yield differences may not, of
course, be caused by the use of the twenty-five percent basket, but may instead reflect the overall
risk tolerance of fund managers that take advantage of the twenty-five percent basket. In
addition, we acknowledge that the current low interest-rate environment may cause the yield
spread in each comparison above to be less than if we were measuring the yield spreads in a
higher interest rate environment.
We requested comment as to whether there would be a significant impact on fund yield,
and if so, how significant. Although commenters did not address the specific impact on fund
1731

These averages are derived from Form N-MFP data as of February 28, 2014, weighted by money market
funds’ assets under management.

547

yield, one commenter stated that our staff’s analysis assumed that funds could replace securities
guaranteed or subject to a demand feature in a twenty-five percent basket with the same
securities that were held by the funds that do not use the twenty-five percent basket, and
suggested that the elimination of the basket might therefore decrease both yield and liquidity of
tax-exempt funds.1732 We recognize that it is possible that one money market fund may not be
able to obtain the exact securities of another money market fund that is not currently relying on
the basket. However, as discussed above, our staff’s analysis shows that there exists a sufficient
supply of first tier guarantors in the market for funds to invest. Therefore, after further
consideration, we believe that the effect on yield, given the 7-day gross yields of funds that use
the twenty-five percent basket versus the 7-day gross yields for those funds that do not, will be
minimal.
Our twenty-five percent basket amendment requires non-tax-exempt money market funds
that use the twenty-five percent basket, and tax-exempt money market funds that use the twentyfive percent basket at levels above the fifteen percent threshold, or that would use it in the future,
to either not acquire certain demand features or guarantees (if the fund could not assume
additional exposure to the provider of the demand feature or guarantee) or to acquire them from
different institutions. Funds that choose the latter course could thereby increase demand for
providers of demand features and guarantees and increase competition among their providers. If
new entrants do not enter the market for demand features and guarantees in response to this
increased demand, reducing the twenty-five percent basket to a fifteen percent basket for tax-

1732

548

exempt money market funds, and removing the twenty-five percent basket for all other money
market funds, could result in money market funds acquiring guarantees and demand features
from lower quality providers than those the funds use today, although, as discussed above, we
expect such potential effect to be mitigated due to the available supply of first-tier guarantors and
demand feature providers that have similar credit quality as the top guarantors that are used by
funds. If new entrants do enter the market (or if current participants increase their participation),
the effect on money market funds would depend on whether these new entrants (or current
participants) are of high or low credit quality as compared to the providers money market funds
would use absent our amendments.
Our ABS amendment and twenty-five percent basket amendment also may increase the
costs of monitoring the credit risk of funds’ portfolios or make that monitoring less efficient, to
the extent they are more diversified under our amendments and money market fund advisers
must expend additional effort to monitor the credit risks posed by a greater number of guarantors
and demand feature providers. Although we cannot provide a point estimate of these costs, and
commenters did not provide us with any data that would assist us with a point estimate, we
expect that these costs would be included in our broader cost estimates as discussed above in
section III.I.1. A money market fund that could not acquire a particular guarantee or demand
feature under our amendments could, for example, be able to acquire a guarantee or demand
feature from another institution in which the fund already was invested, at no additional
monitoring costs to the fund.
Issuers also could incur costs if they were required to engage different providers of
demand features or guarantees under our amendments, which could negatively affect capital

549

formation. This could occur because an issuer might otherwise have sought a guarantee or
demand feature from a particular bank, but might choose not to use that bank because the money
market funds to which the issuer hoped to market its securities could not assume additional
exposure to the bank. If issuers were unable to receive demand features or guarantees from
banks (or other institutions) to which they would have turned absent our amendments, they
would have to engage different banks, which could make the offering process less efficient and
result in higher costs if the different banks charged higher rates. Issuers of securities with
guarantees or demand features (e.g., issuers of longer-term securities that can be sold to money
market funds only with a demand feature) also could be required to broaden their investor base
or seek out different providers of guarantees or demand features under our amendments, which
could make their offering process less efficient or more costly.
As discussed above, some commenters argued that single state funds in particular would
be negatively affected by the removal of the twenty-five percent basket. 1733 We believe that
providing single state funds a fifteen percent basket retains much of the flexibility for single state
funds to invest in securities subject to guarantees or demand features while also limiting the
extent to which a single state fund can become exposed to any one guarantor or demand feature
provider. Although our amendments reduce the twenty-five percent basket for all single state
funds, we are not changing the application of rule 2a-7’s 5% issuer limit to single state funds,
which today applies only to 75% of a single state fund’s total assets. 1734 We historically have

550

applied the issuer diversification limitation differently to single state funds, recognizing that
“single state funds face a limited choice of very high quality issuers in which to invest” and,
therefore, that there is a risk that “too stringent a diversification standard could result in a net
reduction in safety for certain single state funds.” 1735 The market for demand features and
guarantees, in contrast, is national for most single state funds and therefore may not be subject to
the same supply constraints as is the market for issuers in which single state funds may directly
invest. However, the market for demand features and guarantees for some single state funds is
not national. For example, the state of California through the California State Teachers
Retirement System is a guarantor for securities held in California municipal money market fund
portfolios as reported on Form N-MFP. Additional analysis of the data in the DERA Guarantor
Diversification Memo shows that 74% of the single state fund’s excess guarantees above the
15% threshold on average come from California municipal money market funds (39%), New
York municipal money market funds (24%), and Massachusetts municipal money market funds
(11%). All other state municipal money market funds account for 5% or less of the excess
guarantees dollars above the 15% threshold. As such, we would expect that in terms of the
amount of assets, California, New York, and Massachusetts may be affected more than other
states. However, as we discussed earlier, we expect the impact to be minimal since the amount
of excess guarantee dollars above the 15% threshold is less than 0.5% of the single state
guarantee dollars. 1736 This may be reduced further if other single state funds with guarantees

551

below the 10% and 15% threshold choose to increase their percent exposures to those guarantors
with excess exposure in other funds.
We do not expect that our ABS and twenty-five percent basket diversification
amendments will result in operational costs for funds. We understand that money market funds
generally have systems to monitor their exposures to guarantors (among other things) and to
monitor the funds’ compliance with rule 2a-7’s current 10% demand feature and guarantee
diversification limit. We expect that money market funds could use those systems to track
exposures to ABS sponsors under our amendments and could continue to track the funds’
compliance with a 10% demand feature and guarantee diversification limit. To the extent a
money market fund did have to modify its systems as a result of our ABS and twenty-five
percent basket diversification amendments, we expect that the money market fund would make
those modifications when modifying its systems in response to our amendments to require
money market funds to aggregate exposure to affiliated issuers for purposes of rule 2a-7’s 5%
diversification limit, for which we provide cost estimates above. 1737 Because the costs estimated
above are those associated with activities typically involved in making systems modifications,
we expect they also would cover any systems modifications associated with our ABS and
twenty-five percent basket diversification amendments.
In the Paperwork Reduction Act analysis in section IV.A.1 below, we identified certain
initial and ongoing hour burdens and associated time costs related to our diversification
amendments. Specifically, our ABS amendment requires that the board of directors adopt

1737

See supra note 1625 and accompanying text.

552

written procedures requiring periodic evaluation of any determinations made regarding instances
in which the fund is not relying on the ABS sponsor’s financial strength or its ability or
willingness to provide quality or liquidity. Furthermore, for a period of not less than three years
from the date when the evaluation was most recently made, the fund must preserve and maintain
in an easily accessible place a written record of the evaluation. These requirements are a
collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act, and are designed to help ensure
that the objectives of the diversification limitations are achieved. We estimate the one-time
burden to prepare and adopt these procedures will be 1,368 hours at $1,130,880 in total time
costs for all money market funds and we estimate that the annual burden would be approximately
608 burden hours and $842,080 in total time costs for all money market funds. We also note that
a board can delegate its responsibility to determine whether the fund is relying on the ABS
sponsor’s financial strength or its ability or willingness to provide quality or liquidity pursuant to
rule 2a-7. 1738 To the extent that a board delegates this responsibility, it may incur additional costs
related to its oversight of such a delegate, although we expect that any such additional costs
would be minimal.

Amendments to Stress Testing Requirements

We are adopting amendments to the stress testing requirements under rule 2a-7, with
modifications from the proposal in response to comments. Specifically, we are adopting reforms
to the current stress testing provisions that will require funds periodically to test their ability to
maintain weekly liquid assets of at least 10% and to minimize principal volatility1739 in response

1738

See rule 2a-7(j).

1739

Stable NAV funds will continue to be required to test their ability to maintain a stable NAV. See rule 2a-

to specified hypothetical events that include (i) increases in the level of short-term interest rates,
(ii) the downgrade or default of particular portfolio security positions, each representing various
exposures in a fund’s portfolio, and (iii) the widening of spreads in various sectors to which the
fund’s portfolio is exposed, each in combination with various increases in shareholder
redemptions. 1740 The fund adviser must report the results of such stress testing to the board,
including such information as may be reasonably necessary for the board of directors to evaluate
the stress testing results. 1741 We discuss these requirements and the modifications from the
proposal in further detail below.
1.

Overview of Current Stress Testing Requirements and Proposed
Amendments

The current stress testing requirements, adopted in 2010, require that the fund adopt
procedures providing for periodic testing of the fund’s ability to maintain a stable price per share
based on (but not limited to) certain hypothetical events. These hypothetical events include a
change in short-term interest rates, an increase in shareholder redemptions, a downgrade of or
default on portfolio securities, and the widening or narrowing of spreads between yields on an
appropriate benchmark selected by the fund for overnight interest rates and commercial paper
and other types of securities held by the fund. As we discussed in the Proposing Release, we
have monitored the stress testing requirement and how different fund groups have approached its
implementation in the marketplace. Through our staff’s examinations of money market fund

7(g)(8)(i). Additionally, as discussed below, we recognize that fund advisers and boards are more likely to
be concerned with, and the hypothetical events are focused on, downside volatility.
1740

1741

See rule 2a-7(g)(8)(ii).

554

stress testing procedures, we have observed disparities in the quality and comprehensiveness of
stress tests, the types of hypothetical circumstances tested, and the effectiveness of materials
produced by fund managers to explain the stress testing results to boards. For example, some
funds test for combinations of events, as well as for correlations between events and between
portfolio holdings, whereas others do not. As discussed in the proposal, we believe that an
evaluation of combinations of events and correlations among portfolio holdings is an important
part of a fund’s stress testing. 1742
We also noted in the proposal that we have had several opportunities to assess the
effectiveness of the stress testing requirements during periods of market stress, including the
2011 Eurozone debt crisis and the 2011 U.S. debt ceiling impasses. We further assessed the role
of stress testing in fund boards’ assessment of fund risks during the 2013 U.S. debt ceiling
impasse. Our staff has observed that funds that had strong stress testing procedures were able to
use the results of those tests to better manage their portfolios and better understand and minimize
the risks associated with these events. 1743
Finally, we also noted that, both with stable NAV and floating NAV funds, we believe
that stress testing the liquidity of money market funds could enhance a fund board’s
understanding of the risks to the fund related to periods of heavy shareholder redemptions and
could help the fund manage those risks. We also noted that from the staff’s review of stress
testing by funds, some funds already incorporate an analysis of their ability to maintain liquidity

1742

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at section III.L.

1743

Id.

555

in their stress tests. 1744
Considering this information and experience, the Commission proposed certain
modifications, enhancements, and clarifications to the current stress testing requirements in rule
2a-7 to strengthen the stress testing requirements. First, we added a proposed requirement for
each fund to stress test its ability to avoid having its weekly liquid assets fall below 15% of all
fund assets. Under the floating NAV alternative, we also proposed removing the requirement
that floating NAV funds test their ability to maintain a stable share price. Additionally, we
proposed certain enhancements and clarifications to the list of hypothetical events that funds
were required to include in their stress testing. Finally, we proposed to modify the requirements
to report results to the board, proposing an additional requirement that the fund adviser include
such information as may be reasonably necessary for the board of directors to evaluate the stress
testing. 1745
Comments on the proposed changes to the stress testing requirement were mixed. Some
commenters supported the proposed reforms to varying degrees. 1746 Others opposed them. 1747
Commenters who supported the reforms suggested that they will enable better management of
money market fund risk and help address run incentives by heightening board awareness of how

events can affect liquidity and share price. 1748 Commenters who opposed the reforms indicated
that they believed the current stress testing requirements were sufficient, and that the reforms
might be costly, difficult to implement, and provide unnecessary information to boards. 1749 Two
commenters believed that stress testing should not be required for floating NAV funds. 1750 Other
commenters believed that stress testing requirements should continue to apply to floating NAV
funds. 1751 These comments are discussed in more detail below.

As proposed, we are requiring money market funds to test their liquidity, but have
modified the threshold to require funds to test their ability to maintain 10% weekly liquid assets
from the 15% proposed. 1752 This change is consistent with the modification from the proposal
regarding the threshold of weekly liquid assets that will trigger a default liquidity fee. 1753 Several
commenters generally supported the proposed requirement that funds test their liquidity. 1754 One
commenter supported the proposal that funds test against the 15% threshold, and added that the

commenter already tests against multiple liquidity thresholds and will continue to do so. 1755
Another commenter argued that funds should be required to test against a more conservative
threshold, such as 20%, to allow funds to manage liquidity with “an eye toward a significant
buffer” against the liquidity threshold that would trigger fees and gates. 1756 Finally, one
commenter, although generally supportive of testing liquidity, suggested that rather than
requiring funds to test against a specific liquidity threshold, funds should analyze the impact of
specific hypothetical event scenarios on weekly liquidity and the fund’s NAV, even if such
events fall short of triggering a specific liquidity threshold. 1757
Several commenters, however, opposed the proposed requirement to have funds stress
test their liquidity. 1758 One commenter noted that it believed that testing liquidity would not be
particularly meaningful for funds, as it is not possible to predict what assets a fund would sell to
meet redemptions. 1759 This commenter also believed that testing liquidity in floating NAV funds
would serve no useful purpose because any losses on sales of securities to meet redemptions
would be reflected in the fund’s NAV. 1760 Several commenters believed that it was not feasible
for a fund to test “the magnitude of each hypothetical event that would cause” the fund to cross
the liquidity threshold, 1761 as the proposed rule would have required for reporting to the board. 1762

These commenters noted that, unlike stable share price, there was not a direct relationship
between a fund’s liquidity levels and the hypothetical events listed in the proposed rule, other
than shareholder redemptions. 1763 They believed that conducting such stress tests would
therefore require funds to make complex assumptions about how hypothetical events, such as an
interest rate increase, would affect the level of shareholder redemptions or a portfolio manager’s
decision to sell securities. 1764 As an alternative, commenters suggested that funds could calculate
the level of shareholder redemptions that, if satisfied using only weekly liquid assets, would
reduce the fund’s weekly liquid assets to 15%. 1765 Additionally, one commenter, although not
objecting to having funds stress test for liquidity maintenance generally, believed that the stress
tests as proposed were vague and qualitative in nature. 1766
We continue to believe that funds should assess their liquidity as part of the stress testing

and the deterioration of liquidity could spark redemptions. 1767 We agree. We also believe that
the benefits to testing liquidity will apply to floating NAV funds as well as stable NAV funds.
We believe that floating NAV funds need to understand what can place stress on liquidity,
regardless of the fact that losses from the sales of securities are reflected in a market-based NAV,
particularly in light of the potential for triggering a fee or gate. 1768 It is important for boards to
understand and be aware of what could cause a fund’s liquidity to deteriorate below certain
thresholds (or below a regulatory threshold) as this renders the fund less able to satisfy
redemptions through internal liquidity and thus increases the likelihood that satisfying future
redemptions will generate liquidity costs.
We disagree with the commenter that indicated that testing liquidity would not be
meaningful because it is not possible to predict what assets would be sold to meet
redemptions. 1769 As discussed below, we have made several modifications to the proposed rule
in response to comments to reduce the number and complexity of assumptions that funds will
need to make. We recognize that funds still need to make certain assumptions in their stress
testing. In particular, when testing the effect of an increase in shareholder redemptions, funds
will have to make assumptions regarding which assets are sold to meet such redemptions. We
believe, however, that the stress testing requirements that we are adopting today will still be
helpful to a board’s understanding of a fund’s liquidity and the events that can make it
deteriorate, even when it includes some assumptions. In support of this belief that such testing

1767

1768

1769

Id.

560

can be useful to funds, we note that some commenters indicated that they already stress test
liquidity, even though it is not currently required. 1770 Additionally, as we discuss below, we
believe that a disclosure and discussion of the assumptions that fund managers made when
developing stress testing can increase the board’s understanding of the stress testing results, and
how the results might differ if different assumptions are used.
Regarding the commenters that noted that there was not a direct relationship between a
fund’s liquidity levels and the hypothetical events listed in the rule, we recognize that many of
the hypothetical events in the rule do not have a direct effect on liquidity. We did not intend to
require funds to make complex assumptions regarding how the hypothetical events listed in the
proposed rule would affect redemption levels and therefore liquidity. In response to the concerns
that these commenters raised, and as discussed further below, we have modified the stress testing
requirements so that each hypothetical event listed in the amendments is tested assuming varying
levels of shareholder redemptions. We are not requiring the fund to test, for example, how a
change in interest rates or credit spreads by itself affects a fund’s level of weekly liquid assets,
but rather how increases in redemptions combined with the effect of specific hypothetical events,
like a change in interest rates or credit spreads, may affect fund liquidity. It should also simplify
the implementation of the requirement by not requiring the fund to make potentially complex or
speculative assumptions about how an increase in interest rates or deterioration in portfolio credit
quality will affect shareholder redemptions, and thereby affect liquidity, a concern that was
raised by commenters. 1771 We believe this measure, in addition to modifications to the proposed
1770

See BlackRock II Comment Letter; Dreyfus Comment Letter.

1771

See Federated VIII Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter.

561

hypothetical events discussed below, addresses the concern of the commenter that did not object
to testing liquidity in principle but believed that the proposed hypothetical events made the stress
testing requirements vague and qualitative in nature. Finally, as discussed further below, we are
eliminating the proposed requirement that funds report the “magnitude of each hypothetical
event” that would cause the fund to fall below the liquidity threshold. This change from the
proposal responds to commenters’ concerns that making such a determination is not feasible. 1772
As noted above, we are requiring funds to test against a 10% weekly liquid assets
threshold. We have chosen the 10% weekly liquid assets threshold because it is the same
threshold that will trigger a default liquidity fee absent board action under the final amendments.
Much like the inability to maintain a stable price, the triggering of a default fee absent board
action under our fees and gates reform may result in consequences for a fund and its
shareholders. Requiring funds to stress test their ability to avoid falling below this threshold
should help inform boards and fund managers of the circumstances that could cause a fund to
trigger a default liquidity fee and provide them a tool to help avoid doing so. We considered
setting the required threshold at a more conservative level, in particular 30%, because this
threshold is the level of weekly liquid assets that funds are required to maintain and the level
below which fund directors will be permitted to impose a discretionary fee or gate. We believe,
however, that fund directors would benefit most from understanding the events that could place
such stress on a fund’s liquidity that it would trigger a liquidity fee, absent board action.
Although we believe funds would also benefit from testing the ability to maintain higher

1772

Id.

562

liquidity thresholds, 1773 we are sensitive to the potential costs of requiring funds to stress test
against multiple liquidity thresholds, and have therefore chosen to set the liquidity threshold for
required testing at the lower 10% threshold. Nonetheless, we encourage funds to consider testing
multiple liquidity thresholds, particularly up to and including the 30% threshold, and to consider
more generally the effects of hypothetical events and combinations of those events on liquidity.
b.

Principal Volatility

In addition to requiring funds to test their liquidity against, at minimum, specified
hypothetical events, we are requiring funds to test their ability to minimize principal volatility. 1774
Funds are currently required to test their ability to maintain a stable NAV. In the Proposing
Release, we proposed replacing this requirement for floating NAV funds with a requirement to
test their ability to maintain weekly liquid assets, and proposed requiring stable NAV funds to
test their ability to maintain both a certain level of liquidity and a stable share price. 1775 In the
Proposing Release, however, we recognized that there might be other metrics that could be used
in stress testing. Specifically, we requested comment on whether to require floating NAV funds
to test their ability to meet an investment objective, avoid losses or minimize principal
volatility. 1776
In response, several commenters argued that floating NAV funds should continue to test

1773

See BlackRock II Comment Letter (noting that it stress tests against other weekly thresholds it deems
appropriate); Fidelity Comment Letter (noting that testing the effects of events on liquidity and share price
can be useful to boards even if the event “is not of sufficient magnitude to cause the MFF to violate” a
threshold).

563

their NAV stability. 1777 These commenters pointed out investors in floating NAV funds will
continue to expect a relatively stable NAV. 1778 Additionally, commenters argued that the stress
testing requirements should not differ between floating NAV and fixed NAV funds. 1779 As we
noted above, two commenters did not believe that stress testing requirements should apply to
floating NAV funds. 1780 One such commenter argued that testing for floating NAV funds was
not necessary because a floating NAV already provides optimal price transparency. 1781
We agree with commenters that believed floating NAV funds should test their NAV
stability. We believe that money market funds, regardless of whether they have a floating NAV
or maintain a stable NAV, will continue to strive to minimize principal volatility to maintain a
stable share price. In times of market stress, funds could face challenges in limiting principal
volatility, and we believe that funds and fund boards would benefit from stress testing to help
them understand the potential pressures on principal stability, as the current requirements do
today. We have therefore modified the proposed rule to require a fund to test both its ability to
maintain liquidity and its ability to minimize principal volatility based on specified hypothetical
events. We have determined not to set specific limitations or thresholds against which funds

1777

NAV); Fidelity Comment Letter (same); MSCI Comment Letter (noting that even with a floating NAV,

Comment Letter is discussed above in the discussion regarding the use of liquidity as a metric in stress
testing.

564

should test principal volatility. Unlike stable NAV funds, which have a clear threshold, we do
not believe that there is single measure of what level of volatility investors in floating NAV
funds will tolerate. This measure might differ among floating NAV funds, depending on, for
example, investor composition. Accordingly, we believe that funds and fund boards are best
suited to determining the amount of principal volatility that investors in their floating NAV funds
will likely tolerate and, accordingly, what volatility threshold or thresholds should be used in
their stress testing.
We have chosen to use the term “minimize principal volatility” rather than “maintain a
stable share price” to clarify this requirement applies regardless of whether the fund has a
floating or a stable NAV, and believe that this metric is consistent with the comments
submitted. 1782 We believe, based on comments, that funds would generally approach this
requirement similar to how they today test the ability to maintain a stable share price although, as
discussed above, funds will need to determine what volatility threshold or thresholds they believe
are appropriate to test against. 1783 We have chosen to use the metric of minimizing volatility,
rather than avoiding losses because certain investors in floating NAV funds might demand
overall price stability, and therefore some floating NAV funds might determine that it is
appropriate to consider both upward and downward price pressures when developing stress

1782

See BlackRock II Comment Letter (noting that it believes that investors in a floating NAV fund will expect
the fund to have a “relatively stable NAV”); MSCI Comment Letter (noting that it is unlikely that investors
in floating NAV funds will accept NAV fluctuations outside of a very small band, and that there will be
some form of a “valuation tipping point”)

1783

See State Street Comment Letter (noting that it currently offers stress testing to liquidity funds with a
floating NAV, including the ability for a floating NAV to avoid losses greater than 25 or 50 basis points,
and that these tests are “relatively simple” modifications to the stable NAV tests).

565

tests. 1784
We have retained the requirement that stable NAV funds test their ability to maintain a
stable share price. Although we do not anticipate that stable NAV funds would approach this
additional requirement in a way that differs much, if at all, from a test to minimize principal
volatility, it clarifies that stable NAV funds are required to test the ability of the fund to avoid
breaking the buck.
The Commission believes that requiring funds to test against both the level of weekly
liquid assets and principal volatility is appropriate. Several commenters similarly supported
testing both liquidity and principal stability. 1785 Although we recognize that requiring testing
against both metrics could require more tests than requiring testing against one metric, we
believe that testing for both metrics justifies the additional burden of more tests. As commenters
pointed out, principal stability and minimizing price volatility are two primary objectives of
money market funds. 1786 Additionally, we believe that principal stability and liquidity are
interrelated. In particular, we agree with a commenter that pointed out that, in times of market
stress, a fund could experience (i) less price stability, resulting from a decline in liquidity or in an
attempt to maintain adequate liquidity, or (ii) less liquidity, resulting from a decline in price

1784

Although we recognize that upward price pressures might be a relevant metric to stress test for some funds,
we also recognize that funds will generally be more concerned with downward price pressures.
Accordingly, we do not interpret the requirement to test the ability to minimize principal volatility to
require funds, as a matter of course, to test against upward price movements. This is consistent with staff’s
clarification of the stress testing rules adopted in 2010 that funds did not have to stress test against
“breaking the buck on the upside.” See Staff Responses to Questions about Money Market Fund Reform,
August 7, 2012, available at http://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/guidance/mmfreform-imqa.htm.

stability or an attempt to maintain price stability. 1787 We therefore believe boards should
understand the range of events that could place stress on liquidity, principal stability or both, and
that stress testing both liquidity and volatility will increase such understanding.
3.

Hypothetical Events Used in Stress Testing

The Commission is also adopting modifications to the hypothetical events that funds use
in stress testing. As discussed further below, we have modified these events from the Proposing
Release to address commenter concerns about the potential complexity of testing for some of the
proposed hypothetical events, while still enhancing stress tests to incorporate correlations
between securities and combinations of events. In response to commenters’ concerns, we have
modified the rule text to clarify the number and extent of tests that the rule requires.
As discussed above, we proposed improvements to stress testing in the Proposing Release
because we believed that certain enhancements and clarifications to the hypothetical events
currently used in stress testing were necessary to improve the minimum quality of the stress
testing by some funds. The proposed enhancements included requiring the funds to consider
factors such as correlations among securities returns and various combinations of events in their
stress tests, an assessment of how a fund would meet increasing shareholder redemptions (taking
into consideration assumptions regarding the liquidity and price of portfolio securities), and both
parallel and non-parallel shifts in the yield curve.
Some commenters generally supported the proposed enhancements. 1788 Several

1787

See Fidelity Comment Letter.

1788

See, e.g., MSCI Comment Letter; TIAA-CREF Comment Letter.

567

commenters opposed or expressed concerns about the proposed enhancements. 1789 Specifically,
some commenters argued that the enhancements would not allow funds to retain flexibility to
tailor stress tests to the fund. 1790 Some commenters expressed concerns that the proposed
enhancements would increase the burden, expense, and complexity of stress testing. 1791 Some
commenters believed that the proposed enhancements were too vague. 1792 Commenters
expressed concerns that the proposed requirements to test for combinations of events and other
events made the rule unclear about what events must be tested and the extent of testing necessary
to comply with the proposed requirements, with some commenters arguing that the proposed rule
required potentially endless numbers of tests. 1793
In particular, some commenters believed that the proposed enhancements would require
funds to make unrealistic assessments about the liquidity and price of securities that a fund might
sell to meet redemptions, and assessments about how an adverse event in one portfolio security
might affect other portfolio securities. Commenters argued that these requirements might require
significant assumptions that would be difficult to make and that could render the results not
useful to boards. 1794

1794

See, e.g., Schwab Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter; Federated VIII Comment Letter; Dreyfus

568

The Commission disagrees with commenters who argued that modifications to
hypothetical events will reduce funds’ flexibility in developing stress tests. 1795 First, the
requirements we are adopting today still leave the specific parameters of the hypothetical events
to the fund’s discretion. Furthermore, the hypothetical events specified in the rule are not a
comprehensive list of the hypothetical events that funds may stress test, but a minimum set. As
discussed below, the rule requires a fund adviser to include additional combinations of events
that the fund adviser deems relevant.
We are, however, persuaded by commenters that some of the proposed enhancements
might require funds to make complex behavioral assumptions that might not be realistic and that
might ultimately reduce the utility of stress testing to fund boards. We also recognize that, as
proposed, some of the hypothetical events were vague and might be difficult to implement.
Finally, we also are sensitive to the potential burdens that administering a large number of stress
tests with complex assumptions can place on funds and their boards, a point raised by
commenters. To address these concerns, and as discussed below, we have modified the proposed
enhancements to specify certain minimum hypothetical events that funds are required to
incorporate in their testing. We believe that the proposed requirements reflected four primary
areas of risk that can place stress on funds. Those are (i) an increase in the general level of
short-term interest rates, (ii) a downgrade or default of a portfolio security position, (iii) a
correlated increase in the credit spreads for certain portfolio securities, and (iv) an increase in

Letter.

569

shareholder redemptions. 1796 We have therefore modified the hypothetical events that funds must
use in stress testing so that they focus on these risks and eliminated several of the elements in the
proposed rule within those areas of risk that commenters argued would require the most complex
and unrealistic assumptions. As discussed further below, each fund is required to test each of the
first three events in combination with increasing shareholder redemptions, which we believe will
allow funds to focus on the most important combination of events that will provide the most
meaningful results to boards, while reducing the number of combinations of events that the rule
requires as a minimum set for stress testing.
a.

Interest Rate Increases

Funds are currently required to stress test for a change in short-term interest rates. We
proposed modifying this requirement so that funds would only need to test for increases in the
general level of short-term interest rates, making clear that funds did not have to test for
decreases in short-term interest rates. We received no comments on this aspect of the proposal,
and we are adopting the modifications as proposed. 1797
Second, we proposed to add a hypothetical event for funds to test, namely “[o]ther
movements in interest rates that may affect fund portfolio securities, such as parallel and nonparallel shifts in the yield curve.” Commenters expressed concerns with this requirement. First,
commenters noted that testing for non-parallel shifts in the yield curve would be unlikely to yield
1796

See ICI Comment Letter (noting that the rule should only require tests for spreads in the yield curve; an
increase in the spread of non-Treasury securities over the yield curve, redemptions, and a downgrade or
default of a significant issuer and/or provider of demand features and guarantees); Fidelity Comment Letter
(suggesting standardized scenarios with combinations of interest rate increases, yield spread shocks across
a sector of portfolio securities, a credit event of an issuer of a portfolio securities, and shareholder
redemptions).

See rule 2a-7(g)(8)(i)(A).

570

results that are any more informative than carefully chosen parallel shifts in the yield curve, yet
incorporating this factor into stress testing would require significantly more effort. 1798 Another
commenter noted that this requirement was vague and open-ended, as there are an infinite
number of non-parallel interest rate movements. 1799
We are not adopting the proposed requirement to test for “[o]ther movements in interest
rates that may affect fund portfolio securities, such as parallel and non-parallel shifts in the yield
curve.” We are persuaded by commenters’ concerns that incorporating non-parallel shifts in the
yield curve will require funds to expend effort determining the types of shifts to test for, with
little more benefit than testing for parallel shifts in the yield curve, and that testing for parallel
shifts in the yield curve is encompassed by the requirement to test for general increases in the
level of short-term interest rates. 1800
b.

Credit events

Funds currently are required to test for a downgrade of or default on portfolio
securities. 1801 We proposed to enhance this requirement by requiring that funds test for a
“downgrade or default of portfolio securities and the effects these events could have on other
securities held by the fund.” As discussed in the Proposing Release, we had proposed this
requirement to ensure that funds consider portfolio correlations when stress testing. Commenters
expressed concerns about the proposed enhancement, arguing that the requirement was vague

1800

test for general increases in short-term interest rates).

571

and qualitative in nature because the fund would have to make assumptions about the event that
led to the downgrade or default, resulting in stress testing results that might not be meaningful to
its board. 1802 We were persuaded by commenters of the potentially speculative nature of the
proposed requirement and that, as a result, the proposed requirement might not provide
meaningful information to boards about the correlation of portfolio securities, which was the
intent of the proposed requirement. We have therefore determined not to require funds to
incorporate in their testing the effect of a downgrade or default of one security on the price of
other securities in the portfolio. We also believe that eliminating this proposed requirement will
reduce the burden of the stress testing requirements relative to the proposed requirements. 1803
After reviewing the comments, we have modified the requirement from what was
proposed. Specifically, we are requiring that funds test for “a downgrade or default of particular
portfolio security positions, each representing various portions of the fund’s portfolio (with
varying assumptions about the resulting loss in the value of the security)….” The current rule
requires, and the proposed rule would have continued to require, that funds stress test for the
downgrade or default on more than one portfolio security (i.e., they are required to test for a
downgrade or default of portfolio securities). Commenters suggested that the rule could require
funds to stress test a particular portfolio security, such as the most significant individual credit

1802

See, e.g., Dreyfus Comment Letter; see also ICI Comment Letter (noting that a stress test can assume a
downgrade or default without making any assumptions about what caused it, but cannot assess what other
portfolio securities might be correlated to the downgrade or default without some basis for assuming the
adverse event that led to the downgrade or default).

1803

See ICI Comment Letter (noting the time and cost that would need to be incurred in developing highly
sophisticated stress tests that the commenter believed would be required to incorporate this requirement).

572

risk to the fund, measured by the size of the holding, the likelihood of default or both, 1804 or the
“median” portfolio security. 1805
Rather than have the rule define which securities in the portfolio to test, we believe that it
is appropriate for the adviser to make a determination of which security positions, representing
different portions of the portfolio, would be most informative to the board to test for a
downgrade or default of an issuer. We believe the most appropriate security to test for a
hypothetical default will vary among funds depending on several factors, including the
composition of the fund’s portfolio and contemporaneous market events. The fund could
determine that it should test a security that represents the single biggest credit risk in the
portfolio and a security that represents a “median” exposure, like commenters suggested, or it
could include securities representing different levels of exposure.
Although the rule we are adopting gives funds general discretion when making the
determination of which securities to test, we do believe it is appropriate to require funds to select
particular security positions representing varying, i.e., different, portions of the portfolio when
making such determinations, so that the fund’s adviser and its board can better compare the
differing results to the fund depending on the security that is tested. Tests of the hypothetical
downgrade or default of a portfolio security representing the largest credit risk to the fund and of
a portfolio security representing a median exposure, for example, allows a board to see how the
results from these stress tests differ, and therefore better understand that a downgrade or default
of different securities will have different impacts on the fund.
1804

573

Finally, although we are not requiring funds to assume that any particular event is
causing the hypothetical downgrade or default, funds may want to consider incorporating in this
stress test, as appropriate, a deterioration in the credit quality of a guarantor (or provider of
demand features) of portfolio securities, as suggested by one commenter. 1806 This type of
scenario might be particularly relevant for funds in which a single entity is a guarantor or
provider of a demand feature for a high concentration of portfolio securities.
After reviewing the comments, the Commission is also modifying the rule to require that
funds make varying assumptions about the resulting loss in the value of the security when testing
for a downgrade or default of a portfolio security. The Commission notes that a downgrade or
default of a portfolio security does not always have a uniform effect on the price of a security. In
some cases, the downgrade or default could cause almost a complete loss on that portfolio
security. 1807 In other cases, the loss on the security might be less, potentially even substantially
less. 1808
As with the size of the portfolio position of an issuer that has a downgrade or default, the
impact on a fund of a downgrade or default of a portfolio security may vary substantially
depending on the size of the loss that the downgrade or default causes. 1809 Accordingly, we

1806

See ICI Comment Letter (arguing that funds should be required to stress test a “downgrade or default of a
significant issuer and/or provider of demand feature and guarantees).

1807

For example, according to filings submitted to us pursuant to temporary rule 30b1-6T, money market
funds’ holdings of securities issued by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. or its affiliates were typically valued
at approximately 17% of their amortized cost value in 2009.

1808

For example, according to filings submitted to us pursuant to temporary rule 30b1-6T, money market
funds’ holdings of securities issued by structured investment vehicle were typically valued at
approximately 50% of their amortized cost value in 2009.

1809

A comparison of commenters’ discussion of stress testing a downgrade or default of a portfolio security
illustrates that the effect of a downgrade or default can differ substantially, and thereby have substantially

574

believe that it is appropriate to require stress testing to include varying assumptions on the
amount of loss on a security as a result of a downgrade or default so that boards better
understand how the amount of loss of a portfolio security will affect the fund overall. 1810 It can
also help boards understand when pricing pressures on certain securities are unlikely to have a
significant impact on the fund. For example, during the debt ceiling impasse of 2013, staff
observed through discussions with fund advisers that although yields on certain Treasury bills
increased and some funds holding these Treasury bills experienced some increase in
redemptions, there was very little effect on the shadow price of Treasury or government money
market funds. Stress testing can illustrate these effects.
c.

Credit spread increase in portfolio sectors

We proposed requiring that funds test for the “widening or narrowing of spreads among
the indexes to which interest rates of portfolio securities are tied” in order to require funds to test
for changes in spreads that may affect specific asset classes. One commenter supported the
proposed requirement, noting that testing for asset class spreads can provide information about a
fund’s exposure to investor flights that have occurred in the past, such as in asset-backed
commercial paper and European financials. 1811 One commenter suggested that funds be required

different effects on the fund. Compare Dreyfus Comment Letter (“We also know that a single default of a
1% position…in a MMF can break the buck.”) with Fidelity Comment Letter (showing the results of stress
testing the effect on a hypothetical fund of a credit event resulting in a 10% loss on the portfolio security,
which does not cause the hypothetical fund’s NAV per share to drop below $0.9950).
1810

As with the requirement that funds test for a downgrade or default of particular portfolio security positions
representing various portions of the fund’s portfolio, we believe it is efficient for funds to make the
determination of the appropriate magnitudes of loss to incorporate in stress testing, as that decision will
vary depending on several factors, including, for example, historical information on losses on similar
securities following a downgrade or default.

to test for a change in spreads by testing for a parallel increase in the spread of non-Treasury
securities over the Treasury yield curve, assuming a perfect correlation in the price movement,
regardless of issuer or maturity, which would show the board the “worst case scenario” for yield
spread changes. 1812 Another commenter suggested that a test for changes in yield spreads that
would require the fund to test for a yield spread shift in a “typical portfolio sector,” which it
described as a sector (i.e., a logically related subset of holdings) representing the median
exposure in the portfolio among all defined sectors. 1813 This commenter also noted that its
suggested approach would incorporate into stress testing a test for correlated price movements
among portfolio securities.
In response to these comments, we are modifying the proposed requirement to require
funds to test for “a widening of spreads compared to the indexes to which portfolio securities are
tied in various sectors of a fund portfolio (in which a ‘sector’ is a logically related subset of
portfolio securities, such as securities of issuers in similar or related industries or geographic
region, or securities of a similar security type).” 1814 As discussed above and in the Proposing
Release, the Commission believes that it is important for funds to stress test for potential
correlations in the price movements of related securities. That is because an event that affects
the price of one security may also affect the prices of securities of similarly situated issuers or
asset classes. We believe, as one commenter suggested, that testing for a correlated shift in the
yield spread among logically related securities (i.e., sectors) will illustrate the impact on funds of

1812

1814

See rule 2a-7(g)(8)(i)(C).

576

a concurrent price shift among portfolio securities representing, for example, a similar industry,
similar geographic region, or security type. 1815 We understand that some money market funds
today use such assumed sectors in their stress testing.
To implement this requirement, funds should generally group securities into logically
related categories, or sectors, such as securities of a similar industry, similar geographic region
or security type (such as asset-backed commercial paper or variable rate demand notes), and then
test for the impact of yield spread changes on various sectors. For example, a fund with
concentrations of securities in a particular geographic region, such as Europe, could test a
correlated spread shift among those securities, and perhaps even test a correlated shift of
securities from a single country or group of countries that are experiencing or have experienced
stress, such as during the 2011 Eurozone debt crisis. We also believe that it could be helpful to
boards to include in the required report, discussed below, a summary of the sector composition
and the concentration of that sector within the portfolio as part of the assessment of stress testing.
We are not further specifying how funds should define sectors or which sectors funds
should test for a yield spread change, such as requiring funds to test a “typical” or “median”
sector, as suggested by one commenter. 1816 We believe that such determinations are appropriate
to leave to the fund’s discretion because such determinations will vary among funds depending
on several factors, including the composition of the fund’s portfolio and contemporaneous
market events. We are not adopting the suggestion of one commenter that funds test for a perfect
1815

See Fidelity Comment Letter (suggesting that the stress testing requirements include standardized yield
shift spreads of a logically related subset of holdings); MSCI Comment Letter (supporting stress testing
requirements that focus on, among other things, stresses on spreads in asset classes, such as asset-backed
commercial paper or European financials).

1816

See Fidelity Comment Letter.

577

correlation of spreads in all non-Treasury securities to show funds the “worst case scenario” of a
spread shift. 1817 This suggested test would not provide information about potential correlations
among similarly situated securities. For example, the suggested test would not provide any
information about how an adverse event in a particular industry in which the fund held portfolio
securities might affect the fund. We believe that testing a spread of different sectors of a
portfolio, will help the board better understand the composition of the fund portfolio and
potential correlations among portfolio securities.
Additionally, in the Proposing Release, we proposed to require funds to test for
combinations of events that the adviser deemed relevant, “assuming a positive correlation of risk
factors…and taking into consideration the extent to which portfolio securities are correlated such
that adverse events affecting a given security are likely to also affect one or more other securities
(e.g., a consideration of whether issuers in the same or related industries or geographic regions
would be affected by adverse events affecting issuers in the same industry or geographic
region).” This proposed requirement was intended to have stress testing include an evaluation of
the effect that hypothetical events on issuers that operate in a similar industry, are based in a
similar geographic region, or have other related attributes. Commenters expressed concerns
about this proposed requirement, arguing that it would be difficult to implement because it
required complex or speculative assumptions about the effects of adverse events. 1818
We believe that the requirement that we are adopting of an assumed correlated yield shift
in specific sectors of portfolio securities provides funds and boards information about the effect
1817

See ICI Comment Letter.

1818

See ICI Comment Letter; Federated VIII Comment Letter.

578

of correlated price movements among similar securities in a simpler and less burdensome way
than the proposed requirement of taking into consideration correlations among securities.
Because the requirement allows funds to assume a perfectly correlated change in spreads among
similarly situated securities, funds will not be required to make assumptions about how adverse
events affect prices of these securities. Accordingly, although we are requiring some
combinations of events, as discussed below, we are not adopting the requirement that fund
advisers “assum[e] a positive correlation of risk factors…and “tak[e] into consideration the
extent to which the fund’s portfolio securities are correlated….” when considering whether to
test for additional events.
d.

Shareholder redemptions

The fourth hypothetical event identified by the Commission and commenters that is
important to include in stress testing is shareholder redemption levels. As noted above, however,
rather than requiring funds to consider shareholder redemptions in isolation, as is currently
required and would have been required under the proposed rule, we are requiring that funds test
for various levels of shareholder redemptions in combination with each of the three other
required hypothetical events, i.e., an increase in interest rates, a downgrade or default of various
portfolio securities, and a yield spread change in various sectors of portfolio securities.
As discussed in the Proposing Release, the Commission believes that testing for
combinations of events can help funds better understand risks to the fund, and therefore included
in the proposed rule a requirement that the fund test for combinations of events that the adviser
deems relevant. Although the Commission did not include in the proposed rule any specific
combinations of events, the Commission requested comment on whether specific combinations

579

of events should be required in the rule, noting in particular the possibility of combining an
increase in shareholder redemptions with an increase in interest rates or a downgrade of a
portfolio security. 1819
Generally, redemptions, by themselves, are unlikely to create stress on a fund as long as
the market for the fund’s portfolio securities is liquid and interest rates remain unchanged. 1820
Similarly, an increase in interest rates, if no shareholders redeem from the fund until the
securities affected by the interest rate shift mature, should have no price impact on the fund. 1821
It is the combination of events—and particularly an interest rate or credit event combined with
redemptions—that most typically can create fund stress. 1822 We also believe combinations of
events are more likely to be realistic scenarios than market events or increases in redemptions in
isolation (e.g., it is reasonable to expect that a money market fund that experiences a significant
credit event may also experience a subsequent increase in redemptions). 1823 We are not including

1819

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at section III.L.

1820

Prices of fixed income securities typically remain stable if interest rates do not change. Thus, shareholder
redemptions that require funds to sell securities should have no effect on funds’ NAVs as long as interest
rates have not changed. We note that redemptions from a stable value money market fund have no impact
on the fund’s market-based NAV per share as long as the NAV per share is $1.00.

1821

Prices of fixed income securities typically fall when interest rates rise. Thus funds that must sell fixed
income securities before maturity are likely to realize capital losses if interest rates have risen. If instead
funds hold securities to maturity, they receive securities’ par value and should realize no losses. Thus,
interest rates increases that are not accompanied by securities sales to meet redemption requests should not
cause funds to incur capital losses.

1822

See Fidelity Comment Letter (illustrating the effect on liquidity and NAV on increasing shareholder
redemptions in combination with each of an (i) interest rate increase, (ii) a credit event, and (iii) a spread
shift).

1823

See State Street Comment Letter (noting that stress testing combinations of events is important because
stress events do not typically happen in isolation, and suggesting the Commission consider the combination
of shareholder redemptions in combination with increases in interest rates, a downgrade or default, and
credit spreads).

580

in the rule the redemption levels that funds must include in stress testing. 1824 We believe that the
appropriate level of redemptions to test will vary among funds, and will depend, for example, on
the composition of funds’ investor bases and shareholder redemption preferences, as well as
historical redemption activity in the fund.
We also proposed to require that funds incorporate in stress testing an assessment of how
a fund would meet redemptions, taking into consideration factors such as the liquidity and
pricing of the fund’s portfolio securities. One commenter supported this proposed requirement,
but noted that liquidity data regarding fund portfolio securities transactions was scarce. 1825 Other
commenters expressed concerns that this requirement was vague and qualitative, and would
require detailed and sophisticated assumptions. 1826 We were persuaded by commenters’
concerns that the proposed requirement could require complex assumptions to implement for
which data might not be readily available, particularly the requirement that the fund take into
account the liquidity and pricing of the fund’s portfolio securities. We have therefore not
adopted this requirement to simplify, and thereby reduce the potential burden of, the stress
testing requirements relative to the proposal.
We note, however, that funds need to make some basic assumptions about how a fund
obtains cash for redemptions to satisfy the new stress testing requirements relating to the fund’s
level of weekly liquid assets. In doing so, a fund could use a variety of assumptions. For

1824

See Fidelity Comment Letter (suggesting standard scenarios including redemption levels of 0%, 25%, and
50%).

1825

See MSCI Comment Letter.

1826

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter (expressing concerns about how to fulfill this requirement); Dreyfus
Comment Letter (same).

581

example, some commenters suggested that funds assume that all redemptions are satisfied first
using weekly liquid assets. 1827 This assumption would provide conservative stress test results
given that it would have the most dramatic effect on a fund’s level of weekly liquid assets. On
the other hand, some funds may prefer to assume in their stress tests other methods of meeting
shareholder redemptions (or may prefer to show how the stress tests results would differ if this
assumption were varied). For example, a fund might assume that redemptions are met with a
combination of weekly liquid assets and sales of portfolio securities. 1828 The rule does not
specify what assumptions the fund must make, leaving that to the discretion of fund advisers
because we believe the determination of which assumptions are most appropriate will vary
among funds, depending on, for example, how funds have satisfied redemptions historically, and
the composition of the fund’s portfolio. The rule requires, however, that the fund’s adviser
include a summary of the significant assumptions made when performing the stress test. For
example, such assumptions may include how redemptions are satisfied and the size of any
“haircut” that the fund assumed in the sale of portfolio securities in order to meet redemptions.
e.

Other combinations of events

The proposed rule would have required funds to test for “combinations of these and any
other events that the adviser deems relevant…” 1829 We have made clarifying edits to the rule we

1827

See ICI Comment Letter; Federated VIII Comment Letter.

1828

See Fidelity Letter (illustrating a stress test that includes the assumption that sales of non-liquid assets to
meet redemptions incur a cost); MSCI Comment Letter (noting that to the extent that a redemption scenario
would require the fund to sell securities, then the fund should make some assumption regarding a liquidity
haircut, but that only simple assumptions can be reasonably expected).

1829

See proposed rule 2a-7(g)(7)(i)(F) (Floating NAV Alternative or Fees and Gates Alternative). The full
proposed requirement was “Combinations of these and any other events the adviser deems relevant,
assuming a positive correlation of risk factors (e.g., assuming that a security default likely will be followed

582

are adopting today in response to some commenters who expressed concerns that the proposed
rule was open-ended and could be read to require that funds test for combinations of every event
listed in the rule. 1830 Specifically, we are requiring funds to test for “[a]ny additional
combinations of events that the adviser deems relevant.” We believe that the modified language
clarifies that the fund is only required to test for additional combinations as the fund adviser
deems relevant, not for combinations of every permutation of the events listed in the rule.
The rule requires that fund advisers test for combinations of events that they deem
relevant. Although a fund adviser might determine that the three combinations of events
included in the rule are sufficient, there might be circumstances when a fund adviser believes it
is necessary to incorporate additional scenarios. For example, a fund adviser might believe that
it would be relevant for the board to understand the effect of a yield spread increase in a sector,
in combination with a downgrade of a portfolio security in that sector, particularly if that sector,
or an issuer within that sector, has historically experienced stress.
One commenter also argued that the requirement could be interpreted to mean that all
special risk assessments take the form of stress tests. 1831 This is not a requirement of the rule.
We agree with the commenters that stress tests are not the only method to communicate fund

by increased redemptions) and taking into consideration the extent to which the fund’s portfolio securities
are correlated such that adverse events affecting a given security are likely to also affect one or more other
securities (e.g., a consideration of whether issuers in the same or related industries or geographic regions
would be affected by adverse events affecting issuers in the same industry or geographic region).” We
discuss above why we are not adopting the proposed requirement that follows the clause “Combinations of
these any other events the adviser deems relevant.”
1830

See ICI Comment Letter; Federated VIII Comment Letter.

1831

583

risks to the board and that not every risk can be incorporated into a stress test. 1832 The rule does
not require the adviser to develop a stress test for every risk the fund faces, but requires the
adviser to consider whether stress testing for combinations of events not explicitly listed in the
rule might be relevant to the fund’s board. We believe stress testing should be used to help the
board understand the principal risks of the particular fund and the risks that reasonably
foreseeable stress events may place on the fund.
4.

Board Reporting Requirements

Funds are currently required to provide the board with a report of the results of stress
testing, which must include the dates of testing, the magnitude of each hypothetical event that
would cause a fund to “break the buck,” and an assessment of the fund’s ability to withstand
events that are reasonably likely to occur within the following year. We proposed modifications
to these reporting requirements. First, we proposed adding a requirement that the fund report to
the board the magnitude of each hypothetical event that would cause the fund to have invested
less than 15% of its total assets in weekly liquid assets. Second, we proposed requiring funds to
include in their assessment “such information as may reasonably be necessary for the board of
directors to evaluate the stress testing…and the results of the testing.”
We are adopting modifications to the proposed reporting requirements to boards
regarding stress testing in response to comments we received on the proposal. Specifically, we
are adopting a requirement that the board of directors be provided at its next annual meeting, or
sooner if appropriate, a report that includes the dates on which the testing was performed and an
assessment of the fund’s ability to maintain at least 10% in weekly liquid assets and to limit
1832

See ICI Comment Letter; Federated VIII Comment Letter.

584

principal volatility. 1833 As discussed above, some commenters had concerns that the proposed
requirement that funds report to the board the magnitude of each hypothetical event that would
cause the fund to have invested less than 15% in weekly liquid assets was not feasible. 1834 We
believe that requiring funds to provide an assessment of the fund’s ability to maintain liquidity,
rather than requiring the funds report a specific value for each hypothetical event, addresses such
concerns. We have also added the requirement for an assessment of the fund’s ability to
minimize principal volatility because, as discussed above, we have added this metric to the stress
testing requirements in response to comments. We believe that requiring funds to provide an
assessment of their ability to maintain liquidity and minimize principal volatility (and in the case
of stable NAV funds, to maintain a stable share price), rather than the more prescriptive
requirements proposed and that are in the rule currently, is also appropriate because we have
modified the rule so that each “hypothetical event” is a combination of two events. We want to
clarify that funds are not required to separately test for interest rate increases, a downgrade or
default, a spread shift, or shareholder redemptions in isolation. 1835
We understand that under the current requirements, many funds, in addition to reporting
the magnitude of each event that would cause the fund to “break the buck,” provide a table
showing how the fund’s shadow NAV is affected by different combinations of events and
different values. Some funds include information regarding, for example, the concentrations of
1833

See rule 2a-7(g)(8)(ii).

1834

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter; Federated II Comment Letter; Federated VIII Comment Letter.

1835

See ICI Comment Letter (noting that the stress testing requirements adopted in 2010, by requiring funds to
report the “magnitude of each hypothetical event” that would cause a fund to “break the buck,” required
funds to perform and report stress tests of each event in isolation, and noting that changing this requirement
would make it easier for boards to include combinations tests in the fund’s procedures).

585

several of the funds’ largest portfolio holdings, both by individual issuer and by sector, and of
historical redemptions rates, as points of reference. Several funds also include narratives to help
explain the results. In some instances, for example, fund advisers used the narrative to compare
results among funds or to explain results that they considered to be unusual. Some narratives
also assessed the likelihood of the hypothetical events. We are not including requirements for
any of these specific items in the rule because we recognize that there is no one set of factors that
will be relevant for all funds, but we believe these are examples of items that we encourage fund
advisers to consider when developing the required report assessing stress test results.
We are adopting as proposed the requirement that a fund’s adviser provide “such
information as may reasonably be necessary for the board of directors to evaluate the stress
testing conducted by the adviser and the results of the testing.” One commenter supported this
requirement, noting that it is a common practice to provide directors with information that helps
to place stress-testing results in context.1836 Some commenters opposed this requirement, arguing
that the provision of additional information could be burdensome for boards and would not
provide useful information to fund boards. 1837 We disagree. As we noted in the Proposing
Release, the staff’s examination of stress testing reports revealed disparities in the quality of
information regarding stress testing provided to fund boards. We believe that this requirement
will allow boards of directors to receive information that is useful for understanding and
interpreting stress testing results. We note that this requirement does not require a fund adviser
to provide the details and supporting information for every stress test that the fund administered.
1836

See ICI Comment Letter.

1837

See Dreyfus Comment Letter; SIFMA Comment Letter.

586

To the contrary, a thoughtful summary of stress testing results with sufficient context for
understanding the results may be preferable to providing details of every test. For example,
information about historical redemption activities, as mentioned above, and the fund’s investor
base could help boards evaluate the potential for shareholder redemptions at the levels that are
being tested. Additionally, information regarding any contemporaneous market stresses to
particular portfolio sectors could be helpful to a board’s consideration of stress testing results.
Finally, after considering comments regarding the assumptions that funds will need to
make in administering stress tests, 1838 the Commission has added a requirement that the adviser
include in the report a summary of the significant assumptions made when performing the stress
tests. As discussed above, we have, in response to comments, modified the required hypothetical
events from the proposal to reduce the number and complexity of the assumptions funds are
required to make. We recognize, however, that funds will need to make some basic assumptions
when conducting the stress tests. These assumptions would include, for example, how the fund
would satisfy shareholder redemptions (e.g., through weekly liquid assets or by selling certain
portfolio securities, including any assumption of haircuts such securities can be sold at) and the
amount of loss in value of a downgraded or defaulted portfolio security. We believe that having
a summary of such assumptions will help the board better understand the stress testing results,
and particularly the sensitivity of those results to given assumptions. We believe this
information will allow the board to better understand money market fund risk exposures, and

1838

See, e.g., Fidelity Comment Letter (including in its suggested stress testing an assumption regarding the
size of the loss on the sales of securities to meet redemption and the size of the loss on a portfolio security
when testing a hypothetical credit event); ICI Comment Letter (suggesting funds use an assumption that
redemptions are satisfied using weekly liquid assets).

587

thus allow it to provide more effective oversight of the fund and its adviser.
5.

Dodd-Frank Mandated Stress Testing

In the Proposing Release, we requested comment on certain aspects of money market
fund stress testing as it relates to our obligation under section 165(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act to
specify certain stress testing requirements for nonbank financial companies that have total
consolidated assets of more than $10 billion and are regulated by a primary federal financial
regulatory agency. 1839 Under this section of the Dodd-Frank Act, among other matters, we must
establish methodologies for the conduct of stress tests that shall provide for at least three
different sets of conditions, including baseline, adverse, and severely adverse. 1840 Two
commenters responded, noting that they did not believe that the scenarios currently published by
the Federal Reserve Board for stress testing under Dodd-Frank Act Section 165(i) would be an
effective means of stress testing for money market funds, because the Federal Reserve’s
scenarios are focused on long-term horizons, which do not have a direct causal link to
foreseeable changes in money market funds. 1841 Another commenter, however, expressed some

1839

For a definition of “nonbank financial companies” for these purposes, see Definition of “Predominantly
Engaged in Financial Activities” and “Significant” Nonbank Financial Company and Bank Holding
Company, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, [78 FR 20756 (April 5, 2013)].

1840

Under this section of the Dodd-Frank Act, we also must define the term “stress test” for purposes of that
section, establish the form and content of the report to the Federal Reserve Board and the Commission
regarding such stress testing, and require companies subject to this requirement to publish a summary of the
results of the required stress tests. We note that under this section of the Dodd-Frank Act, we must design
stress testing not just for certain money market funds, but also other types of funds and investment advisers
that we regulate and that meet the $10 billion total consolidated assets test.

1841

See Fidelity Comment Letter (noting that the Federal Reserve scenarios have at best an indirect causal link
to changes in a money market fund); MSCI Comment Letter (noting that the horizon for the Federal
Reserve’s stress scenarios is between one and two years, while the scenarios that are of concern to money
market funds are short-term, such as valuation shocks and rapid shareholder redemptions).

588

support for incorporating macroeconomic factors in money market fund stress tests. 1842 One
commenter made recommendations regarding the stress testing scenarios required under section
165(i), including scenarios involving the four hypothetical events in the stress testing rule
amendments we are adopting today, and stated that its recommendations would be an effective
means to evaluate risk in a money market fund portfolio. 1843
As discussed in the Proposing Release, we intend to engage in a separate
rulemaking to implement the requirements of Section 165(i) of the Dodd-Frank Act, including
determining appropriate baseline, adverse, and severely adverse scenarios for money market
funds and other funds and advisers with more than $10 billion in consolidated assets. 1844 In
proposing such stress testing for money market funds subject to these requirements, we expect to
consider the efficiencies that funds subject to these additional requirements will achieve if the
scenarios broadly are built off of the parameters set forth today.
6.

Economic Analysis

Our baseline for the economic analysis we discuss below is the current stress testing
requirements for money market funds. The costs and benefits, and effects on competition,
efficiency, and capital formation are measured in increments over the current stress testing
requirement baseline. The benefits, as well as the costs, of the stress test requirements will
depend in part on the extent to which funds already engage in stress tests that are similar to the

1842

See Santoro Comment Letter (noting that stress testing should align with existing stress testing
methodologies, and specifically macro market stress scenarios).

1843

Fidelity Comment Letter (noting that the standardized scenario that it proposed could serve as the “severely
adverse” conditions required by Section 165(i)(2)(C)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act).

1844

Proposing Release, supra note 25, at section III.L.

589

requirements. For example, although we are now requiring funds to test for increases in the
general level of short-term interest rates in combination with various levels of an increase in
shareholder redemptions, we understand that many funds already tested for increases in interest
rates in combination with shareholder redemptions.
The additional information generated from the amendments to the stress testing
requirements should provide several qualitative benefits to funds. Specifically, they should help
fund managers, advisers, and boards monitor, evaluate, and manage fund risk, and thus better
protect the fund and its investors from the adverse consequences that may result from falling
below the 10% weekly liquid assets threshold or failing to minimize principal volatility (or, in
the case of stable NAV funds, a stable share price). The magnitude of these qualitative benefits
are not easily quantified and will vary from fund to fund based on the extent to which funds are
already voluntarily conducting stress testing that meet the new requirements, as well as the
investor base and portfolios of each fund. We received no comments regarding how to quantify
such benefits.
In the Proposing Release, we stated that because funds are currently required to meet a
stress testing requirement, we did not anticipate significant additional costs to funds under the
proposed rule. Several commenters responded that they expected to incur increased costs as a
result of the changes. 1845 One commenter noted that it believed a majority of funds will need to

1845

See, e.g., SSGA Comment Letter (generally supporting stress testing by funds, but asking the Commission
to consider the benefits of the enhancements against the “substantial increase in costs” associated with the
proposed changes); State Street Comment Letter (noting that there will be both a development cost and ongoing operational costs); Schwab Comment Letter (noting that the proposal is costly); TIAA-CREF
Comment Letter (supporting the proposed requirement and acknowledging that they would require
operational changes that would require time and resources to implement).

590

change their stress testing procedures to some degree, specifically with respect to stress testing
liquidity levels. 1846 One commenter provided a quantitative estimate for some of the proposed
changes, estimating that required software changes to implement two of the proposed
requirements, not including costs to load data, run the tests, and analyze the results, would range
from $250,000 to $750,000. 1847 We note, however, that the estimate was based on an evaluation
of two of the hypothetical stress tests that we proposed, one of which the Commission has
determined not to adopt and the other which the Commission has modified and simplified
substantially.
We stated in the Proposing Release that we expected funds would use similar
hypothetical events when testing their ability to avoid falling below a liquidity threshold to those
events they use when stress testing their ability to maintain a stable price. We also understand
many funds already test for their ability to avoid falling below a 15% weekly liquid asset
threshold as part of their current stress tests. One commenter noted that it already tests against
the 15% liquidity threshold and other liquidity thresholds, and one commenter stated generally
that it already tests for liquidity maintenance, and neither commenter discussed the costs of
including liquidity metric in stress testing. 1848 Two commenters indicated that requiring funds to
add this liquidity metric to the stress testing requirements would impose new costs, but did not
provide quantitative estimates of the costs of adding a liquidity metric to the stress testing

of implementing proposed rule 2a-7(g)(7)(i)(E), concerning testing for parallel and non-parallel shifts in the

that the adviser deems relevant, assuming a positive correlation of risk factors…and taking into
consideration the extent to which the fund’s portfolio securities are correlated…”).

591

requirements. 1849 One commenter, which provides stress testing services to funds, noted that it
currently provides liquidity-related stress tests, but it did not currently provide a stress test that
tests a fund’s ability to avoid falling below a 15% liquidity asset threshold. 1850
After reviewing the comments, we believe that the amendments to the stress testing
requirements will impose some development and ongoing costs to funds, particularly the
requirement to test against a liquidity threshold. We believe that the costs will be lower for
funds that already include liquidity and combinations of events as part of their stress testing, as
some funds do. We understand from commenters, however, that even funds that currently
incorporate liquidity metric in their stress testing might need to modify their procedures to test
against the 10% threshold. 1851 We also recognize that funds, which currently are required to test
their ability to maintain a stable share price, will now be required to test the ability to minimize
principal volatility. We believe, based on our review of comments, that the costs of modifying
stress testing from the metric of maintaining a stable share price to the metric of minimizing
principal volatility will not be substantial. 1852 We recognize, however, that funds might incur
some costs in analyzing and determining the appropriate level of volatility against which to test.
Additionally, we believe there will be costs associated with stress testing the effect of the

1849

See Federated VIII Comment Letter; State Street Comment Letter (noting that the new requirement would
imposed both a development cost and on-going operational costs).

1850

See State Street Comment Letter. See also Federated VIII Comment Letter (noting that it contacted a
service provider of a risk management system, who indicated that the provider’s system could not test for
an ability to maintain weekly liquid assets at or above 15% of its total assets).

1851

See State Street Comment Letter (noting that it currently provides a range of liquidity related stress tests).

1852

See State Street Comment Letter (noting that it currently provides stress testing services to floating NAV
liquidity funds that include testing a fund’s ability to avoid losses of greater than 25 or 50 basis points, and
that this would entail “relatively simple modifications,” with no associated development costs).

592

hypothetical events that we are adopting. The extent of those costs will depend upon the extent
to which a fund currently tests for the requirements or would need to modify their stress testing
procedures and systems to add such tests. We understand that many funds already test for events
such as interest rate increases and credit events in combination with hypothetical increases in
shareholder redemptions. We also note that we have determined not to adopt several of the
hypothetical events that commenters indicated would require the most estimation or modeling. 1853
Finally, as the rule requires that a fund test for “any additional combinations of events that the
adviser deems relevant,” a fund might incur periodic costs for making such an assessment and, if
necessary, incorporating such additional tests in its stress testing.
In the Paperwork Reduction Act analysis in section IV.A.5 below, we identified certain
initial and ongoing hour burdens and associated time costs related to the collection of
information requirements for our stress testing amendments. As we discuss there in more detail,
our staff estimates that the amendments to stress testing associated with the requirement that
money market funds maintain a written copy of their stress testing procedures, and any
modifications thereto, and preserve for a period of not less than six years following the
replacement of such procedures with new procedures, the first two years in an easily accessible
place, would involve 51,428 burden hours, at an average one-time cost of $24.52 million for all
money market funds. In addition, our staff estimates that the amendments to stress testing
associated with the requirement that money market funds have written procedures that provide

1853

See, e.g., Fidelity Comment Letter (noting that the proposed requirement to test for non-parallel shifts in
the yield curve would require significantly more effort and analysis than testing for non-parallel shifts with
little benefit); ICI Comment Letter (noting that the proposed requirement to include assumptions as to how
the fund would sell portfolio securities to meet redemptions were sophisticated and complex assumptions).

593

for a report of the stress testing results to be presented to the board of directors at its next
regularly scheduled meeting (or sooner, if appropriate in light of the results) would create a total
annual burden for all money market funds of an additional 25,155 burden hours at a total time
cost of approximately $7.28 million.
We believe the new costs for stress testing will be so small as compared to the fund’s
overall operating expenses that any effect on competition would be insignificant. Although some
commenters believed the proposed requirements would impose new costs, commenters did not
indicate that such costs would have competitive effects. The new stress testing requirements
may increase allocative efficiency if the information it provides to the fund adviser, and board of
directors improves the fund adviser’s ability to manage the fund’s risk and the board’s oversight
of fund risk management. Some money market fund investors also may view the enhanced stress
testing requirements positively, which could marginally increase those investors’ demand for
money market funds and correspondingly the level of the funds’ investment in the short-term
financing markets. This in turn positively affects capital formation. We do not have the
information necessary to provide a reasonable estimate of the effects the amendments might have
on capital formation, because we do not know to what extent these changes would result in
increases or decreases in investments in money market funds or in money market funds’
allocation of investments among different types of short-term debt securities. No commenters
provided such information or discussed the potential effects of the proposed stress testing rule on
efficiency or capital formation.

Certain Macroeconomic Consequences of the New Amendments

In this section, as well as in sections III.A and III.B above, we analyze the

594

macroeconomic consequences of the primary reform amendments that require fees and gates
for all non-government funds and an additional floating NAV requirement for institutional
prime funds. We also examine, in conjunction with analyses in these preceding sections, the
effects that the amendments may have on efficiency, competition, and capital formation and
discuss the potential implications of the changes for money market fund investors, funds, and
the short-term financing markets. We note that we presented extensive economic analyses of
the specific benefits and costs associated with the amended rules in sections III.A.5 and III.B.8
above, as well as examined commenters’ specific evaluations of the proposed fees and gates
and floating NAV requirements. As such, we focus here on the specific macroeconomic effects
of the reforms on current money market funds and the impact of the reforms on efficiency,
competition, and capital formation. It is important to note that although a large number of
commenters supported our proposed fees and gates requirement for non-government funds, 1854
and some commenters supported our floating NAV requirement for institutional prime funds, 1855
many commenters opposed the combination of alternatives. 1856 The baseline for these analyses
(and all of our economic analysis in this Release) is money market fund investment and the
short-term financing markets as they exist today.
In earlier sections we discussed the specific benefits and costs associated with other
reforms adopted today, including the amended rules that increase portfolio and guarantor

diversification, enhance disclosure, and mandate stress testing. We discuss in these sections the
macroeconomic effects of the amendments, as well as their effects on efficiency, competition,
and capital formation. The specific operational costs of implementing the reforms are
discussed in each respective section.
We note that the reforms adopted today will affect the economy in a number of ways,
many of which are difficult, if not impossible to quantify. The effect of the reforms will depend
on investors’ choices among many investment alternatives, funds’ and competitors’ responses
to the reforms and to each other’s strategies, and many other factors in the larger economy. For
these reasons, many of the macroeconomic effects discussed here are unquantifiable. We
provide, however, ranges of possible outcomes where we can without being speculative and we
discuss effects qualitatively, as well. Much of the qualitative analysis of the reforms remains
similar to that presented in the Proposing Release. We note, however, that the magnitude of the
macroeconomic effects, both positive and negative, may be greater for funds that are subject to
both a floating NAV and fees and gates than the funds subject to just one type of reform. Many
commenters noted that the combination of reforms would have a greater impact than either
alternative alone. 1857
In the remaining portion of this section, we discuss in detail the likely macroeconomic
effects of our primary reforms and the effects that these amendments may have on efficiency,
competition, and capital formation. We first examine the effect of our amendments on
investors in money market funds. We then analyze the effect on the money market fund

industry and the short-term financing markets.
1.

Effect on Current Investors in Money Market Funds

As of February 28, 2014, money market funds had approximately $3.0 trillion in assets
under management. Of this $3.0 trillion, government money market funds had approximately
$959 billion in assets under management. 1858 Government money market funds will not be
required to comply with either fees and gates or floating NAV requirements. Because the
regulatory landscape for these funds will remain largely unchanged, we anticipate current
investors will likely remain invested in the funds.
Non-government funds, however, will be subject to fees and gates, and some investors
may shift their assets to government funds or other investment alternatives. Non-government
funds, which include prime and tax-exempt funds, held approximately $2.1 trillion in assets as of
February 28, 2014. Of this approximately $2.1 trillion, we estimate retail prime funds managed
approximately 33% of prime fund assets (not including tax-exempt funds) or $593 billion,
whereas retail tax-exempt funds managed 71% of tax-exempt fund assets or $197 billion of
assets, or $790 billion in total retail fund assets. 1859 The remaining funds are institutional prime
funds, which will be subject to an additional floating NAV requirement. We estimate that
institutional prime funds, other than tax-exempt funds, managed approximately 67% of prime

Based on Form N-MFP data as of February 28, 2014.

1859

Based on data from Form N-MFP and iMoneyNet data as of February 28, 2014. To estimate retail and
institutional segments for non-government funds, we used self-reported fund data from iMoneyNet as of
February 28, 2014 to estimate percentages for retail and institutional segments for each fund type. We then
multiplied the percentages times the total market size segments, as provided by Form N-MFP as of
February 28, 2014. We note the retail designation is self-reported and omnibus accounts in these funds
may include both individual and institutional beneficial owners. For these reasons, our estimates may
underestimate the number of funds with retail investors.

597

fund assets (not including tax-exempt fund assets) or $1.2 trillion in assets and institutional taxexempt funds managed 29% of tax-exempt funds assets or $82 billion, for a total of $1.269
trillion.1860 Consistent with these estimates, commenters noted that approximately 30% of taxexempt funds currently self-report as institutional funds. 1861
As noted in the Proposing Release, the Commission recognizes that imposing fees and
gates on non-government money market funds and an additional floating NAV requirement on
institutional prime funds will likely affect the willingness of investors to commit capital to
certain money market funds. On the one hand, the fees and gates requirements will have little
effect on funds and their investors except during times of fund distress. During such
exceptional times, investors, especially investors who are unlikely to redeem shares, may view
the fees and gates requirements as protecting them from incurring costs from heavy shareholder
redemptions and improving their funds’ ability to manage and mitigate potential contagion
from such redemptions. Likewise, some, but not all, investors in institutional prime funds may
view the floating NAV requirement as reducing their funds’ susceptibility to heavy investor
redemptions and minimizing shareholder dilution. We believe the amendments more generally
will increase funds’ resiliency and treat investors more equitably than the rules do today.
Further, one commenter pointed out that floating NAV money market funds will likely offer
higher returns than stable NAV government money market funds, and thus will continue to

1860

Our staff’s analysis, based on iMoneyNet data, shows that the amount of municipal money market fund
assets held by institutional investors varied between 25% to 43% between 2001 to 2013.

598

attract investment. 1862 This commenter argued that institutional investors are unlikely to
reallocate assets from floating NAV institutional prime funds because they will continue to be
one of the most conservative and flexible investment alternatives, even with a floating NAV. 1863
Finally, this commenter contended that investor education may improve investor confidence in
floating NAV money market funds, which could attract capital. 1864
On the other hand, we recognize many current investors in non-government funds,
especially institutions, may prefer products that offer guaranteed liquidity and a stable NAV
rather than non-government funds that will be subject to fees and gates and a floating NAV
requirement after the reforms. As we noted in the Proposing Release and in this Release, we
anticipate these investors will consider the tradeoffs involved with continuing to invest in the
money market funds that are subject to the new requirements. As discussed in section
III.A.1.c.iv above, several commenters noted and we concur that fees and gates might force
some investors to either abandon or severely restrict investment in affected money market
funds. 1865 Likewise, commenters expressed concern that investors would migrate away from
institutional prime funds because a floating NAV would eliminate the stable value feature that
currently makes money market funds attractive to many shareholders. 1866 As discussed in detail

in section III.B.1 above, and noted by commenters, 1867 unlike most investment products, money
market funds are generally used as cash management tools, and a floating NAV may curtail the
ability of some investors to use money market funds for cash management purposes. Investors
also may be prohibited by board-approved guidelines, internal policies, or other restrictions
from investing in products that do not have a stable value per share. 1868 A floating NAV also
could drive investors with a more limited loss tolerance away from money market funds. 1869
The Commission acknowledges, and many commenters concur, 1870 that, as a result of our
reforms, some investors may reallocate assets to either government money market funds or other
investment alternatives. We do not anticipate our reforms will have a substantial effect on the
total amount of capital invested, although investors may reallocate assets among investment
alternatives, potentially affecting issuers and the short-term financing markets, which we discuss
below.
As noted earlier in this section, retail investors owned approximately $790 billion of
assets in non-government money market funds as of February 28, 2014. Under the reforms,
money market funds that qualify as retail funds may continue to offer a stable value as they do

today—and facilitate their stable price by use of amortized cost valuation and/or penny-rounding
pricing of their portfolios. We anticipate few investors in retail funds will reallocate assets to
other investment choices, given that retail funds will continue to offer price stability, yield, and
liquidity in all but exceptional circumstances. We are defining a retail money market fund to
mean a money market fund that has policies and procedures reasonably designed to limit all
beneficial owners of the fund to natural persons. 1871 We expect, however, that at least some
investors who are natural persons that currently are invested in non-government funds that are
not designated retail may reallocate their assets to retail funds. We anticipate these investors will
likely move to retail funds that have investment objectives that are similar to the objectives of
their current funds.
Institutions invested approximately $1.27 trillion in non-government money market funds
as of February 28, 2014. Of this $1.27 trillion, institutional prime funds, other than tax-exempt
funds, managed approximately $1.19 trillion in assets and institutional tax-exempt funds
managed $82 billion. Under the reforms, these funds will be subject not only to fees and gates,
but also to an additional floating NAV requirement. As such, we believe as much as $1.269
trillion in assets could be at risk for being reallocated to government funds and other investment
alternatives.
But as discussed below, neither the Commission nor most commenters believe that all
institutional investors in non-government funds will reallocate their assets. Institutional prime
funds typically offer higher yields than government funds, and certain investors receive tax
1871

See rule 2a-7(a)(25). “Beneficial ownership” typically means having voting and/or investment power. See
supra note 679.

601

advantages from investing in tax-exempt funds. In addition, we have been informed that, today,
the Treasury Department and the IRS will propose new regulations and issue a revenue
procedure that we believe should remove the most significant tax-related impediments associated
with our floating NAV reform. 1872 Additionally, the Commission, which has authority to set
accounting standards, has clarified that an investment in a floating NAV money market fund
generally meets the definition of a “cash equivalent.” 1873 And according to one commenter, more
than half of survey respondents indicated the likelihood of using a floating NAV money market
fund would increase if such a fund’s shares are considered cash equivalents for accounting
purposes. 1874 Thus, we believe these factors and actions taken by the Commission and other
regulatory agencies should help preserve the attractiveness of institutional prime funds to
investors, perhaps reducing the assets reallocated to alternatives.
As noted by several commenters, it is difficult to estimate the amount of assets that
institutional investors might reallocate from non-government funds to either government funds
or other investment alternatives. 1875 One commenter estimated that 64% or $806 billion could
shift from prime funds to government funds, 1876 whereas another commenter estimated that 25%
of assets in its institutional prime funds would transfer permanently into government funds. 1877 A
1872

See supra section III.B.6.

1873

As discussed in detail in section III.B.6.b, many investors questioned whether an investment in a floating
NAV money market fund would meet the definition of a “cash equivalent.”

third commenter estimated a shift in assets of between $500 billion and $1 trillion. 1878 In an
earlier letter, this commenter cited a survey of institutional investors that estimates investors may
withdraw between $660 and $750 billion from money market funds if the Commission adopts a
floating NAV requirement because they cannot tolerate principal volatility. 1879 As with much of
the survey evidence provided by commenters, 1880 however, we note that this survey was
administered before the Proposing Release and before the tax and accounting relief that we are
discussing today was known. For example, the survey, which was administered between
February 13, 2012 and March 6, 2012, did not consider that government funds might not be
subject to the fees, gates, and floating NAV requirements, 1881 and retail money market funds
might continue to maintain a stable price. Similarly, the survey designers did not present to
survey participants the possibility that the Treasury Department and IRS would propose new
regulations and issue a revenue procedure that we believe will remove the most significant taxrelated impediments associated with a floating NAV reform. 1882 Moreover, survey designers
were not able to anticipate that the Commission, which has authority to set accounting standards,

Federated X Comment Letter. Federated concludes, “…at a minimum, $660 to $750 billion would be
driven from institutional prime funds…” We note, however, the cited survey queries institutional
respondents about money market funds generally and does not reflect that government funds are not be
subject to the floating NAV requirement. In addition, the survey did not address fees and gates.

1880

A number of commenters cited survey data indicating that organizations would reduce their use of money
market funds under either our floating NAV or liquidity fees and gates reform. See, e.g., ICI Comment
Letter (citing the 2013 AFP Liquidity Survey, Association of Financial Professionals, 2013 AFP Liquidity
Survey: Report of Survey Results (June 2013)); Wells Fargo Comment Letter; Northern Trust Comment

would clarify that an investment in a floating NAV money market fund would meet the
definition of a “cash equivalent.” For these and other reasons herein, we believe that the survey
data submitted by commenters reflecting that certain investors expect to reduce or eliminate their
money market fund investments under the floating NAV alternative may overstate how investors
are likely to actually behave under the final amendments that we are adopting today. 1883
The Commission recognizes, however, that some assets will likely flow out of nongovernment funds as a result of the reforms, and that the greatest effect will likely be on
institutional prime funds. Commenters specifically noted that a combination of proposals
would force most money market fund sponsors to exit the prime space, 1884 and would cause
many investors to invest their cash assets in government money market funds, direct
investments, bank deposits, or other investment alternatives. 1885 As discussed in the DERA
Study, 1886 the Proposing Release, 1887 and below, there are a range of investment alternatives that
currently compete with money market funds. Each of these choices involves different
tradeoffs, and money market fund investors that are unwilling or unable to invest in their

would actually result from instituting a floating NAV. [. . . .] The move to a floating NAV does not alter
the fundamental attributes of money market funds with respect to the type, quality, and liquidity of the
investments in the fund. [. . . .] It is therefore unrealistic to think that money market funds . . . will become
extinct solely as a result of a move to a more accurate and transparent valuation methodology.”); Comment

current option under the reforms would need to analyze the various tradeoffs associated with
each alternative. Specifically, investors could choose from among at least the following
alternatives: direct investments in money market instruments; money market funds that are not
subject to the reforms; bank deposit accounts; bank certificates of deposit; bank collective trust
funds; LGIPs; U.S. private funds; offshore money market funds; short-term investment funds
(“STIFs”); separately managed accounts; ultra-short bond funds; and short-duration exchangetraded funds (“ETFs”). 1888 The following table, taken from the DERA Study and Proposing

For purposes of this table, investment risks include exposure to interest rate and credit risks. The column also indicates the
general level of investment risk for the product compared with the baseline of prime money market funds and is generally a
premium above the risk-free or Treasury rate.
The table entries reflect average yields in a normal interest rate environment. Certain cash management products, such as
certificates of deposits (“CDs”) and demand deposits, may be able to offer rates above the baseline in a low interest rate
environment.
The current DI limit is $250,000 per owner for interest-bearing accounts. See Deposit Insurance Summary, Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), available at http://www.fdic.gov/deposit/deposits/.
Time deposits, or CDs, are subject to minimum early withdrawal penalties if funds are withdrawn within six days of the date
of deposit or within six days of the immediately preceding partial withdrawal. See 12 CFR 204.2(c)(1)(i). Many CDs are
also subject to early withdrawal penalties if withdrawn before maturity, although market forces, rather than federal
regulation, impose such penalties. CDs generally have specific fixed terms (e.g., one-, three-, or six-month terms), although
some banks offer customized CDs (e.g., with terms of seven days).
The vast majority of money market fund assets are held in U.S. and European money market funds. See Consultation Report
of the IOSCO Standing Committee 5 (Apr. 27, 2012) (“IOSCO SC5 Report”), at App. B, §§ 2.1 - 2.36 (in 2011, of the assets
invested in money market funds in IOSCO countries, approximately 61% were invested in U.S. money market funds and
32% were invested in European money market funds). Consequently, dollar-denominated European money market funds
may provide a limited offshore money market fund alternative to U.S. money market funds. Most European stable value
money market funds are a member of the Institutional Money Market Funds Association (“IMMFA”). According to
IMMFA, as of March 1, 2013, there were approximately $286 billion U.S. dollar-denominated IMMFA money market
funds. See www.immfa.org (this figure excludes accumulating NAV U.S. dollar-denominated money market funds). Like
U.S. money market funds, European short-term money market funds must have a dollar-weighted average maturity of no
more than 60 days and a dollar-weighted average life maturity of no more than 120 days, and their portfolio securities must
hold one of the two highest short-term credit ratings and have a maturity of no more than 397 days. However, unlike U.S.
money market funds, European short-term money market funds may either have a floating or fixed NAV. Compare
Common Definition of European Money Market Funds (Ref. CESR/10-049) with rule 2a-7.
Most European money market funds are subject to legislation governing Undertakings for Collective Investment in
Transferable Securities (“UCITS”), which also covers other collective investments. See, e.g., UCITS IV Directive, Article
84 (permitting a UCITS to, in accordance with applicable national law and its instruments of incorporation, temporarily
suspend redemption of its units); Articles L. 214-19 and L. 214-30 of the French Monetary and Financial Code (providing
that under exceptional circumstances and if the interests of the UCITS units holders so demand, UCITs may temporarily
suspend redemptions).
Section 7(d) of the Investment Company Act requires that any non-U.S. investment company that wishes to register as an
investment company in order to publicly offer its securities in the U.S. must first obtain an order from the SEC. To issue
such an order, the SEC must find that “by reason of special circumstances or arrangements, it is both legally and practically
feasible to enforce the provisions of [the Act against the non-U.S. fund,] and that the issuance of [the] order is otherwise
consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.” No European money market fund has received such an
order. European money market funds could be offered to U.S. investors privately on a very limited basis subject to certain
exclusions from investment company regulation under the Investment Company Act and certain exemptions from
registration under the Securities Act. U.S. investors purchasing non-U.S. funds in private offerings, however, may be
subject to potentially significant adverse tax implications. See, e.g., Internal Revenue Code of 1986 §§ 1291 through 1297.
Moreover, as a practical matter, and in view of the severe consequences of violating the Securities Act registration and
offering requirements, most European money market funds currently prohibit investment by U.S. Persons.
European money market funds may have a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity of up to six months and a dollarweighted average life maturity of up to 12 months that are significantly greater than are permitted for U.S. money market
funds. Compare Common Definition of European Money Market Funds (Ref. CESR/10-049) with rule 2a-7.
Private funds generally rely on one of two exclusions from investment company regulation by the Commission. Section
3(c)(1) of the Investment Company Act, in general, excludes from the definition of “investment company” funds whose
shares are beneficially owned by not more than 100 persons where the issuer does not make or propose to make a public
offering. Section 3(c) (7) of the Act places no limit on the number of holders of securities, as long as each is a “qualified
purchaser” (as that term is defined in section 2(a)(51) of the Act) when the securities are acquired and the issuer does not

make or propose to make a public offering. Most retail investors would not fall within the definition of “qualified
purchaser.” Moreover, such private funds also generally rely on the private offering exemption in section 4(2) of the
Securities Act or Securities Act rule 506 to avoid the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of Section 5 of the
Securities Act. Rule 506 establishes “safe harbor” criteria to meet the private offering exemption. The provision most often
relied upon by private funds under rule 506 exempts offerings made exclusively to “accredited investors” (as that term is
defined in rule 501(a) under the Securities Act). Most retail investors would not fall within the definition of “accredited
investor.” Offshore private funds also generally rely on one of the two non-exclusive safe harbors of Regulation S, an issuer
safe harbor and an offshore resale safe harbor. If one of the two is satisfied, an offshore private fund will not have to
register the offer and sale of its securities under the Securities Act. Specifically, rules 903(a) and 904(a) of Regulation S
provide that offers and sales must be made in “offshore transactions” and rule 902(h) provides that an offer or sale is made
in an “offshore transaction” if, among other conditions, the offer is not made to a person in the United States. Regulation S
is not available to offers and sales of securities issued by investment companies required to be registered, but not registered,
under the Investment Company Act. See Regulation S Preliminary Notes 3 and 4.
See id.
Collective investment funds include collective trust funds and common trust funds managed by banks or their trust
departments, both of which are a subset of short-term investment funds. For purposes of this table, short-term investment
funds are separately addressed.
Collective trust funds are generally limited to tax-qualified plans and government plans, while common trust funds are
generally limited to tax-qualified personal trusts and estates and trusts established by institutions.
STIFs are generally regulated by 12 CFR 9.18. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency recently reformed the rules
governing STIFs subject to their jurisdiction to impose similar requirements to those governing money market funds. See
Office of the Comptroller of Currency, Treasury, Short-Term Investment Funds [77 FR 61229 (Oct. 9, 2012)].
Regarding all items in this row of the table, LGIPs generally are structured to meet a particular investment objective. In most
cases, they are designed to serve as short-term investments for funds that may be needed by participants on a day-to-day or
near-term basis. These local government investment pools tend to emulate typical money market mutual funds in many
respects, particularly by maintaining a stable net asset value of $1.00 through investments in short-term securities. A few
local government investment pools are designed to provide the potential for greater returns through investment in longerterm securities for participants’ funds that may not be needed on a near-term basis. The value of shares in these local
government investment pools fluctuates depending upon the value of the underlying investments. Local government
investment pools limit the nature of underlying investments to those in which its participants are permitted to invest under
applicable state law. See http://www.msrb.org/Municipal-Bond-Market/About-Municipal-Securities/Local-GovernmentInvestment-Pools.aspx. Investors in local government investment pools may include counties, cities, public schools, and
similar public entities. See, e.g., The South Carolina Local Government Investment Pool Participant Procedures Manual,
available at http://www.treasurer.sc.gov/media/4755/The-South-Carolina-Local-Government-Investment-Pool-ParticipantProcedures-Manual.pdf.
Although the performance of an ETF is measured by its NAV, the price of an ETF for most shareholders is not determined
solely by its NAV, but by buyers and sellers on the open market, who may take into account the ETF’s NAV as well as other
factors.
Many separately managed accounts have investment minimums of $100,000 or more.
Depending on the nature and scope of their investments, these investors may also face risks stemming from a lack of
portfolio diversification.
Some money market fund instruments are only sold in large denominations or are only available to qualified institutional
buyers. See generally rule 144A under the Securities Act (17 CFR 230.144A(7)(a)(1)).

These investment options offer different combinations of price stability, risk exposure,
return, investor protections, and disclosure. For example, some current money market fund
investors, in particular bank trust departments and corporate trusts, may choose to manage their

608

cash themselves and, based on our understanding of institutional investor cash management
practices, many of these investors will invest directly in securities similar to those held by
money market funds today. According to one commenter, however, this strategy may create
additional burdens and risks for these investors, including having to acquire, retain, and monitor
the maturity of short-term investments. 1889 Any desire to self-manage cash will likely be
tempered by the expertise required to invest in a diversified portfolio of money market
securities directly and the costs of investing in those securities given the economies of scale that
will be lost when each investor has to conduct credit analysis itself for each investment (in
contrast to money market funds which are able to spread their credit analysis costs for each
security across their entire shareholder base). 1890 As such, we anticipate that direct investment
in securities similar to those held by money market funds today will be limited to investors with
large cash management requirements and active Treasury functions.
Alternatively, commenters suggested that some investors, especially investors in
institutional prime funds, will reallocate assets to government funds. 1891 Investors that shift their
assets from institutional prime funds to government money market funds will likely sacrifice
yield, 1892 but they will retain the principal stability and liquidity of their assets. To the extent that

management fee for a money market funds than to hire the internal staff to manage the investment of
cash.”).

1892

See, e.g., Federated X Comment Letter; Angel Comment Letter. Commenters noted that investors that shift
assets from prime funds to government funds will earn lower rates on their investments because

609

assets under management in government funds increase, we anticipate investors will have more
government funds from which to choose than they do today. This expected increase in the
number government funds could be because complexes that currently offer government funds
will offer additional government funds or because other complexes will offer new government
funds. In either case, competition among government funds should increase although the impact
on competition likely should, at the margin, be larger if new complexes enter the government
fund market.
In addition, a reallocation of assets to government funds could lower the yields received
by both investors in government funds and direct purchasers of government securities. If an
increase in demand for government funds, which must largely invest in eligible government
securities, subsequently increases the demand for these securities, 1893 the rates on eligible
government securities and hence yields on government funds might fall. 1894 Several
commenters argued that absorbing assets from non-government funds into government funds
could reduce yields on eligible government securities in what is already a low yield
environment. 1895 The extent to which asset reallocation affects yields on government funds,
however, will depend on the amount of capital that shifts into government funds and on the
government funds are less risky and offer lower yields than prime funds.
1893

Government money market funds must invest at least 99.5 percent of their portfolio in cash, “government
securities” as defined in section 2(a)(16) of the Act, and repurchase agreements collateralized with
government securities. See rule 2a-7(a)(16). Allowable securities include securities issued by governmentsponsored entities such as the Federal Home Loan Banks, government repurchase agreements, and those
issued by other ‘‘instrumentalities’’ of the U.S. government. It excludes, however, securities issued by
state and municipal governments, which do not generally share the same credit and liquidity traits as U.S.
government securities.

supply of eligible government securities to meet heightened demand for these securities by
government funds. We discuss these issues in further detail below.
As noted above, commenters indicated that some investors that currently invest in nongovernment funds may shift assets into demand deposits or short-maturity certificates of
deposit. FDIC insurance that covers deposit accounts (which include checking and savings
accounts, money market deposit accounts, and certificates of deposit) guarantees principal
stability within the insurance limits and in certain instances liquidity irrespective of market
conditions. 1896 We noted in the Proposing Release that some institutions may be deterred from
moving their investments from money market funds to banks, because their assets in many
cases may be above the current depository insurance limits; assets above the limits would be
exposed to counterparty and sector-specific risks that are different and less attractive than the
risk profiles of diversified non-government money market funds today. 1897 Nevertheless, these
investors may gain full insurance coverage if they are willing and able to break their cash
holdings into sufficiently small pieces and spread them across banks, but doing so may impose

1896

FDIC insurance covers all deposit accounts, including checking and savings accounts, money market
deposit accounts and certificates of deposit. FDIC insurance does not cover other financial products and
services that banks may offer, such as stocks, bonds, mutual fund shares, life insurance policies, annuities,
or securities. The standard insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account
ownership category. See http://www.fdic.gov/deposit/deposits/.

1897

See, e.g., Comment Letter of Crawford and Company (Jan. 14, 2013) (available in File No. FSOC-20120003) (“Bank demand deposits . . . lack the diversification of money market funds and carry inherent
counterparty risk.”); Comment Letter of Investment Company Institute (Jan. 10, 2011) (available in File No
4-619) (“The Report suggests that requiring money market funds to float their NAVs could encourage
investors to shift their liquid balances to bank deposits. We believe that this effect is overstated,
particularly for institutional investors. Corporate cash managers and other institutional investors would not
view an undiversified holding in an uninsured (or underinsured) bank account as having the same risk
profile as an investment in a diversified short-term money market fund. Such investors would continue to
seek out diversified investment pools, which may or may not include bank time deposits.”). See also

an administrative burden on investors. 1898
It is important to note that investors will likely earn lower yields on deposit accounts than
what they currently receive on non-government funds. 1899 One commenter even suggested flows
of capital into banks may create additional downward pressure on the yields paid to depositors,
further lowering investor returns. 1900 If the additional capital that flows from non-government
funds is more than banks can profitably lend, then banks might reduce the interest rates that they
pay to depositors. If, however, banks have sufficient opportunities to invest the additional
capital, interest rates would likely not fall.
In addition, as discussed above, investors in non-government funds may not reallocate
assets in a significant way, and if they do, may not reallocate large amounts of capital to banks.
Given that deposit accounts held over $8 trillion as of February 28, 2014, 1901 we do not anticipate
that additional flows from non-government funds will have a sufficient impact to materially push
down interest rates at banks. Even if investors reallocate capital to demand deposits, recent
history indicates demand deposits can successfully absorb large flows of capital from investors.

currency have significantly increased in recent years relative to their holdings of money market

deposits accounted for 51% of the surveyed organizations’ short-term investments in 2012,
which is up from 25% in 2008. 1903 Money market funds accounted for 19% of these
organizations’ short-term investments in 2012, down from 30% just a year earlier, and down
from almost 40% in 2008. 1904
We discussed in the Proposing Release and commenters who addressed this issue
agreed that one practical constraint for many money market fund investors is that they may be
precluded from investing in certain alternatives outside of funds regulated under rule 2a-7, such
as STIFs, offshore money market funds, LGIPs, separately managed accounts, and direct
investments in money market instruments, due to significant restrictions on participation. 1905
For example, STIFs are only available to accounts for personal trusts, estates, and employee
benefit plans that are exempt from taxation under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. 1906 STIFs
subject to regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency also are subject to less
stringent regulatory restrictions than rule 2a-7 imposes, and STIFs under the jurisdiction of
other banking regulators may be subject to no restrictions at all equivalent to rule 2a-7. 1907

Similarly, European money market funds can take on more risk than U.S. money market funds
because they are not currently subject to regulatory restrictions as stringent as rule 2a-7 on their
credit quality, liquidity, maturity, and diversification. 1908 If investment alternatives are less
stringently regulated than non-government funds, then they could pose greater risk than money
market funds and thus may not be viable or attractive alternatives to investors that highly value
principal stability. Offshore money market funds, which are investment pools domiciled and
authorized outside the United States, generally sell shares to U.S. investors only in private
offerings, limiting their availability to investors at large. 1909 Further, few offshore money
market funds offer their shares to U.S. investors in part because doing so could create adverse
tax consequences. 1910
In the Proposing Release and sections III.A and III.B of this Release, we recognize, and
commenters concurred, 1911 that some current money market fund investors may have selfimposed restrictions or fiduciary duties that limit the risks they can assume or that preclude
them from investing in certain alternatives. They may be prohibited from investing in, for

example, enhanced cash funds that are privately offered to institutions, wealthy clients, and
certain types of trusts due to greater investment risk, limitations on investor base, or the lack of
disclosure and legal protections of the type afforded them by U.S. securities regulations. 1912
Likewise, we recognized in the Proposing Release that money market fund investors that can
only invest in SEC-registered investment vehicles could not invest in LGIPs, which are not
registered with the SEC (as states and local state agencies are excluded from regulation under
the Investment Company Act). In addition, many unregistered and offshore alternatives to
money market funds—unlike registered money market funds in the United States today—are
not prohibited from imposing gates or redemption fees or suspending redemptions. 1913 Other
investment alternatives, such as bank CDs, also impose redemption restrictions.
The Commission recognizes that not every cash investment alternative presented here
will be available and attractive to each investor, which may leave investors with fewer
investment options than those enumerated above. Investors, however, have available a range of
investment options, with each choice offering different tradeoffs. Money market fund investors
that are unwilling or unable to invest in their current option after the reforms will need to
analyze the various tradeoffs associated with each alternative. We anticipate the money market
fund industry may also innovate in various ways to meet investors’ needs. For example, some
managers may try to stabilize their funds’ NAVs by choosing low principal-risk portfolio
investment strategies, whereas other funds may seek to offer higher yields within the

According to the 2012 AFP Liquidity Survey, supra note 64, only 21% of respondents stated that enhanced
cash funds were permissible investment vehicles under the organization’s short-term investment policy. In
contrast, 44% stated that prime money market funds were a permissible investment and 56% stated that
Treasury money market funds were a permissible investment.

1913

See, e.g., Proposing Release, supra note 25, Table 2, explanatory n.F.

615

restrictions of rule 2a-7.
We also recognize the reforms adopted today may cause investors to reallocate assets to
investment alternatives that offer different combinations of yield, risk, and features than those
of the funds in which they are invested today. The fact that investors have bought nongovernment funds rather than these other investment alternatives reveals that they almost
certainly prefer these funds to the alternatives. We, and a number of commenters, 1914
acknowledge that it is doubtful that any of the non-money market fund investment alternatives
provide the identical combination of price stability, transparency, risk, liquidity, yield, and level
of regulation provided by past money market funds. However, with today’s adopted
amendments, the Commission addresses certain concerns inherent in the current structure of
non-government money market funds that create incentives for shareholders to redeem shares
ahead of other investors and thus contribute to the likelihood of heavy share redemptions and
shareholder dilution. Specifically and as pointed out in the DERA study, although the 2010
reforms made the funds more resilient to both portfolio losses and investor redemptions, no
fund would have been able to withstand the losses that the Reserve Primary Fund incurred in
2008 without breaking the buck, and nothing in the 2010 reforms would have prevented the
Reserve Primary Fund’s holding of Lehman Brothers debt. We therefore believe that the
relative costs to investors from losing certain features of some of today’s money market funds

should be acceptable in light of the significant benefits stemming from advancing our goals of
reducing money market funds’ susceptibility to heavy redemptions, improving their ability to
manage and mitigate potential contagion from redemptions, and increasing the transparency of
their risks.
2.

Efficiency, Competition and Capital Formation Effects on the Money
Market Fund Industry

In this section, we consider certain effects on the money market fund industry of
investors reallocating money away from certain money market funds as a result of our reforms.
As discussed in section III.A, our primary reforms will not apply to government money market
funds. 1915 As such, we anticipate current investors in government funds will likely remain
invested in these funds, as they will offer the price stability, liquidity, and yield to which these
investors are accustomed. 1916 As discussed further in section III.K.3 below, in fact we expect
some non-government money market fund shareholders will likely reallocate their investments to
government money market funds. Accordingly, to the extent investors reallocate funds between
these two alternatives, we expect that our primary reforms will affect the short-term funding
market and capital allocation at least in the short-run as discussed further below. We also expect
to have an increase in allocative efficiency because investors will be making choices best suited
to their investment risk profiles. Furthermore, to the extent that new government funds will be
offered because of an increased demand for government funds, competition among government
1915

Government money market funds are permitted to opt in to the fees and gates reforms if they disclose they
are doing so in advance. Because government funds hold assets with little credit risk, we believe it is
unlikely that these funds will ever choose to impose fees or gates.

1916

If government funds experience heavy inflows, the yields on eligible government securities, in which
government funds largely invest, might fall. If the yields on portfolio assets fall, the yields on the fund will
decline as well. We discuss this possibility and its impact in greater detail below.

617

funds will also increase.
Like government funds, money market funds that qualify as retail funds will also be able
to continue transacting at a stable value and will not be subject to the floating NAV reform.
Retail funds will be required to consider imposing a fee or gate if their liquidity comes under
stress. As such, retail funds will be competing with government and floating NAV funds based
on their structure. Although some investors may reallocate their investments away from retail
money market funds because they could impose a fee or gate, we expect many investors will
remain in these funds because their investment experience under normal market conditions is
unlikely to change. Some investors may move into retail money market funds in response to our
reforms, as there are likely some natural persons currently invested in funds that are categorized
as institutional prime or institutional tax-exempt money market funds that would prefer to stay in
a money market fund that maintains a stable NAV per share and that has a similar investment
risk profile as their current fund. Funds with both retail and institutional investors also may
create new retail-only non-government funds with the same investment objective. Although we
do not have a basis for estimating the amount of assets that might be reallocated to retail nongovernment funds because we do not know what fraction of the shareholder base of these funds
today categorized as institutional would qualify as natural persons, we anticipate the number of
retail funds and competition among these funds to increase as they compete to attract new
investors and thus increase their allocative efficiency. The impact on competition likely should,
at the margin, be larger if the increase in the number retail funds stems from new complexes
offering additional retail funds as opposed to current complexes offering additional retail funds.
Today’s fees and gates amendments are designed to moderate redemption requests by

618

allocating liquidity costs to those shareholders who impose such costs on funds through their
redemptions and, in certain cases, stop heavy redemptions in times of market stress by providing
fund boards with additional tools to manage heavy redemptions and improve risk transparency.
As such, the fees and gates amendments should increase allocational efficiency in the nongovernment money market fund industry by making liquidity risk more apparent to shareholders
in these funds through enhanced disclosure and by allocating the costs of redeeming shares when
liquidity is costly to shareholders that redeem shares. 1917 If investors make better informed
investment decisions given the liquidity risk inherent in these money market funds as a result of
the fees and gates amendments, allocational efficiency will be enhanced.
In addition to the impacts discussed above, the combination of our floating NAV and
fees and gates reforms may have a number of effects on efficiency, competition, and capital
formation in the institutional prime money market fund industry. First, by allocating marketbased gains and losses on portfolio securities in institutional prime funds to each shareholder on
a proportionate basis, the floating NAV should increase allocational efficiency in this industry,
as investors are allocating their investment capital based on true returns. 1918 Doing so will
further increase the allocative efficiency discussed above in institutional prime money market
1917

Allocational efficiency refers to investors efficiently allocating their funds to available investments, taking
all relevant factors into account.

1918

Some commenters noted the potential for inequitable treatment of shareholders under the stable NAV
model. See, e.g., Better Markets FSOC Comment Letter (stating that “an investor that succeeds in
redeeming early in a downward spiral may receive more than they deserve in the sense that they liquidate at
$1.00 per share even though the underlying assets are actually worth less. Without a sponsor contribution
or other rescue, that differential in share value is paid by the shareholders remaining in the fund, who
receive less not only due to declining asset values but also because early redeemers received more than
their fair share of asset value.”); Comment Letter of Wisconsin Bankers Association (Feb. 15, 2013)
(available in File No. FSOC-2012-0003) (stating that “[a] floating NAV has the benefits of . . . reducing the
possibilities for transaction activity that results in non-equitable treatment across all shareholders”). See
also supra section II.B.1.

619

funds attributable to the fees and gates reform and its effect on shareholders’ understanding of
money market funds’ liquidity risk.
Our primary reforms also may affect how different kinds of money market funds
compete in the industry, and thus affect efficiency, competition, and capital formation in the
industry. For example, we anticipate that some institutional investors will continue to demand
a combination of relative price stability, liquidity, and yields that are higher than the yields
offered by government funds. Managers of floating NAV money market funds may respond to
these investors in one of several ways. Some managers may respond by altering their portfolio
management and preferentially investing portfolio holdings in shorter-maturity, lower-risk
securities than they do today. They would do so to reduce NAV fluctuations and lessen the
probability the fund’s weekly liquid assets decline sufficiently for a fee or gate to be possible.
These portfolio management changes may affect competition within the institutional prime
money market fund industry (or broader money market fund industry) if these funds more
favorably compete with other less conservatively managed funds. They also could affect
capital formation to the extent they shift portfolio investment away from certain issuers or
certain maturities or lessen the yields passed through to investors from their money market fund
investments. In addition, an increase in these types of funds could encourage issuers to fund
themselves with shorter term debt.
Other portfolio managers of institutional prime funds could respond by using affiliate
financial support to minimize principal volatility or avoid declines in weekly liquid assets that

620

could lead to the imposition of a fee or gate. 1919 The emergence of these types of money market
funds also could have competitive effects within the institutional prime money market fund
industry (or broader money market fund industry), depending on how favorably they compete
with money market funds that are managed differently. These funds could reduce allocational
efficiency to the extent shareholders invest in money market funds based on the assumption that
principal volatility and liquidity risk will be borne by the fund’s sponsor or other affiliate rather
than on the risk-return profile of the fund’s portfolio (although this impact could be tempered to
the extent any of these costs are passed on to investors through higher management fees). They
also could affect capital formation if affiliate sponsor support leads to higher investment in
riskier or longer-term debt securities than otherwise would occur if investors had to bear the
principal volatility or liquidity risk accompanying those money market fund investments.
Finally, some portfolio managers of institutional prime money market funds may seek to
competitively distinguish their funds post-reform by altering their portfolio management and
investing in relatively longer-term or riskier securities than they do today. These funds may seek
to appeal to investors that, if investing in a floating NAV money market fund that could be
subject to fees or gates, now may be willing to sacrifice liquidity in times of stress or some
principal stability for greater yield. The emergence of these types of money market funds may
enhance competition in the money market fund industry among different types of institutional
prime money market funds along the risk-return spectrum. It also would affect changes in

1919

Fund affiliates could avoid declines in weekly liquid assets, for example by purchasing non-weekly liquid
assets or directly purchasing fund shares. Under the reforms we are adopting today, we are requiring
increased disclosure of any affiliate financial support of money market funds. These reforms, and their
effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation, are discussed above in sections III.E and III.F

621

capital formation post-reform to the extent that it shifts investment to issuers of longer-term or
riskier securities or increases yields paid to investors (or increases management fees paid to
certain types of fund complexes). Thus, depending on the magnitude of the primary reforms’
effect on the assets managed by different types of money market funds, the type and number of
institutional prime funds may contract overall, potentially limiting investors’ choices among
them, or may expand, potentially enhancing investors’ choices among them. Accordingly,
competition among institutional prime funds may increase or decrease with an impact that will
likely be stronger if the number of complexes offering institutional prime funds changes.
Finally, as discussed above, we recognize investors in institutional prime funds may
reallocate assets to investment alternatives. In addition to the potential effects on investors
described above and the short-term funding markets described below, a reallocation of assets out
of these funds may affect the profitability of the money market fund industry, and thus have
incremental effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. For example, fund
complexes that, on net, experience a decline in managed money market fund assets as a result of
our primary reforms, will likely earn lower fund advisers’ management and other fees than they
do today. 1920 It is important to note, however, that fees for managing these assets will still be
earned, but by the asset managers to which assets are reallocated. To the extent investors shift
assets within a fund complex (e.g., to a government fund), at least some of the fees may be
retained by the fund complex. If, however, investors instead reallocate assets to non-money
market fund alternatives, the managers of these other options will benefit. This shift may have

1920

622

competitive implications within the money market fund industry as not all fund complexes are
likely to be equally affected by a movement in money market fund assets as a result of the
primary reforms. For example, fund complexes that primarily advise government money market
funds may benefit competitively as these funds are generally not affected by our primary reforms
and may experience inflows, which would raise these fund advisers’ management fee income.
Similarly, fund complexes that manage mostly retail money market funds may be competitively
advantaged post-reform over those that primarily manage institutional prime funds. These latter
funds will be subject to both our floating NAV and fees and gates reforms and thus may
experience a greater decline in assets than retail money market funds as a result of our primary
reforms. We thus anticipate our primary reforms may significantly alter the competitive makeup
of the money market fund industry, producing related effects on efficiency and capital formation.
We believe, however, that these changes are necessary to accomplish our policy goals.
3.

Effect of Reforms on Investment Alternatives, and the Short-Term
Financing Markets

In this section, we consider the effects of the reforms on investment alternatives, issuers,
and the short-term financing markets. We have presented extensive economic analysis relating
to our final policy choices and discussed commenters’ views in earlier sections of the Release.
As such, we focus here on the specific macroeconomic effects of the reforms on investment
alternatives, as well as the short-term financing markets and the impact of the reforms on
efficiency, competition, and capital formation on issuers in the short-term financing market and
the short-term financing market.
We recognized in the Proposing Release that the amendments we are adopting today
could create incentives for investors to shift assets out of non-government money market funds,

623

which could lead to changes in the funding of and other effects on the short-term financing
markets. Many commenters agreed with our views. 1921 Some commenters, for example,
cautioned that a decrease in investor demand for money market funds could limit the availability
and raise the cost of short-term funding for businesses, as well as federal, state, and local
governments, and that it is currently unclear whether these entities would be able to find and use
alternative efficient sources of credit. 1922 Since government funds are not subject to the fees and
gates and floating NAV requirements, we disagree that today’s adopted amendments have a
negative impact on the availability and cost of short-term funding for the federal government.
As discussed in the Proposing Release and herein, we believe the effects of a shift, including any
effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation, will depend on the amount of capital
reallocated to specific investment alternatives and the nature of the alternatives. More
specifically, the extent to which money market fund investors choose to reallocate their assets to
investment alternatives, including other money market fund types, as a result of these reforms
will drive the effect on the short-term financing markets. We discuss the potential impact of
these shifts in investment below.
As discussed in the Proposing Release, because non-government money market funds’
investment strategies differ from a number of the investment alternatives enumerated, a shift by
investors from non-government money market funds to these alternatives could affect the
markets for short-term securities. Commenters warned that movement of invested assets from

Comment Letter.

624

prime money market funds to, for example, government money market funds could skew shortterm funding away from private markets to the public sector. 1923 The magnitude of the effect will
depend on not only the size of the shift but also the extent to which there are portfolio investment
differences between non-government money market funds and the chosen investment
alternatives. As discussed in the DERA Study, for example, even a modest shift from prime
funds to other types of money market funds could represent a sizeable increase in certain
investments. 1924 If instead investors in institutional prime funds choose to manage their cash
directly rather than invest in alternative cash management products, they may invest in securities
that are similar to those currently held by prime funds, in which the effects on issuers and the
short-term financing markets will likely be minimal. 1925
We believe, and a number of commenters agreed, 1926 that some capital will be reallocated
from non-government funds, especially institutional prime funds, to government money market
funds. If the magnitude of the flows is large, we anticipate the shift in investment could affect
not only the government securities market, but also issuers, including companies and
municipalities, that previously sold securities to non-government funds. It is important to note
that although investors may reallocate assets to government funds, it is also possible and even

See DERA Study, supra 24, Table 7.

1925

The preference for this alternative, however, may be tempered by the cost to investors of managing cash on
their own. See, e.g., supra note 580 and accompanying text.

likely that some will reallocate assets to bank demand deposits and other investment vehicles,
which would mitigate the negative impact of the reforms on the short-term funding market in
general and bank issuers of short-term papers in particular. 1927
Commenters cautioned that there is limited market capacity if investors reallocate their
assets from non-government money market funds into government money market funds. 1928
Commenters noted a specific concern that reallocating assets from non-government funds to
government funds would increase the demand for eligible government securities, 1929 which could
reduce these securities’ yields in what is already a low-yield environment. Low yields on
eligible government securities would not only affect investors in government funds, but also
those investors who directly purchase government securities. 1930 Commenters noted heavy flows
to government funds during the financial crisis caused several government funds to close to new
investors to prevent additional net inflows, 1931 while yields fell close to zero. 1932 These problems
arose even with large issuances of government securities during the financial crisis. 1933 One
commenter specifically stated that negative yields would be problematic for the competitiveness
of government funds and investors, as well as for parties holding government securities for

regulatory capital and collateral purposes. 1934
Evidence from the financial crisis also indicates, however, that government funds
absorbed large inflows of assets. Specifically, approximately $498 billion or 24% of assets
flowed out of prime funds, whereas $409 billion or 44% of assets flowed into government funds
between September 2, 2008 and October 7, 2008, 1935 and even with these unprecedented
reallocations of assets, Treasury-bill rates approached or fell below zero for only a relatively
short period during the crisis. 1936 One commenter also noted the supply of Treasury bills has
declined by more than $250 billion on three separate occasions between January 31, 2009 and
March 31, 2014 without apparent market dislocation. 1937 We recognize that any reallocation of
assets from non-government money market funds into government money market funds may
affect yields in the short-run. However, we believe that the two-year period for funds to
implement the fees and gates and floating NAV reforms that we are adopting may help facilitate
the market adjustment process. For example, fund complexes with non-government funds that
have both institutional and retail investors as well as other fund complexes will have time to
originate retail funds not subject to the floating NAV requirement to meet the needs of retail
clients. Similarly, retail investors in non-government funds that will be subject to the floating
NAV after the implementation period will have time to reallocate assets to a retail fund. More
generally, investors will have time to identify investment alternatives and consider trade-offs for

alternatives other than government funds.
Commenters, using data from July 2013 through March 2014, estimated there are
between $5.2-$6.8 trillion in eligible government securities. 1938 However, as noted by several
commenters, it is difficult to estimate the amount of assets that institutional investors might
reallocate from non-government funds to government funds. 1939 Several commenters cautioned
this supply of eligible government securities would likely be insufficient if today’s reforms were
adopted. 1940 One commenter, however, argued that the supply would be adequate. 1941 This
commenter estimated 64% or $806 billion could shift from prime funds to government funds, 1942
whereas a second commenter estimated 25% of assets in its institutional prime funds would
transfer permanently into government funds. 1943 A third commenter estimated between $500
billion to $1 trillion.1944 The first commenter noted, however, that prime funds invested 19.5% of
their assets on average in eligible government securities as of February 28, 2014, explaining that
prime funds hold eligible government securities to meet the Daily Liquid Asset and Weekly
1938

See Federated DERA I Comment Letter; Fidelity DERA Comment Letter; ICI DERA Comment Letter;
Wells Fargo DERA Comment Letter. One commenter (see the Invesco DERA Comment Letter) estimated
eligible government assets were $2 trillion, which is substantially lower than the other commenters’
estimates. It appears the estimate does not include repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasuries
or other government securities and may have other assumptions, so we focus here on the estimates provided
in the other four letters.

Liquid Asset requirements of Rule 2a-7. 1945 As such, they would likely divest some of these
assets to meet investor redemption requests, thereby freeing up eligible government securities for
government fund purchase. Applying this 19.5% estimate to prime funds at large and assuming
investors reallocated 64% of prime fund assets to government funds, 1946 the commenter then
estimated the demand for eligible government securities would increase “approximately $806
billion, which is only about 8% of current total available eligible government securities.” 1947 The
commenter concluded, “the supply of eligible government securities is more than adequate to
meet anticipated demand.” 1948 We agree with this commenter. Applying the 19.5% estimate to
institutional prime funds at large and assuming investors reallocated 25% of prime fund assets to
government funds, 1949 the demand for eligible government securities would increase about $239
billion, which is only about 4% of current total available eligible government securities. 1950
Therefore, we do not anticipate the reallocation of fund assets will be large relative to the market
for eligible government securities.
1945

See Fidelity DERA Comment Letter. The Federated DERA I Comment Letter estimated prime funds
invested 27% of assets in eligible government securities. More specifically, the letter stated prime money
market funds held $95 billion in Treasury securities, $130 billion in agency securities, and $169 in fully
collateralized repurchase agreements. It cited year-end assets in prime money market funds of $1.486
trillion.

prime funds. We then multiplied the percentage times the assets managed by prime funds, as provided
by Form N-MFP as of February 28, 2014. Commenters, using data from July 2013 through March 2014,
estimated there are between $5.2-$6.8 trillion Eligible Government Securities. See Federated DERA I
Comment Letter; Fidelity DERA Comment Letter; ICI DERA Comment Letter; Wells Fargo DERA

629

It is also difficult to estimate the future supply of available eligible government securities,
given market forces and possible changes in the supply and demand. Commenters, as well as the
staff, noted a number of factors that may affect the supply and demand of eligible government
securities. 1951 Some factors would affect the net supply negatively, whereas other factors would
affect it positively. Given the large number of possible factors and the range of possible effects
of each factor on both the supply of eligible government securities and the economy overall, we
cannot estimate the net macroeconomic effect of the factors overall. 1952 For this reason, we
discuss these factors qualitatively.
Several factors could increase the future demand for and decrease the future supply of
eligible government securities. For example, one commenter discussed the impact of rising
interest rates on the demand for money market funds generally and the concomitant increase in
demand for eligible government securities. 1953 This commenter suggested, for example, the
“eventual resolution of the Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation will reduce the supply,” 1954 as will a reduction in the federal deficit. 1955
The same commenter noted several factors have increased the demand of government securities,
including the stockpiling of securities by the Federal Reserve “as a result of quantitative easing

1951

We note commenters did not provide data to help the Commission estimate the effects of these factors. See,
e.g., BlackRock DERA Comment Letter; Dreyfus DERA Comment Letter; Federated DERA I Comment

and other policy initiatives.” 1956 The commenter further notes continued trade deficits, structural
and regulatory changes in the markets for financial contracts, and regulatory capital and liquidity
requirements have increased and are likely to continue increasing the demand for U.S.
government securities. 1957 We agree with the commenter that many of these factors will increase
the demand for U.S. government securities. 1958
On the other hand, several factors may decrease the future demand for and increase the
future supply of eligible government securities. For example, one commenter hypothesized
companies, seeking better investment opportunities, may reduce their holdings of cash
equivalents, thereby reducing their holdings of government money market funds and eligible
government securities. 1959 This commenter further suggested that central banks might wind down
their open market bond purchases, which could cause investors to sell short-term and purchase
long-term government securities to earn higher yields. In addition, the commenter suggested that
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York through its Overnight Reverse Repo Program might
increase government repurchase agreements as part of its quantitative easing exit strategy, 1960 and
the Treasury could increase the supply of Treasury Floating Rate Notes designed to be attractive

to money market funds and their investors. 1961 Because we cannot foresee all of the ways
markets will evolve, we cannot predict the macroeconomic effects of these changes. 1962
Nevertheless, we acknowledge changes in the market arising from the reforms may have
macroeconomic effects in the future.
In a separate analysis, the staff noted that some investors that currently own eligible
government securities might choose to reallocate these assets to other global safe assets, 1963
which could free up eligible government securities for government fund purchase. 1964 A number
of commenters argued the Commission should focus solely on the supply of eligible government
securities, given that government funds are largely restricted to investing in eligible government
securities. 1965 Several commenters also argued investors other than government funds may be
restricted from holding assets other than eligible government securities, which would preclude

1961

It is important to also note that arguments supporting the idea of a shortfall typically ignore the ability of
market participants to adapt to a changing landscape. See SEC Staff Analysis
http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-03-13/s70313-324.pdf.

1963

See SEC Staff Analysis http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-03-13/s70313-324.pdf. A “safe asset” is defined
as any debt asset that promises a fixed amount of money in the future with virtually no default risk. Safe
assets are generally considered to be information insensitive: Investors’ concerns about asymmetric
information or adverse selection are ameliorated when trading because the asset’s creditworthiness is
known with near certainty, reducing the need for investors to collect information. The safety of a given
asset does not depend on the creditworthiness of the issuer alone but also is determined by the liquidity of
the market in which the asset trades and by guarantees. Any asset can be rendered safe by an implicit or
explicit promise from a central bank or credit-worthy institution to buy it if its price falls below a certain
level.

1964

See SEC Staff Analysis http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-03-13/s70313-324.pdf. We note government
money market funds are largely precluded from investing in securities other than government securities.
The market for global safe assets may provide investment alternatives for current investors in government
funds and institutional investors invested in non-government funds that are willing to reallocate assets.

them from buying other assets. 1966 One commenter pointed out certain global safe assets can
present risks, such as foreign exchange risk, 1967 credit risk (securitized assets and investment
grade corporate debt), 1968 and commodity risk (gold), 1969 and suggested investors either may not
choose to or cannot hold them. 1970 Moreover, this commenter suggested that using global safe
assets for regulatory and counterparty purposes may be more expensive than using eligible
government securities. 1971
We recognize that government funds and certain other investors are restricted from
investing in assets other than eligible government securities and that other investors may prefer
to invest in eligible government securities. As discussed above, commenters estimated there are
between $5.2-$6.8 trillion of eligible government securities. 1972 Of these, government money
market funds today hold about $959 billion or 16%, which leaves over $5 trillion or 84% of
eligible government securities in the hands of investors that may be able to reallocate their
investments in eligible government securities to other assets. 1973 The staff’s analysis, which we
credit, suggests any shift in demand from eligible government securities to global safe assets

Based on Form N-MFP data as of February 28, 2014, government money market funds had approximately
$959 billion in assets under management.

more generally would be small relative to the overall supply of global safe assets, which is
estimated to be $74 trillion. 1974 Consistent with this argument, a commenter notes that the entire
market for eligible government securities is less than 10% of the market for global safe assets. 1975
Based on these comments and the staff’s analysis, we continue to believe that some investors and
market participants may reallocate assets from eligible government securities to other safe assets,
which would free up eligible government securities for government fund purchase.
If significant capital flows from institutional prime funds to demand deposits, issuers and
the short-term capital markets may be affected. If banks invest the additional capital in the shortterm financing markets, we do not anticipate a large impact on issuers or the short-term capital
markets. But if they do not, less capital will be available to issuers, which could negatively
impact capital formation in the short-term financing market and perhaps increase the cost of
short-term financing. In this scenario, however, banks, which tend to fund longer-term lending
and capital investments, will have additional monies to invest in the long-term financing market,
which could lower the cost of capital for long-term financing and aid capital formation in that
market.
Several commenters noted that shifts in assets from institutional prime funds to banks,
although reducing systemic risk in money market funds, might increase systemic risk in the
banking system. 1976 Some commenters, for example, noted that a shift of assets from money

634

market funds to bank deposits would increase the size of the banking sector and investors’
reliance on FDIC-deposit insurance, possibly increasing the concentration of risk in banks. 1977
Several commenters also observed that banks in this scenario would likely need to raise capital
to meet capital adequacy standards. 1978 Several commenters discussed the effects of evolving
regulations (and related regulatory uncertainty) on banks’ willingness to accept large inflows.
For example, they noted that pending proposals to increase banks’ leverage ratios could limit
banks’ willingness to accept large cash deposits on their balance sheets, because banks will need
to raise large amounts of new capital to reflect the growth in bank assets. 1979 Finally,
commenters explained that state and municipal entities might not be able to find banks willing to
accept their large deposits due to the high cost of collateralizing public bank deposits, a common
requirement among municipalities. 1980
As discussed above, although we are not able to estimate the flows of capital from
institutional prime funds, we do expect some outflow when investors in institutional prime funds

attractiveness of money market funds,” which “could increase, not decrease, systemic risk as assets move
to too-big-to-fail banks.”); Comment Letter of Jonathan Macey (Nov. 27, 2012) (available in File No.

the FDIC.”); See, e.g., Comment Letter of Federated Investors, Inc. (Jan. 25, 2013) (available in File No.

their bank deposits to be collateralized by marketable securities at a higher amount than the current
$250,000 FDIC deposit insurance limit (often over 100 percent of the deposits after the deduction of the
amount of deposit insurance).

weigh the costs and benefits of each investment alternative against the prime fund investment
and find an investment alternative a superior allocation. Given the heterogeneity of investors’
preferences and investment objectives and constraints, we do not expect that all investors will
allocate assets to the same alternative. We expect, for example, that some investors will allocate
assets to government funds, some to demand deposits, and others to various other alternatives.
If, however, significant capital flows from prime money market funds to demand deposits, the
size of the banking sector will increase. It is uncertain to what extent an increase in the size of
the banking sector is a concern. First, banks are highly regulated and attuned to managing and
diversifying risks. Second, because the size of the remaining institutional prime funds’
portfolios will, in aggregate, be smaller, these portfolios could contain a higher percentage of
high-quality prime assets, with improved diversification, and likely could be less susceptible to
heavy redemptions. Taken together, it is not clear what the net effect on the resilience of the
short-term funding markets will be due to a shift of assets from institutional prime funds to the
banking sector.
Historically, money market funds have been a significant source of financing for issuers
of commercial paper, especially financial commercial paper, and for issuers of short-term
municipal debt. 1981 Analysis of Form N-MFP data from November 2010 through March 2014
indicates that financial company commercial paper and asset-backed commercial paper
1981

Based on Form N-MFP data, non-financial company commercial paper, which includes corporate and nonfinancial business commercial paper, is a small fraction of overall money market holdings. In addition,
commercial paper financing by non-financial businesses is a small portion (one percent) of their overall
credit market instruments. According to Federal Reserve Board flow of funds data, as of December 31,
2012 non-financial company commercial paper totaled $130.5 billion compared with $12,694.2 billion of
total credit market instruments outstanding for these entities. As such, we do not anticipate a significant
effect on the market for non-financial corporate fund raising. Federal Reserve Board flow of funds data is
available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/Current/z1.pdf.

comprise most of money market funds’ commercial paper holdings. 1982 Thus, we acknowledge
that a shift by investors from non-government money market funds to other investment
alternatives could cause a decline in demand for commercial paper and municipal debt,
reducing these firms and municipalities’ access to capital from money market funds and
potentially creating a decline in short-term financing for them. 1983 If, however, money market
fund investors shift capital to investment alternatives that demand the same assets as prime
money market funds, the net effect on the short-term financing markets should be small.
As discussed in the DERA Study, the 2008-2012 increase in bank deposits coupled with
the contraction of money market funds provides data to examine how capital formation can be
affected by a reallocation of capital among different funding sources. According to Federal
Reserve Board flow-of-funds data, money market funds’ investments in commercial paper
declined by 45%, or $277.7 billion, from the end of 2008 to the end of 2012.
Contemporaneously, funding corporations reduced their holdings of commercial paper by 99%

1982

In addition, according to the DERA Study, supra note 24, “as of March 31, 2012, money market funds held
$1.4 trillion in Treasury debt, Treasury repo, Government agency debt, and Government agency repo as its
largest sector exposure, followed by $659 billion in financial company commercial paper and CDs, its next
largest sector exposure.”

1983

See, e.g., Comment Letter of Associated Oregon Industries (Jan. 18, 2013) (available in File No. FSOC2012-0003) (stating that if the proposed reforms “drive investors out of money market funds, the flow of
short-term capital to businesses will be significantly disrupted.”); U.S. Chamber FSOC Comment Letter
(stating that “any changes [that make money market funds] a less attractive investment will impact the
overall costs for issuers in the commercial paper market resulting from a reduced demand in commercial
paper.”); Comment Letter of N.J. Municipal League (Jan. 23, 2013) (available in File No. FSOC-20120003) (stating that “money market funds hold more than half of the short-term debt that finances state and
municipal governments for public projects,” which could force local governments to “limit projects and
staffing, spend more on financing . . . or increase taxes” if such financing was no longer available.);
Comment Letter of Government Finance Officers Association, et al. (Feb. 13, 2013) (available in File No.
FSOC-2012-0003) (stating that with respect to FSOC’s floating NAV proposal, “changing the fundamental
feature of money market funds . . . would dampen investor demand for municipal securities and therefore
could deprive state and local governments and other borrowers of much-needed capital.”).

or $357.7 billion. 1984 The end result was a contraction of more than 40% or $647.5 billion in the
amount of commercial paper outstanding.
Although the decline in funds’ commercial paper holdings was large, it is important to
place commercial paper borrowing by financial institutions into perspective by considering its
size compared with other funding sources. As with non-financial businesses, financial
company commercial paper is a small fraction (3.2%) of all credit market instruments. 1985 We
have also witnessed the ability of issuers, especially financial institutions, to adjust to changes
in markets. Financial institutions, for example, dramatically reduced their use of commercial
paper from $1.1 trillion at the end of 2008 to $449.2 billion at the end of 2012. 1986 As such, we
continue to believe that financial institutions, as well as other firms, will be able to identify
alternate short-term financing sources if the amount of capital available to purchase financial
commercial paper declines in response to our money market fund rule changes.
We recognize, however, that as part of this shift there is the potential that commercial
paper issuers may have to offer higher yields to attract alternate investors, which would

The Federal Reserve flow of funds data defines funding corporations as “funding subsidiaries, custodial
accounts for reinvested collateral of securities lending operations, Federal Reserve lending facilities, and
funds associated with the Public-Private Investment Program (PPIP).”

1985

According to the Federal Reserve Flow of Funds data as of December 31, 2012, commercial paper
outstanding was $449.2 billion compared with $13,852.2 billion of total credit market instruments
outstanding for financial institutions.

increase issuers’ short-term cost of capital. 1987 Any increase in yield would likely increase
demand for these investments which in turn could to some extent mitigate the potential adverse
capital formation effects on the commercial paper market. Issuers, facing higher short-term
financing costs, might consider the trade-offs of shifting into longer-term sources of financing.
To the extent issuers’ funding costs rise, whether short or long term, issuers will be less likely
to raise capital and invest in projects, possibly affecting capital formation negatively. However,
we also note that to the extent that fees and gates slow capital from leaving money market funds
during times of stress, the fees and gates amendments adopted today should benefit the shortterm funding market. This is because money from maturing portfolio assets may need to be
reinvested in the short-term funding market, which may help prevent that market from
completely locking up during times of stress as we have experienced during the financial crisis.
To that extent, fees and gates may allow issuers to continue accessing the short-term capital
market served by money market funds while they identify alternate sources of short-term
capital.
Municipalities also could be affected if the new amendments cause the size or number of
municipal money market funds to contract. Commenters expressed concern about a loss of
funding or other adverse impacts on state and local governments. 1988 As discussed in detail in

1987

See, e.g., Federated X Comment Letter.

1988

A number of commenters argued that applying our floating NAV reform to municipal funds would reduce
demand for municipal securities and raise the costs of financing. See, e.g., Fidelity Comment Letter (noting
that tax-exempt funds purchase approximately 65% of short-term municipal securities and that fewer
institutional investors in tax-exempt funds will lead to less purchasing of short-term municipal securities by
tax-exempt funds and a corresponding higher yield paid by municipal issuers to attract new investors);

section III.B, however, we anticipate the impact will likely be relatively small. As of the last
quarter of 2013, municipal funds held approximately 7% of the municipal debt outstanding. 1989
Of that 7%, retail investors owned approximately 71% of the assets under management. Even
though municipal funds will be subject to our fees and gates reforms, we do not anticipate that
retail investors in significant numbers will divest their assets in municipal funds because these
funds should continue to offer price stability, 1990 yield, and liquidity in all but exceptional
circumstances. We therefore anticipate that many retail investors will continue to find municipal
funds to be an attractive cash management tool compared to other alternatives.
Of that 7% of municipal debt outstanding that municipal funds held, institutional
investors, who might divest their municipal fund assets if they do not want to invest in a floating
NAV fund, held approximately 30% of assets. 1991 Because we estimate that institutional
municipal funds held approximately 2% of the total municipal debt outstanding, we believe at

1989

Based on data from Form N-MFP and the Federal Reserve Board “Flow of Funds Accounts of the United
States” (Z.1), which details the flows and levels of municipal securities and loans, to estimate outstanding
municipal debt, (March 6th, 2014), available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/current/z1.pdf.
This estimate is consistent with a previous estimate presented in U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. 2012 Report on the Municipal Securities Market. The estimate in the 2012 report was based
on data from Mergent’s Municipal Bond Securities Database.

1990

Retail municipal funds are exempt from the floating NAV requirement adopted today.

1991

See Dreyfus II Comment Letter indicated that based on data from iMoneyNet institutional tax-exempt
funds represent “approximately $80 billion in assets,” which “constitute approximately 30% of the current
Municipal MMF industry.” Commission staff estimates based on data from Form N-MFP and iMoneyNet
as of February 28, 2014 confirm these statistics. To estimate the assets managed by the retail and
institutional segments of municipal funds, we used self-reported fund data from iMoneyNet as of February
28, 2014 to estimate percentages. We then multiplied the percentages times the total assets managed by
municipal funds, as provided by Form N-MFP as of February 28, 2014. We note the retail designation is
self-reported and omnibus accounts in these funds may include both individual and institutional beneficial
owners. For these reasons, our estimates may underestimate the number of funds with retail investors. In
the Proposing Release, we estimated that retail investors own close to all municipal fund assets. We now
recognize retail investors own approximately 71% of municipal fund assets.

640

most approximately 2% is at risk of leaving the municipal debt market. 1992 Of this 2% of the
municipal debt market that institutions hold, we anticipate many investors that currently invest in
institutional municipal funds likely value the tax benefits of the funds and should choose to
continue investing in municipal funds to take advantage of the tax benefits. In addition, we
anticipate that some investors who qualify as natural persons and currently are invested in
institutional prime funds may reallocate their assets to retail municipal funds, thereby increasing
investment in retail municipal funds.
Even if municipal funds were to reduce their purchasing of municipal securities, we
expect that other investors may fill the gap. Between the end of 2008 and the end of 2012, for
example, money market funds decreased their holdings of municipal debt by 34% or $172.8
billion.1993 Despite this reduction in holdings by money market funds, municipal issuers
increased aggregate borrowings by over 4% between the end of 2008 and the end of 2012.
Municipalities were able to fill the gap by attracting other investor types. Other types of mutual
funds, for example, increased their municipal securities holdings by 61% or $238.6 billion.
Depository institutions have also increased their funding of municipal issuers during this time
period by $141.2 billion as investors have shifted their assets away from money market funds
into bank deposit accounts. Life insurance companies almost tripled their municipal securities
holdings from $47.1 billion at the end of 2008 to $121 billion at the end of 2012. Because
historically other types of investors have increased their investment in municipal debt when

1992

This estimate is calculated as follows: Municipal funds hold 7.5% of municipal debt outstanding x 29% of
municipal assets held by institutional investors = 2.2% of total municipal debt held by institutions.

1993

The statistics in this paragraph are based on the Federal Reserve Board’s Flow of Funds data.

641

money market funds have decreased their investment, the Commission expects that other
investors may again increase their investment in municipal debt if money market funds reduce
their funding of the municipal debt market in the future, though we note that yields on municipal
securities could rise. For these reasons, we do not anticipate the amendments adopted today will
substantially affect capital formation in the municipal debt market.
The amendments we are adopting today, including the floating NAV requirement and
enhanced disclosure requirements should improve informational efficiency in the capital
markets by increasing investors’ ability to knowledgably allocate capital. We recognize,
however, that a fund’s imposition of a liquidity fee increases the cost of reallocating their assets
while it is in place, whereas a gate prevents investors from doing so. The additional costs of
liquidity and inability of investors to redeem shares may impede the efficient allocation of
capital and hence capital formation during periods of market stress because investors will not
be able to reallocate capital as freely. We have tried to mitigate the magnitude of this effect by
reducing the time that gates are in place to at most 10 business days in any 90-day period (down
from the proposed 30 calendar days) and by adopting a 1% default liquidity fee (down from the
proposed 2% fee). We also expect that funds will impose fees and gates infrequently. 1994
Although we recognize that the reallocation of assets by money market fund investors
may affect efficiency, competition, and capital formation within the short-term financing
markets, the final amendments reflect our efforts to moderate the amount of assets that may be
potentially redistributed by limiting our fees and gates requirement to non-government funds
1994

As discussed in section III.E, the DERA study found that 2.7% of the funds had their monthly weekly
liquid assets percentages fall below 30% and 0.02% of the funds had their monthly weekly liquid assets
percentages fall below 10%.

642

and our floating NAV requirement to institutional prime funds. If shareholders either remain in
non-government money market funds or move to alternatives that invest in similar underlying
assets, the competitive effects are likely to be small. If, however, investors reallocate (whether
directly or through intermediaries) investments into substantively different assets, the effects
may be larger. In that case, issuers may have to access different investor bases and perhaps
offer higher yields to attract capital, whether from the smaller money market fund industry or
from other investors. Either way, we recognize that issuers that are unable to offer the required
higher yield may have difficulties raising capital, at least in the short-term financing markets.
However, as discussed in detail earlier in this section, we can neither precisely estimate the
amount of capital that will be reallocated nor its destination.
The Commission anticipates other competitive consequences and effects on capital
formation as well. For example, we expect managers of non-government money market funds
will have incentives to closely manage weekly liquid assets and principal risk so as to avoid
crossing the threshold for triggering fees and gates or having a volatile NAV. 1995 To manage
these risks, fund managers will have incentives to hold short-maturity, low-risk securities, and
as a result the overall short-term financing markets may tilt toward these issuances. If so, the
prices of these securities are likely to rise and yields may fall. We anticipate issuers that are
able and willing to issue securities that meet these criteria may gain a competitive advantage
over other issuers in the market. Alternatively, the new amendments may create a competitive
advantage for issuers of higher yielding and riskier assets that are rule 2a-7-eligible securities if
1995

See, e.g., SIFMA Comment Letter; BlackRock II Comment Letter; Wells Fargo Comment Letter; Peirce &
Greene Comment Letter; Dreyfus Comment Letter; Goldman Sachs Comment Letter.

643

non-government funds pursue more aggressive investment strategies within the confines of rule
2a-7 or if relatively less risk-averse investors avoid government funds and instead invest in
non-government funds. If so, issuers of higher-yielding 2a-7-eligible assets may gain a
competitive advantage.
The DERA study pointed out that although the 2010 reforms made money market funds
more resilient to both portfolio losses and investor redemptions, no fund would have been able
to withstand the losses that the Reserve Primary Fund incurred in 2008 without breaking the
buck, and nothing in the 2010 reforms would have prevented the Reserve Primary Fund’s
holding of Lehman Brothers debt. We therefore believe that the costs to participants in the
short-term funding market are acceptable relative to the benefits stemming from advancing our
goals of reducing money market funds’ susceptibility to heavy redemptions, improving their
ability to manage and mitigate potential contagion from redemptions, and increasing the
transparency of their risks.
L.

Certain Alternatives Considered

In this section, we discuss certain reasonable alternatives that we considered as potential
other methods for achieving our primary reform goals, as well as a number of other alternatives
suggested by commenters, and discuss their benefits as well as their limitations. 1996 The goals of
today’s reforms include reducing money market funds’ susceptibility to heavy redemptions,
improving their ability to manage and mitigate potential contagion from such redemptions, and

1996

This section discusses reasonable alternatives to the primary fees and gates and floating NAV reforms
discussed above. We also discuss reasonable alternatives to other rule amendments, as well as more
specific or distinct issues, throughout other parts of the Release. For example, see supra section III.B.5 for
a discussion of alternatives related to decimal place rounding.

644

increasing the transparency of their risks, while preserving, as much as possible, the benefits of
money market funds. Having considered carefully the trade-offs of the alternatives discussed
below, we believe, based on our experience, observations, and analysis, as well as careful
consideration of comments received on the adopted reforms and alternatives, that the
amendments we are adopting today best effectuate our policy goals.
1.

Liquidity Fees, Gates, and Floating NAV Alternatives

In the Proposing Release, we presented a number of reform options. Among them were
standalone floating NAV, standalone fees and gates, and a combination of fees, gates, and a
floating NAV requirement. Today we are adopting an approach that includes fees and gates for
all non-government money market funds, as well as an additional targeted reform of a floating
NAV for the funds with investors most susceptible to heavy redemptions, institutional prime
funds. 1997 We are adopting this approach based on our evaluation, discussed both in other
sections of this Release and below, of our policy goals, experience, observations, and analysis, as
well as careful consideration of comments received on the following reasonable alternatives.
a.

Standalone Liquidity Fees and Redemption Gates

One option outlined in the Proposing Release was for non-government fund boards to be
given discretion to impose liquidity fees and permit imposition of redemption gates under certain
conditions, but without also requiring a floating NAV for institutional prime money market

1997

We did not propose to apply either the fees and gate or floating NAV reforms to government money market
funds, and accordingly the final amendments do not apply to government funds, for the policy reasons
discussed in section III.C.1. The analysis of reasonable alternatives below therefore does not focus on the
potential effects of these alternatives as applied to government funds.

645

funds. 1998 We believe a standalone fee option would reduce money market funds’ susceptibility
to heavy redemptions when liquidity costs are high and fund liquidity is stressed and would
allocate liquidity costs to redeeming shareholders, making them pay for the liquidity that they
receive, rather than transferring such liquidity costs to remaining shareholders. Gates, in
addition to liquidity fees, would help improve the ability of fund managers and boards to manage
and mitigate potential contagion from high levels of shareholder redemptions. 1999 A standalone
fees and gates requirement would eliminate some of the benefits of money market funds as they
exist today for investors, but retain others. Investors would face the possibility of costly
redemptions or the elimination of redemptions temporarily when fund liquidity is stressed. On
the other hand, fees and gates, as discussed in section III.A and below, would retain the
advantages of a stable-price product, avoiding certain issues associated with floating NAV funds.
A large number of commenters supported, to varying degrees and with varying caveats, our fees
and gates proposal. 2000 Many other commenters, however, expressed their opposition to fees and
gates. 2001 We discuss specific comments on fees and gates in detail in section III.A. 2002
As discussed here and in the Proposing Release, liquidity fees are designed to preserve
the current benefits of principal stability, liquidity, and a market yield, but reduce the likelihood

1998

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at section III.B. We note that we have adopted this alternative for a
certain subset of funds-namely retail funds that limit their investors to natural persons. We discuss the
reasons why we adopted this alternative for retail funds, and the tradeoffs involved, in section III.C.2.

2002

We discuss the trade-offs of standalone fees versus standalone gates in section III.L.1.a below.

646

that “when markets are dislocated, costs that ought to be attributed to a redeeming shareholder
are externalized on remaining shareholders and on the wider market.” 2003 Even if a liquidity fee
is imposed, fund investors will continue to be able to access liquidity, although at a cost. The
ability of fund boards to impose liquidity fees when liquidity costs are high would have many
benefits, including reducing the incentives for shareholders to redeem shares when the fees are in
effect. Liquidity fees will require redeeming shareholders to bear the liquidity costs associated
with their redemptions, rather than transferring those costs to remaining shareholders. Likewise,
fees would help reduce investors’ incentives to redeem shares ahead of other investors,
especially if fund managers deplete their funds’ most liquid assets first to meet redemptions,
leaving later redemption requests to be met by selling less liquid assets. Liquidity fees would
protect fund liquidity by requiring redeeming shareholders to repay funds for the liquidity costs
incurred. For these reasons, we believe liquidity fees would reduce money market funds’
susceptibility to heavy redemptions when liquidity fees are high and would improve fund
managers and boards’ ability to manage and mitigate potential contagion from such redemptions.
We also recognize that the possibility of fees and gates being imposed when a fund is
under stress may make the risk of investing in money market funds more salient and transparent
to some investors, which could sensitize them to the risks of investing in the funds. The
disclosure amendments we are adopting today will require funds to provide disclosure to
investors regarding the possibility of fees and gates being imposed if a fund’s liquidity is
significantly stressed. Funds’ disclosures that shareholders may face liquidity fees and

2003

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, n.343.

647

redemption gates may help inform and could perhaps sensitize some of those investors to some
of the risks of investing in money market funds.
Redemption gates would stop heavy redemptions in times of market or fund stress. 2004
Like liquidity fees, gates would preserve the current benefits of money market funds under most
market conditions. Funds, however, would be able to use gates to respond to runs by halting
redemptions. Gates would provide a “cooling off” period, which might temper the effects of
short-term investor panic, possibly reducing investors’ incentives to redeem shares. In addition,
gates would allow funds to generate additional internal liquidity as assets mature and would
reduce or eliminate the likelihood that funds sell otherwise desirable assets and engage in “fire
sales.” They would also provide time for funds to identify solutions in crises and communicate
the nature of any stresses to shareholders.
Standalone liquidity fees and gates would preserve many of the current benefits of money
market funds under normal market conditions. As discussed in the Proposing Release, the ability
of funds to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates, had it been available during the financial
crisis, might have helped some funds manage the heavy redemptions that occurred and may have
helped limit the contagion effects of such redemptions, though it is impossible to know what
exactly would have happened if money market funds had operated with fees and gates at that
time. Unlike a floating NAV, which affects day-to-day fund pricing, fund boards would impose

2004

See supra section III.A. We note, however, gates could prompt pre-emptive runs if investors anticipate
them. We believe, however, that several aspects of today’s amendments mitigate this risk, and the effects
of such pre-emptive runs should they occur. For example, board discretion in imposing gates mitigates this
risk. We have also tried to mitigate the magnitude of this effect by reducing the time that gates are in place
to at most 10 business days in any 90-day period (down from the proposed 30 days) and adopted a 1%
default liquidity fee (down from a 2% fee).

648

liquidity fees and gates only when liquidity costs are high and fund liquidity is stressed. In
addition, a standalone liquidity fee and redemption gate structure would preserve many of the
benefits of stable price money market funds, avoiding many of the costs associated with floating
NAV funds. 2005
The Commission recognizes, however, that liquidity fees and redemption gates address
some of the risks associated with money market funds, but cannot address all of the factors that
might lead to heavy redemptions in certain money market funds. As discussed previously, we
have found that certain money market funds (i.e., institutional prime funds) pose particularly
significant risks that fees and gate alone do not fully address. 2006 Specifically, fees and gates are
intended to enhance money market funds’ ability to manage and mitigate potential contagion
from high levels of redemptions and make investors pay their share of the costs of the liquidity
that they receive. They do not, however, eliminate the incremental incentive for certain investors
to redeem shares ahead of other shareholders when their money market fund’s shadow price falls
below $1.00—a risk to which institutional prime funds are particularly susceptible, and the
potential resultant dilution of remaining shareholders interests. Thus, we believe a liquidity fee
combined with a redemption gate—without a floating NAV—will not adequately address this
risk of heavy redemptions for institutional prime funds. However, balanced with the competing
goal of retaining the benefits of money market funds for investors to the extent possible, as
discussed above, we believe that a standalone fees and gates approach does meet our policy goals
2005

As discussed previously, the Commission acknowledges, for example, some investors may reallocate assets
from floating NAV prime funds to either government money market fund or other stable-price alternatives,
which may impose costs on investors, funds, and the short-term capital markets. We discuss these effects
in more detail in section III.K.

2006

See supra section III.B.

649

when applied to retail funds. 2007
b. Standalone Floating NAV
Another option outlined in the Proposing Release was for institutional prime funds to
transact at a floating NAV with no liquidity fees or gates. 2008 Most commenters opposed
requiring a standalone floating NAV. 2009 As we discuss in detail in section III.B, we believe a
floating NAV requirement reduces certain money market funds’ susceptibility to heavy
redemptions and improves the allocation of gains, losses, and costs among shareholders. It does
not, however, fully address the ability of fund managers and boards to manage and mitigate
potential contagion from high levels of shareholder redemptions. A standalone floating NAV
requirement would eliminate some of the benefits of a stable-price fund for institutional
investors, while retaining other benefits that investors currently experience with money market
funds.
First and foremost, we believe a standalone floating NAV would help reduce institutional
prime money market funds’ susceptibility to heavy redemptions by reducing the incremental
incentive for shareholders in these funds to redeem shares ahead of other investors when a fund’s
shadow NAV falls below $1.00. 2010 As discussed in Section III.B, a floating NAV requirement

2007

The tradeoffs of just a fee or gate (without a floating NAV) are discussed in section III.A. We note that one
commenter suggested a “penny rounding” alternative that, if combined with fees and gates, is very similar
to the fees and gates alternative we proposed (which included a requirement for penny-rounded pricing).
We discuss this alternative at notes 512 - 515 and accompanying text. We are not adopting this suggested
“penny rounding” alternative combined with fees and gates for the reasons described in this section
III.L.1.a.

2008

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at section III.A.

2009

See supra section III.B for a detailed discussion of comments we received on this issue.

2010

Although most commenters opposed requiring a floating NAV, a number of commenters did agree that a
floating NAV would address this incremental incentive to redeem. See, e.g., Thrivent Comment Letter;

650

mandating that institutional prime money market funds transact at share prices that reflect
current market-based factors (not amortized cost or penny rounding, as currently is permitted)
would lessen investors’ incentives to redeem early to take advantage of transacting at a stable
value. As a result, the floating NAV requirement by itself without an accompanying liquidity fee
and/or redemption gate would help mutualize potential losses and costs among all investors,
including redeeming shareholders. 2011
A standalone floating NAV, which many observers perceive to be more equitable than a
stable NAV, 2012 may also minimize investor dilution. A standalone floating NAV should result
in redeeming investors receiving only their fair share of the fund when there are embedded losses
in the portfolio, thereby avoiding dilution of remaining shareholders. A standalone floating
NAV requirement would also preserve certain current benefits of money market funds, because
investors would continue to be able to redeem shares during times of market stress without
paying a liquidity fee or waiting for a redemption gate to be lifted. A standalone floating NAV
would also avoid certain costs associated with liquidity fees and redemption gates.
We anticipate a standalone floating NAV would contribute to the allocation of money
market fund risks in the same ways that a floating NAV does in a combination approach. As
discussed in the Proposing Release and in section III.B, a floating NAV requirement is designed
to increase the allocation of the risks present in money market funds by causing shareholders to

651

experience gains and losses when a fund’s value fluctuates. Some money market fund investors,
accustomed to a stable NAV, may not appreciate the risks associated with money market funds
whose prices may remain stable, but whose underlying values may fluctuate in times of market
stress. As we have discussed previously, transacting at prices based on current market values
will help ensure that institutional investors who invest in floating NAV funds do so only if they
are willing to tolerate small fluctuations in share price in return for potentially higher yield. 2013
And for those investors who are unwilling to tolerate the risk that the price fluctuations reflect,
we anticipate they may reallocate their investments to other, more appropriate alternatives, which
may help reduce any redemption pressure that these investors could have caused in times of
stress had they remained in the funds. 2014
A standalone floating NAV would not necessarily eliminate, however, shareholders’
incentives to redeem shares from institutional prime money market funds ahead of other
investors when liquidity costs are high. In times of severe market stress when the secondary
markets for funds’ assets become illiquid and liquidity costs are high, investors may still have an
incentive to rapidly redeem shares before their fund’s liquidity dries up. A floating NAV may
also not alter institutional prime money market fund shareholders’ incentives to redeem shares in
times of market stress when investors want to shift from money market funds into securities with
greater quality, liquidity, and transparency. As such, when the situation develops, a standalone
floating NAV would not necessarily prevent heavy shareholder redemptions in institutional
prime money market funds and the related effects on the short-term capital markets or help fund

managers and boards manage redemptions. 2015 Thus, a standalone floating NAV would likely be
insufficient to satisfy these important policy goals of the money market fund reform.
We have therefore determined to adopt a floating NAV as a targeted reform that is
intended to supplement the broader liquidity fees and gates reforms discussed above (as well as
other reforms discussed in sections III.E, III.I, and III.J) by addressing the incremental incentive
for institutional investors to redeem from prime funds. We believe that an approach that includes
both fees and gates for all non-government money market funds as well as a floating NAV for a
subset of those funds (i.e., institutional prime money market funds) provides fund managers and
boards with targeted and additional tools to manage heavy redemptions and help limit contagion.
c.

Fund Choice of Standalone Floating NAV or Standalone Liquidity
Fees and Redemption Gates

We also considered providing institutional prime money market funds a choice of either
transacting with a floating NAV or being able to impose liquidity fees and gates in times of
stress—in other words, each institutional prime money market fund would choose to apply either
the floating NAV alternative or the liquidity fees and gates alternative. 2016 In the Proposing
Release, we discussed how providing such a choice might allow each money market fund to
select the reform alternative that is most efficient, cost-effective, and preferable to its
shareholders. We suggested such a choice might enhance the efficiency of our reforms and

2015

We have discussed the particular risks posed by institutional prime funds throughout this Release and
especially in section III.B.

2016

We note that we did not propose to require retail or government funds to adopt a floating NAV, and
accordingly this discussion focuses on the tradeoffs between allowing such a choice for institutional prime
funds. We discuss the reasons why we are not mandating either a floating NAV or fees and gates for
government money market funds, but allowing them to opt in to fees and gates if they choose in section
III.C.1 and discuss why we believe that a floating NAV is not necessary for retail funds in section III.C.2.

653

minimize costs and competitive impacts.
A number of commenters offered support for this “choice” reform approach, 2017 and one
commenter specifically opposed it. 2018 The commenters who supported allowing funds to choose
which reform alternative to implement argued that this approach would allow the market to
decide which reform was most suitable rather than imposing a top-down solution. They noted
that each alternative offers a varying set of benefits and drawbacks and that allowing funds to
choose which reform to implement would allow them to offer different kinds of funds to clients
who may have divergent priorities for either liquidity or a stable NAV. 2019 These commenters
also suggested that letting each fund choose would allow them to select the approach that they
can implement at lowest cost and with least disruption. The commenters who supported
allowing fund choice between the principal reforms we are adopting today also emphasized they
did not support imposing both reforms in combination, only alternatively. 2020 One commenter
that supported fund choice nonetheless suggested intermediaries may be unwilling to
accommodate funds that have two options as they would have to bear the costs of dealing with
both sets of reforms for different funds. 2021 The commenter that opposed allowing a choice of
structural reforms stated that having both primary structural reforms available could be confusing
for investors and may promote regulatory arbitrage. 2022 They argued that the Commission should

654

adopt a standardized structure that is simple for investors to understand. 2023
We have carefully considered these comments. However, for the same reasons that we
believe a standalone approach with either fees and gates or floating NAV would not fully address
the risks inherent in money market funds, we believe, based on our consideration of relevant
risks and policy objectives, allowing institutional prime money market funds to choose between
them also would not address the risks posed by money market funds. As discussed above, the
floating NAV alternative by itself would not necessarily eliminate shareholders’ incentives to
redeem shares from money market funds ahead of other investors when liquidity costs are high.
In times of severe market stress when the secondary markets for funds’ assets become illiquid
and liquidity costs are high, investors may still have an incentive to redeem shares before their
fund’s liquidity dries up. A floating NAV also may not alter money market fund shareholders’
incentives to redeem shares in times of market stress when investors want to shift from money
market funds into securities with greater quality, liquidity, and transparency. As such, a floating
NAV alternative by itself would not necessarily prevent heavy shareholder redemptions and the
related effects on the short-term capital markets or help fund managers and boards manage the
rapid heavy redemptions to which institutional prime funds can be susceptible. These funds
would lack the additional tools of fees and gates to help manage heavy redemptions and limit
contagion. Thus, providing institutional prime funds an alternative and having some funds adopt
a floating NAV would prevent us from satisfying certain important policy goals of the money
market fund reform for those funds.

2023

Id.

655

Some funds might instead choose to adopt the liquidity fees and gates option. However,
as discussed above, these funds, while having certain tools to manage heavy redemptions, would
have a diminished ability to address an important factor that can lead to redemptions in money
market funds. Specifically, fees and gates would not eliminate the incentive for institutional
investors to redeem shares ahead of other shareholders to avoid market-based losses embedded
in their fund’s portfolio or mitigate shareholder dilution. Liquidity fees and gates would not
allocate day-to-day gains, losses, and costs to investors on a proportionate basis, a risk that is
particularly relevant to institutional prime funds.
In addition, we note that today neither funds nor their investors may necessarily
internalize the full likely effects of their own decisions on other funds and investors and the
short-term financing markets, and thus capital formation. 2024 The approach that we are adopting
today, which subjects all non-government funds to the fees and gates reform and only
institutional prime funds to the additional floating NAV requirement, is designed to address these
externalities by reducing money market funds’ susceptibility to heavy redemptions and
improving their ability to manage and mitigate potential contagion from such redemptions.
Because allowing institutional prime funds to choose between either a floating NAV or fees and
gates would effectively negate the combined effects of the reforms that we have found to be
necessary to address their risks, we believe that this is not the most appropriate alternative, for
the reasons discussed above. For these reasons, we now believe neither liquidity fees and
redemption gates nor floating NAV, alone, addresses all of the factors that might lead to heavy

See generally MFDF Comment Letter (discussing, in the context of fees and gates, that boards need not put
significant emphasis on the broader systemic effects of their decisions).

656

redemptions in institutional prime money market funds, and thereby to allow them such a choice
would not effectively mitigate all of the risks that our reforms are designed to address.
d.

Standalone Fees or Standalone Gates

The amendments we are adopting today will allow funds to impose liquidity fees and
redemption gates. 2025 Some commenters on the proposal, however, expressed a preference for
either just fees or just gates. For example, some commenters noted a preference for fees over
gates. 2026 One commenter argued that liquidity fees could slow runs, as the price for liquidity
would be factored into investors’ redemption decisions, whereas a gate could exacerbate the risk
of pre-emptive runs if investors expect gates to be imposed. 2027 Another commenter stated that
although a liquidity fee might be acceptable to shareholders if it reflected the cost of liquidity,
gates that prevented investors from accessing their cash would be the least attractive alternative
for institutional investors that use money market funds for cash management purposes. 2028
Conversely, other commenters expressed a preference for gates over fees. 2029 One
commenter noted liquidity fees are unlikely to prevent institutional investors from redeeming

2025

As discussed in section III.C.1, government funds are not required to impose fees or gates, but may opt to
do so if they choose. We believe that if a government fund were to choose to opt into a fee and gate
regime, for the same reasons discussed below, such a fund should have the flexibility to use both tools,
rather than be limited to just one or the other. We further note that gating is always entirely discretionary
(once a fund goes below 30% weekly liquid assets), and that if a board finds that a fee is not in the best
interests of the fund need not impose it, and thus a government fund that opted into fees and gates could
apply effectively only a fee or only a gate if the boards finds that using only one such tools is in the best
interests of the fund.

shares in a crisis, but that gates would be more likely to achieve the Commission’s goals. 2030
Similarly, another commenter described gates as the “most effective option in addressing run
risk,” but was skeptical as to whether fees “would deter shareholders from redeeming their
shares in a time of extreme market stress.” 2031 Finally, a commenter suggested implementing
only fully discretionary gates but no fees, noting in part that, “establishing appropriate triggers
and setting properly sized fees in advance are difficult and likely futile tasks.” 2032
We continue to believe that funds and their boards should be permitted to choose between
fees and gates but be capable of utilizing both when determining the best way to address heavy
redemptions. As discussed in section III.1 above, fees and gates can accomplish similar policy
goals, but one may be better suited to one set of circumstances or funds than the other. 2033 The
flexibility in today’s amendments should address many of the commenters’ concerns in favoring
one approach over the other, 2034 because it gives boards the option to impose fees, gates, neither

2033

As discussed in the Proposing Release, shareholders valuing principal preservation may prefer a
redemption gate over a liquidity fee, particularly if the fund expects to rebuild liquidity through maturing
assets. In contrast, shareholders preferring liquidity over principal preservation may prefer a liquidity fee
because it allows access to that investor’s money market fund shareholdings – it just imposes a greater cost
for that liquidity if the fund is under stress. See, e.g., Comment Letter of BlackRock, Inc. on the IOSCO
Consultation Report on Money Market Fund Systemic Risk Analysis and Reform Options (May 28, 2012),
available at http://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD392.pdf (stating their preference for
liquidity fees over gates “because clients with an extreme need for liquidity can choose to pay for that
liquidity in a crisis”); Comment Letter of BNP Paribas on the IOSCO Consultation Report on Money
Market Fund Systemic Risk Analysis and Reform Options (May 25, 2012), available at

restrict the redeemer willing to pay the price of liquidity”); see also Capital Advisors Comment Letter.

2034

See supra section III.A.1.c.i addressing pre-emptive run concerns and section III.A.2 addressing concerns
with default thresholds and fees. We also note that, to the extent an investor is seeking to invest in a money
market fund for cash management purposes and views a fund with the ability to impose a fee or gate as
incompatible with cash management, it may alternatively invest in a government money market fund that

658

or both. The flexibility provided in today’s amendments will allow funds to tailor the
redemption restrictions they employ to market conditions, as well as the preferences and
behavior of their particular shareholder base and to adapt restrictions over time as they and the
industry gain experience employing such restrictions. Of course, consideration of any such
factors would have to be made in the context of the fund’s best interests. 2035 The flexibility
provided by today’s amendments also allows funds to alter their approach as events unfold. For
example, if a board determines initially that a liquidity fee is in the best interests of the fund, but
the fee turns out to be ineffective in reducing heavy redemptions, the board may then choose to
impose a redemption gate. Accordingly, we believe that providing funds and their boards with
the flexibility to choose on an ongoing basis between fees and gates best meets our policy goals
of reducing money market funds’ susceptibility to heavy redemptions and helping funds manage
and mitigate potential contagion from such redemptions.
e.

Partial Gates

We are adopting amendments to rule 2a-7 that, like the proposal, will allow a fund board
to impose a gate on all redemptions, but that will not allow for partial redemption gates. 2036 A
number of commenters advocated allowing the board greater discretion to impose partial
gates. 2037 For example, some commenters noted partial gates would provide investors with some

Business Law Section Comment Letter; see also Comment Letter of HSBC Global Asset Management on
the European Commission’s Green Paper on Shadow Banking (May 28, 2012) (stating that a money market
fund should be able to limit the total number of shares that the fund is required to redeem on any trading
day to 10% of the shares in issue, that any such gate be applied pro rata to redemption requests, and that

immediate liquidity, but allow funds time to regenerate liquidity or service redemptions under
improved market conditions. 2038 In addition, a commenter stated that partial gates would, “make
it easier for a board to determine that a gate is in the best interests of the fund because a partial
gate would impose a lesser hardship on investors.” 2039
Commenters suggested a variety of approaches for imposing partial gates. For example,
a commenter proposed allowing shareholders to redeem “at least 50% of their remaining balance
at the then basis-point rounded NAV plus a 1% fee.” 2040 Others proposed imposing partial gates
with greater restrictions on shareholders making larger redemptions and lower or no restrictions
on shareholders making smaller redemptions. 2041 Another commenter suggested limiting
redemptions to 10% of outstanding shares per day and applying this limitation pro rata among
all redeeming shareholders that day, with the balance of unredeemed shares carried to the next
day until all redemption requests have been met. 2042 In contrast, other commenters were opposed
to the idea of partial redemption gates, citing significant operational challenges and costs, 2043 as
well as the potential for arbitrary and inconsistent application among funds and inequitable
treatment among shareholders. 2044

We have determined not to permit partial redemption gates under amended rule 2a-7. An
important policy goal of this reform is to improve funds’ ability to manage and mitigate potential
contagion from such redemptions. Partial gates do not fully stop runs, because shareholders can
continue to redeem shares. Although board discretion to impose partial gates may be effective
for individual funds, it may not address our larger concerns about contagion resulting from rapid
heavy redemptions. There may exist times when full gates are required to limit the contagion
effects of heavy redemptions on remaining investors and the short-term financing markets, but
individual firms may choose instead to impose partial gates. We also note that a number of
commenters opposed partial gates, noting significant operational challenges and costs, which are
not associated with full gates. 2045 We also believe the benefits of allowing partial gating is
further diminished now that we are adopting only a 10 business day maximum gate period,
because 10 business days (rather than the 30-day gate under the proposal) may be a more
reasonably manageable period of time during which investors may not need the safety valve that
a partial gate might afford.
There are several additional potential issues with partial gates. First, we understand it
may be difficult for funds to achieve desired outcomes with partial gates, and partial gates may
create unintended consequences. For example, when a Florida LGIP suspended redemptions in
2007 in response to a run, it re-opened with a combined partial gate and liquidity fee – local
governments could take out the greater of 15% of their holdings or $2 million without penalty,
and the remainder of any redemptions was subject to a 2% redemption fee. 2046 We understand
2045

See, e.g., Fidelity Comment Letter; Fin. Info. Forum Comment Letter; Federated V Comment Letter.

2046

See David Evans and Darrell Preston, Florida Investment Chief Quits; Fund Rescue Approved,

661

that investors redeemed most of what was allowed under the partial gate without triggering the
redemption fee, which meant the partial gate not only did not stop the run, but may have
triggered redemptions up to that limit. 2047
Second, partial gates based on the size of redemptions may also be easily manipulated
unless appropriate, but costly and complex, procedures are put in place to prevent such gaming.
For example, a partial gate that allowed small redemptions could result in investors redeeming
small amounts over a number of days, essentially achieving large redemptions through multiple
smaller redemption transactions. 2048 Funds could prevent this sort of gaming by limiting each
shareholder’s redemptions to a certain amount, but this type of restriction would only serve to
increase the costs and complexity of such a gate. Third, a partial gate based on the size of
redemptions could effectively exempt certain types of funds and their shareholders (e.g., retail
funds and their shareholders) from a gating requirement.
Fourth, we also believe partial gates would complicate the fees and gates requirements as
an operational matter. If partial gates were assessed on a redemption-by-redemption basis (e.g.,
the size of a shareholder’s redemption), we believe, as one commenter stated, “[t]he systems
enhancements necessary to track holdings for purposes of determining each shareholder’s
redemption limit would be more complicated, cumbersome, and costly than the changes required

BLOOMBERG (Dec. 4, 2007).
2047

See, e.g., Neil Weinberg, Florida Fund Meltdown: Bad to Worse, Forbes (Dec. 6, 2007) (noting that
investors withdrew $1.2 billion from the $14 billion pool after it re-opened, while depositing only $7
million, but that only 3 out of about 1,700 participants in the pool withdrew assets subject to the
redemption fee).

2048

See supra section III.A.1.c herein discussing gaming of redemption restrictions.

662

to implement the full gate.” 2049 Similarly, complexity would be compounded by the existence of
omnibus accounts, as funds would need to track all redemptions made by a single investor
through multiple accounts over the course of a day to prevent investors from making
redemptions in excess of the limit imposed by a partial gate in a single day by spreading them
over multiple omnibus accounts.
f.

In-Kind Redemptions

As discussed in the Proposing Release, we requested comment in 2009 on a potential
amendment that would require funds to satisfy redemption requests in excess of a certain size
through in-kind redemptions.

2050

We also requested comment on this type of redemption

restriction when we requested comment on the PWG Report. 2051 Almost all commenters on the
PWG alternative opposed it. 2052 Most commenters believed that requiring in-kind redemptions
would be technically unworkable due to the complex valuation and operational issues that would
be imposed on both the fund and on investors receiving portfolio securities. 2053 Several
commenters stated that investors would dislike the prospect of receiving redemptions in-kind and

2049

See Fidelity Comment Letter.

2050

See 2009 Proposing Release, supra note 66, at section III.B; PWG Report, supra note 506, at section 3.c.
An in-kind redemption occurs when a shareholder’s redemption request to a fund is satisfied by distributing
to that shareholder portfolio assets of that fund instead of cash. In-kind redemptions might lessen the effect
of large redemptions on remaining money market fund shareholders, and they would ensure that the
redeeming investors bear part of the cost of their liquidity needs. During the financial crisis, one money
market fund stated that it would honor certain large redemptions in-kind in an attempt to decrease the level
of redemptions in that fund. See 2009 Proposing Release, supra note 66, at n.30.

2051

See PWG Report, supra note 506, at section 3.c (discussing requiring that money market funds satisfy
certain redemptions in-kind).

2052

But see Proposing Release, supra note 25 at n.472.

2053

See Proposing Release, supra note 25 at 233-34 n.473. They also asserted that required in-kind
redemptions could result in disrupting, rather than stabilizing, markets if redeeming shareholders needing
liquidity were forced to sell into declining markets. See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.474.

663

would structure their holdings to avoid the requirement, but would nevertheless still collectively
engage in redemptions if the money market funds were to come under stress with similar adverse
consequences for the funds and the short-term financing markets. 2054
In connection with the current reforms, we again asked for comment regarding possible
in-kind redemption restrictions. Two commenters noted the complexity of implementing this
mechanism. 2055 One of these commenters suggested that the Commission permit, but not require,
money market funds to meet redemptions by returning a pro rata share of the fund’s assets rather
than cash to investors. 2056 In light of these comments and comments we previously received, we
continue to believe requiring in-kind redemptions could create operational difficulties that might
prevent funds from treating investors fairly in practice. In contrast, we anticipate reforms such
as liquidity fees and gates would fulfill many of our policy goals in a manner that is
operationally simpler and potentially fairer to investors than in-kind redemptions.
We also note requiring in-kind redemptions would not necessarily stop runs and the
related adverse effects on the short-term financing markets and capital formation. Rather, we
believe the liquidity fees and gates approach described in section III.A would better achieve our
policy goals, including improving money market funds’ ability to manage and mitigate potential
contagion from high levels of redemptions and helping to preserve the benefits of money market
funds for investors and the short-term financing markets for issuers. We note that money market

664

funds are already permitted to satisfy redemptions in kind if they disclose such a possibility in
the fund’s prospectus. 2057
g.

Standalone Floating NAV Combined with only Liquidity Fees or
Redemption Gates

The Commission also considered combining a floating NAV with either a liquidity fee or
a redemption gate; that is, we considered an alternative where money market funds would be
required to maintain a floating NAV combined with a liquidity fee but not a redemption gate and
an alternative where money market funds would be required to maintain a floating NAV
combined with a redemption gate but not a liquidity fee. Combining a floating NAV with just a
liquidity fee or just a redemption gate would simplify the operational implementation of the rule
and perhaps make money market funds more attractive to investors.
These more limited combinations, however, would likely fail to achieve the policy goals
of the money market fund reform to the same extent as the full set of reforms that we are
adopting today. Without liquidity fees, there would be heightened incentives for shareholders to
redeem in times of market stress before fund managers deplete their funds’ liquidity to meet
redemptions. The costs of providing liquidity to redeeming shareholders would fall on nonredeeming shareholders, creating a financial inequity between shareholder types.
Similarly, without the possibility of imposing gates, funds would lose an important tool
to manage redemptions during periods of stress. They would not be able to fully halt
redemptions, which could affect funds’ ability to generate internal liquidity as assets mature,
2057

See section 2(a)(32) (defining a redeemable security as a security where the holder is entitled ... to receive
approximately his proportionate share of the issuer's current net assets, or the cash equivalent thereof
(italics added)). See also rule 18f-1, which provides an exemption from certain prohibitions of section
18(f)(1) of the Act with regard to redemptions in kind and in cash.

665

perhaps undermining capital formation. Losing the time necessary to generate internal liquidity
would increase the likelihood funds would have to sell desirable assets, perhaps at “fire sale”
prices. Funds would not have as much time to identify solutions and communicate with
investors as they would with gates. They would also lose the ability to create a “cooling off”
period, which might temper the effects of short-term investor panic, possibly reducing investors’
incentives to redeem shares.
Precommiting to either a combination of a floating NAV and fees or a combination of a
floating NAV and gates would reduce funds’ ability to manage heavy redemptions relative to
having a floating NAV and both fees and gates. In addition, it would limit boards’ ongoing
discretion to address potential problems. A fund’s optimal response to managing heavy
redemptions would likely depend on its particular circumstance, market conditions, and the
appropriateness of imposing a fee or gate. As discussed in section III.A above, we believe funds
are likely to first impose fees in times of market stress and then to impose gates, but only if fees
fail to control redemptions. That said, the managers of a fund that experiences a credit event in
an otherwise healthy economy might instead choose to gate their fund to staunch redemptions,
forgoing a liquidity fee because liquidity costs are low. By forcing funds to precommit to fees or
gates (along with a floating NAV), this alternative limits funds’ ability to manage and mitigate
potential contagion from such redemptions.
2.

Alternatives in the FSOC Proposed Recommendations

As discussed in the Proposing Release, we considered a number of alternatives for
regulatory reform, including the reforms proposed by FSOC. We received comment on several
of these alternatives. After considering the comments that FSOC received on their proposed

666

reforms (the “FSOC Proposed Recommendations”), as well as the comments we received on the
Proposing Release and the economic analysis set forth in this Release, we have concluded that
these alternatives generally would not achieve our regulatory goals as well as the reforms we are
adopting today. We are, however, today adopting a floating NAV for institutional funds, which
was one proposed reform included in the FSOC Proposed Recommendations. We discuss below
these options, and our principal reasons for not adopting them (other than the floating NAV for
institutional prime money market funds).
In November 2012, the FSOC proposed to recommend that we undertake structural
reforms of money market funds. FSOC proposed three alternatives for consideration, which, it
stated, could be implemented individually or in combination. The first option 2058—requiring that
money market funds use a floating NAV—is one of the reforms we are adopting today for
institutional prime money market funds. We discuss this option in section III.B below. The
other two options in the FSOC Proposed Recommendations each would require that money
market funds maintain a NAV buffer, or a specified amount of additional assets available to
absorb daily fluctuations in the value of the fund’s portfolio securities. One option would require
that most money market funds have a risk-based NAV buffer of up to 1% to absorb day-to-day
fluctuations in the value of the funds’ portfolio securities and allow the funds to maintain a stable
NAV and that this NAV buffer be combined with a “minimum balance at risk.” 2059 The required
minimum size of a fund’s NAV buffer would be determined based on the composition of the
2058

See FSOC Proposed Recommendations, supra note 1562, at section V.A.

2059

Under the FSOC Proposed Recommendations, Treasury money market funds would not be subject to a
NAV buffer or a minimum balance at risk. See FSOC Proposed Recommendations, supra note 1562, at
sections V.B and V.C for a full discussion of these two alternatives. This section of the Release provides a
summary based on those sections of the FSOC Proposed Recommendation.

667

money market fund’s portfolio according to the following formula:
•

No buffer requirement for cash, Treasury securities, and repos collateralized
solely by cash and Treasury securities (“Treasury repo”);

•

A 0.75% buffer requirement for other daily liquid assets (or weekly liquid assets,
in the case of tax-exempt money market funds); and

•

A 1% buffer requirement for all other assets.

A fund whose NAV buffer fell below the required minimum amount would be required to
limit its new investments to cash, Treasury securities, and Treasury repos until its NAV buffer
was restored. A fund that completely exhausted its NAV buffer would be required to suspend
redemptions and liquidate or could continue to operate with a floating NAV indefinitely or until
it restored its NAV buffer.
A money market fund could use any funding method or combination of methods to build
the NAV buffer, and could vary these methods over time. The FSOC Proposed
Recommendations identified three funding methods that would be possible with Commission
relief from certain provisions of the Investment Company Act: (1) an escrow account that a
money market fund’s sponsor established and funded and that was pledged to support the fund’s
stable share price; (2) the money market fund’s issuance of a class of subordinated, nonredeemable equity securities (“buffer shares”) that would absorb first losses in the funds’
portfolios; and (3) the money market fund’s retention of some earnings that it would otherwise

668

distribute to shareholders (subject to certain tax limitations). 2060 We believe that the first funding
method would be the most likely approach for funding the buffer given the complexity of a fund
offering a new class of buffer shares (and the uncertainty of an active, liquid market for buffer
shares developing) and the tax limitations on the third method. 2061 We note, however, that we
believe this funding method is the most expensive of the three because of the opportunity costs
the fund’s sponsor would bear to the extent that the firms redirect this funding from other
essential activities, as further discussed below. 2062
The minimum balance at risk (“MBR”) would require that the last 3% of a shareholder’s
highest account value in excess of $100,000 during the previous 30 days (the shareholder’s MBR
or “holdback shares”) be redeemable only with a 30-day delay. 2063 All shareholders may redeem
97% of their holdings immediately without being restricted by the MBR. If the money market

Under the Internal Revenue Code, each year, mutual funds, including money market funds, must distribute
to shareholders at least 90% of their annual earnings or lose the ability to deduct dividends paid to their
shareholders. See, e.g., Comment Letter of the Investment Company Institute (May 16, 2012) (available in
File No. 4-619). We note that the retained earnings method is similar to how some money market funds
paid for insurance that was provided by ICI Mutual Insurance Company from 1993 to 2003. This insurance
covered losses on money market fund portfolio assets due to defaults and insolvencies but not from events
such as a security downgrade or a rise in interest rates. Coverage was limited to $50 million per fund, with
a deductible of the first 10 to 40 basis points of any loss. Premiums ranged from 1 to 3 basis points. See
PWG Report, supra note 506, at n.24 and accompanying text. Because of the tax disadvantages of this
funding method, it would take a long time for a NAV buffer of any size to build, particularly in the current
low interest rate environment.

2062

This funding method also could have the greatest competitive impacts on the money market fund industry,
as larger bank-affiliated sponsors would have less costly access to funding for the NAV buffer than
independent asset management firm sponsors. See, e.g., Comment Letter of The Systemic Risk Council
(Jan.18, 2013) (available in File No. FSOC 2012–0003) (“Systemic Risk Council FSOC Comment Letter”)
(“Capital requirements would likely encourage money market fund consolidation—particularly toward
larger bank-affiliated sponsors (who traditionally have, and can access, more capital than traditional,
independent asset managers). If so, this could further concentrate systemic risk from these institutions, and
create conflicts of interest in the short-term financing markets (as fewer money funds would control a
larger share of the short-term lending markets.”)).

fund suffers losses that exceed its NAV buffer, the losses would be borne first by the MBRs of
shareholders who have recently redeemed (i.e., their MBRs would be “subordinated”). The
extent of subordination of a shareholder’s MBR would be approximately proportionate to the
shareholder’s cumulative net redemptions during the prior 30 days—in other words, the more the
shareholder redeems, the more their holdback shares become “subordinated holdback shares.”
The last option in the FSOC Proposed Recommendations would require money market
funds to have a risk-based NAV buffer of up to 3% (which otherwise would have the same
structure as discussed above), and this larger NAV buffer could be combined with other
measures. 2064 The other measures discussed in the FSOC Proposed Recommendations include
more stringent investment diversification requirements (which we are generally adopting, as
discussed in section III.I above), increased minimum liquidity levels (which we are not
adopting), and more robust disclosure requirements (which we are generally adopting, as
discussed in sections III.E and III.F above). 2065
In the sections that follow, we discuss our evaluation of a NAV buffer requirement and
an MBR requirement for money market funds. We also discuss comments FSOC received on
these recommendations, and that we received on the Proposing Release. As we discuss in more
2064

See id, at section V.C.

2065

The FSOC Proposed Recommendations asked the Commission to consider increasing minimum weekly
liquidity requirements from 30% of total assets to 40% of total assets. The justification provided by FSOC
was that most funds already have weekly liquidity in excess of this 40% minimum level. We are not
adopting this alternative. There is no evidence that current liquidity requirements are inadequate, and
several commenters agreed. See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter, U.S. Bancorp Comment Letter, Federated
Comment Letter. For example, the DERA Study notes that the heightened redemption activity in the
summer of 2011 did not place undue burdens on MMFs when they sold assets to meet redemption requests.
No fund lost more than 50 basis points during this period nor did their shadow NAVs deviate significantly
from amortized cost. See DERA Study, supra note 24. We have therefore determined not to address
additional minimum liquidity requirements at this time.

670

detail below, the Commission is not pursuing these alternatives because we continue to believe
that the imposition of either a NAV buffer combined with a minimum balance at risk or a standalone NAV buffer, while advancing some of our goals for money market fund reform, might
prove costly for money market fund shareholders and could result in a contraction in the money
market fund industry that could harm the short-term financing markets and capital formation to a
greater degree than the reforms we are adopting today.
a.

NAV Buffer

Several commenters expressed support for a NAV buffer (which we did not propose),
although no commenters explicitly discussed an opposition to such a buffer as part of their
comments on this proposal. 2066 In particular, two commenters argued that a capital buffer would
reduce the incentives for a fund to take excessive risk and for investors to run. 2067 As discussed
in the Proposing Release, in considering a NAV buffer such as those recommended by FSOC as
a potential reform option for money market funds, we considered the benefits that such a buffer
could provide, as well as its costs. Our evaluation of what could be a reasonable size for a NAV
buffer also factored into our analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of these options. A
buffer can be designed to satisfy different potential objectives. A large buffer could protect
shareholders from losses related to defaults, such as the one experienced by the Reserve Primary
Fund following the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. However, if complete loss absorption is the
2066

See, e.g., Americans for Fin. Reform Comment Letter; Comment Letter of Dorothy B. Sherry (Sept. 21,
2013) (“Sherry Comment Letter”); Occupy the SEC Comment Letter. However, many commenters
opposed a NAV buffer when included as an alternative in the FSOC recommendation. See, e.g. Comment
Letter of Invesco Ltd. (Feb. 15, 2013) (available in File No. FSOC–2012–0003) (“Invesco FSOC Comment
Letter”); Blackrock FSOC Comment Letter; Comment Letter of Independent Directors Council (Jan. 23,
2013) (available in File No. FSOC–2012–0003) (“IDC FSOC Comment Letter”).

671

objective, a substantial buffer would be required, particularly given that money market funds can
hold up to 5% of their assets in a single security. 2068
Alternatively, if a buffer were not intended for complete loss absorption, but rather
designed primarily to absorb day-to-day variations in the market-based value of money market
funds’ portfolio holdings under normal market conditions, this would allow a fund to hold a
significantly smaller buffer. Accordingly, the relatively larger buffers contemplated in the FSOC
Proposed Recommendations 2069 must have been designed to absorb daily price fluctuations as
well as relatively large security defaults. 2070 In fact, a 3% buffer would accommodate all but

2068

Even commenters in favor of a buffer showed concern that FSOC’s proposed buffer size of 1% or 3% may
be inadequate. See, e.g., Federal Reserve Bank Presidents FSOC Comment Letter, supra note 47 (“For a
poorly diversified fund with portfolio assets that carry relatively more credit risk, a 3% (maximum) NAV
buffer may not be sufficient.”); Harvard Business School FSOC Comment Letter, supra note 47 (“For a
well-diversified portfolio, we estimate that MMFs should hold 3 to 4% capital against unsecured paper
issued by financial institutions, the primary asset held by MMFs. For more concentrated portfolios, we
estimate that the amount of capital should be considerably higher.”); Better Markets FSOC Comment
Letter, supra note 59 (“The primary shortcoming of [FSOC’s proposed buffer] is its low level of 1 or 3
percent…. [Any buffer] must be set at a level that is sufficient to cover all of these factors: projected and
historical losses; additional costs in the form of liquidity damages or government backstops; and investor
psychology in the face of possible financial shocks or crises. [….] Historical examples alone…indicate
that MMF losses have risen as high as 3.9 percent. This serves only as a floor regarding actual potential
losses, clearly indicating that the necessary buffer must be substantially higher than 3.9 percent.”);
Comment Letter of Occupy the SEC (Feb. 15, 2013) (available in File No. FSOC–2012–0003) (“Occupy
the SEC FSOC Comment Letter”), supra note 52 (arguing that FSOC’s proposed buffer does not go far
enough in accounting for potential risks in a fund’s portfolio. Instead, the approach should be a two-layer
buffer, with a first layer of up to 3% depending on the portfolio’s credit rating and a second layer to be
sized according to the concentration of the portfolio).

2069

While the second alternative in the FSOC Proposed Recommendation only includes a NAV buffer of up to
1%, it was combined with a 3% MBR, which would effectively provide the fund with a 4% buffer before
non-redeeming shareholders in the fund suffered losses.

2070

For example, beginning in September 2008, money market funds that chose to participate in the Treasury
Temporary Guarantee Program were required to file with the Treasury their weekly shadow price if it was
below $0.9975. Our staff has reviewed the data, and found that through October 17, 2008, only three funds
carried losses larger than four percent, and only five funds carried losses larger than three percent.
Reported shadow prices excluded the value of any capital support agreements in place at the time, but in
some cases included sponsor-provided capital contributions to the fund. Not every money market fund that
applied to participate in the program reported shadow price data for every day during the period between
September 1, 2008 and October 17, 2008. See also Patrick E. McCabe et al., The Minimum Balance at
Risk: A Proposal to Mitigate the Systemic Risks Posed by Money Market Funds, at 31, Table 2 Federal

672

extremely large losses, such as those experienced during the crisis. However, a buffer that was
designed to absorb such large losses may be too high and too costly because the opportunity cost
of this capital would be borne at all times even though it was likely to be drawn upon to any
degree only rarely. Two commenters disagreed, noting that a capital buffer in the range of three
to four percent would reduce yields for ordinary investors by about five basis points. 2071
However, another commenter asserted that a capital buffer would have a much more dramatic
effect on yields by effectively turning prime money market funds into synthetic Treasury
funds. 2072 Accordingly, as we discuss below, a buffer of the size contemplated by either
alternative in the FSOC Proposed Recommendations appears to be too costly to be
practicable. 2073
i.

Benefits of a NAV Buffer

As discussed in the Proposing Release, the FSOC Proposed Recommendations discusses
a number of potential benefits that a NAV buffer could provide to money market funds and their

Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report No. 564, July 2012 (providing additional statistical analysis of
shadow price information reported by money market funds filing under the Treasury Temporary Guarantee
Program). During that period there were over 800 money market funds based on Form N-SAR data.
2071

See Americans for Fin. Reform Comment Letter; Squam Lake Comment Letter.

See Craig M. Lewis, The Economic Implications of Money Market Fund Capital Buffers (Nov. 2013),
available at http://www.sec.gov/divisions/riskfin/workingpapers/rsfi-wp2014-01.pdf (“Lewis”).

2073

There is another potential adverse effect of requiring large NAV buffers for money market funds to address
risk from systemic events. According to the FSOC Proposed Recommendations, outflows from
institutional prime money market funds following the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy tended to be larger
among money market funds with sponsors that were themselves under stress, indicating that investors
redeemed shares when concerned about sponsors’ potential inability to support ailing funds. But these
sponsors were the ones most likely to need funding dedicated to the buffer for other purposes. As a result,
larger buffers may negatively affect other important activities of money market fund sponsors and cause
them to fail faster.

673

investors, many of which we discuss below. 2074 As noted by commenters, it would preserve
money market funds’ stable share price and potentially increase the stability of the funds, but
would likely reduce the yields (and in the option that combines a 1% NAV buffer with an MBR,
the liquidity) that money market funds currently offer to investors. 2075 Like the reforms we are
adopting today, the NAV buffer presents trade-offs between stability, yield, and liquidity.
In effect, depending on the size of the buffer, a buffer could provide various levels of
coverage of losses due to both the illiquidity and credit deterioration of portfolio securities.
Money market funds that are supported by a NAV buffer would be more resilient to redemptions
and credit or liquidity changes in their portfolios than stable value money market funds without a
buffer (the current baseline). 2076 As long as the NAV buffer is funded at necessary levels, each
$1.00 in money market fund shares is backed by $1.00 in fund assets, eliminating the incentive
of shareholders to redeem at $1.00 when the market-based value of their shares is worth less.
This reduces shareholders’ incentive to redeem shares quickly in response to small losses or
concerns about the quality and liquidity of the money market fund portfolio, discussed in section
II.B above, particularly during periods when the underlying portfolio has significant unrealized
capital losses and the fund has not broken the buck. As long as the expected effect on the
portfolio from potential losses is smaller than the NAV buffer, investors would be protected—
they would continue to receive a stable value for their shares.
A second benefit is that a NAV buffer would force money market funds to provide

674

explicit capital support rather than the implicit and uncertain support that is permitted under the
current regulatory baseline. This would require funds to internalize some of the cost of the
discretionary capital support sometimes provided to money market funds and to define in
advance how losses will be allocated. In addition, as noted by commenters, a NAV buffer could
reduce fund managers’ incentives to take risk beyond what is desired by fund shareholders
because investing in less risky securities reduces the probability of buffer depletion. 2077
Another potential benefit is that a NAV buffer might provide counter-cyclical capital to
the money market fund industry. This is because once a buffer is funded it remains in place
regardless of redemption activity. With a buffer, redemptions increase the relative size of the
buffer because the same dollar buffer now supports fewer assets. 2078 As an example, consider a
fund with a 1% NAV buffer that experiences a 25 basis point portfolio loss, which then triggers
redemptions of 20% of its assets. The NAV buffer, as a proportion of fund assets and prior to
any replenishment, will increase from 75 basis points after the loss to 93.75 basis points after the
redemptions. This illustrates how the NAV buffer strengthens the ability of the fund to absorb
further losses, reducing investors’ incentive to redeem shares. This result contrasts to the current
regulatory baseline under rule 2a-7 where redemptions amplify the impact of losses by

2077

See, e.g., Harvard Business School FSOC Comment Letter, supra note 47 (“Capital buffers also mean that
there is an investor class that explicitly bears losses and has incentives to curb ex ante risk taking.”);
Americans for Fin. Reform Comment Letter; Hanson et al. Comment Letter; and Squam Lake Comment
Letter.

2078

See, e.g., Comment Letter of J.P. Morgan Asset Management (Jan. 14, 2013) (available in File No. FSOC–
2012–0003) (“J.P. Morgan FSOC Comment Letter”) (“[W]here capital support is utilized as a first loss
position upon liquidation, the level of capital can be tied to a MMF’s highest asset levels. This can result in
a structure whereby, as redemptions accelerate and cause the unrealized loss per share to increase further,
the amount of capital support available per share increases accordingly, providing further capital support to
the remaining shareholders that do not redeem their shares.”).

675

distributing them over a smaller investor base. For example, suppose a fund with a shadow price
of $1.00 (i.e., no embedded losses) experiences a 25 basis point loss, which causes its shadow
price to fall to $0.9975. If 20% of the fund’s shares are then redeemed at $1.00, its shadow price
will fall to $0.9969, reflecting a loss that is 24% greater than the loss precipitating the
redemptions.
Finally, by allowing money market funds to absorb small losses in portfolio securities
without affecting their ability to transact at a stable price per share, a NAV buffer may facilitate
and protect capital formation in short-term financing markets during periods of modest stress.
Currently, money market fund portfolio managers are limited in their ability to sell portfolio
securities when markets are under stress because they have little ability to absorb losses without
causing a fund’s shadow NAV to drop below $1.00 (or embed losses in the fund’s market-based
NAV per share). As a result, managers tend to avoid trading when markets are strained,
contributing to further illiquidity in the short-term financing markets in such circumstances. A
NAV buffer should enable funds to absorb small losses and thus could reduce this tendency.
Thus, by adding resiliency to money market funds and enhancing their ability to absorb losses, a
NAV buffer may benefit capital formation in the long term. A more stable money market fund
industry may produce more stable short-term financing markets, which would provide more
reliability as to the demand for short-term credit to the economy.
ii.

Costs of a NAV Buffer

The Proposing Release also recognized that there are significant ongoing costs associated
with a NAV buffer. Some commenters agreed that a capital buffer would impose a cost on funds
and their investors, but these commenters claimed that the magnitude of the costs would be

676

relatively modest. 2079 For the reasons discussed below, we disagree with these commenters that
the costs would be relatively modest. Costs can be divided into direct costs that affect money
market fund sponsors or investors and indirect costs that impact capital formation. In addition, a
NAV buffer does not protect shareholders completely from the possibility of heightened rapid
redemption activity during periods of market stress, particularly in periods where the buffer is at
risk of depletion. As the buffer becomes impaired (or if shareholders believe the fund may suffer
a loss that exceeds the size of its NAV buffer), shareholders have an incentive to redeem shares
quickly because, once the buffer fails, the fund will no longer be able to maintain a stable value
and shareholders will experience sudden losses. 2080 Such rapid severe redemptions could impair
the fund’s business model and viability.
Another possible implication is that money market funds with buffers may avoid holding
riskier short-term debt securities (like commercial paper) and instead hold a higher amount of
low yielding investments like cash, Treasury securities, or Treasury repos. This could lead
money market funds to hold more conservative portfolios than investors may prefer, given
tradeoffs between principal stability, liquidity, and yield. 2081

2079

See Americans for Fin. Reform Comment Letter; Hanson et al. Comment Letter; Squam Lake Comment
Letter.

2080

See, e.g., Systemic Risk Council FSOC Comment Letter (stating that capital is difficult to set and is
imperfect, that “[g]iven the lack of data and impossibility of modeling future events, even [a 3% NAV
buffer] runs the risk of being too high, or too low to protect the system in the future” and that “too little
capital could provide a false sense of security in a crisis”). See also infra note 2091 and accompanying
discussion.

2081

But see, e.g., U.S. Chamber FSOC Comment Letter (arguing that “a NAV buffer is likely to incentivize
sponsors to reach for yield.”); Vanguard FSOC Comment Letter (“Capital buffers are also likely to carry
unintended consequences, as some funds may purchase riskier, higher-yielding securities to compensate for
the reduction in yield. As a result, capital buffers are likely to provide investors with a false sense of
security.”); Federated V Comment Letter (“If anything, creating a junior class of equity puts earnings
pressure on an MMF to alter its balance sheet to decrease near-term liquid assets to generate investment

677

The most significant indirect cost of a NAV buffer is the opportunity cost associated with
maintaining a NAV buffer. 2082 Those contributing to the buffer essentially deploy valuable
scarce resources to maintain a NAV buffer rather than being able to use the funds elsewhere.
The cost of diverting funds for this purpose represents a significant incremental cost of doing
business for those providing the buffer funding. We cannot provide estimates of these
opportunity costs because the relevant data is not currently available to the Commission.2083
The second indirect cost of a NAV buffer is the equilibrium rate of return that a provider
of funding for a NAV buffer would demand. 2084 An entity that provides such funding, possibly
the fund sponsor, would expect to be paid a return that sets the market value of the buffer equal
to the amount of the capital contribution. Since a NAV buffer is designed to absorb the same
amount of risk regardless of its size, as noted by at least one commenter, the promised yield, or
cost of the buffer, increases with the relative amount of risk it is expected to absorb. 2085 This is a

returns available from longer-term, higher risk investments in order to either build capital through retained
earnings or to compensate investors who have invested in the new class of subordinated equity capital of
the MMF.”).
2082

See Lewis, supra note 2072.

2083

The opportunity costs would represent the net present value of these forgone opportunities, an amount that
cannot be estimated without relevant data about each firm’s productive opportunities. However, a number
of FSOC commenters have already cautioned that a NAV buffer could make money market funds
unprofitable. See, e.g., Angel FSOC Comment Letter (stating that “in today’s low yield environment, even
five basis points [of cost associated with a NAV buffer] would push most money market funds into
negative yield territory.”); BlackRock FSOC Comment Letter (“[A]ny capital over 0.75% will make the
MMF product uneconomical for sponsors to offer.”); Comment Letter of Federated Investors, Inc. (Feb. 15.
2013) (available in File No. FSOC–2012–0003) (“Federated Investors Feb. 15 FSOC Comment Letter”)

provided by the ICI.).

well-known leverage effect. 2086
One could analogize a NAV buffer to bank capital by considering the similarities
between money market funds with a NAV buffer and banks with capital. A traditional bank
generally finances long-term assets (customer loans) with short-term liabilities (demand
deposits). The Federal Reserve Board, as part of its prudential regulation, requires banks to
adhere to certain minimum capital requirements. 2087 Bank capital, among other functions,
provides a buffer that allows banks to withstand a certain amount of sudden demands for
liquidity and losses without becoming insolvent and thus needing to draw upon federal deposit
insurance or other aspects of the regulatory safety net for banks. 2088 The fact that the bank assets
have a long maturity and are illiquid compared to the bank’s liabilities results in a maturity and
liquidity mismatch problem that creates the possibility of a depositor run during periods of
stress. 2089 Capital is one part of a prudential regulatory framework employed to deter runs in

2086

The leverage effect reflects the concept that higher leverage levels induce an equity holder to demand
higher returns to compensate for the higher risk levels.

2087

See the Federal Reserve Board’s website on Capital Guidelines and Adequacy, available at
http://www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/topics/capital.htm, for an overview of minimum capital
requirements.

2088

See, e.g., Allen N. Berger et al., The Role of Capital in Financial Institutions, 19 J. OF BANKING AND FIN.
393 (1995) (“Berger”) (“Regulators require capital for almost all the same reasons that other uninsured
creditors of banks ‘require’ capital—to protect themselves against the costs of financial distress, agency
problems, and the reduction in market discipline caused by the safety net.”).

2089

More generally, banks are structured to satisfy depositors’ preference for access to their money on demand
with businesses’ preference for a source of longer-term capital. However, the maturity and liquidity
transformation provided by banks can also lead to runs. Deposit insurance, access to a lender of last resort,
and other bank regulatory tools are designed to lessen the incentive of depositors to run. See, e.g., Douglas
W. Diamond & Philip H. Dybvig, Bank Runs, Deposit Insurance, and Liquidity, 91 J. POL. ECON 401 (June
1983) (“Diamond & Dybvig”); Mark J. Flannery, Financial Crises, Payment System Problems, and

banks and generally protect the safety and soundness of the banking system. A money market
fund with a NAV buffer has been described as essentially a “special purpose bank” where fund
shareholders’ equity is equivalent to demand deposits and a NAV buffer is analogous to the
bank’s capital. 2090 Since a NAV buffer is effectively a leveraged position in the underlying assets
of the fund that is designed to absorb interest rate risk and mitigate default risk, a provider of
buffer funding should demand a return that reflects the fund’s aggregate cost of capital plus
compensation for the fraction of default risk it is capable of absorbing.
The effectiveness of a NAV buffer to protect against large-scale redemptions during
periods of stress is predicated upon whether shareholders expect the decline in the value of the
fund’s portfolio to be less than the value of the NAV buffer. Once investors anticipate that the
buffer will be depleted, they have an incentive to redeem before it is completely depleted. 2091 In
this sense, a NAV buffer that is not sufficiently large is incapable of fully mitigating the
possibility of a liquidity run. The drawback with increasing buffer size to address this risk,
however, is that the opportunity costs of operating a buffer increase as the size of the buffer
increases. Due to the correlated nature of portfolio holdings across money market funds, this
could amplify market-wide run risk if NAV buffer impairment also is highly correlated across
2090

See, e.g., Gary Gorton & George Pennacchi, Money Market Funds and Finance Companies: Are They the
Banks of the Future?, in STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN BANKING (Michael Klausner & Lawrence J. White, eds.
1993), at 173-214.

2091

See, e.g., Federal Reserve Bank Presidents FSOC Comment Letter (“The [FSOC] Proposal notes that a
fund depleting its NAV buffer would be required to suspend redemptions and liquidate under rule 22e-3 or
continue operating as a floating NAV fund. However, this sequence of events could be destabilizing.
Investors in 3% NAV buffer funds may be quite risk averse, even more so than floating NAV MMF
investors might be, given their revealed preference for stable NAV shares. If they foresee a possible
conversion to floating NAV once the buffer is depleted, these risk-averse investors would have an incentive
to redeem prior to conversion. If, on the other hand, investors foresee a suspension of redemptions, they
would presumably have an even stronger incentive to redeem before facing a liquidity freeze when the
NAV buffer is completely depleted.”).

680

money market funds. The incentive to redeem could be further amplified if, as contemplated in
the FSOC Proposed Recommendations, a NAV buffer failure would require a money market
fund to either liquidate or convert to a floating NAV. If investors anticipate this occurring, some
investors that value principal stability and liquidity may no longer view money market funds as
viable investments.
As noted above, substantial NAV buffers may be able to absorb much, if not all, of the
default risk in the underlying portfolio of a money market fund. This implies that any
compensation for bearing default risk will be transferred from current money market fund
shareholders to those financing the NAV buffer, effectively converting a prime money market
fund into a fund that mimics the return of a Treasury fund for current money market fund
shareholders. If fund managers are unable to pass through the yield associated with holding
relatively riskier securities (compared to government securities), like commercial paper or shortterm municipal securities, to money market fund shareholders, it is likely that they will reduce
their investment in these securities. 2092 While lower yields would reduce, but not necessarily
eliminate, the utility of the product to investors, it could have a negative impact on capital
formation. Since the probability of breaking the buck is higher for a money market fund that
invests in these relatively riskier securities (e.g., a fund with a WAM of 90 days rather than one
with a WAM of 60 days) 2093 and fund managers cannot pass through the higher associated yields,
it is likely that managers will reduce investments in these securities because they cannot
differentiate their funds on the basis of yield.
2092

But see supra note 2081.

2093

See DERA Study, supra note 24, at 28-31.

681

In addition, many investors are attracted to money market funds because they provide a
stable value but have higher rates of return than Treasury securities. These higher rates of return
are intended to compensate for exposure to greater credit risk and potential volatility than
Treasury securities. As a result of funding the buffer, the returns to money market fund
shareholders are likely to decline, potentially reducing demand from investors who are attracted
to money market funds for their higher yield than alternative stable value investments. 2094
Taken together, the demand by investors for some yield and the incentives for fund
managers to reduce portfolio risk may impact competition and capital formation in two ways.
First, investors seeking higher yield may move their funds to other alternative investment
vehicles resulting in a contraction in the money market fund industry. In addition, fund
managers may have an incentive to reduce the funds’ investment in commercial paper or shortterm municipal securities in order to reduce the volatility of cash flows and increase the
resilience of the NAV buffer. In both of these cases, there may be an effect on the short-term
financing markets if the decrease in demand for short-term securities from money market funds
results in an increase in the cost of capital for issuers of commercial paper and other securities.
We have carefully considered the comments received on both the PWG report and our
Proposing Release regarding the NAV buffer alternative and we continue to believe that our
original analysis of the costs and benefits remains appropriate. Specifically, we continue to
2094

See, e.g., Invesco FSOC Comment Letter (“As a result of the ongoing ultra-low interest rate environment,
MMF yields remain at historic lows … A requirement to divert a portion of a MMF’s earnings in order to
build a NAV buffer would result in prime MMF yields essentially equaling those of Treasury MMFs
(which would not be required to maintain a buffer under the Proposal). Faced with the choice of equivalent
yields but asymmetrical risks, logical investors would abandon prime funds for Treasury funds, potentially
triggering the very instability that reforms are intended to prevent and vastly reducing corporate borrowers’
access to short-term financing.”).

682

believe that a NAV buffer should not be adopted because we feel that a NAV buffer would
reduce yields on money market funds and would therefore render such funds to be unattractive to
many investors to a greater extent than the reforms we are adopting.
b.

Minimum Balance at Risk

As discussed above, under the second alternative in the FSOC Proposed
Recommendations, a 1% capital buffer is paired with an MBR or a holdback of a certain portion
of a shareholder’s money market fund shares. 2095 In the event of fund losses, this alternative
effectively would create a “waterfall” with the NAV buffer bearing first losses, subordinated
holdback shares bearing second losses, followed by non-subordinated holdback shares, and
finally by the remaining shares in the fund (and then only if the loss exceeded the aggregate
value of the holdback shares). This allocation of losses, in effect, would impose a “liquidity fee”
on redeeming shareholders if the fund experiences a loss that exceeds the NAV buffer. The
value of the holdback shares effectively provides the non-redeeming shareholders with an
additional buffer cushion when the NAV buffer is exhausted. The Commission did not receive
any comments on this alternative, and, as discussed below, we continue to believe that a
minimum balance at risk is not the most appropriate alternative to meet the policy goals of our
reforms.
i.

Benefits of a Minimum Balance at Risk

As discussed in the Proposing Release, an MBR requirement could provide some benefits
to money market funds. First, it would force redeeming shareholders to pay for the cost of

2095

683

liquidity during periods of severe market stress when liquidity is particularly costly. Such a
requirement could create an incentive against shareholders participating in a run on a fund facing
potential losses of certain sizes because shareholders will incur greater losses if they redeem. 2096
It thus may reduce the amount of less liquid securities that funds would need to sell in the
secondary markets at unfavorable prices to satisfy redemptions and therefore may increase
stability in the short-term financing markets.
Second, it would allocate liquidity costs to investors demanding liquidity when the fund
itself is under severe stress. This would be accomplished primarily by making redeeming
shareholders bear first losses when the fund first depletes its buffer and then the fund’s value
falls below its stable share price within 30 days after their redemption. Redeeming shareholders
subject to the holdback are the ones whose redemptions may have contributed to fund losses if
securities are sold at fire sale prices to satisfy those redemptions. If the fund sells assets to meet
redemptions, the costs of doing so would be incurred while the redeeming investor is still in the
fund because of the delay in redeeming his or her holdback shares. Essentially, investors would
face a choice between redeeming to preserve liquidity and remaining invested in the fund to
protect their principal.
Third, an MBR would provide the fund with 30 days to obtain cash to satisfy the
holdback portion of a shareholder’s redemption. This may give the fund time for distressed
securities to recover when, for example, the market has acquired additional information about the
ability of the issuer to make payment upon maturity. As of February 28, 2014, 43% of prime

See, e.g., Comment Letter of Jeffrey Gordon (Feb. 28, 2013) (available in File No. FSOC–2012–0003)
(“Gordon FSOC Comment Letter”) (“[T]he Minimum Balance at Risk feature is a novel way to reduce
MMF run risk by imposing some of the run costs on the users of MMFs.”).

684

money market fund assets had a maturity of 30 days or less. 2097 Thus, an MBR would provide
time for potential losses in fund portfolios to be avoided since distressed securities could trade at
a heavy discount in the market but may ultimately pay in full at maturity. This added resiliency
could not only benefit the fund and its investors, but it also could reduce the contagion risk that a
run on a single fund can cause when assets are correlated across the money market fund industry.
ii.

Costs of a Minimum Balance at Risk

However, we also recognized that there are a number of drawbacks to an MBR
requirement. It forces shareholders that redeem more than 97% of their assets to pay for any
losses, if incurred, on the entire portfolio on a ratable basis. Rather than simply delaying
redemption requests, the contingent nature of the way losses are distributed among shareholders
forces early redeeming investors to bear the losses they are trying to avoid.
As discussed in section III.A.1 above, there may be a tendency for a money market fund
to meet redemptions by selling assets that are the most liquid and have the smallest capital
losses. Liquid assets may be sold first because managers can trade at close to their nondistressed valuations because they do not typically experience large liquidity discounts.
Managers also tend to sell assets whose market-based values are close to or exceed amortized
cost because realized capital gains and losses will be reflected in a fund’s shadow price. Assets
that are highly liquid will not be sold at significant discounts to fair value. Since the liquidity
discount associated with the sale of liquid assets is smaller than that for illiquid assets,
shareholders can continue to immediately redeem shares at $1.00 per share under an MBR

computing the fund’s weighted average life.

685

provided the fund is capable of selling liquid assets. Once a fund exhausts its supply of liquid
assets, it will sell less liquid assets to meet redemption requests, possibly at a loss. If in fact
assets are sold at a loss, the stable value of the fund’s shares could be impaired, motivating
shareholders to be the first to leave. Therefore, even with a NAV buffer and an MBR there
continues to be an incentive to redeem in times of fund and market stress. 2098
The MBR, which applies to all redemptions without regard to the fund’s circumstances at
the time of redemption, constantly restricts some portion of an investor’s holdings. Under the
resulting continuous impairment of full liquidity, many current investors who value liquidity in
money market funds may shift their investment to other short-term investments that offer higher
yields or fewer restrictions on redemptions. A reduction in the number of money market funds
and/or the amount of money market fund assets under management as a result of any further
money market fund reforms would have a greater negative impact on money market fund
sponsors whose fund groups consist primarily of money market funds, as opposed to sponsors
that offer a more diversified range of mutual funds or engage in other financial activities (e.g.,
brokerage). Given that money market funds’ largest commercial paper exposure is to issuances
by financial institutions, 2099 a reduction in the demand of money market instruments may have an
impact on the ability of financial institutions to issue commercial paper. 2100

2098

See, e.g., Comment Letter of Federated Investors, Inc. (Dec. 17, 2012) (available in File No. FSOC-20120003) (“The data, analyses, surveys and other commentary in the SEC’s docket show convincingly that the
MBR/capital proposal’s impact in reducing runs is speculative and unproven and in fact could and likely
would precipitate runs under certain circumstances.”); Comment Letter of Charles Schwab (Jan. 17, 2013)
(available in File No. FSOC–2012–0003) (“[I]t is not clear to us that holding back a certain percentage of a
client’s funds would reduce run risk.”)

See, e.g., Wells Fargo FSOC Comment Letter (“the MBR requirement would have the anticipated impact of

686

The MBR would introduce additional complexity to what to-date has been a relatively
simple product for investors to understand. For example, requiring shareholders that redeem
more than 97% of their balances to bear the first loss creates a cash flow waterfall that is
complex and that may be difficult for unsophisticated investors to understand fully. 2101
Implementing an MBR could involve significant operational costs. These would include
costs to convert existing shares or issue new holdback and subordinated holdback shares and
changes to systems that would allow record-keepers to account for and track the MBR and
allocation of unrestricted, holdback or subordinated holdback shares in shareholder accounts.
We expect that these costs would vary significantly among funds depending on a variety of
factors. In addition, funds subject to an MBR may have to amend or adopt new governing
documents to issue different classes of shares with different rights: unrestricted shares, holdback
shares, and subordinated holdback shares. 2102 The costs to amend governing documents would
vary based on the jurisdiction in which the fund is organized and the amendment processes
enumerated in the fund’s governing documents, including whether board or shareholder approval
driving investors and sponsors out of money market funds. We expect that the resulting contraction of
assets in the money market fund industry would, in turn, have disruptive effects on the short-term money
markets, decrease the supply of capital and/or raise the cost of borrowing for businesses, states,
municipalities and other local governments that rely on money market funds, and jeopardize the fragile
state of the economy and its long-term growth prospects.”).
2101

Several commenters have noted that the MBR would be confusing to retail investors. See, e.g., Comment
Letter of Fidelity Investments (Feb. 14, 2013) (available in File No. FSOC–2012–0003); Comment Letter
of T. Rowe Price (Jan. 30, 2013) (available in File No. FSOC–2012–0003).

2102

One commenter on the PWG Report suggested that the MBR framework may be achieved by issuing
different classes of shares with conversion features triggered by shareholder activity. See Comment Letter
of Federated Investors, Inc. (Mar. 16, 2012) (available in File No. 4-619). Multiple class structures are
common among funds offering different arrangements for the payment of distribution costs and related
shareholder services. Funds have also developed the operational capacity to track and convert certain share
classes to others based on the redemption activity of the shareholder. See Mutual Fund Distribution Fees;
Confirmations, Investment Company Act Release No. 29367 (July 21, 2010) [75 FR 47064 (Aug. 4,
2010)], at section III.D.1.b.

687

is necessary. 2103 The costs of obtaining shareholder approval, amending governing documents, or
changing domicile would depend on a number of factors, including the size and the number of
shareholders of the fund. 2104
As noted above, we did not receive any comments on the MBR alternative based on our
discussion of it in the Proposing Release and we continue to believe that overall, the complexity
of an MBR may be more costly for unsophisticated investors because they may not fully
appreciate the implications. In addition, money market funds and their intermediaries (and
money market fund shareholders that have in place cash management systems) could incur
potentially significant operational costs to modify their systems to reflect a MBR requirement.
We believe that an MBR coupled with a NAV buffer would turn money market funds into a
more complex instrument whose valuation may become more difficult for investors to
understand.

Alternatives in the PWG Report

As discussed in the Proposing Release, we considered each option discussed in the
President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, which published a report on money market
fund reform options in 2010 (the “PWG Report”). 2105 We discussed these alternatives in the

FSOC–2012–0003); March 2012 PWG Comment Letter.

2104

Other factors may include the concentration of fund shares among certain shareholders, the number of
objecting beneficial owners and non-objecting beneficial owners of street name shareholders, whether
certain costs can be shared among funds in the same family, whether the fund employs a proxy solicitor and
the services the proxy solicitor may provide, and whether the fund, in connection with sending a proxy
statement to shareholders, uses the opportunity to have shareholders vote on other matters. Other matters
that may be set forth in the proxy materials include the election of directors, a change in investment
objectives or fundamental investment restrictions, and fund reorganization or re-domicile.

Proposing Release, and the comments that we had received on several of these alternatives, as
discussed below. We have decided not to pursue these options because we believe, after
considering the comments we received on the PWG Report, as well as the comments we received
on the Proposing Release and the economic analysis set forth in this Release, that they would not
achieve our regulatory goals as well as the package of reforms that we are adopting today. We
discuss below these options, and our principal reasons for not adopting them. 2106
a.

Private Emergency Liquidity Facility

As discussed in the Proposing Release, one option outlined by the PWG Report, is a
private emergency liquidity facility (“LF”) for money market funds. 2107 One comment letter on
the PWG Report proposed a structure for such a facility in some detail. 2108 Under this proposal,
the LF would be organized as a state-chartered bank or trust company. Sponsors of prime money
market funds would be required to provide initial capital to the LF in an amount based on their
assets under management up to 4.9% of the LF’s total initial equity, but with a minimum
investment amount. The LF also would charge participating funds commitment fees of 3 basis
points per year on fund assets under management. Finally, at the end of its third year, the LF
would issue to third parties time deposits paying a rate approximately equal to the 3-month bank
CD rate. The LF would be designed to provide initially $7 billion in backup redemption
releases/Documents/10.21%20PWG%20Report%20Final.pdf. The members of the PWG included the
Secretary of the Treasury Department (as chairman of the PWG), the Chairman of the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System, the Chairman of the SEC, and the Chairman of the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission.
2106

We note we may not have the legal authority to implement some of the alternatives discussed below, even
were we to find that they might help achieve our regulatory goals.

liquidity to prime money market funds, $12.3 billion at the end of the first year, $30 billion at the
end of five years, and $50-55 billion at the end of year 10 (these figures take into account the
LF’s ability to expand its capacity by borrowing through the Federal Reserve’s discount
window). The LF would be leveraged at inception, but would seek to achieve and maintain a
minimum leverage ratio of 5%. Each fund would be able to obtain a maximum amount of cash
from the LF. The LF would not provide credit support. It would not provide liquidity to a fund
that had “broken the buck” or would “break the buck” after using the LF. There also would be
eligibility requirements for money market fund access to the LF.
Participating funds would elect a board of directors that would oversee the LF, with
representation from large, medium, and smaller money market fund complexes. The LF would
have restrictions on the securities that it could purchase from funds seeking liquidity and on the
LF’s investment portfolio. The LF would be able to pledge approved securities (less a haircut) to
the Federal Reserve discount window. We note that the interaction with the Federal Reserve
discount window (as well as the bank structure of the LF) means that the Commission does not
have regulatory authority to create the LF.
An LF could lessen and internalize some of the liquidity risk of money market funds that
contributes to their vulnerability to liquidity runs by acting as a purchaser of last resort if a
liquidity event is triggered. It also could create efficiency gains by pooling this liquidity risk
within the money market fund industry. 2109 Commenters on the PWG Report addressing this
option generally supported the concept of the LF, stating that it would facilitate money market

economics of using a liquidity facility to stop runs, see Diamond & Dybvig, supra note 2089.

funds internalizing the costs of liquidity and other risks associated with their operations through
the cost of participation. In addition, such a facility could reduce contagion effects by limiting
the need for fire sales of money market fund assets to satisfy redemption pressures. 2110
However, several commenters expressed reservations regarding this reform option. For
example, one commenter supported “the idea” of such a facility “in that it could provide an
incremental liquidity cushion for the industry,” but noted that “it is difficult to ensure that [a
liquidity facility] with finite purchasing capacity is fairly administered in a crisis…, [which]
could lead to [money market funds] attempting to optimize the outcome for themselves, rather
than working cooperatively to solve a systemic crisis.” 2111 This commenter also stated that
shared capital “poses the danger of increased risk-taking by industry participants who believe
that they have access to a large collective pool of capital.” 2112 Another commenter, although
“receptive to a private liquidity facility,” expressed concern that the facility itself might be
vulnerable to runs if the facility raises funding through the short-term financing markets. 2113 This
commenter also noted other challenges in designing such a facility, including governance issues
and “the fact that because of its size, the liquidity facility would only be able to address the
liquidity needs of a very limited number of funds and would not be able to meet the needs of the

Id. In the case of deposit insurance, bank capital is used to overcome the moral hazard problem of
excessive risk taking. See, e.g., Berger, supra note 2088; Michael C. Keeley & Frederick T. Furlong, A

entire industry in the event of a run.” 2114 Another commenter expressed concerns that “the costs,
infrastructure and complications associated with private liquidity facilities are not worth the
minimal liquidity that would be provided.” 2115 Finally, another commenter echoed this concern,
stating:
[a private liquidity facility] cannot possibly eliminate completely the risk of breaking the
buck without in effect eliminating maturity transformation, for instance through the
imposition of capital and liquidity standards on the private facilities. Thus, in the case of
a pervasive financial shock to asset values, [money market fund] shareholders will almost
certainly view the presence of private facilities as a weak reed and widespread runs are
likely to develop. In turn, government aid is likely to flow. Because shareholders will
expect government aid in a pervasive financial crisis, shareholder and [money market
fund] investment decisions will be distorted. Therefore, we view emergency facilities as
perhaps a valuable enhancement, but not a reliable overall solution either to the problem
of runs or to the broader problem of distorted investment decisions. 2116
A private liquidity facility was also discussed at the 2011 Roundtable, where many
participants made points and expressed concerns similar to those discussed above. 2117

See, e.g., Roundtable Transcript, supra note 63. (Brian Reid, Investment Company Institute) (discussing the
basic concept for a private liquidity facility as proposed by the Investment Company Institute and its
potential advantages providing additional liquidity to money market funds when market makers were
unwilling or unable to do so); (Paul Tucker, Bank of England) (discussing the potential policy issues

692

The Commission did not receive any comments regarding this alternative after we
proposed our reforms. However, as noted in the Proposing Release, we have considered
comments on the PWG Report, and our staff has spent considerable time evaluating whether an
LF would successfully mitigate the risk of liquidity runs in money market funds and change the
economic incentives of market participants. We continue to believe that this alternative should
not be adopted for the reasons discussed in the Proposing Release, including, foremost because
we are concerned that a private liquidity facility would not have sufficient purchasing capacity in
the event of a widespread run without access to the Federal Reserve’s discount window and we
do not have legal authority to grant discount window access to an LF. Access to the discount
window would raise complicated policy considerations and likely would require legislation. 2118
In addition, such a facility would not protect money market funds from capital losses triggered
by credit events as the facility would purchase securities at the prevailing market price. Thus, we
are concerned that such a facility without additional loss protection would not sufficiently
prevent widespread liquidity-induced runs on money market funds.

Federal Reserve Board) (discussing the potential policy issues involved in the Federal Reserve extending
discount window access to such a facility); (Jeffrey A. Goldstein, Department of Treasury) (questioning
whether there were potential capacity issues with such a facility); (Sheila C. Bair, Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation) (stating her belief that “the better approach would be to try to reduce or eliminate
the systemic risk, as opposed to just kind of acknowledge it” and institutionalize a “bailout facility” in a
way that would exacerbate moral hazard).
2118

See, e.g., id. (Paul Tucker, Bank of England) (“As I understand it, this is a bank whose sole purpose is to
stand between the Federal Reserve and the money market mutual fund industry. If I think about that as a
central banker, I think ‘So, I’m lending to the money market mutual fund industry.’ What do I think about
the regulation of the money market mutual fund industry? …And the other thought I think I would have
is…‘If the money market mutual fund industry can do this, what’s to stop other parts of our economy doing
this and tapping into the special ability of the central bank to create liquidity’…It’s almost to bring out the
enormity of the idea that you have floated…it’s posing very big questions indeed, about who should have
direct access and to the nature of the monetary economy.”)

693

We also continue to be concerned about the conflicts of interest inherent in any such
facility given that it would be managed by a diverse money market fund industry, not all of
whom may have the same interests at all times. Participating money market funds would be of
different sizes and the governance arrangements would represent some fund complexes and not
others. There may be conflicts relating to money market funds whose nature or portfolio makes
them more or less likely to ever need to access the LF. The LF may face conflicts allocating
limited liquidity resources during a crisis, and choosing which funds gain access and which do
not. To be successful, an LF would need to be managed such that it sustains its credibility,
particularly in a crisis, and does not distort incentives in the market to favor certain business
models or types of funds.
These potential issues collectively created a concern that such a facility may not prove
effective in a crisis and thus we would not be able to achieve our regulatory goals of reducing
money market funds’ susceptibility to liquidity runs and the corresponding impacts on investor
protection and capital formation. Combined with our lack of authority to create an LF bank with
access to the Federal Reserve’s discount window, these concerns ultimately have led us to not
pursue this alternative.
b.

Insurance

As discussed in the Proposing Release, we also considered whether money market funds
should be required to carry some form of public or private insurance, similar to bank accounts
that carry Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation deposit insurance, which has played a central

694

role in mitigating the risk of runs on banks. 2119 The Treasury’s Temporary Guarantee Program
helped slow the run on money market funds in September 2008, and thus we naturally
considered whether some form of insurance for money market fund shareholders might mitigate
the risk of liquidity runs in money market funds and their detrimental impacts on investors and
capital formation. 2120 Insurance might replace money market funds’ historical reliance on
discretionary sponsor support, which has covered capital losses in money market funds in the
past but, as discussed above, also contributes to these funds’ vulnerability to liquidity runs.
As noted in the Proposing Release, although a few commenters on the PWG Report
expressed some support for a system of insurance for money market funds, 2121 most opposed this
potential reform option. 2122 Those commenters expressed concern that government insurance
would create moral hazard and encourage excessive risk taking by funds. 2123 They also asserted
that such insurance could distort capital flows from bank deposits or government money market

Authority for a guarantee program like the Temporary Guarantee Program for Money Market Funds has
since been removed. See Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 § 131(b), 12 U.S.C. 5236 (2008)
(prohibiting the Secretary of Treasury from using the Exchange Stabilization Fund for the establishment of
any future guaranty programs for the U.S. money market fund industry).

2121

See, e.g., Richmond Fed PWG Comment Letter (stating that insurance would be a second best solution for
mitigating the risk of runs in money market funds after a floating net asset value because insurance
premiums and regulation are difficult to calibrate correctly, so distortions would likely remain); Comment
Letter of Paul A. Volcker (Feb. 11, 2011) (available in File No. 4-619) (“Volcker PWG Comment Letter”)
(stating that money market funds wishing to retain a stable net asset value should reorganize as special
purpose banks or “submit themselves to capital and supervisory requirements and FDIC-type insurance on
the funds under deposit”).

funds into prime money market funds, and that this disintermediation could and likely would
cause significant disruption to the banking system and the money market. 2124 For example, one
commenter stated that:
“If the insurance program were partial (for example, capped at $250,000 per
account), many institutional investors likely would invest in this partially insured product
rather than directly in the market or in other cash pools because the insured funds would
offer liquidity, portfolios that were somewhat less risky than other pools, and yields only
slightly lower than alternative cash pools. Without insurance covering the full value of
investors’ account balances, however, there would still be an incentive for these investors
to withdraw the uninsured portion of their assets from these funds during periods of
severe market stress.” 2125
Commenters stated that with respect to private insurance, it has been made available in
the past but the product proved unsuccessful due to its cost and in the future would be too
costly. 2126 They also stated that they did not believe any private insurance coverage would have
sufficient capacity. 2127 However, some commenters on our Proposing Release supported a
system of insurance for money market funds, noting that historically insurance has provided
stability during times of stress. 2128

696

We have carefully considered the comments on the PWG Report and our Proposing
Release. However, considering foremost that we do not have regulatory authority to create a
public insurance scheme for money market funds, we are not pursuing this option. Separately,
we continue to believe that it would not achieve our goal, among others, of materially reducing
the contagion effects from heavy redemptions at money market funds without undue costs. We
have made this determination based on money market fund insurance’s potential for creating
moral hazard and encouraging excessive risk-taking by money market funds, given the
difficulties and costs involved in creating effective risk-based pricing for insurance and
additional regulatory structure to offset this incentive. 2129 If insurance actually increases moral
hazard and decreases corresponding market discipline, it may in fact increase rather than
decrease money market funds’ susceptibility to liquidity runs. If the only way to counter these
incentives was by imposing a very costly regulatory structure and risk-based pricing system our
reforms potentially offer a better ratio of benefits to associated costs. Finally, we were
concerned with the difficulty of creating private insurance at an appropriate cost and of sufficient
capacity for a several trillion-dollar industry that tends to have highly correlated tail risk. All of
these considerations have led us to not pursue this option further.
c.

Special Purpose Bank

In the Proposing Release, we also evaluated whether money market funds should be
regulated as special purpose banks. Stable net asset value money market fund shares can bear

697

some similarity to bank deposits. 2130 Some aspects of bank regulation could be used to mitigate
some of the risks described in section II above. 2131 Money market funds could benefit from
access to the special purpose bank’s capital, government deposit insurance and emergency
liquidity facilities from the Federal Reserve on terms codified and well understood in advance,
and thus with a clearer allocation of risks among market participants. We did not receive any
comments on this alternative.
As the PWG Report noted, and as commenters reinforced, there are a number of
drawbacks to regulating money market funds as special purpose banks. Although a few
commenters expressed some support for this option, 2132 almost all commenters on the PWG
Report addressing this possible reform option opposed it. 2133 Some commenters stated that the
costs of converting money market funds to special purpose banks would likely be large relative
to the costs of simply allowing more of this type of cash management activity to be absorbed into
the existing banking sector. 2134 Others expressed concern that regulating money market funds as
special purpose banks would radically change the product, make it less attractive to investors and

thereby have unintended consequences potentially worse than the mitigated risk, such as leading
sophisticated investors to move their funds to unregulated or offshore money market fund
substitutes and thereby limiting the applicability of the current money market fund regulatory
regime and creating additional systemic risk. 2135 For example, one of these commenters stated
that transforming money market funds into special purpose banks would create homogeneity in
the financial regulatory scheme by relying on the bank business model for all short-term cash
investments and that “[g]iven the unprecedented difficulties the banking industry has
experienced recently, it seems bizarre to propose that [money market funds] operate more like
banks, which have absorbed hundreds of billions of dollars in government loans and
handouts.” 2136 Some pointed to the differences between banks and money market funds as
justifying different regulatory treatment, and expressed concern that concentrating investors’
cash management activity in the banking sector could increase systemic risk. 2137
Foremost, we are not pursuing this option because we lack regulatory authority to
transform money market funds into special purpose banks. Separately, however, we continue to
believe that the potential costs involved in creating a new special purpose bank regulatory
framework to govern money market funds are not justified. In addition, given our view that
money market funds have some features similar to banks but other aspects quite different from
banks, applying substantial parts of the bank regulatory regime to money market funds would not

be well tailored to the structure of and risks involved in money market funds compared to the
reforms we are adopting in this Release. As noted above, we received no comments on this
alternative after the Proposing Release was issued. After considering our lack of regulatory
authority to transform money market funds into special purpose banks as well as the views
expressed in the PWG comment letters and for the reasons set forth above, we continue to
believe that transforming money market funds into special purpose banks is not the most
appropriate reform.
d.

Dual Systems of Money Market Funds

In the Proposing Release, we evaluated options that would institute a dual system of
money market funds, where either institutional money market funds or money market funds
using a stable share price would be subject to more stringent regulation than others. As
discussed in the PWG Report, 2138 money market fund reforms could focus on providing enhanced
regulation solely for money market funds that seek to maintain a stable net asset value, rather
than a floating NAV. Enhanced regulations could include any of the regulatory reform options
discussed above such as mandatory insurance, a private liquidity facility, or special purpose bank
regulation. Money market funds that did not comply with these enhanced constraints would
have a floating NAV (though they would still be subject to the other risk-limiting conditions
contained in rule 2a-7).
There also may be other enhanced forms of regulation or other types of dual systems.
For example, an alternative formulation of this regulatory regime would apply the enhanced

2138

See PWG Report, supra note 506, at 29-32.

700

regulatory constraints discussed above (e.g., a private liquidity facility or insurance) only to
“institutional” money market funds, and “retail” money market funds would continue to be
subject to rule 2a-7 as it exists today. We note that our decision to not subject retail and
government money market funds to a floating NAV requirement and to not subject government
money market funds to a fees and gates requirement in effect creates a dual system, which we
discuss in greater detail in section III.C.1.
These dual system regulatory regimes for money market funds could provide several
important benefits. They attempt to apply the enhanced regulatory constraints on those aspects
of money market funds that most contribute to their susceptibility to liquidity runs—whether it is
institutional investors that have shown a tendency to run or a stable net asset value created
through the use of amortized cost valuation that can create a first mover advantage for those
investors that redeem at the first signs of potential stress. A dual system that imposes enhanced
constraints on stable net asset value money market funds would allow investors to choose their
preferred mixture of stability, risk, and return.
Because insurance, special purpose banks, and the private liquidity facility generally are
beyond our regulatory authority to create, these particular dual options, which would impose one
of these regulatory constraints on a subset of money market funds, could not be created under
our current regulatory authority. Other options, such as requiring a floating NAV or liquidity
fees and gates only for some types of money market funds, however, could be imposed under our
current authority and are being adopted today.
Each of these dual systems generally has the same advantages and disadvantages as the
potential enhanced regulatory constraints that would be applied, described above. In addition,

701

for any two-tier system of money market fund regulation to be effective in reducing the risk of
contagion effects from heavy redemptions, investors would need to fully understand the
difference between the two types of funds and their associated risks. If they did not, they may
indiscriminately flee both types of money market funds even if only one type experiences
difficulty. 2139
However, given the difficulties, drawbacks, and limitations on our regulatory authority
associated with dual systems involving a special purpose bank, private liquidity facility and
insurance, we continue to believe that a dual system of money market fund regulation involving
these enhanced regulatory constraints should not be adopted. We did not receive any comments
on these types of dual systems. However, as noted above, our current reforms would to some
extent create a dual system of money market funds, and we discuss in greater detail our rationale
for that approach, together with an analysis of commenter’s views and the economic effects of
that approach, in section III.C.1.
M.

Clarifying Amendments

Since our adoption of amendments to rule 2a-7 in 2010, a number of questions have
arisen regarding the application of certain of those changes. As stated in the Proposing Release,
we are taking this opportunity to amend rule 2a-7 to clarify the operation of these provisions. In
addition, we are also amending rule 2a-7 to state more clearly a limit we imposed on money
2139

For example, when the Reserve Primary Fund broke the buck in September 2008, all money market funds
managed by Reserve Management Company, Inc. experienced runs, even the Reserve U.S. Government
Fund, despite the fact that the Reserve U.S. Government Fund had a quite different risk profile. See Press
Release, A Statement Regarding The Reserve Primary and U.S. Government Funds (Sept. 19, 2008)

market funds’ investments in second tier securities in 2010. 2140 Two commenters stated that they
supported our clarifying amendments but did not comment on any specific provisions of the
amendments. 2141 One of these commenters generally supported our amendments but did not
address or discuss any costs or benefits. 2142 The second commenter stated that it believed the
clarifying amendments conform with current fund practices, that there would be no costs to
funds that may not currently conform to these amendments, and that there would be little to no
effect on market efficiency, competition or capital formation. 2143 A third commenter stated that
most, if not all, money market funds currently conform to the proposed clarifying amendments,
and stated that it does not anticipate a significant cost burden to the industry in conforming with
any of the proposed amendments. 2144 This commenter specifically supported certain of the
amendments and provided comment on certain specific provisions of the amendments. 2145 We
discuss these comments below. No commenters objected to the proposed clarifying
amendments.
As stated in the Proposing Release, we believe that for funds that are already acting
consistently with our amendments, there will be no associated costs. We requested comment as
to whether there would be any costs to funds that may not currently conform to the clarifying
2140

In addition, we are adopting as proposed, technical, conforming amendments to rule 419(b)(2)(iv) under the
Securities Act of 1933 (17 CFR 230.419(b)(2)(iv)), which references certain paragraphs in rule 2a-7 the
location of which is changing under our amendments. Specifically, we are replacing references to
“paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4)” with “paragraph (d)”.

amendments. As noted above, no commenter provided any quantification of potential costs or
benefits but one commenter suggested that there would be no costs to funds that may not
currently conform to the clarifying amendments 2146 and one commenter stated that it does not
anticipate a significant cost burden to the industry in conforming with the proposed
amendments. 2147 As stated in the Proposing Release, we understand that most funds currently
comply with our clarifying amendments and did not receive comments stating otherwise, except
that one commenter noted that funds do not always include open sales receivables as liquid
assets, and do not necessarily determine maturity for short-term floating rate securities in the
manner proposed by the amendment. 2148 This commenter did note however, that it agreed that
most, if not all money market funds currently conform to the proposed clarifying
amendments. 2149 We therefore expect that the clarifying amendments will likely not result in any
significant economic effects or quantifiable costs or benefits.
1.

Definitions of Daily Liquid Assets and Weekly Liquid Assets

We are adopting, as proposed, amendments to clarify certain characteristics of
instruments that qualify as a “daily liquid asset” or “weekly liquid asset” for purposes of the rule.
First, we are making clear that money market funds cannot use the maturity-shortening
provisions in current paragraph (d) of rule 2a-7 regarding interest rate readjustments 2150 when

2146

2150

See current rule 2a-7(d) (providing a number of exceptions to the general requirement that the maturity of a
portfolio security be deemed to be the period remaining (from the trade date) until the date on which, in
accordance with the terms of the security, the principal amount must unconditionally be paid; the

704

determining whether a security satisfies the maturity requirements of a daily liquid asset or
weekly liquid asset, 2151 which include securities that will mature within one or five business days,
respectively. 2152 Using an interest rate readjustment to determine maturity as permitted under
current paragraph (d) for these purposes allows funds to include as daily or weekly liquid assets
securities that the fund would not have a legal right to convert to cash in one or five business
days. This is not consistent with the purposes of the minimum daily and weekly liquidity
requirements, which are designed to increase a fund’s ability to pay redeeming shareholders in
times of market stress when the fund cannot rely on the market or a dealer to provide immediate
liquidity. 2153
Second, we are adopting as proposed, amendments to require that an agency discount
note with a remaining maturity of 60 days or less qualifies as a “weekly liquid asset” only if the
note is issued without an obligation to pay additional interest on the principal amount. 2154 Our
amendment clarifies that interest-bearing agency notes that are issued at a discount do not

exceptions generally provide that a fund may shorten the maturity date of certain securities to the period
remaining until the next readjustment of the interest rate or the period remaining until the principal amount
can be recovered through demand).
2151

See rule 2a-7(a)(8); rule 2a-7(a)(34). The amended definitions require funds to determine a security’s
maturity in the same way they must calculate for purposes of determining WAL under amended rule 2a7(d)(1)(iii).

2152

Current rule 2a-7(a)(8) defines “daily liquid assets” to include (i) cash, (ii) direct obligations of the U.S.
government, or (iii) securities that will mature or are subject to a demand feature that is exercisable and
payable within one business day. Current rule 2a-7(a)(32) defines “weekly liquid assets” to include (i)
cash; (ii) direct obligations of the U.S. government; (iii) securities that will mature or are subject to a
demand feature that is exercisable and payable within five business days; or (iv) Government securities (as
defined in section 2(a)(16) of the Act) that are issued by a person controlled or supervised by and acting as
an instrumentality of the U.S. government that are issued at a discount to the principal amount to be repaid
at maturity and have a remaining maturity date of 60 days or less.

qualify. 2155 We understand that these interest-bearing agency notes issued at a discount are
extremely rare and do not believe that interest-bearing agency notes are among the very shortterm agency discount notes that appeared to be relatively liquid during the 2008 market events
and that we determined could qualify as weekly liquid assets. 2156
Finally, we are amending as proposed, rule 2a-7 to include in the definitions of daily and
weekly liquid assets amounts receivable that are due unconditionally within one or five business
days, respectively, on pending sales of portfolio securities. 2157 These receivables, like certain
other securities that qualify as daily or weekly liquid assets, provide liquidity for the fund
because they give a fund the legal right to receive cash in one to five business days. A fund (or
its adviser) could include these receivables in daily and weekly liquid assets if the fund (or its
adviser) has no reason to believe that the buyer might not perform.
We continue to understand that the instruments that most money market funds currently
hold as daily and weekly liquid assets currently conform to the amendments and that these
practices are consistent with positions our staff has taken in informal guidance to money market
funds. 2158 Although one commenter noted that it is not always typical for money market funds to

2155

We understand that an interest-bearing agency note might be issued at a discount to facilitate a rounded
coupon rate (i.e., 2.75% or 3.5%) when yield demanded on the note would otherwise require a coupon rate
that is not rounded.

2156

See 2010 Adopting Release, supra note 17, at text accompanying and following nn.251-55. Our
determination was informed by average daily yields of 30 day and 60 day agency discount notes during the
fall of 2008. We believe that interest-bearing agency notes issued at a discount were not included in the
indices of the agency discount notes on which we based our analysis or if they were included, there were
too few to have affected the indices’ averages.

include open sales receivables as liquid assets, this commenter also stated that most, if not all,
money market funds currently conform to the proposed amendments. 2159 The first two clarifying
amendments discussed above are designed to make clear that securities with maturities
determined according to interest rate resets and interest bearing agency notes issued at a discount
do not qualify as daily or weekly liquid assets, as applicable. 2160 Because both of these types of
securities are less liquid than the limited types of instruments that do qualify, any funds that alter
their future portfolio investments to conform to these requirements would benefit from increased
liquidity and ability to absorb larger amounts of redemptions. We continue to believe that by
including certain receivables as daily and weekly assets, funds will benefit because the types of
assets that can satisfy those liquidity requirements will be increased.
We also continue to believe that there would not be any significant costs associated with
our amendments to the definitions of daily and weekly liquid assets. We do not anticipate that
there will be operational costs for any funds that currently hold securities that will no longer
qualify as daily or weekly assets because those securities likely would mature before the
compliance date for our amendments. 2161 Because we continue to believe that most money
market funds are currently acting consistently with the amendments that clarify assets that
qualify as daily and weekly assets, we do not anticipate that the amendments will have any effect
on efficiency or capital formation. To the extent that some funds’ practices do not already

707

conform, however, the clarifications may eliminate any competitive advantages that may have
resulted from those practices, although we expect that any such advantages would have been
small because the amendments make minor clarifying changes to the assets that qualify as daily
and weekly liquid assets but do not otherwise remove a significant portion of assets that would
otherwise qualify as daily or weekly liquid assets. We did not receive comments suggesting
otherwise.
2.

Definition of Demand Feature

We are amending the definition of demand feature in rule 2a-7 as proposed to mean a
feature permitting the holder of a security to sell the security at an exercise price equal to the
approximate amortized cost of the security plus accrued interest, if any, at the time of exercise,
paid within 397 calendar days of exercise. 2162 Our amendment eliminates the requirement that a
demand feature be exercisable at any time on no more than 30 calendar days’ notice. 2163
One commenter addressed this proposed clarifying amendment, stating that it agreed that
eliminating the requirement that a demand feature be exercisable at any time on no more than 30
days’ notice would clarify the operation of rule 2a-7. 2164 Eliminating the requirement that a
demand feature be exercisable at any time on no more than 30 days’ notice removes from rule
2a-7 a provision that has become obsolete. In 1986, the Commission expanded the notice period

2162

See rule 2a-7(a)(9).

2163

A demand feature is currently defined to mean (i) a feature permitting the holder of a security to sell the
security at an exercise price equal to the approximate amortized cost of the security plus accrued interest, if
any, at the time of exercise. A demand feature must be exercisable either: (a) At any time on no more than
30 calendar days’ notice; or (b) At specified intervals not exceeding 397 calendar days and upon no more
than 30 calendar days' notice; or (ii) A feature permitting the holder of an ABS unconditionally to receive
principal and interest within 397 calendar days of making demand. See current rule 2a-7(a)(9).

2164

See State Street Comment Letter.

708

from seven days to 30 days for all types of demand features and emphasized that the notice
requirement was at least in part designed to ensure that money market funds maintain adequate
liquidity. 2165 Because, as discussed in section II.E.1 above, the 2010 amendments added
significant new provisions to enhance the liquidity of money market funds, we continue to
believe it is unnecessary to continue to require that demand features be exercised at any time on
no more than 30 days’ notice. 2166 Therefore, the demand feature definition will focus on funds’
ability to receive payment within 397 calendar days of exercise of the demand feature.
As stated in the Proposing Release, we believe that eliminating the 30-day notice
requirement may improve efficiency by simplifying the operation of rule 2a-7 regarding demand
features and providing issuers with more flexibility. One commenter agreed that limiting the 30day notice requirement may improve efficiency by simplifying the operation of rule 2a-7. 2167 As
noted in the Proposing Release, our amendment will permit funds to purchase securities with
demand features from a larger pool of issuers. We continue to believe that permitting funds to
purchase securities with demand features from a larger pool of issuers may promote competition
among issuers and facilitate capital formation because issuers will have a higher number of other
2165

See Acquisition and Valuation of Certain Portfolio Instruments by Registered Investment Companies,
Investment Company Act Release No. 14983 (Mar. 12, 1986) [51 FR 9773 (Mar. 21, 1986)] (“The
Commission still believes that some limit must be placed on the extent to which funds relying on the rule
will have to anticipate their cash and investment needs more than seven days in advance. However, the
Commission believes that funds should be able to invest in the demand instruments that are being marketed
with notice periods of up to 30 days, as long as the directors are cognizant of their responsibility to
maintain an adequate level of liquidity.”). Liquidity was also a concern when the Commission added the
definition of demand feature for asset-backed securities and noted that it was done, in part, to make clear
the date on which there was a binding obligation to pay (and not just the scheduled maturity). See 1996
Adopting Release, supra note 1735, at accompanying nn.151-152.

2166

Our amendments are also consistent with a position our staff has taken in the past. See, e.g., SEC NoAction Letter to Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (May 28, 2009), available at

issuers to compete against in selling securities to funds, which in turn may incentivize issuers to
develop new or additional securities with demand features. We also continue to believe that our
amendment will not impose costs on funds, and did not receive comment indicating otherwise. 2168
One commenter agreed that it did not anticipate any additional cost to the industry in connection
with this amendment. 2169
3.

Short-Term Floating Rate Securities

We are also amending rule 2a-7 as proposed to clarify the method for determining WAL
for short-term floating rate securities. 2170 WAL is similar to a fund’s WAM, except that WAL is
determined without reference to interest rate readjustments. 2171 Under current rule 2a-7, a shortterm variable rate security, the principal of which must unconditionally be paid in 397 calendar
days or less, is “deemed to have a maturity equal to the earlier of the period remaining until the
next readjustment of the interest rate or the period remaining until the principal amount can be
recovered through demand.” 2172 A short-term floating rate security, the principal amount of
which must unconditionally be paid in 397 calendar days or less, is “deemed to have a maturity
2168

We note that demand features and guarantees are referenced in rule 12d3-1(d)(7)(v) (providing that, subject
to a diversification limitation, the acquisition of a demand feature or guarantee is not an acquisition of
securities of a securities related business (that would otherwise be prohibited pursuant to section 12(d)(3) of
the Act)) and rule 31a-1(b)(1) (requiring that a fund’s detailed records of daily purchase and sale records
include the name and nature of any demand feature provider or guarantor). We do not believe that our
amendment will provide any benefits or impose any costs with respect to these rules, other than those
described above. We also are updating the cross references to the definition of the terms “demand feature”
and “guarantee” in rule 12d3-1(d)(7)(v), which defines these terms by reference to rule 2a-7 (replacing the
references to “rule 2a-7(a)(8)” and “rule 2a-7(a)(15)” with “§ 270.2a-7(a)(9)” and “§ 270.2a-7(a)(18)”) and
rule 31a-1(b)(1) (replacing the references to “rule 2a-7(a)(8)” and “rule 2a-7(a)(15)” with “§ 270.2a7(a)(9)” and “§ 270.2a-7(a)(18)”).

of one day” because the interest rate for a floating rate security will change on any date there is a
change in the specified interest rate. 2173
Despite the difference in wording of the maturity-shortening provisions for floating rate
and variable rate securities, the Commission has always intended for these provisions to work in
parallel and provide the same results. 2174 The omission of an explicit reference to demand
features in the maturity-shortening provision for short-term floating rate securities, however, has
created uncertainty in determining the maturity of short-term floating rate securities with a
demand feature for purposes of calculating a fund’s WAL. 2175 Therefore, we are amending rule
2a-7(d)(4) to provide that, for purposes of determining WAL, a short-term floating rate security
shall be deemed to have a maturity equal to the period remaining until the principal amount can
be recovered through demand. 2176
As stated in the Proposing Release, we understand that most money market funds
currently determine maturity for short-term floating rate securities consistent with our
amendment. 2177 Although one commenter noted that it does not determine maturity for shortterm floating rate securities in the manner consistent with the proposed amendment and instead
2173

See current rule 2a-7(d)(4). Rule 2a-7 distinguishes between floating rate and variable rate securities based
on whether the securities’ interest rate adjusts (i) when there is a change in a specified interest rate (floating
rate securities), or (ii) on set dates (variable rate securities); current rule 2a-7(a)(15) (defining “floating rate
security”); current rule 2a-7(a)(31) (defining “variable rate security”).

2174

See 1996 Adopting Release, supra note 1735, at n.154 (the maturity of a floating rate security subject to a
demand feature is the period remaining until principal can be recovered through demand).

2175

Long-term floating rate securities that are subject to a demand feature are deemed to have a maturity equal
to the period remaining until the principal amount can be recovered through demand. See current rule 2a7(d)(5).

See rule 2a-7(i)(4).

Such a determination would be consistent with informal guidance that the staff has provided. See
Investment Company Institute, Request for Interpretation under rule 2a-7 (Aug. 10, 2010) (incoming letter

uses the rate reset date regardless of the type of security, this commenter did state that most, if
not all, money market funds currently conform to the proposed clarifying amendments. 2178 This
commenter also noted that it agreed that there would be minimal cost related to the proposed
amendment. 2179 Accordingly, we continue to believe that the amendment will likely not result in
costs to most funds and that to the extent a fund may not already act consistently with our
amendment, the amendment will likely not result in significant costs to such a fund. Any funds
that currently limit or avoid investments in short-term floating rate securities because they would
look to the security’s stated final maturity date rather than the demand feature for purposes of
determining WAL (which could significantly increase the WAL) may benefit if they increase
investments in short-term floating rate securities that are higher yielding than alternative
investments in the fund’s portfolio. To the extent that those funds may have experienced any
competitive yield disadvantage because they limited or avoided these investments, the
amendments should address those effects. Because we continue to believe that most funds
currently interpret the maturity requirements as we provide in our amendments, we believe that
although our changes may produce benefits, these benefits are not quantifiable because we
cannot predict the extent to which, absent our amendments, funds may have decided to interpret
the maturity requirements differently in the future. For those funds that do not currently interpret
the maturity requirements as we provide in our amendments, we are unable to estimate any
quantifiable benefits because we are unable to predict the extent to which a fund may increase
investments in short-term floating rate securities that are higher yielding than alternative

investments in the fund’s portfolio, and did not receive any comments on such issue. We also
believe that our amendments will not result in a significant, if any, impact on efficiency or
capital formation. We did not receive any comments suggesting otherwise.
4.

Second Tier Securities

In 2010, we amended rule 2a-7 to limit money market funds to acquiring second tier
securities with remaining maturities of 45 days or less. 2180 As discussed in the Proposing
Release, our analysis in adopting this requirement was focused primarily on second tier
securities’ credit risk, credit spread risk, and liquidity, all of which are more appropriately
measured by the security’s final legal maturity, rather than its maturity recognizing interest rate
readjustments, which focuses on interest rate risk. Thus to state more clearly the way in which
this limitation operates, we are amending rule 2a-7 as proposed to state specifically that the 45day limit applicable to second tier securities must be determined without reference to the
maturity-shortening provisions in rule 2a-7 for interest rate readjustments. 2181
We continue to believe that most money market funds currently determine the remaining
maturity for second tier securities consistent with this amendment. Accordingly, we continue to
believe that our amendment will likely not result in costs to funds or impact competition,
efficiency, or capital formation. In cases where the 45-day limit applicable to second tier
securities is determined with reference to the maturity-shortening provisions for interest rate
adjustments for certain funds, such funds that alter their future portfolio investments to conform
to this amendment may benefit from increased liquidity. In addition, as we noted in the
2180

See 2010 Adopting Release, supra note 17, at nn.65-69 and accompanying text.

2181

See rule 2a-7(d)(2)(ii).

713

Proposing Release, any funds that currently hold securities that would no longer qualify as
second tier securities would not incur costs because those securities likely would mature before
the compliance date for our amendments. 2182 We did not receive any comments suggesting
otherwise.

our floating NAV and liquidity fees and gates amendments is October 14, 2016. The compliance
date for new Form N-CR is July 14, 2015 and the compliance date for our diversification, stress
testing, disclosure, Form PF, Form N-MFP, and clarifying amendments is April 14, 2016. If any
provision of these rules, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held to be
invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or application of such provisions to other
persons or circumstances that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application.
1.

Compliance Date for Amendments Related to Liquidity Fees and Gates

The compliance date for our amendments related to liquidity fees and gates, including
any related amendments to disclosure, is October 14, 2016. 2183 We are adopting a compliance
period of 2 years for money market funds to implement the fees and gates amendments instead of
the proposed one-year compliance period. One commenter argued that the compliance period for
our fees and gates amendments should be reduced. 2184 Several commenters, however, argued that

2182

2183

We expect a fund to make any related changes to disclosure at the time the fund implements the
amendments related to fees and gates.

2184

See Santoro Comment Letter.

714

our fees and gates amendments require at least 2 years to implement. 2185 For example, one
commenter stated that the multiple programming requirements and costs involved suggest that 2
years is a reasonable amount of time to require implementation of fees and gates. 2186 In addition,
a few commenters recommended extending the compliance period for fees and gates to 3
years. 2187 After further consideration, we have decided to extend the compliance period to 2
years.
We expect that providing a longer compliance period will allow additional time for
money market funds and their sponsors and service providers to conduct the requisite operational
changes to their systems to implement these provisions, and for fund sponsors to restructure or
establish new money market funds if they choose to rely on an available exemption. 2188 It also
will provide a substantial amount of time for money market fund shareholders to consider the
reforms and make any corresponding changes to their investments. In addition, we have decided
to adopt a two-year compliance period in order to provide a uniform compliance date for the
floating NAV and fees and gates amendments, which we believe will provide money market
funds with a smoother transition and prevent funds from having to make various operational and
compliance changes multiple times. Accordingly, the compliance date is 2 years after the
effective date of the adoption of the amendments to rule 2a-7(c)(2) and other related provisions
of rule 2a-7 that apply to the liquidity fees and gates amendments, rule 22e-3(a)(1) and (d), rule

2.

Compliance Date for Amendments Related to Floating NAV

The compliance date for our amendments related to floating NAV, including any related
amendments to disclosure, is October 14, 2016. 2189 We are adopting, as proposed, a compliance
period of 2 years for money market funds to implement the floating NAV amendments. A few
commenters stated that they agreed that the transition period for the floating NAV amendments
should be at least 2 years. 2190 Most commenters, however, argued for a compliance period longer
than the proposed two-year period, 2191 with some commenters specifically arguing that the
floating NAV amendments require at least 3 years to implement. 2192 Several commenters
suggesting a longer compliance period argued that adopting a floating NAV would require
significant operational modifications. 2193 In addition, many of the commenters recommending a
longer compliance period argued that the relevant tax and accounting issues should be resolved
by the appropriate regulator well before the compliance date of any final money market fund
reform. 2194 As we discuss above in section III.B.6, we have been informed that, the Treasury
Department and the IRS today will propose new regulations and issue a revenue procedure (with
an effective date of 60 days after publication of today’s reforms in the Federal Register) that

We expect a fund to make any related changes to disclosure at the time the fund implements the
amendments related to floating NAV.

address relevant tax and accounting issues associated with our amendments. 2195 A two-year
compliance period also will allow time for the Commission to consider finalizing rules removing
NRSRO ratings from rule 2a-7, so that funds could make many of the compliance-related
changes at one time.
After further consideration, we believe it is appropriate to adopt a compliance period of 2
years. We expect that a two-year compliance period will provide time for funds and their
shareholders to make any operational modifications necessary to transition to a floating NAV. In
addition, we expect that a two-year compliance period will allow time for funds to implement
any needed changes to their investment policies and train staff, and also provide time for
investors to analyze and consider how they might wish to adjust their cash management
strategies. A two-year compliance period also will allow funds to reorganize their operations
and establish new funds to meet the definition of a retail money market fund, to the extent
necessary. Accordingly, the compliance date is 2 years after the effective date of the adoption of
the amendments to rule 2a-7(c) and other related provisions of rule 2a-7 that apply to the floating
NAV amendments, rule 22e-3(a)(1) and (d), rule 30b1-7, rule 482(b)(3)(i) and (b)(4), Form NMFP and Item 4(b)(1) of Form N-1A.
3.

Compliance Date for Rule 30b1-8 and Form N-CR

The compliance date for rule 30b1-8, Form N-CR, and the related website disclosure 2196 is
July 14, 2015. We received no comments specifically addressing the compliance date for rule
30b1-8, Form N-CR or the related website disclosure. After reviewing the operational
2195

See supra section III.B.6.

2196

See rule 2a-7(h)(10)(v) (website disclosure of certain information required to be reported in Form N-CR).

717

considerations as well as the significant interest of investors and the Commission in receiving
this information, we are adopting, as proposed, a compliance period of 9 months.
We are eliminating, as proposed, the provision in current rule 2a-7 that requires money
market funds to report defaults or events of insolvency to the Commission by email, because it
would duplicate Part B (default or event of insolvency of portfolio security issuer) of Form NCR. 2197 We are also eliminating, as proposed, the provision in current rule 2a-7 that requires
money market funds to disclose to the Commission by email instances when a sponsor supports a
fund by purchasing a security pursuant to rule 17a-9, because it would duplicate Part C
(provision of financial support to fund) of Form N-CR. 2198 Money market funds will continue to
be required to comply with these email notification requirements in rule 2a-7 until the date in
which money market funds are required to comply with Part B and Part C of Form N-CR.
Accordingly, the effective date of removal of the email notification requirements in rule 2a-7 is 9
months after the effective date of the adoption of Part B and Part C of Form N-CR. 2199
We note that Part E (imposition of liquidity fee), Part F (suspension of fund redemptions)
and Part G (removal of liquidity fees and/or resumption of fund redemptions) of Form N-CR are
disclosure items specifically related to our liquidity fees and gates amendments and therefore
would also have a conforming compliance period of 2 years. Accordingly, the compliance date
for Parts E - G of Form N-CR and the related website disclosure requirements pursuant to rule

2197

See current rule 2a-7(7)(iii)(A).

2198

See current rule 2a-7(7)(iii)(B).

2199

We note that a money market fund need not comply with the email notification requirements prior to the
effective date of removal if the money market fund instead elects to comply with the requirements of Part B
and Part C of Form N-CR, as applicable.

718

2a-7(h)(10)(v) is 2 years after the effective date of the adoption of Part E - G of Form N-CR and
rule 2a-7(h)(10)(v). The compliance date for all other Parts of Form N-CR is 9 months.
Accordingly, the compliance date for rule 30b1-8, Parts A - D and Part H of Form N-CR, and the
related website disclosure requirements pursuant to rule 2a-7(h)(10)(v) is 9 months after the
effective date of the adoption of rule 30b1-8, Parts A - D and Part H of Form N-CR and rule 2a7(h)(10)(v).
4.

Compliance Date for Diversification, Stress Testing, Disclosure, Form
PF, Form N-MFP, and Clarifying Amendments

The compliance date for amendments that are not specifically related to either floating
NAV or liquidity fees and gates, including amendments to diversification, stress testing,
disclosure that are not specifically related to either floating NAV or liquidity fees and gates,
Form PF, Form N-MFP, and clarifying amendments is April 14, 2016. We are adopting an 18
month compliance period for money market funds to implement these amendments instead of the
proposed 9 month compliance period. As discussed above, disclosure amendments that relate to
the floating NAV or liquidity fees and gates amendments will have a two-year compliance
period. For disclosure amendments that are not specifically related to the floating NAV or
liquidity fees and gates amendments, we are adopting an 18 month compliance period. These
disclosure amendments include amendments to Form N-1A requiring historical disclosure of
affiliate financial support, 2200 and amendments to rule 2a-7 requiring certain website disclosure of

2200

See Item 16(g)(2) of Form N-1A (historical disclosure of affiliate financial support). For purposes of the
required historical disclosure of affiliate financial support, funds will be required only to disclose events
that occur on or after the compliance date. See supra section III.E.5.

719

portfolio holdings and other fund information. 2201 Several commenters argued that the
compliance period for amendments not relating to floating NAV or liquidity fees and gates
should be extended in order for funds to implement the amendments and make any necessary
operational changes. 2202 After further consideration, we expect that 18 months will allow
additional time for money market funds and their sponsors and service providers to implement
any applicable requirements and conduct any requisite operational changes to their systems to
implement these provisions.
Accordingly, the compliance date for amendments relating to diversification is 18 months
after the effective date of the amendments to rule 2a-7(a)(18) and (d)(3) and other related
provisions of rule 2a-7 that apply to the diversification amendments. The compliance date for
amendments related to stress testing is 18 months after the effective date of the amendments to
rule 2a-7(g)(8) and other related provisions of rule 2a-7 that apply to the stress testing
amendments. The compliance date for disclosure amendments not specifically related to either
floating NAV or liquidity fees and gates is 18 months after the effective date of the amendments
to Item 16(g)(2) of Form N-1A and rule 2a-7(h)(10). The compliance date for amendments to
rule 204(b)-1 under the Advisers Act and Form PF is 18 months after the effective date of the
amendments to rule 204(b)-1 under the Advisers Act and Form PF. The compliance date for

2201

See rules 2a-7(h)(10)(i)-(iv). For purposes of the required website disclosure of portfolio holdings and
other fund information, funds will be required to disclose such information for the prior six months, even if
such information is from prior to the compliance date. See supra section III.E.9.

2202

See, e.g., ICI Comment Letter (recommending a minimum of 18 months for funds to comply with the
disclosure amendments); UBS Comment Letter (recommending a 12 to 18 month compliance period for all
proposed regulatory changes that are not specifically related to either floating NAV or liquidity fees and
gates); Dreyfus Comment Letter (recommending a two-year compliance period for amendments that are not
specifically related to either floating NAV or liquidity fees and gates).

720

amendments to rule 30b1-7 and Form N-MFP is 18 months after the effective date of the
amendments to rule 30b1-7 and Form N-MFP. The compliance date for the clarifying
amendments is 18 months after the effective date of the amendments to rule 2a-7 pertaining to
the clarifying amendments.
IV.

PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT

Certain provisions of the proposed amendments contain “collections of information”
within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”). 2203 The titles for the
existing collections of information are: “Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
money market funds” (Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) Control No. 3235-0268);
“Rule 22e-3 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, Exemption for liquidation of money
market funds” (OMB Control No. 3235-0658); “Rule 30b1-7 under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, Monthly report for money market funds” (OMB Control No. 3235-0657); “Rule 34b1(a) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, Sales Literature Deemed to be Misleading”
(OMB Control No. 3235-0346); “Rule 204(b)-1 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,
Reporting by investment advisers to private funds” (OMB Control No. 3235-0679); “Rule 482
under the Securities Act of 1933, Advertising by an Investment Company as Satisfying
Requirements of Section 10” (OMB Control No. 3235-0565); “Form N-1A under the Securities
Act of 1933 and under the Investment Company Act of 1940, Registration statement of open-end
management investment companies” (OMB Control No. 3235-0307); “Form N-MFP, Monthly
schedule of portfolio holdings of money market funds” (OMB Control No. 3235-0657); and
“Form PF, Reporting Form for Investment Advisers to Private Funds and Certain Commodity
2203

44 U.S.C. 3501 through 3521.

721

Pool Operators and Commodity Trading Advisers” (OMB Control No. 3235-0679). We are also
submitting new collections of information for new rule 30b1-8 and new Form N-CR under the
Investment Company Act of 1940. 2204 The Commission submitted these collections of
information to the OMB for review in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3507(d) and 5 CFR 1320.11.
An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of
information unless it displays a currently valid control number.
Today the Commission is adopting amendments intended to address money market
funds’ susceptibility to heavy redemptions, improve their ability to manage and mitigate
potential contagion from such redemptions, and increase the transparency of their risks. Our
amendments will (i) permit all money market funds to impose a liquidity fee and/or “gate” the
fund if a fund’s weekly liquidity level falls below the required regulatory amount; (ii) require all
non-government money market funds to impose a liquidity fee if the fund’s weekly liquidity
level falls below a designated regulatory threshold, unless the fund’s board determines that
imposing such a fee is not in the best interests of the fund; (iii) require, as a targeted reform, that
institutional non-government money market funds sell and redeem shares based on the current
market-based value of the securities in their underlying portfolios, rounded to four decimal
places (e.g., $1.0000), i.e., transact at a floating NAV; and (iv) require that money market funds
adopt other amendments designed to make money market funds more resilient, including
increasing diversification of their portfolios, enhancing their stress testing, and improving
transparency through enhanced disclosure. The amendments further require investment advisers
2204

We also are proposing additional amendments that do not affect the relevant rules’ paperwork collections
(e.g., we propose to amend Investment Company Act rule 12d3-1 solely to update cross references in that
rule to provisions of rule 2a-7).

722

to certain unregistered liquidity funds, which can resemble money market funds, to provide
additional information about those funds to the SEC. We discuss below the collection of
information burdens associated with these amendments.
A.

Rule 2a-7

A number of the amendments we are adopting today, including our liquidity fees and
gates reform, as well as our floating NAV reform, affect rule 2a-7. These amendments to rule
2a-7 also amend or establish new collection of information burdens by: (a) requiring money
market funds to be diversified with respect to the sponsors of asset-backed securities by deeming
the sponsor to guarantee the asset-backed security unless the fund’s board of directors makes a
finding otherwise; (b) requiring that “retail money market funds” adopt and implement policies
and procedures reasonably designed to limit beneficial ownership of the fund to natural persons;
(c) requiring that “government money market funds” amend policies and procedures to reflect
the 0.5% de minimis non-conforming basket; (d) requiring money market funds’ boards to make
and document a number of determinations regarding the imposition of fees and gates when
weekly liquid assets fall below a certain threshold; (e) replacing the requirement that funds
promptly notify the Commission via electronic mail of defaults and other events with disclosure
on new Form N-CR; (f) amending the stress testing requirements; and (g) amending the
disclosures that money market funds are required to post on their websites. Unless otherwise
noted, the estimated burden hours discussed below are based on estimates of Commission staff
with experience in similar matters. Several of the amendments create new collection of
information requirements. The respondents to these collections of information are money market
funds, investment advisers and other service providers to money market funds, including

723

financial intermediaries, as noted below. The currently approved burden for rule 2a-7 is 517,228
hours.
1.

Asset-Backed Securities

Under the amendments we are adopting today, we are requiring that a money market fund
treat the sponsors of ABS as guarantors subject to rule 2a-7’s 10% diversification limit
applicable to guarantee and demand features, unless the fund’s board of directors (or its delegate)
determines that the fund is not relying on the sponsor’s financial strength or its ability or
willingness to provide liquidity, credit or other support to determine the ABS’s quality or
liquidity. 2205 The board of directors must adopt written procedures requiring periodic evaluation
of this determination. 2206 Furthermore, for a period of not less than three years from the date
when the evaluation was most recently made, the fund must preserve and maintain, in an easily
accessible place, a written record of the evaluation. 2207 These requirements are collections of
information under the PRA, and are designed to help ensure that the objectives of the
diversification limitations are achieved. The new collection of information is mandatory for
money market funds that rely on rule 2a-7, and to the extent that the Commission receives
confidential information pursuant to the collection of information, such information will be kept
confidential, subject to the provisions of applicable law. 2208

2205

See rule 2a-7(a)(18)(ii).

See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 552 (Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act provides an exemption for “trade
secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.” 5

are “contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, or on behalf of, or
for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions.” 5 U.S.C.

724

In the Proposing Release, the Commission estimated that approximately 183 money
market funds held asset-backed securities and would have been required to adopt written
procedures regarding the periodic evaluation of determinations made by the fund as to ABS not
subject to guarantees. The Commission estimated the one-time burden to prepare and adopt
these procedures would have been 1,647 hours 2209 at approximately $1.2 million in total time
costs for all money market funds. 2210 Amortized over a three-year period, this would have
resulted in an average annual burden of 549 hours and time costs of approximately $400,000 for
all money market funds. 2211 The Commission estimated that the average annual burden to
prepare materials and written records for the boards’ required review of new and existing
determinations would have been 732 burden hours 2212 and approximately $940,071 in total time
costs for all money market funds. 2213 Averaging the initial burden plus the average annual
burdens over three years would have resulted in an average annual burden of 1,281 hours and
time costs of approximately $1.3 million for all money market funds. The Commission
estimated in the Proposing Release that there would have been no external costs associated with
this collection of information.

552(b)(8)).
2209

This estimate was based on the following calculation: 8 burden hours to prepare written procedures + 1
burden hour to adopt procedures = 9 burden hours per money market fund required to adopt procedures; 9
burden hours per money market fund x 183 funds expected to adopt procedures = 1,647 total burden hours.

2210

This estimate was based on the following calculation: 183 money market funds x $7,032 in total costs per
fund = $1.2 million.

2211

This estimate was based on the following calculations: 1,647 burden hours ÷ 3 = 549 average annual
burden hours; $1.2 million burden costs ÷ 3 = $400,000 average annual burden cost.

2212

This estimate was based on the following calculation: 4 burden hours per money market fund x 183 funds
= 732 total burden hours.

2213

This estimate was based on the following calculation: 183 money market funds x $5,137 in total costs per
fund = $940,071.

725

The Commission did not receive any comments on the estimated hour and cost burdens.
The Commission has modified the estimated increase in annual burden hours and total time costs
that will result from the amendment based on updated industry data. The Commission believes
that the written procedures will be developed for all the money market funds in a fund complex
by the fund adviser, and that a fund complex will have economies of scale to the extent that there
may be more than one money market fund in a complex. Based on its review of reports on Form
N-MFP as of February 28, 2014, the Commission estimates that approximately 152 money
market funds hold asset-backed securities and will be required to adopt written procedures
regarding the periodic evaluation of determinations made by the fund as to ABS not subject to
guarantees. The Commission continues to estimate that it will take approximately eight hours of
a fund attorney’s time to prepare the procedures and one hour for a board to adopt the
procedures. Therefore, the Commission estimates the one-time burden to prepare and adopt
these procedures will be approximately nine hours per money market fund, at a time cost of
$7,440 per fund. 2214 The Commission further estimates the one-time burden to prepare and adopt
these procedures will be 1,368 hours 2215 at $1,130,880 in total time costs for all money market

2214

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (8 hours x $380 per hour for an attorney = $3,040) + (1
hour x $4,400 per hour for a board of 8 directors = $4,400) = $7,440. The staff previously estimated in
2009 that the average cost of board of director time was $4,000 per hour for the board as a whole, based on
information received from funds and their counsel. Adjusting for inflation, the staff estimates that the
current average cost of board of director time is approximately $4,400. All other estimated wage figures
discussed here and throughout section IV of this Release are based on published rates have been taken from
SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013, available at
http://www.sifma.org/research/item.aspx?id=8589940603, modified by Commission staff to account for an
1800-hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and
overhead.

2215

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 8 burden hours to prepare written procedures + 1
burden hour to adopt procedures = 9 burden hours per money market fund required to adopt procedures; 9
burden hours per money market fund x 152 funds expected to adopt procedures = 1,368 total burden hours.

726

funds. 2216 Amortized over a three-year period, this will result in an average annual burden of 456
hours and time costs of $376,960 for all funds. 2217 The Commission continues to estimate that a
money market fund that will be required to adopt such written procedures will spend, on an
annual basis, (i) two hours of a fund attorney’s time to prepare materials for the board’s review
of new and existing determinations, (ii) one hour for the board to review those materials and
make the required determinations, and (iii) one hour of a fund attorney’s time per year, on
average, to prepare the written records of such determinations. 2218 Therefore, the Commission
estimates that the average annual burden to prepare materials and written records for a board’s
required review of new and existing determinations will be approximately four hours per fund 2219
at a time cost of approximately $5,540 per fund. 2220 The Commission therefore estimates the
annual burden will be 608 burden hours 2221 and $842,080 in total time costs for all money market
funds. 2222 Adding the one-time burden, amortized over three years, to prepare and adopt
procedures with the annual burden to prepare materials for determinations will result in a total

2216

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 152 money market funds x $7,440 in total costs per
fund complex = $1,130,880.

2217

This estimate is based on the following calculations: 1,368 burden hours ÷ 3 = 456 average annual burden
hours; $1,130,880 burden costs ÷ 3 = $376,960 average annual burden cost.

2218

This estimate includes documenting, if applicable, the fund board’s determination that the fund is not
relying on the fund sponsor’s financial strength or its ability or willingness to provide liquidity or other
credit support to determine the ABS’s quality or liquidity. See rule 2a-7(a)(18)(ii) and rule 2a-7(h)(6).

2219

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 2 hours to adopt + 1 hour for board review + 1 hour for
record preparation = 4 hours per year.

2220

This estimate is based on the following calculations: (3 hours x $380 per hour for an attorney = $1,140) +
(1 hour x $4,400 per hour for a board of 8 directors = $4,400) = $5,540.

2221

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 4 burden hours per money market fund x 152 funds
= 608 total burden hours.

2222

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 152 money market funds x $5,540 in total costs per
fund = $842,080.

727

amortized annual burden of 1,064 hours and time costs of $1,219,040 for all funds. 2223 We
estimate that there are no external costs associated with this collection of information.
2.

Retail and Government Funds
i.

Retail Funds

Under our floating NAV reform, a retail money market fund—which means a money
market fund that adopts and implements policies and procedures reasonably designed to limit
beneficial owners to natural persons—will be allowed to continue to maintain a stable NAV
through the use of amortized cost valuation and/or penny-rounding pricing. The requirement that
retail money market funds adopt policies and procedures is a collection of information under the
PRA. The new collections of information are mandatory for money market funds that seek to
qualify as “retail money market funds” under rule 2a-7 as amended, 2224 and to the extent that the
Commission receives confidential information pursuant to this collection of information, such
information will be kept confidential, subject to the provisions of applicable law. 2225

For purposes of the PRA, the Commission estimates that approximately 55 money market
fund complexes will seek to qualify as retail money market funds under rule 2a-7 and therefore
be required to adopt written policies and procedures reasonably designed to limit beneficial
owners to natural persons. 2226 We continue to estimate, as we did in the Proposing Release, that

2223

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (1,368 burden hours ÷ 3 = 456 average annual burden
hours) + 608 annual burden hours = 1,064 hours; ($1,130,880 burden costs ÷ 3 = $376,960 average annual
burden cost) + $842,080 annual time costs = $1,219,040.

2224

See rule 2a-7(a)(25); 2a-7(c)(1)(i).

2225

See supra note 2208.

2226

For purposes of the PRA, staff estimates that those money market funds that self-reported as “retail” funds
as of February 28, 2014 (based on iMoneyNet data) will likely seek to qualify as retail money market funds
under amended rule 2a-7. Based on iMoneyNet data, these 55 fund complexes managed 195 self-reported

728

it will take approximately 12 hours of a fund attorney’s time to prepare the procedures and one
hour for a board to adopt the procedures. 2227 The Commission did not receive any comments on
the estimated hour and cost burdens. Accordingly, we have modified our estimate of the total
time cost that will result from the amendments based on updated industry data and estimate an
initial time cost of approximately $8,960 per fund complex. 2228 Therefore, we estimate the onetime burden to prepare and adopt these procedures will be approximately 715 hours 2229 at
$492,800 in total time costs for all fund complexes. 2230 Amortized over a three year period, this
will result in an average annual burden of 238 hours and time costs of $164,267 for all funds. 2231
We estimate that there are no external costs associated with this collection of information.
ii.

Government Funds

Under today’s amendments, government money market funds will not be required to
implement a floating NAV or fees and gates. We define a government money market fund to
mean a fund that invests at least 99.5% of its total assets in cash, government securities, and/or
repurchase agreements collateralized by cash or government securities. Currently, a government
“retail” money market funds.
2227

Staff believes that the burden associated with drafting and adopting policies and procedures reasonably
designed to limit beneficial ownership to natural persons will be approximately the same as the burden that
would have been required under our proposal (requiring that funds adopt and implement procedures
reasonably designed to allow the conclusion that the omnibus account holder does not permit any beneficial
owner, directly or indirectly, to redeem more than the daily permitted amount).

2228

This estimate is based on the following calculation: ([12 hours x $380 per hour for an attorney = $4,560] +
[1 hour x $4,400 per hour for a board of 8 directors = $4,400] = $8,960).

2229

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 12 burden hours to prepare written procedures + 1
burden hour to adopt procedures = 13 burden hours per money market fund complex; 13 burden hours per
fund complex x 55 fund complexes = 715 total burden hours for all fund complexes.

2230

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 55 fund complexes x $8,960 in total costs per fund
complex = $492,800.

2231

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 715 burden hours ÷ 3 = 238 average annual burden
hours; $492,800 burden costs ÷ 3 = $164,267 average annual burden cost.

729

money market fund is permitted to invest up to 20% of its total assets in non-government
assets. 2232 Under our amendments, a government money market fund will no longer be permitted
to invest up to 20% of its total assets in non-government assets; rather, these funds will be
permitted a 0.5% de minimis non-conforming basket in which the fund may invest in nongovernment assets. Accordingly, we anticipate that government money market funds will need
to amend their existing policies and procedures to reflect the new 0.5% de minimis basket.
For purposes of the PRA, the Commission estimates that approximately 60 money market
fund complexes will seek to qualify as government money market funds under rule 2a-7 and
therefore be required to amend their written policies and procedures to reflect the 0.5% de
minimis basket. 2233 We estimate that it will take approximately one hour of a fund attorney’s
time to amend the procedures and 0.5 hours for a board to adopt the amended procedures.
Accordingly, we estimate the total initial time cost that will result from the amendments will be
approximately $2,580 per fund complex. 2234 Therefore, we estimate the one-time burden to
amend these procedures will be approximately 90 hours 2235 at $154,800 in total time costs for all
fund complexes. 2236 Amortized over a three-year period, this will result in an average annual

2232

See supra note 628 (defining “non-government assets”); see also supra note 629 (noting that the “names
rule” effectively limits government funds from investing more than 20% of total assets in non-government
assets).

2233

This estimate is based on Form N-MFP data as of February 28, 2014.

2234

This estimate is based on the following calculation: ([1 hours x $380 per hour for an attorney = $380] +
[0.5 hours x $4,400 per hour for a board of 8 directors = $2,200] = $2,580).

2235

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 1 burden hours to amend written procedures + 0.5
burden hours to adopt procedures = 1.5 burden hours per money market fund complex; 1.5 burden hours
per fund complex x 60 fund complexes = 90 total burden hours for all fund complexes.

2236

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 60 fund complexes x $2,580 in total costs per fund
complex = $154,800.

730

burden of approximately 30 hours and time costs of $51,600 for all funds. 2237 We estimate that
there are no external costs associated with this collection of information.
3.

Board Determinations – Fees and Gates

Under the fees and gates amendments, if a money market fund’s weekly liquid assets fall
below 30% or 10%, respectively, of its total assets, the fund’s board may be required to make
and document a number of determinations regarding the imposition of fees and gates, 2238
including (i) whether to impose a liquidity fee, and if so, what the amount of the liquidity fee
should be (not to exceed 2%); (ii) whether to impose a redemption gate; (iii) when to remove a
liquidity fee put in place (subject to other rule requirements); and (iv) when to lift a redemption
gate put in place (subject to other rule requirements). 2239 This requirement is a collection of
information under the PRA, and is designed to ensure that a fund that imposes a fee or gate does
so when it is in its best interests (as determined by its board). This new collection of information
is mandatory for money market funds that rely on rule 2a-7, and to the extent that the
Commission receives confidential information pursuant to these collections of information, such
information will be kept confidential, subject to the provisions of applicable law. 2240
As proposed, the fees and gates amendments would have required the same collection of
information if a money market fund’s weekly liquid assets fell below 15% of its total assets. As
2237

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 90 burden hours ÷ 3 = 30 average annual burden hours;
$154,800 burden costs ÷ 3 = $51,600 average annual burden cost.

2238

As discussed in section III.A above, after a fund’s weekly liquid assets have dropped below 30%, a fund’s
board may determine that it is in the best interests of the fund to impose a liquidity fee or redemption gate.
After a fund’s weekly liquid assets have dropped below 10%, a fund must impose a 1% a liquidity fee on
all redemptions, unless its board determines it is not in the best interests of the fund to do so. See rule 2a7(c)(2)(i) and (ii).

2239

2240

See supra note 2208.

731

discussed in the Proposing Release, Commission staff analysis of Form N-MFP data showed
that, between March 2011 and October 2012, five prime money market funds had weekly liquid
assets below 15% of total assets. 2241 As set forth in the Proposing Release, the same
Commission staff analysis of Form N-MFP data shows that 138 prime money market funds had
weekly liquid assets below 30% of total assets during this same period. 2242 In the proposal, the
Commission estimated approximately 28 annual burden hours, 2243 and a total time cost of
$39,580 for all money market funds. 2244 We did not receive any comments on the estimated
hour and cost burdens related to board determinations under the fees and gates amendments.
The Commission continues to estimate that the affected money market funds that will
satisfy the triggering event will spend, on an annual basis, (i) four hours of a fund attorney’s time
to prepare materials for the board’s determinations, (ii) two hours for the board to review those
materials and make the required determinations, and (iii) one hour of a fund attorney’s time per
year, on average, to prepare the written records of such determinations. 2245 Therefore, the
Commission estimates that the average annual burden to prepare materials and written records

2241

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at 548-49 (showing that, during the period, four funds dropped
below 15% weekly liquid assets and one fund dropped below 10% weekly liquid assets).

2242

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at 177. This same analysis shows that one prime money market fund
had weekly liquid assets below 10% between March 2011 and October 2012. Because 30% is the higher
threshold, the fund that dropped below 10% weekly liquid assets during the period would also be included
within the 138 funds that crossed below 30% weekly liquid assets during the period.

2243

This estimate was based on the following calculation: 7 burden hours per money market fund x 4 funds
= 28 total burden hours.

2244

This estimate was based on the following calculation: 4 money market funds x $9,895 in total costs per
fund complex = $39,580.

2245

This estimate includes preparing and evaluating materials relevant to the determinations required in
imposing (and removing) either or both liquidity fees and redemption gates. See supra note 2239.

732

for a board’s required determinations will be approximately seven hours per fund, 2246 the same as
proposed, at a time cost of approximately $10,700 per fund. 2247 The estimated time cost has
increased from the proposal, which estimated $9,895 per fund, as a result of updated industry
data. 2248 Based on a total of 83 funds per year that will have weekly liquid assets below 30% of
total assets, 2249 the Commission estimates the annual burden will be approximately 581 burden
hours, 2250 and $888,100 in total time costs for all money market funds. 2251
The increases in annual burden hours and total time costs from the proposal are largely
due to the increase in the estimated number of funds that will be subject to collection of
information (from four to 83) as a result of the higher weekly liquid assets threshold for
imposition of fees and gates. We estimate that there are no external costs associated with this
collection of information.

2246

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 4 hours to prepare materials + 2 hours for board review
+ 1 hour for record preparation = 7 hours per year.

2247

This estimate is based on the following calculation: [5 hours x $380 per hour for an attorney = $1900] + [2
hours x $4,400 per hour for a board of 8 directors = $8,800] = $10,700.

2248

The proposal estimated $379 per hour for an attorney based on published rates that had been taken from
SIFMA’s Management and Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2012, available at
http://www.sifma.org/research/item.aspx?id=8589940603, modified by Commission staff to account for an
1800-hour work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and
overhead. The proposal also estimated that the average cost of board of director time was $4,000 per hour
for the board as a whole based on information received from funds and their counsel. Adjusting for
inflation, the staff estimates that the current average cost of board of director time is approximately $4,400.

2249

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (138 funds ÷ 20 months) x 12 months = 83 funds per
year.

2250

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 7 burden hours per fund x 83 funds = 581 burden
hours.

2251

This estimate is based on the following calculation: $10,700 in total costs per fund x 83 money market
funds = $888,100.

Notice to the Commission

Our amendments also eliminate, as proposed, the requirements under rule 2a-7 relating to
notifications money market funds must make to the Commission upon the occurrence of certain
events. Specifically, the amendments eliminate the requirements for money market funds to
promptly notify the Director of Investment Management or its designee by electronic mail (i) of
any default or event of insolvency with respect to the issuer of one or more portfolio securities
(or any issuer of a demand feature or guarantee), where immediately before the default the
securities comprised one half of one percent or more of the fund’s total assets; 2252 and (ii) of any
purchase of a security from the fund by an affiliated person in reliance on rule 17a-9 under the
Investment Company Act. 2253 The Proposing Release also estimated that approximately 20
money market funds per year previously would have been required to provide the notification of
an event of default or insolvency, and that each such notification would entail 0.5 burden hours.
The Commission also estimated that approximately 25 money market fund complexes per year
previously would have been required to provide notification of a purchase of a portfolio security
in reliance on rule 17a-9, and each such notification would entail one burden hour. Based on
these estimates, we calculated that the elimination of these requirements would reduce the
current annual burden by approximately 10 hours for notices of default or insolvency, at a total

2252

See current rule 2a-7(c)(7)(iii)(A) (requiring that the notice include a description of the actions the money
market fund intends to take in response to the event).

2253

See current rule 2a-7(c)(7)(iii)(B) (requiring that the notice include identification of the security, its
amortized cost, the sale price, and the reasons for the purchase).

734

time cost savings of $3,790, 2254 and by approximately 25 hours for notices of purchases in
reliance on rule 17a-9, at a total time cost savings of $9,475. 2255
No commenters addressed the number of money market funds that would be affected by
the proposal or the estimated reduction in annual burden hours or total time cost savings that
would result from the proposed amendments. Accordingly, the Commission has not modified
the estimated reduction in annual burden hours associated with the amendments, although it has
modified its estimate of the total hour burden reduction that will result from the amendments
based on updated industry data. Given these estimates, the amendments will reduce the current
annual burden by approximately 10 hours for notices of default or insolvency, at a total time cost
reduction of $3,800, 2256 and by approximately 25 hours for notices of purchases in reliance on
rule 17a-9, at a total time cost reduction of $9,500. 2257 Therefore, the total reduction in burden is
35 hours at a total time cost of $13,300. 2258 We estimate that there are no external costs
associated with this collection of information.
5.

Stress Testing

We are adopting amendments to the stress testing requirements under rule 2a-7.
2254

This estimate was based on the following calculations: 20 funds x 0.5 hour reduction in hours per fund =
reduction of 10 hours; 10 burden hours x $379 per hour for an attorney = $3,790.

2255

This estimate was based on the following calculations: 25 fund complexes x 1 hour reduction in hours per
fund = reduction of 25 hours; 25 burden hours x $379 per hour for an attorney = $9,475.

2256

This estimate is based on the following calculations: 20 funds x 0.5 hour reduction in hours per fund =
reduction of 10 hours; 10 burden hours x $380 per hour for an attorney = $3,800.

2257

This estimate is based on the following calculations: 25 fund complexes x 1 hour reduction in hours per
fund = reduction of 25 hours; 25 burden hours x $380 per hour for an attorney = $9,500.

2258

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 10 hours (reduction for notices of default or
insolvency) + 25 hours (reduction for notices of purchases in reliance on rule 17a-9) = 35 hours total
reduction; $3,800 (reduction for notices of default or insolvency) + $9,500 (reduction for notices of
purchases in reliance on rule 17a-9) = $13,300 total reduction.

735

Specifically, we are adopting reforms to the current stress testing provisions that will require
funds to test their ability to maintain weekly liquid assets of at least 10% and to minimize
principal volatility in response to specified hypothetical events that include (i) increases in the
level of short-term interest rates, (ii) a downgrade or default of particular portfolio security
positions, each representing various portions of the fund’s portfolio, and (iii) the widening of
spreads in various sectors to which the fund’s portfolio is exposed, each in combination with
various increases in shareholder redemptions. A written copy of the procedures and any
modifications thereto, must be maintained and preserved for a period of not less than six years
following the replacement of such procedures with new procedures, the first two years in an
easily accessible place. 2259 In addition, the written procedures must provide for a report of the
stress testing results to be presented to the board of directors at its next regularly scheduled
meeting (or sooner, if appropriate in light of the results). 2260 These requirements are collections
of information under the PRA, and are designed, in part, to address disparities in the quality and
comprehensiveness of stress tests. The collection of information is mandatory for money market
funds that rely on rule 2a-7, and to the extent that the Commission receives confidential
information pursuant to this collection of information, such information will be kept confidential,
subject to the provisions of applicable law. 2261

In the Proposing Release, we noted that we were proposing to amend the stress testing
provisions of rule 2a-7 to enhance the hypothetical events for which a fund (or its adviser) is

2259

See rule 2a-7(h)(8).

2260

See rule 2a-7(g)(8)(ii).

2261

See supra note 2208.

736

required to stress test, including: (i) increases (rather than changes) in the general level of shortterm interest rates; (ii) downgrades or defaults of portfolio securities, and the effects these events
could have on other securities held by the fund; (iii) “widening or narrowing of spreads among
the indexes to which interest rates of portfolio securities are tied”; (iv) other movements in
interest rates that may affect the fund’s portfolio securities, such as shifts in the yield curve; and
(v) combinations of these and any other events the adviser deems relevant, assuming a positive
correlation of risk factors. 2262 Under our proposed amendments, floating NAV money market
funds would have been required to replace their current stress test for the ability to maintain a
stable price per share with a test of the fund’s ability to maintain 15% of its total assets in weekly
liquid assets.
Based on the proposed amendments to stress testing, the Commission estimated in the
Proposing Release that each fund that would have been required to implement the proposed
stress testing changes would have to incur an average one-time burden of 92 hours at a time cost
of $42,688. 2263 Based on an estimate of 92 funds that would incur this one-time burden, 2264 the
Commission estimated that the aggregate one-time burden for all money market funds to

2262

See proposed (FNAV) rule 2a-7(g)(7).

2263

Staff estimated that these systems modifications would include the following costs: (i) project planning
and systems design (24 hours x $291 (hourly rate for a senior systems analyst) = $6,984); (ii) systems
modification integration, testing, installation, and deployment (32 hours x $282 (hourly rate for a senior
programmer) = $9,024); (iii) drafting, integrating, implementing procedures and controls (24 hours x $327
(blended hourly rate for assistant general counsel ($467), chief compliance officer ($441), senior EDP
auditor ($273) and operations specialist ($126)) = $7,848); and (iv) preparation of training materials ((8
hours x $354 (hourly rate for an assistant compliance director) = $2,832) + (4 hours (4 hour training session
for board of directors) x $4,000 (hourly rate for board of 8 directors) = $16,000) = $18,832). Therefore,
staff estimated an average one-time burden of 92 hours (24+32+24+8+4), at a total cost per fund of
$42,688 ($6,984+$9,024+$7,848+$18,832).

2264

This estimate was based on staff experience and discussions with industry.

737

implement the proposed amendments to stress testing would have been 8,464 hours at a total
time cost of $3.9 million.2265 Amortized over a three year period, this would have resulted in an
average annual burden of 2,821 burden hours and $1.3 million total time cost for all funds. 2266
The Commission estimated in the Proposing Release that there would have been no external
costs associated with this collection of information. The Commission did not receive any
comments on the estimated hour and cost burdens.
Although we are adopting amendments to the stress testing requirements with
modifications from the proposal, the Commission does not believe that the changes from the
proposed amendments will directly affect the burden hours or total time costs associated with the
requirement that money market funds maintain a written copy of their stress testing procedures,
and any modifications thereto, and preserve for a period of not less than six years following the
replacement of such procedures with new procedures, the first two years in an easily accessible
place. However, the Commission has modified the estimated increase in annual burden hours
and total time costs that will result from the amendment based on updated industry data.
We understand that most money market funds, in their normal course of risk
management, include many of the elements we are adopting in their stress testing. Nevertheless,
we expect that funds may incur a one-time internal burden to reprogram an existing system to
provide the required reports of stress testing results based on our amendments. We believe that
the stress testing procedures will be modified for all the money market funds in a fund complex
2265

This estimate was based on the following calculations: 92 funds x 92 hours per fund = 8,464 hours; 92
funds x $42,688 = $3.9 million.

2266

This estimate is based on the following calculations: 8,464 hours ÷ 3 = 2,821 burden hours; $3.9 million ÷
3 = $1.3 million burden cost.

738

by the fund adviser, and that a fund complex will have economies of scale to the extent that there
may be more than one money market fund in a complex. The Commission estimates that each
fund that will have to implement the stress testing changes will incur an average one-time burden
of 92 hours at a time cost of $43,872. 2267 Based on an estimate of 559 money market funds that
will incur this one-time burden, 2268 the Commission estimates that the aggregate one-time burden
for all money market funds to implement the amendments to stress testing will be 51,428 hours
at a total time cost of $24,524,448. 2269 Amortized over a three year period, this will result in an
average annual burden of approximately 17,143 burden hours and $8,174,816 total time cost for
all funds. 2270 We estimate that there are no external costs associated with this collection of
information.
Each report to the board of directors will include an assessment of the money market
fund’s ability to have invested at least 10% of its total assets in weekly liquid assets and to
minimize principal volatility, and an assessment by the fund’s adviser of the fund’s ability to
withstand the events that are reasonably likely to occur within the following year. Under current
2267

The Commission estimates that these systems modifications will include the following costs: (i) project
planning and systems design (24 hours x $260 (hourly rate for a senior systems analyst) = $6,240); (ii)
systems modification integration, testing, installation, and deployment (32 hours x $303 (hourly rate for a
senior programmer) = $9,696); (iii) drafting, integrating, implementing procedures and controls (24 hours x
$319 (blended hourly rate for assistant general counsel ($426), chief compliance officer ($485), senior EDP
auditor ($241) and operations specialist ($125)) = $7,656); and (iv) preparation of training materials ((8
hours x $335 (hourly rate for an assistant compliance director) = $2,680) + (4 hours (4 hour training session
for board of directors) x $4,400 (hourly rate for board of 8 directors) = $17,600) = $20,280). Therefore, the
Commission estimates an average one-time burden of 92 hours (24+32+24+8+4), at a total cost per fund of
$43,872 ($6,240+$9,696+$7,656+$20,280).

2268

We increased the estimated number of funds from the Proposing Release based on staff experience and
discussions with industry.

2269

This estimate is based on the following calculations: 559 funds x 92 hours per fund = 51,428 hours; 559
funds x $43,872 = $24,524,448

2270

This estimate is based on the following calculations: 51,428 hours ÷ 3 = approximately 17,143 burden
hours; $24,524,448 ÷ 3 = $8,174,816.

739

rule 2a-7, money market funds are required to have written procedures that provide for a report
of the stress testing results to be presented to the board of directors at its next regularly scheduled
meeting (or sooner, if appropriate in light of the results). However, because we are amending the
type of information that must be included in the report to the board, we have estimated the
collection of information burden hours increase and the total time cost increase.
The Commission estimates that it will take on average an additional: (i) two hours of
portfolio management time, (ii) one hour of compliance time, (iii) one hour of professional legal
time and (iv) 0.5 hours of support staff time, requiring an additional 4.5 burden hours at a time
cost of approximately $1,302 per fund. 2271 Under normal circumstances, the report must be
provided at the next scheduled board meeting, and the Commission estimates that the report and
the adviser’s assessment will cover all money market funds in a complex. For purposes of these
calculations, the Commission assumes that funds will conduct stress tests no less than monthly.
With an average of six board meetings each year, the Commission estimates that the annual
burden for regularly scheduled reports will be 27 hours per money market fund. 2272 Under the
rule, a report must be provided earlier if appropriate in light of the results of the test. The
Commission estimates that as a result of unanticipated changes in market conditions or other
events, stress testing results are likely to prompt additional reports on average four times each
year. 2273 Thus, the Commission estimates reports will result in an additional 18 hours for an

2271

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (2 hours x $301 per hour for a portfolio manager =
$602) + (1 hour x $283 for a compliance manager = $283) + (1 hour x $380 for an attorney = $380) + (0.5
hours x $74 per hour for an administrative assistant = $37) = $1,302.

2272

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (2 hours (portfolio management) + 1 hour (compliance)
+ 1 hour (legal) + 0.5 hours (support staff)) = 4.5 hours x 6 meetings = 27 hours.

2273

The Commission anticipates that in many years there will be no need for special reports, but that in a year

740

individual fund each year. 2274 The Commission estimates the total annual burden for all money
market funds will be an additional 25,155 hours at a total time cost of $7,278,180. 2275
Adding the one-time burden, amortized over three years, to implement the stress testing
amendments with the annual burden to report the results of the stress tests to the board of will
result in a total amortized annual burden of 42,298 hours and time costs of $15,452,996 for all
funds. 2276 We estimate that there are no external costs associated with this collection of
information.
6.

Website Disclosure

The amendments we are adopting today require money market funds to disclose certain
additional information on their websites. These amendments promote transparency to investors
of money market funds’ risks and risk management by:
• Harmonizing the specific portfolio holdings information that rule 2a-7 requires a fund
to disclose on the fund’s website with the corresponding portfolio holdings information
required to be reported on Form N-MFP; 2277

in which there is severe market stress, a fund may report to the board weekly for a period of 3 to 6 months.
Such reporting will generate 9 to 18 reports in addition to the regular monthly reports. Assuming that this
type of event may occur once every five years, and additional reports will be generated for 6 months, a fund
will produce an average of four additional reports per year (18 additional reports ÷ 5 = 3.6 reports).
2274

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 4.5 hours x 4 = 18 hours.

2275

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (27 hours + 18 hours = 45 hours) x 559 money market
funds = 25,155 hours and ($1,302 x (6 regularly scheduled reports + 4 additional reports = 10 reports per
year) = $13,020 per fund) x 559 funds = $7,278,180.

2276

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (51,428 burden hours ÷ 3 = 17,143 average annual
burden hours) + 25,155 annual burden hours = 42,298 hours; ($24,524,448 burden costs ÷ 3 = $8,174,816
average annual burden cost) + $7,278,180 annual time costs = $15,452,996.

Disclosure of Portfolio Holdings Information

We are adopting, largely as proposed, the requirement for a money market fund to
disclose on its website certain portfolio holdings information that the fund also will be required
to disclose on Form N-MFP. This requirement will harmonize the holdings information that a

fund is required to disclose on its website with the corresponding portfolio holdings information
required to be reported on Form N-MFP. We anticipate that the burden for each fund to draft
and finalize the disclosure that appears on its website will largely be incurred when the fund files
Form N-MFP. 2281 In the Proposing Release, the Commission estimated that a fund would incur
an additional burden of one hour each time that it updates its website to include the new
disclosure. Using an estimate of 586 money market funds that would be required to include the
proposed new portfolio holdings disclosure on the fund’s website, we estimated that each fund
would incur 12 additional hours of internal staff time per year (one hour per monthly filing), at a
time cost of $2,484, to update the website to include the new disclosure, for a total of 7,032
aggregate hours per year, at a total aggregate time cost of $1,455,624.
Certain commenters generally noted that complying with the new website disclosure
requirements would add costs for funds, including costs to upgrade internal systems and software
relevant to the website disclosure requirements (which possibly could include costs to engage
third-party service providers for those money market fund managers that do not have existing
relevant systems). 2282 One commenter, however, noted that the portfolio holdings disclosure

(i) the categories of a money fund’s portfolio securities; (ii) maturity date information for each of the fund’s
portfolio securities; and (iii) market-based values of the fund’s portfolio securities at the same time as this
information becomes publicly available on Form N-MFP. We believe this information is too detailed to be
useful to most investors and would be cost prohibitive to provide. Complying with these new website
disclosure requirements would add notable costs for each money fund that UBS Global AM advises.”);
Chamber II Comment Letter (“With respect to the website disclosure requirements, internal systems and
software would need to be upgraded or, for those MMF managers that do not have existing systems,
third-party service providers would need to be engaged. The costs (which ultimately would be borne by
investors through higher fees or lower yields) could potentially be significant to an MMF and higher than
those estimated in the Proposal.”); Dreyfus Comment Letter (noting that “several of the new Form
reporting and web site and registration statement disclosure requirements . . . come with . . . material cost
to funds and their sponsors”); see also Fin. Svcs. Roundtable Comment Letter (noting that the disclosure

requirements should not cause a significant cost increase as long as the information is made
available from relevant accounting systems, 2283 and another commenter stated that the proposed
disclosure requirements generally should not produce any meaningful costs. 2284 Another
commenter urged the Commission to harmonize new disclosure requirements so that funds
would face lower administrative burdens, and investors would bear correspondingly fewer
costs. 2285 As described above, the portfolio holdings disclosure requirements we are adopting
have changed slightly from those that we proposed, in order to conform to modifications we are
making to the proposed Form N-MFP disclosure requirements. 2286 The Commission estimates
that the number of money market funds is currently 559 and that the hour burden per fund
remains the same as previously estimated. 2287 Because the 2010 money market fund reforms
already require money market funds to post monthly portfolio information on their websites, 2288
funds should not need to upgrade their systems and software, or develop relevant systems (either
in-house or with the assistance of a third-party service provider) to comply with the new
portfolio holdings information disclosure requirements. The Commission therefore does not

investors and portfolio issuers).

believe that comments about the costs required to upgrade relevant systems and software should
affect its estimates of the burdens and costs associated with the portfolio holdings disclosure
requirements. Taking this into consideration, the Commission has not modified its previous hour
burden estimates. Although we have slightly revised the portfolio holdings disclosure
requirements since proposing the requirements, we believe that these revisions do not produce
additional burdens for funds and thus does not affect previous hour burden estimates.
Based on an estimate of 559 money market funds posting their portfolio holdings on their
webpages, we estimate that, in the aggregate, the amendment will result in a total of 6,708
burden hours per year, 2289 at a total aggregate time cost of $1,522,716. 2290 We estimate that there
are no external costs associated with this collection of information.
b.

Disclosure of Daily Weekly Assets and Weekly Liquid Assets and
Net Shareholder Flow

We are adopting, as proposed, the requirement for a money market fund to disclose on its
website a schedule, chart, graph, or other depiction showing the percentage of the fund’s total
assets that are invested in daily and weekly liquid assets, as well as the fund’s net inflows or
outflows, as of the end of each business day during the preceding six months. The burdens
associated with this requirement include one-time burdens as well as ongoing burdens. In the
Proposing Release, the Commission estimated that a money market fund would incur a one-time
burden of 70 hours, at a time cost of $20,150, to design the required schedule, chart, graph, or

other depiction, and to make the necessary software programming changes to the fund’s website
to disclose the percentage of the fund’s total assets that are invested in daily liquid assets and
weekly liquid assets, as well as the fund’s net inflows or outflows, as of the end of each business
day during the preceding six months. Using an estimate of 586 money market funds, the
Commission estimated that money market funds would incur, in aggregate, a total one-time
burden of 41,020 hours, at a time cost of $11,807,900, to comply with these website disclosure
requirements. We estimated that each fund would incur an ongoing annual burden of 32 hours,
at a time cost of $9,184, to update the depiction of daily and weekly liquid assets and the fund’s
net inflows or outflows on the fund’s website each business day during that year. We further
estimated that, in the aggregate, money market funds would incur an average ongoing annual
burden of 18,752 hours, at a time cost of $5,381,824, to comply with this disclosure requirement.
As discussed above, certain commenters generally noted that complying with the new
website disclosure requirements would add costs for funds, including costs to upgrade internal
systems and software relevant to the website disclosure requirements (which possibly could
include costs to engage third-party service providers for those money market fund managers that
do not have existing relevant systems). 2291 One commenter noted that these costs could
potentially be “significant to [a money market fund] and higher than those estimated in the
Proposing Release.” 2292 Another commenter suggested that obtaining the daily and weekly liquid
asset data for purposes of complying with the disclosure requirements would result in additional

746

costs that the Commission did not include in its estimate in the Proposing Release, namely, the
costs associated with the enhanced controls required to disseminate this information publicly
each day. 2293 However, one commenter stated that the proposed disclosure requirements should
not produce any meaningful costs. 2294
The Commission estimates that the number of money market funds is currently 559. We
agree that the one-time costs for certain money market funds to upgrade internal systems and
software, and/or develop such systems if a money market fund does not have existing relevant
systems, could be higher than those average one-time costs estimated in the Proposing Release.
However, because the estimated one-time costs were based on the mid-point of a range of
estimated costs, the higher costs that may be incurred by certain industry participants have
already been factored into our estimates. 2295 Our assumptions in estimating one-time hour and
cost burdens therefore have not changed from those discussed in the Proposing Release. Based
on an estimate of 559 money market funds posting information about their daily and weekly
liquid assets, as well as their net inflows or outflows, on their webpages, we estimate that, in the
aggregate, the amendment will result in a total one-time burden of 39,130 hours, 2296 at a time cost
of $11,336,520, 2297 to comply with these website disclosure requirements. Amortized over a

2293

See State Street Comment Letter at Appendix A (“Due to the inherent risks associated with public
disclosure, there will be enhanced controls required with respect to the daily public dissemination of daily
and weekly liquid assets and the risks of shareholders making redemption decisions in reliance on that
information . . . adds to staff to calculate and review the daily and weekly liquid assets.”).

2294

See HSBC Comment Letter.

2295

See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.1044.

2296

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 70 hours x 559 money market funds = 39,130 hours.

2297

This estimate is based on the following calculation: $20,280 per fund x 559 money market funds =
$11,336,520. The $20,280 per fund figure is, in turn, based on the following calculations: (20 hours (mid-

three-year period, this will result in an average annual burden of approximately 13,043 hours and
time costs of approximately $3,778,840 for all money market funds. 2298
The Commission agrees that money market funds may incur additional costs associated
with the enhanced controls required to publicly disseminate daily and weekly liquid asset data,
which costs were not estimated in the Proposing Release. Incorporating these additional costs
into new estimates, we estimate that each fund will incur an ongoing annual burden of 36
hours, 2299 at a time cost of $10,274, 2300 to update the depiction of daily and weekly liquid assets
and the fund’s net inflows or outflows on the fund’s website each business day during that year.

manager ($283) and a compliance attorney ($334)) = $6,180) + (50 hours (mid-point of 40 hours and 60
hours for project development, implementation, and testing) x $282 (blended hourly rate for a senior
systems analyst ($260) and a senior programmer ($303)) = $14,100) = $20,280 per fund. See Proposing
Release, supra note 25, at nn.1044 and 1045.
2298

This estimate was based on the following calculations: 39,130 burden hours ÷ 3 = 13,043 average annual
burden hours; $11,336,520 burden costs ÷ 3 = $3,778,840 average annual burden cost.

2299

The Commission estimates that the lower bound of the range of the ongoing annual hour burden to update
the required website information will be 21 hours per year (5 minutes per day x 252 business days in a year
= 1,260 minutes, or 21 hours). We estimate that the upper bound of the range of the ongoing annual hour
burden to update the required website information will be 42 hours per year (10 minutes per day x 252
business days in a year = 2,520 minutes, or 42 hours).
Additionally, we estimate that each fund will incur an additional ongoing annual hour burden of between 3
hours and 6 hours associated with implementing enhanced controls required to publicly disseminate the
data at issue. Specifically, depending on the controls the fund already has in place, the Commission
estimates that it will take a compliance manager and an attorney between 3 and 6 hours to review and
update (or if necessary, to develop and implement) the controls associated with the public dissemination of
daily liquid asset and weekly liquid asset data each year.
Because we do not have the information necessary to provide a point estimate of the costs to modify a
particular fund’s systems we thus have provided ranges of estimated costs in our economic analysis. See
supra section III.E.9.h. Likewise, for purposes of our estimates for the PRA analysis, we have taken the
mid-point of the range discussed above (mid-point of 24 hours (21 hours + 3 hours) and 48 hours (42 hours
+ 6 hours) = 36 hours).

2300

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (31.5 hours (mid-point of 21 hours and 42 hours for
updating the required website information) x $282 (blended rate for a senior systems analyst and senior
programmer) = $8,883) + (4.5 hours (mid-point of 3 hours and 6 hours for implementing enhanced controls
associated with public dissemination of data) x $309 (blended rate for a compliance manager and a
compliance attorney) = $1,391) = $10,274 per fund.

748

Based on an estimate of 559 money market funds posting information about their daily and
weekly liquid assets (as well as their net inflows or outflows) on their webpages, we estimate
that the amendment will result in an average aggregate ongoing annual burden of 20,124
hours, 2301 at a time cost of $5,743,166, 2302 to comply with this disclosure requirement.
Adding the one-time burden, amortized over three years, to prepare and adopt procedures
with the annual burden to prepare materials for determinations will result in a total amortized
annual burden of 33,167 hours and time costs of $9,522,006 for all funds. 2303 We estimate that
there are no external costs associated with this collection of information. 2304
c.

Disclosure of Daily Current NAV

We are adopting, as proposed, the requirement for a money market fund to disclose on its
website a schedule, chart, graph, or other depiction showing the fund’s current NAV per share as
of the end of each business day during the preceding six months. The burdens associated with
this requirement include one-time burdens as well as ongoing burdens. In the Proposing Release,
the Commission estimated that a money market fund would incur a one-time burden of 70 hours,
at a time cost of $20,150, to design the required schedule, chart, graph, or other depiction, and to
make the necessary software programming changes to the fund’s website to disclose the fund’s
2301

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 36 hours x 559 money market funds = 20,124 hours.

2302

This estimate is based on the following calculation: $10,274 per fund x 559 money market funds =
$5,743,166.

2303

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (39,130 burden hours ÷ 3 = 13,043 average annual
burden hours) + 20,124 annual burden hours = 33,167 hours; ($11,336,520 burden costs ÷ 3 = $3,778,840
average annual burden cost) + $5,743,166 annual time costs = $9,522,006.

2304

While a money market fund could rely on third-party service providers to assist in developing systems
relevant to the website disclosure requirements (see supra note 2282 and accompanying text; infra note
2305 and accompanying text), a fund also could rely on in-house capability to develop such systems. Our
cost estimates assume that funds will use in-house resources to develop such systems except where it is
more economical to use third-party service providers.

current NAV per share as of the end of each business day during the preceding six months.
Using an estimate of 586 money market funds, we estimated that money market funds would
incur, in aggregate, a total one-time burden of 41,020 hours, at a time cost of $11,807,900, to
comply with these website disclosure requirements. We estimated that each fund would incur an
ongoing annual burden of 32 hours, at a time cost of $9,184,

to

update the depiction of the fund’s

current NAV per share on the fund’s website each business day during that year. We further
estimated that, in the aggregate, money market funds would incur an average ongoing annual

As discussed above, certain commenters generally noted that complying with the new

do not have existing relevant systems). 2305 One commenter noted that these costs could
potentially be “significant to [a money market fund] and higher than those estimated in the
Proposal.” 2306 However, another commenter stated that it agrees that those money market funds
that presently publicize their current NAV per share daily on the fund’s website will incur few
additional costs to comply with the proposed disclosure requirements, and also that it agrees with
the Commission’s estimates for the ongoing costs of providing a depiction of the fund’s current
NAV each business day. 2307

one-time burden of 39,130 hours, 2309 at a time cost of $11,336,520, 2310 to comply with these
website disclosure requirements. As discussed above, we received no comments providing
specific suggestions or critiques about our assumptions in estimating ongoing hour and cost
burdens associated with the disclosure of a fund’s current NAV per share, and therefore our
methods of estimating these burdens also have not changed from those discussed in the
Proposing Release. Based on an estimate of 559 money market funds posting information about

disclosure requirements should not produce any “meaningful cost”).

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 70 hours x 559 money market funds = 39,130 hours.

This estimate is based on the following calculation: $20,280 per fund x 559 money market funds =
$11,336,520. The $20,280 per fund figure is, in turn, based on the following calculations: (20 hours (midpoint of 16 hours and 24 hours for project assessment) x $309 (blended hourly rate for a compliance

hours for project development, implementation, and testing) x $282 (blended hourly rate for a senior

their daily current NAV per share on their webpages, we estimate that, in the aggregate, the
amendment will result in an average ongoing annual burden of 17,888 hours, 2311 at a time cost of
$5,044,416, 2312 to comply with this disclosure requirement.
Amortizing these hourly and cost burdens over three years results in an average annual
increased burden of 30,931 burden hours 2313 at a time cost of $8,823,256. 2314 We estimate that
there are no external costs associated with this collection of information. 2315 Adding the one-time
burden, amortized over three years, to prepare and adopt procedures with the annual burden to
prepare materials for determinations will result in a total amortized annual burden of 30,931
hours and time costs of $8,823,256 for all funds. 2316

Disclosure Regarding Financial Support Received by the Fund, the
Imposition and Removal of Liquidity Fees, and the Suspension and
Resumption of Fund Redemptions

We are adopting, substantially as proposed, the requirement for a money market fund to
disclose on its website certain information that the fund is required to report on Form N-CR
2311

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 32 hours x 559 money market funds = 17,888 hours.

2312

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (32 hours x $282 (blended hourly rate for a senior
systems analyst ($260) and a senior programmer ($303)) = $9,024) x 559 money market funds =
$5,044,416.

2313

This estimate is based on the following calculation: [(39,130 initial burden hours + 17,888 annual burden
hours (year 1)) + 17,888 burden hours (year 2) + 17,888 burden hours (year 3)] ÷ 3 = 30,931 hours.

2314

This estimate is based on the following calculation: [($11,336,520 initial monetized burden + $5,044,416
monetized burden (year 1)) + $5,044,416 monetized burden (year 2) + $5,044,416 monetized burden (year
3)] ÷ 3 = $8,823,256.

2315

While a money market fund could rely on third-party service providers to assist in developing systems
relevant to the website disclosure requirements (see supra notes 2282 and 2305 and accompanying text), a
fund also could rely on in-house capability to develop such systems. Our cost estimates assume that funds
will use in-house resources to develop such systems except where it is more economical to use third-party
service providers.

2316

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (39,130 burden hours ÷ 3 = 13,043 average annual
burden hours) + 17,888 annual burden hours = 30,931 hours; ($11,336,520 burden costs ÷ 3 = $3,778,840
average annual burden cost) + $5,044,416 annual time costs = $8,823,256.

752

regarding the provision of financial support to the fund, as well as the imposition and removal of
liquidity fees, and the suspension and resumption of fund redemptions. 2317 In the Proposing
Release, the Commission estimated that the Commission would receive 40 reports per year filed
in response to an event specified on Part C (“Provision of financial support to Fund”) of Form
N-CR. We further estimated that the Commission would receive 8 reports per year filed in
response to events specified on Part E (“Imposition of liquidity fee”), Part F (“Suspension of
Fund redemptions”), and Part G (“Removal of liquidity fee and/or resumption of Fund
redemptions”). Using these numbers, we estimated that the requirement to disclose information
about financial support received by a money market fund on the fund’s website would result in a
total aggregate burden of 40 hours per year, at a total aggregate time cost of $8,280. We further
estimated that the requirement to disclose information about the imposition and removal of
liquidity fees, and the suspension and resumption of fund redemptions, on the fund’s website
would result in a total aggregate burden of eight hours per year, at a total aggregate time cost of
$1,656.
Although certain commenters generally noted, as discussed above, that complying with
the new website disclosure requirements would add costs for funds, 2318 one commenter stated that
the costs of disclosing liquidity fees and gates and instances of financial support on the fund’s
website would be minimal when compared to other costs, 2319 and another commenter stated that

2317

As discussed in section III.E.9, the final amendments include certain changes to the website disclosure
requirements from the proposal, largely designed to track the information on the website with the initial
filings that will be provided on Form N-CR.

753

the proposed disclosure requirements should not produce any meaningful costs. 2320 As described
above, we have modified the required time frame for disclosing information about financial
support received by a fund on the fund’s website, and have also modified the financial support
disclosure requirement to require a fund to post only a subset of the information required to be
filed in response to Part C of Form N-CR. However, this modification does not produce
additional burdens for funds because it merely allows more time for the same disclosure and thus
does not affect previous hour burden estimates. The Commission also has determined not to
change the assumptions used in our estimates in response to the comments we received, as the
comments provided no specific suggestions or critiques regarding our methods for estimating the
hour burdens and costs associated with the Form N-CR-linked website disclosure requirements.
We have, however, modified our estimates of the number of reports that will be filed each year
on Part C, Part E, Part F, and Part G of Form N-CR, and these modified estimates have affected
our estimates of the burdens associated with the related website disclosure requirements. 2321
Given these estimates, the requirement to disclose information about financial support received
by a money market fund on the fund’s website will result in a total aggregate burden of 30 hours
per year, at a total aggregate time cost of $6,810. 2322 In addition, the requirement to disclose
information about the imposition and removal of liquidity fees, and the suspension and

2320

See infra section IV.D.2.

2322

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 30 hours per year (1 hour per website update x 30 total
website updates per year) x $227 per hour for a webmaster = $6,810. Because all money market funds are
required to have a website (see rule 2a-7(h)(10)), and because the disclosure at issue does not require any
particular formatting or computational capacity, we assume that money market funds will not need to create
a website or update their current systems capability to disclose the relevant information, and therefore we
estimate that there are no one-time costs associated with this disclosure requirement.

754

resumption of fund redemptions, on the fund’s website will result in a total aggregate burden of
3.6 hours per year, at a total aggregate time cost of $817. 2323 We estimate that there are no
external costs associated with this collection of information.
e.

Change in Burden

The aggregate additional annual burden associated with the website disclosure
amendments discussed above is 70,840 hours 2324 at a time cost of $19,875,605. 2325 There is no
change in the external cost burden associated with this collection of information.

Total Burden for Rule 2a-7

The currently approved burden for rule 2a-7 is 517,228 hours. The net aggregate
additional burden hours associated with the amendments to rule 2a-7 increase the burden
estimate to 632,244 hours annually for all funds. 2326

2323

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 3.6 hours per year (1 hour per website update x 3.6
total website updates per year) x $227 per hour for a webmaster = approximately $817. We estimate that
there are no one-time costs associated with this disclosure requirement.

2324

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 6,708 hours (annual aggregate burden for the disclosure
of portfolio holdings information) + 33,167 (average annual aggregate burden for the disclosure of daily
liquid assets and weekly liquid assets and net shareholder flow) + 30,931 (average annual aggregate burden
for the disclosure of daily current NAV) + 30 hours (annual aggregate burden for the disclosure of financial
support provided to money market funds) + 3.6 hours (annual aggregate burden for the imposition and
removal of liquidity fees, and suspension and resumption of fund redemptions) = 70,840 hours. This
calculation reflects hourly burdens that have been amortized over three years, where appropriate.

2325

This estimate is based on the following calculation: $1,522,716 (annual aggregate costs associated with the
disclosure of portfolio holdings information) + $9,522,006 (average annual aggregate costs associated with
the disclosure of daily liquid assets and weekly liquid assets and net shareholder flow) + $8,823,256
(average annual aggregate costs associated with the disclosure of daily current NAV) + $6,810 (annual
aggregate costs associated with the disclosure of financial support provided to money market funds) + $817
(annual aggregate costs associated with the imposition and removal of liquidity fees, and suspension and
resumption of fund redemptions) = $19,875,605. This calculation reflects hourly burdens that have been
amortized over three years, where appropriate.

2326

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 517,228 hours (currently approved burden) + 1,064
hours (ABS determination & recordkeeping) + 238 hours (retail funds) + 30 hours (government funds) +
581 hours (board determinations) - 35 hours (notice to the Commission) + 42,298 hours (stress testing) +
70,840 (website disclosure) = 632,244 hours.

B.

Rule 22e-3

As outlined above, rule 22e-3 under the Investment Company Act exempts money market
funds from section 22(e) of the Act to permit them to suspend redemptions and postpone
payment of redemption proceeds in order to facilitate an orderly liquidation of the fund, provided
that certain conditions are met. The rule requires a money market fund to provide prior
notification to the Commission of its decision to suspend redemptions and liquidate. 2327 This
requirement is a collection of information under the PRA, and is designed to assist Commission
staff in monitoring a money market fund’s suspension of redemptions. The collection of
information is mandatory for any fund that holds itself out as a money market fund in reliance on
rule 2a-7 and any conduit funds that rely on the rule, 2328 and to the extent that the Commission
receives confidential information pursuant to this collection of information, such information will
be kept confidential, subject to the provisions of applicable law.

To provide shareholders with protections comparable to those currently provided by the
rule while also updating the rule to make it consistent with our amendments to rule 2a-7, we are
amending rule 22e-3 to permit a money market fund to invoke the exemption in rule 22e-3 if the
fund, at the end of a business day, has invested less than 10% of its total assets in weekly liquid
assets. 2329 As under the current rule, a money market fund that maintains a stable NAV will
continue to be able to invoke the exemption in rule 22e-3 if it has broken the buck or is about to

2327

See rule 22e-3(a)(3).

2328

The rule permits funds that invest in a money market fund pursuant to section 12(d)(1)(E) of the Act
(“conduit funds”) to rely on the rule, and requires the conduit fund to notify the Commission of its reliance
on the rule. See rule 22e-3(b).

2329

See rule 22e-3(a)(1).

756

“break the buck.” 2330
The amendments to rule 22e-3 are designed to permit a money market fund to suspend
redemptions when the fund is under significant stress, as the funds may do today under rule 22e3. We do not expect that money market funds will invoke the exemption provided by rule 22e-3
more frequently under our amendments than they do today. Although the amendments change
the circumstances under which a money market fund may invoke the exemption provided by rule
22e-3, the amended rule still will permit a money market fund to invoke the exemption only
when the fund is under significant stress, and we estimate that a money market fund is likely to
experience that level of stress and choose to suspend redemptions in reliance on rule 22e-3 with
the same frequency that funds today may do so. Therefore, as we indicated in the Proposing
Release, we are not revising rule 22e-3’s current approved annual aggregate collection of
information.
The rule’s current approved annual aggregate burden is approximately 30 minutes and is
based on estimates that: (1) on average, one money market fund will break the buck and
liquidate every six years; 2331 (2) there are an average of two conduit funds that may be invested in
a money market fund that breaks the buck; 2332 and (3) each money market fund and conduit fund
will spend approximately one hour of an in-house attorney’s time to prepare and submit the

2330

See id.; see also supra section III.A.4 (discussing amended rule 22e-3).

2331

This estimate is based upon the Commission’s experience with the frequency with which money market
funds have historically required sponsor support. Although many money market fund sponsors have
supported their money market funds in times of market distress, for purposes of this estimate the
Commission conservatively estimates that one or more sponsors may not provide support.

2332

These estimates are based on a staff review of filings with the Commission. Generally, rule 22e-3 permits
conduit funds to suspend redemptions in reliance on rule 22e-3 and requires that they notify the
Commission if they elect to do so.

757

notice required by the rule. 2333 As discussed in the Proposing Release, there will be no change in
the external cost burden associated with this collection of information. We did not receive any
comments on the estimated hour and cost burdens related to amended rule 22e-3.
C.

Rule 30b1-7 and Form N-MFP

Rule 30b1-7 under the Investment Company Act currently requires money market funds
to file electronically a monthly report on Form N-MFP within five business days after the end of
each month. The information required by the form must be data-tagged in XML format and filed
through EDGAR. The rule is designed to improve transparency of information about money
market funds’ portfolio holdings and facilitate Commission oversight of money market funds.
Preparing a report on Form N-MFP is a collection of information under the PRA. 2334 This
collection of information will be mandatory for money market funds that rely on rule 2a-7 and
the information will not be kept confidential.
1.

Discussion of Final Amendments

We are adopting a number of amendments to Form N-MFP which will include new and
amended collections of information. As discussed in more detail in section III.G. above, we
have revised the final amendments from our proposal in a number of ways in order to reduce
costs to the extent feasible and still achieve our goals of enhancing and improving the monitoring
2333

This estimate is based on the following calculations: (1 hour ÷ 6 years) = 10 minutes per year for each fund
and conduit fund that is required to provide notice under the rule; 10 minutes per year x 3 (combined
number of affected funds and conduit funds) = 30 minutes. The estimated cost associated with the
estimated burden hours ($189) is based on the following calculations: $378/hour (hourly rate for an inhouse attorney based on the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Management &
Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2011, modified to account for an 1,800-hour work year and
multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits and overhead.) x 30 minutes =
$189.

2334

For purposes of the PRA analysis, the current burden associated with the requirements of rule 30b1-7 is
included in the collection of information requirements of Form N-MFP.

758

of money market fund risks. While the final form amendments differ in some respects from
what we proposed, we are adopting many of the other proposed amendments unchanged. 2335
These amendments include:
Amendments Related to Rule 2a-7 Reforms. As discussed in more detail in section III.G.
above, we proposed a number of changes to Form N-MFP designed to conform it with the
general reforms of rule 2a-7. We are adopting them largely as proposed, with some revisions to
reflect the revised approach we are taking to the primary reforms. 2336
New Reporting Requirements. We are also adopting several new items to Form N-MFP
that we believe will improve the Commission’s (and investors’) ability to monitor money market
funds. As discussed in more detail in section III.G. above, these final amendments include some,
but not all, of the new reporting requirements that we had proposed. For example, as proposed,
the final amendments include additional reporting on fair value categorization and LEI
information (if available). 2337 We are also adopting, with some changes from the proposal,
revisions to several other items, including revised investment categories for portfolio securities
and repurchase agreement collateral. However, we are not adopting the lot level portfolio
security disclosure, top 20 shareholder information, and security identifier level reporting on
repo collateral that we had proposed.

2335

We provide a more detailed discussion of our final amendments and commenters’ comments in section
III.G above.

Clarifying and Other Amendments. We are adopting, as proposed, several amendments
to clarify current instructions and items of Form N-MFP. 2338 We are also making certain other,
non-substantive, structural changes to Form N-MFP. 2339
2.

Current Burden

The current approved collection of information for Form N-MFP is 45,214 annual
aggregate hours and $4,424,480 in external costs.
3.

Change in Burden

The Commission estimates that 559 money market funds are required to file reports on
Form N-MFP on a monthly basis. 2340 No commenters provided specific data or estimates
regarding the cost estimates we provided in the Proposing Release for the amendments to Form
N-MFP, although some suggested that the costs of some aspects of our proposed amendments to
Form N-MFP could be significant. 2341 For example, some commenters expressed concern that
the proposed lot level portfolio security disclosure would significantly increase the costs and
burdens of preparing Form N-MFP. 2342 After consideration of these comments, we believe that
our original cost estimates may have understated the costs if we had implemented the
amendments as proposed. As noted above, we have revised the final amendments from our

2338

See supra section III.G for a more detailed discussion of these clarifications.

2339

As proposed, the amendments will renumber the items of Form N-MFP to separate the items into four
separate sections to allow the Commission to reference, add, or delete items in the future without having to
re-number all subsequent items in the form. See supra section III.G for a more detailed discussion of this
restructuring.

2340

This estimate is based on a review of reports on Form N-MFP filed with the Commission for the month
ended February 28, 2014.

proposal in a number of ways in order to reduce costs to the extent feasible and still achieve our
goals of enhancing and improving the monitoring of money market fund risks. In light of these
changes, and taking into account other commenters’ estimates, 2343 we believe our original cost
estimates continue to be reasonable. Accordingly, the Commission has not modified the
estimated annual burden hours associated with the final amendments from those we estimated at
the proposal. However, the Commission has modified its estimates based on updated industry
data on time costs as well as the updated total number of money market funds that will be
affected. 2344
The Commission understands that approximately 35% of the 559 2345 (for a total of 196 2346)
money market funds that report information on Form N-MFP license a software solution from a
third party that is used to assist the funds to prepare and file the required information. The

2343

See, e.g., State Street Comment Letter, (estimating that “the additional disclosures that will be required will
at a minimum double the cost of preparing and filing the Form N-MFP. If purchases and sales information
is also required, it may increase even more.”); Dreyfus Comment Letter (estimating that it “incurred several
hundreds of thousands of dollars in technology-related costs to build systems required to populate the Form
N-MFP for (at the time) 51 MMFs,” and that the reprogramming for each round of changes to Form NMFP “will require several months of time at tens of thousands of dollars in cost for each.”). As discussed
in more detail below, given that we are not adopting certain costlier disclosures such as lot level reporting,
the Commission estimates that the current approved collection of information for Form N-MFP of 45,214
aggregate annual hours will almost double to 83,412 aggregate annual hours, while external costs will rise
from $4,424,480 to $4,780,736. See supra section IV.C.2 and infra note 2363 and accompanying
discussion.

2344

The updated industry data on time costs reflects salary information from SIFMA’s Management &
Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013, supra note 2214.

2345

We are estimating that 559 money market funds will be affected by our final amendments to Form N-MFP.
This estimate is based on a review of reports on Form N-MFP filed with the Commission for the month
ended February 28, 2014. In the Proposing Release we estimated 586 funds would be affected by our
proposed amendments. See Proposing Release supra note 25 at n.688.

2346

The Commission estimated this 35% in the current burden. This estimate is based on the following
calculation: 559 funds x 35% = 196 funds.

761

Commission also understands that approximately 65% of the 559 2347 (for a total of 363) money
market funds that report information on Form N-MFP retain the services of a third party to
provide data aggregation and validation services as part of the preparation and filing of reports
on Form N-MFP on behalf of the fund. The Commission estimates that, in the first year, each
fund (regardless of whether the fund licenses the software or uses a third-party service provider,
given our assumption that these two options are cost-competitive with one another) will incur an
additional average annual burden of 85 hours, at a time cost of $22,069 per fund, 2348 to prepare
and file the report on Form N-MFP (as amended) and an average of approximately 60 additional
burden hours (five hours per fund, per filing), at a time cost of $15,569 per fund 2349 each year
thereafter. 2350
2347

The Commission estimated this 65% in the current burden. This estimate is based on the following
calculation: 559 funds x 65% = 363 funds.

2348

This estimate is based on the following calculations: [30 hours for the initial monthly filing at a total cost
of $7,824 per fund (8 hours x $232 blended average hourly rate for a financial reporting manager ($266 per
hour) and fund senior accountant ($198 per hour) = $1,856 per fund) + (4 hours x $157 per hour for an
intermediate accountant = $628 per fund) + (6 hours x $312 per hour for a senior database administrator =
$1872 per fund) + (4 hours x $301 for a senior portfolio manager = $1204 per fund) + (8 hours x $283 per
hour for a compliance manager = $2,264 per fund)] + [55 hours (5 hours per fund x 11 monthly filings) at a
total cost of $14,245 per fund ($259 average cost per fund per burden hour x 55 hours)]. The additional
average annual burden per fund for the first year is 85 hours (30 hours (initial monthly filing) + 55 hours
(remaining 11 monthly filings)) and the additional average cost burden per fund for the first year is $22,069
($7,824 (initial monthly filing) + $14,245 (remaining 11 monthly filings = $22,069).

2349

This estimate is based on the following calculations: (16 hours x $232 blended average hourly rate for a
financial reporting manager ($266 per hour) and fund senior accountant ($198 per hour) = $3,712 per fund)
+ (9 hours x $157 per hour for an intermediate accountant = $1,413 per fund) + (13 hours x $312 per hour
for a senior database administrator = $4,056 per fund) + (9 hours x $301 for a senior portfolio manager =
$2,709 per fund) + (13 hours x $283 per hour for a compliance manager = $3,679 per fund) = 60 hours (16
+ 9 + 13 + 9 + 13) at a total cost of $15,569 per fund ($3,712 + $1,413 + $4,056 + $2,709 + $3,679).
Therefore, the additional average cost per fund per burden hour is approximately $259 ($15,569 ÷ 60
burden hours).

2350

In the Proposing Release, we estimated each fund would incur an additional average annual burden of 85
hours (30 hours for the initial monthly filing and 55 hours for the remaining monthly filings (5 hours per
fund, per filing x 11 months)), at a time cost of $22,045 per fund, to prepare and file the report on Form NMFP (as proposed) and an average of approximately 60 additional burden hours (five hours per fund, per
filing), at a time cost of $15,562 per fund each year thereafter. See Proposing Release, supra note 25, at

762

In the Proposing Release, we also discussed that software service providers (whether
provided by a licensor or third-party service provider) would be likely to incur additional
external costs to modify their software and might pass those costs down to money market funds
in the form of higher annual licensing fees. 2351 In the Proposing Release, although we did not
have the information necessary to provide a point estimate of the external costs or the extent to
which the software service providers would pass down any external costs to funds, we were able
to estimate a range of costs, from 5% to 10% of current annual licensing fees. 2352 We received no
specific comments on this estimate. While we are making certain changes to the final
amendments as described above that may reduce costs, we do not believe that these changes
would significantly alter our estimated range of additional external licensing costs. 2353
Accordingly, as proposed, the Commission estimates that 35% of funds (196 funds) will pay
$336 in additional external licensing costs each year and 65% of funds (363 funds) will pay $800
in additional external licensing costs each year because of our final amendments to Form
N-MFP. 2354
The Commission therefore estimates that our final amendments to Form N-MFP will

2353

Similar to our previous estimates of time costs, we believe our original estimates of external costs continue
to be reasonable in light of certain changes in the final amendments and consideration of commenters’
comments. See supra note 2343 and accompanying discussion.

2354

As proposed, the Commission estimates that the annual licensing fee for 35% of money market funds is
$3,360: a 5% to 10% increase = $168 - $336 in increased costs; the Commission estimates that the annual
licensing fee for 65% of money market funds is $8,000: a 5% to 10% increase = $400 - $800 in increased
costs. See also, Proposing Release, supra note 25, at n.1094 and accompanying text.

result in a first-year aggregate additional 47,515 burden hours 2355 at a total time cost of
$12,336,571 2356 plus $356,256 in total external costs 2357 for all funds, and 33,540 burden hours 2358
at a total time cost of $8,703,071 2359 plus $356,256 in total external costs 2360 for all funds each
year hereafter. Amortizing these additional hourly burdens over three years results in an average
annual aggregate burden of approximately 38,198 hours at a total time cost of $9,914,238, and
$356,256 in total external costs for all funds. 2361 Finally, the Commission estimates that our final
amendments to Form N-MFP will result in a total aggregate annual collection of information
burden of 83,412 hours 2362 and $4,780,736 in external costs. 2363

Discussion of New Reporting Requirements

Today we are adopting a new requirement that money market funds file a current report

2355

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 559 funds x 85 hours = 47,515 burden hours in year
one.

2356

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 559 funds x $22,069 annual cost per fund in the initial
year = $12,336,571.

2357

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (196 funds x $336 additional external costs = $65,856)
+ (363 funds x $800 additional external costs = $290,400) = $356,256.

2358

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 559 funds x 60 hours per fund = 33,540 hours.

2359

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 559 funds x $15,569 annual cost per fund in
subsequent years = $8,703,071.

2360

See supra note 2357.

2361

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (47,515 hours in year 1 + 33,540 hours in year 2 +
33,540 hours in year 3) ÷ 3 = 38,198 average annual burden hours; ($12,336,571 in year 1 + $8,703,071 in
year 2 + $8,703,071 in year 3) ÷ 3 = $9,914,238 average annual burden costs; ($356,256 in year 1 +
$356,256 in year 2 + $356,256 in year 3) ÷ 3 = $356,256 average external costs.

2362

This estimate is based on the following calculation: current approved burden of 45,214 hours + 38,198 in
additional burden hours as a result of our amendments = 83,412 hours.

2363

This estimate is based on the following calculation: current approved burden of $4,424,480 in external
costs + $356,256 in additional external costs as a result of our amendments = $4,780,736.

with us when certain significant events occur. 2364 Generally, a money market fund will be
required to file Form N-CR if a portfolio security defaults, an affiliate provides financial support
to the fund, the fund experiences a significant decline in its shadow price, or when liquidity fees
or redemption gates are imposed and when they are lifted. 2365 In most cases, a money market
fund will be required to submit a brief summary filing on Form N-CR within one business day of
the occurrence of the event, and a follow up filing within four business days that includes a more
complete description and information. 2366 This requirement is a collection of information under
the PRA. The information provided on Form N-CR will enable the Commission to enhance its
oversight of money market funds and its ability to respond to market events. The Commission
will be able to use the information provided on Form N-CR in its regulatory, disclosure review,
inspection, and policymaking roles. Requiring funds to report these events on Form N-CR will
provide important transparency to fund shareholders, and also will provide information more
uniformly and efficiently to the Commission. It will also provide investors and other market

2364

As we proposed, this requirement will be implemented through our adoption of new rule 30b1-8, which
requires funds to file a report on new Form N-CR in certain circumstances. See rule 30b1-8; Form N-CR.
For purposes of the PRA analysis, therefore, the burden associated with the requirements of rule 30b1-8 is
included in the collection of information requirements of Form N-CR.

2365

See Form N-CR Parts B-H. More specifically, these events include instances of portfolio security default
(Form N-CR Part B), financial support (Form N-CR Part C), a decline in a stable NAV fund’s current NAV
per share (Form N-CR Part D), a decline in weekly liquid assets below 10% of total fund assets (Form NCR Part E), whether a fund has imposed or removed a liquidity fee or gate (Form N-CR Parts E, F and G),
or any such other event(s) a Fund, in its discretion, may wish to disclose (Form N-CR Part H). In addition,
Form N-CR Part A will also require a fund to report the following general information: (i) the date of the
report; (ii) the registrant’s central index key (“CIK”) number; (iii) the EDGAR series identifier; (iv) the
Securities Act file number; and (v) the name, email address, and telephone number of the person authorized
to receive information and respond to questions about the filing. See Form N-CR Part A. While the
Commission estimates the burden of reporting the information in response to Part A to be minimal, they
were considered in the estimates of the burdens incurred generally in connection with the preparation,
formatting and filing of a report under any of the other Parts of Form N-CR.

2366

A report on Form N-CR will be made public on EDGAR immediately upon filing.

observers with better and timelier disclosure of potentially important events. This collection of
information will be mandatory for money market funds that rely on rule 2a-7 and the information
will not be kept confidential.

Estimated Burden
a.

Overview of Cost and Burden Changes

Our cost estimates below generally reflect the costs associated with an actual filing of
Form N-CR. 2367 The Proposing Release estimated that a fund would annually spend on average
approximately five burden hours and total time costs of $1,708 to prepare, review and submit a
report under any Part of Form N-CR. 2368 In the aggregate, the Proposing Release estimated that
compliance with new rule 30b1-8 and Form N-CR would result in a total annual burden of
approximately 341 burden hours and total annual time costs of approximately $116,429. 2369 The
Proposing Release estimated 586 money market funds would be required to comply with new
rule 30b1-8 and Form N-CR, 2370 which would have resulted in an average annual burden of
approximately 0.58 burden hours and average annual time costs of approximately $199 on a perfund basis. The Proposing Release further estimated that there would be no external costs
associated with this collection of information. 2371
As discussed in section III.F above, we are making various changes from the proposal to
our final amendments, a number of which we expect to impact the frequency of filings as well as
2367

We also recognize the possibility for some advance industry discussions and preparation in connection with
Form N-CR, as discussed in more detail in the text following supra note 1363.

the costs associated with filing a report on Form N-CR. 2372 For example, with respect to Parts B,
C and D, we are now permitting filers to split their response into an initial and follow-up
filing, 2373 similar to what we proposed for Parts E and F in the Proposing Release. We believe
this change will increase total filing costs by increasing the number of filings. In addition,
although only one commenter provided specific cost estimates, 2374 we also took into account
commenters’ general concerns and suggestions about the timing and burdens of Form N-CR. 2375
For example, commenters cited the particular burdens and the role of the board in drafting and
reviewing the board disclosures in Parts E and F. 2376 In light of commenters’ input, we therefore
revisited (and typically increased) our prior cost estimates. Recognizing the substantive
differences between each Part of Form N-CR, we are also breaking out our cost estimates for
each Part individually, rather than providing just one estimate with respect to any Part as in the
proposal. 2377 We further expect, in particular with respect to the follow-up reports under Parts B
through F as well as any reports on Part H, that certain funds may engage legal counsel to assist
with the drafting and review of Form N-CR, thereby incurring additional external costs. 2378
Accordingly, we have added an estimate for new Part H and, in the discussion below, we are also

funds to file a response to the Items discussed by the commenter within four business days instead of just
one business day, we expect that the costs of filing Form N-CR should be significantly reduced from this
commenter’s estimates. Id.

updating and providing a more nuanced estimate of the costs associated with filing a report with
respect to each of Parts B though G of Form N-CR.

Part B: Default Events

As proposed, 2379 we estimate that the Commission would receive, in the aggregate, an
average of 20 sets 2380 of initial and follow-up reports 2381 per year in response to Part B. Taking
into account a blend of legal and financial in-house professionals, 2382 we estimate that a fund
would on average spend a total of 13.5 burden hours 2383 and time costs of $4,830 2384 for one set of

2379

See Proposing Release supra note 25 at n.1107 and accompanying text.

2380

This estimate is based on the Commission’s current estimate of an average of 20 notifications of an event
of default or insolvency sent via email to the Director of IM pursuant to rule 2a-7(c)(7)(iii) each year. See
Submission for OMB Review, Comment Request, Extension: Rule 2a-7, OMB Control No. 3235-0268,
Securities and Exchange Commission 77 FR 236 (Dec. 7, 2012). We believe that this estimate is likely to
be high, in particular when markets are not in crisis as they were during 2008 or 2011. However, we are
continuing to use this higher estimate to be conservative in our analysis.

2381

A fund must file a report on Form N-CR responding to Items B.1 through B.4 on the first business day after
the initial date on which a default or event of insolvency contemplated in Item B occurs. A fund must
amend its initial report on Form N-CR to respond to Item B.5 by the fourth business day after the initial
date on which a default or event of insolvency contemplated in Item B occurs. See Form N-CR Item B
Instructions.

2382

Recognizing that, depending on the particular circumstances, different members of a fund’s financial team
may assist with the preparation of Form N-CR in varying degrees, we have estimated the time costs for a
financial professional to be $255 per hour, which is the blended average hourly rate for a senior portfolio
manager ($301), financial reporting manager ($266), and senior accountant ($198). For similar reasons, we
have estimated the time costs for a legal professional to be $440 per hour, which is the blended average
hourly rate for a deputy general counsel ($546) and compliance attorney ($334). In the Proposing Release,
we based our estimate of time costs on an in-house attorney and in-house accountant only. See Proposing
Release supra note 25 at n.1111 and accompanying text. As noted in this section, we are making these and
other changes to provide a more nuanced estimate of the costs associated with filing a report on Part B of
Form N-CR.

2383

When filing a report, the Commission estimates that a fund would spend on average approximately 3 hours
of legal professional time and 3 hours of financial professional time to prepare, review and submit an initial
filing. In addition, the Commission estimates that a fund would spend on average approximately 4.5 hours
of legal professional time and 3 hours of financial professional time to prepare, review and submit a followup amendment. The estimates of the average legal professional time above have already been reduced by
the corresponding average amount of time that we estimate will be shifted in the aggregate from in-house
counsel to outside counsel. See infra note 2386.

2384

This estimate is based on the following calculations: ((3 hours for the initial filing + 4.5 hours for the
follow-up filing) x $440 per hour for a legal professional = $3,300) + ((3 hours for the initial filing + 3

768

initial and follow-up reports in response to Part B. Because some funds may also engage outside
legal counsel, 2385 we estimate funds will also incur on average external costs of approximately
$1,000 for one set of reports. 2386 The Commission therefore estimates that the total annual
burden for Part B reporting would be 270 burden hours, time costs of $96,600, and external costs
of $20,000. 2387
c.

Part C: Financial Support

In a change from the proposal, we have made modifications to the definition of financial
support in Part C of Form N-CR, 2388 which we estimate will impact the frequency of filings on
Part C of Form N-CR. Accordingly, updating our estimate from the proposal, 2389 we estimate

hours for the follow-up filing) x $255 per hour for a financial professional = $1,530) = 13.5 burden hours
and time costs of $4,830.
2385

We estimate the cost for outside legal counsel to be $400 per hour. This is based on an estimated $400 per
hour cost for outside legal services, and is the same estimate used by the Commission for these services in
the “Exemptions for Advisers to Venture Capital Funds, Private Fund Advisers With Less Than $150
Million Under Management, and Foreign Private Advisers” final rule: SEC Release No. IA-3222 (June 22,
2011); [76 FR 39646 (July 6, 2011)].

2386

Commenters provided us with no specific comments that would allow us to estimate with any precision to
what extent funds may engage legal counsel to assist in the preparation of Form N-CR. However, for
purposes of this PRA, we estimate that in approximately half of all instances funds will engage legal
counsel to assist in the preparation of a set of initial and follow up filings responding to Part B of Form
N-CR. In such cases, we estimate that approximately half of the total legal professional time that in-house
counsel would have otherwise spent on responding to Part B of Form N-CR will be shifted to outside
counsel. Accordingly, a quarter of the total legal professional time that would otherwise have been spent
on responding to Part B of Form N-CR, or 2.5 hours, will be shifted from in-house counsel to outside
counsel (½ of all instances x ½ legal professional time = ¼ aggregate legal professional time).
Accordingly, we estimate that funds will incur additional external legal costs of $1,000 (2.5 hours x $400
per hour for outside counsel) per set of initial and follow-up reports in response to Part B.

2387

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 20 reports per year x 13.5 burden hours per report =
270 burden hours; 20 reports per year x $4,830 time cost per report = $96,600 in time costs; 20 reports per
year x $1,000 external cost per report = $20,000 in external costs.

2388

See supra section III.F.3 (Definition of Financial Support).

2389

See Proposing Release supra note 25 at n.1108 and accompanying text (estimating an average of 40 reports
per year filed in response to an event specified on Part C).

769

that the Commission will receive, in the aggregate, an average of 30 sets 2390 of initial and followup reports 2391 per year in response to Part C. Taking into account a blend of legal and financial
in-house professionals, 2392 we estimate that a fund will on average spend a total of 18.5 burden
hours 2393 and time costs of approximately $6,660 2394 for one set of initial and follow-up reports in
response to Part C. We also estimate funds will also incur on average external costs of

2390

This estimate is based on our current estimate of an average of 25 notifications of certain rule 17a-9
security purchases that money market funds currently send via email to the Director of IM pursuant to rule
2a-7(c)(7)(iii) each year. See Submission for OMB Review, Comment Request, Extension: Rule 2a-7, OMB
Control No. 3235-0268, Securities and Exchange Commission 77 FR 236 (Dec. 7, 2012). Because money
market funds will be required to file a report in response to Part C of Form N-CR if the fund receives any
form of financial support from the fund’s sponsor or other affiliated person (which support includes, but is
not limited to, a rule 17a-9 security purchase), the Commission estimates that the Commission will receive
a greater number of reports on Form N-CR Part C than the number of notifications of rule 17a-9 security
purchases that it currently receives. In the Proposing Release, we originally estimated 40 filings per year
under Part C of Form N-CR. See Proposing Release supra note 25 at n.735 and accompanying text. As
discussed in supra section III.F.3, today we are adopting certain exclusions from the definition of financial
support that will narrow the definition to a certain degree. Correspondingly, in anticipation of a moderate
reduction in instances that meet the definition as amended today, we predict an estimated 30 filings per
year under Part C of Form N-CR. We believe that this estimate is likely to be high, in particular when
markets are not in crisis as they were during 2008 or 2011. However, we are using this higher estimate to
be conservative in our analysis.

2391

A fund must file a report on Form N-CR responding to Items C.1 through C.7 on the first business day after
the initial date on which any financial support contemplated in Item C is provided to the fund. A fund must
amend its initial report on Form N-CR to respond to Items C.8 through C.10 by the fourth business day
after the initial date on which any financial support contemplated in Item C is provided to the fund. See
Form N-CR Item C Instructions.

2392

See supra note 2382.

2393

When filing a report, the Commission estimates that a fund will spend on average approximately 4.5 hours
of legal professional time and 4 hours of financial professional time to prepare, review and submit an initial
filing. In addition, the Commission estimates that a fund will spend on average approximately 6 hours of
legal professional time and 4 hours of financial professional time to prepare, review and submit a follow-up
amendment. The estimates of the average legal professional time above have already been reduced by the
corresponding average amount of time that we estimate will be shifted in the aggregate from in-house
counsel to outside counsel. See infra note 2395.

2394

This estimate is based on the following calculations: ((4.5 hours for the initial filing + 6 hours for the
follow-up filing) x $440 per hour for a legal professional = $4,620) + ((4 hours for the initial filing + 4
hours for the follow-up filing) x $255 per hour for a financial professional = $2,040) = 18.5 burden hours
and time costs of $6,660.

770

approximately $1,400 for one set of reports. 2395 The Commission therefore estimates that the
total annual burden for Part C reporting will be 555 burden hours, time costs of $199,800, and
external costs of $42,000. 2396
d.

Part D: Shadow Price Declines

In a change from the proposal, we estimate that the Commission will receive, in the
aggregate, an average of 0.3 sets 2397 of initial and follow-up reports 2398 per year in response to
Part D. Taking into account a blend of legal and financial in-house professionals, 2399 we estimate
that a fund will on average spend a total of 13.5 burden hours 2400 and time costs of approximately

2395

Using the same assumptions as with respect to Part B in supra note 2386, we estimate that approximately a
quarter of the total legal professional time that would otherwise have been spent on responding to Part C of
Form N-CR, or 3.5 hours, will be shifted from in-house counsel to outside counsel. Accordingly, we
estimate that funds will incur additional external legal costs of $1,400 (3.5 hours x $400 per hour for
outside counsel) per set of initial and follow-up reports in response to Part C.

2396

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 30 reports per year x 18.5 burden hours per report =
555 burden hours; 30 reports per year x $6,660 time cost per report = $199,800 in time costs; 30 reports per
year x $1,400 external cost per report = $42,000 in external costs.

2397

Commission staff analyzed form N-MFP data from November 2010 to February 2014 and found that only
one non-institutional fund had a ¼ of 1 percent deviation from the stable $1.00 per share NAV. 1 fund in
over 39 months is equivalent to less than 1 (1 x 12 ÷ 39 = 0.31) funds per year. See also supra note 1394.
In the Proposing Release, we had estimated 0.167 reports filed per year in respect of Part D. See Proposing
Release, supra note 25, at n.1205. We revised this estimate to reflect more accurate accounting and
updated data.

2398

A retail or government money market fund must file a report on Form N-CR responding to Items D.1 and
D.2 on the first business day after the initial date on which the fund’s current NAV deviates downward
from its intended stable price per share by more than ¼ of 1 percent. A fund must amend its initial report
on Form N-CR to respond to Item D.3 by the fourth business day after the initial date on which the fund’s
current NAV deviates downward from its intended stable price per share by more than ¼ of 1 percent. See
Form N-CR Item D Instructions.

2399

See supra note 2382.

2400

When filing a report, the Commission estimates that a fund will spend on average approximately 3 hours of
legal professional time and 3 hours of financial professional time to prepare, review and submit an initial
filing. In addition, the Commission estimates that a fund will spend on average approximately 4.5 hours of
legal professional time and 3 hours of financial professional time to prepare, review and submit a follow-up
amendment. The estimates of the average legal professional time above have already been reduced by the
corresponding average amount of time that we estimate will be shifted in the aggregate from in-house
counsel to outside counsel. See infra note 2402.

771

$4,830 2401 for one set of initial and follow-up reports in response to Part D. We also estimate
funds will also incur on average external costs of approximately $1,000 for one set of reports. 2402
The Commission therefore estimates that the total annual burden for Part D reporting will be four
burden hours, time costs of $1,449, and external costs of $300. 2403
e.

Part E: Imposition of Liquidity Fees

In addition to other changes from the proposal, 2404 we have made modifications to the
weekly liquid asset thresholds permitting or triggering board consideration of a liquidity fee in
Part E of Form N-CR, 2405 We therefore have updated our estimates of the frequency of filings
under Part E. 2406 Moreover, in particular with respect to the board disclosures, we expect that
most if not all funds may engage outside legal counsel to assist with the drafting and review of
Form N-CR, thereby incurring additional external costs. 2407 Accordingly, we estimate that the

2401

This estimate is based on the following calculations: ((3 hours for the initial filing + 4.5 hours for the
follow-up filing) x $440 per hour for a legal professional = $3,300) + ((3 hours for the initial filing + 3
hours for the follow-up filing) x $255 per hour for a financial professional = $1,530) = 13.5 burden hours
and time costs of $4,830.

2402

Using the same assumptions as with respect to Part B in supra note 2386, we estimate that approximately a
quarter of the total legal professional time that would otherwise have been spent on responding to Part D of
Form N-CR, or 2 hours, will be shifted from in-house counsel to outside counsel. Accordingly, we
estimate that funds will incur additional external legal costs of $1,000 (2.5 hours x $400 per hour for
outside counsel) per set of initial and follow-up reports in response to Part D.

2403

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 0.3 reports per year x 13.5 burden hours per report = 4
burden hours; 0.3 reports per year x $4,830 time cost per report = $1,449 in time costs; 0.3 reports per year
x $1,000 external cost per report = $300 in external costs.

2404

See supra section III.F.5 for a discussion of all our final amendments to Part E. For example, we have
made modifications to the board disclosure requirements. See supra section III.F.5 (Board Disclosures). In
addition, as noted in supra note 2376, commenters cited the particular burdens and the role of the board in
drafting and reviewing the board disclosures in Parts E and F. Accordingly, taking into account these and
our other changes to Part E, we have increased our cost estimates for Part E.

2405

See supra section III.F.5 (Conforming Changes).

2406

See infra note 2408 and accompanying text.

2407

See supra note 1377 and accompanying discussion.

772

Commission will receive, in the aggregate, an average of 1.2 sets 2408 of initial and follow-up
reports 2409 per year in response to an event specified on Part E. Taking into account a blend of
legal and financial in-house professionals, 2410 as well as time spent by the board reviewing the
disclosure, 2411 we estimate that a fund will on average spend a total of 20 burden hours 2412 and
time costs of approximately $10,910 2413 for one set of initial and follow-up reports in response to
2408

For purposes of this estimate, the Commission estimates that 0.6 funds per year will file a report triggered
by the 10% weekly liquid asset threshold. See supra section III.F.5 (Operational Costs of Part E, F, and G:
Imposition and Lifting of Fees and Gates). In the Proposing Release, we had previously estimated a total
of 4 reports in response to Parts E and F based on the previously proposed higher 15% weekly liquid asset
trigger. See Proposing Release supra note 25 at n.1202. In addition, the DERA Study analyzed the
distribution of weekly liquid assets and found that 83 prime funds per year had their weekly liquid asset
percentages fall below 30%. See supra section III.F.5 (Operational Costs of Part E, F, and G: Imposition
and Lifting of Fees and Gates). We are unable to estimate with any specificity how many of these 83 prime
funds would have decided to impose a discretionary liquidity fee upon breaching the 30% weekly liquid
asset threshold. However, we generally expect relatively few funds will impose a discretionary liquidity
fee given its voluntary nature and potential costs on redeeming shareholders. For purposes of this PRA, we
estimate that funds will voluntarily impose a liquidity fee at most as often as they will be required to
consider a liquidity fee based on the 10% weekly liquid asset trigger. Accordingly, the Commission
conservatively estimates that 0.6 additional funds per year will file a report in response to Part E because it
breached the 30% weekly liquid asset threshold and their board determined to impose such a discretionary
liquidity fee. Together with the filings triggered by the 10% weekly liquid asset threshold, this will result
in a total of 1.2 sets of filings in response to Part E per year. Although we believe this estimate is likely to
be high, we are using this estimate to be conservative in our analysis. See supra section III.F.5
(Operational Costs of Part E, F, and G: Imposition and Lifting of Fees and Gates).

2409

A fund must file a report on Form N-CR responding to Items E.1 through E.4 on the first business day after
the initial date on which the reporting requirement under Part E was triggered. A fund must amend its
initial report on Form N-CR to respond to Items E.5 and E.6 by the fourth business day after the initial date
on which the reporting requirement under Part E was triggered. See Form N-CR Item E Instructions.

2410

See supra note 2382.

2411

For purposes of this PRA, we estimate time costs of $4,400 per hour for a board of 8 directors. See supra
note 2214.

2412

When filing a report, the Commission estimates that a fund would spend on average approximately 3 hours
of legal professional time and 4 hours of financial professional time to prepare, review and submit an initial
filing. In addition, the Commission estimates that a fund would spend on average approximately 6 hours of
legal professional time and 6 hours of financial professional time to prepare, review and submit a follow-up
amendment. The Commission also estimates that a fund would spend 1 hour for a board of directors to
review the reports. The estimates of the average legal professional time above have already been reduced
by the corresponding average amount of time that we estimate will be shifted in the aggregate from inhouse counsel to outside counsel. See infra note 2415.

2413

This estimate is based on the following calculations: ((3 hours for the initial filing + 6 hours for the followup filing) x $440 per hour for a legal professional = $3,960) + ((4 hours for the initial filing + 6 hours for

773

Part E. Because we expect that most, if not all, funds may also engage outside legal counsel to
assist with the drafting and review of Part E, 2414 we also estimate funds will also incur on average
external costs of approximately $3,600 per set of reports. 2415 The Commission therefore
estimates that the total annual burden for Part E reporting will be 24 burden hours, time costs of
$13,092, and external costs of $4,320. 2416
f.

Part F: Suspension of Fund Redemptions

In addition to other changes from the proposal, 2417 we have increased the weekly liquid
asset threshold permitting boards to impose a discretionary gate. 2418 We therefore have updated
our estimates of the frequency of filings under Part F. 2419 In particular with respect to the board
disclosures, we expect that most if not all funds may engage legal counsel to assist with the

the follow-up filing) x $255 per hour for a financial professional = $2,550) + (1 hour x $4,400 per hour for
a board of 8 directors = $4,400) = 20 burden hours and time costs of $10,910.
2414

Because, for the reason discussed in supra note 1301 and accompanying text, the potential imposition of a
liquidity fee is one of the most significant events that can occur to money market funds, to be conservative
we estimate that all funds would seek outside counsel for purposes of this estimate.

2415

On average, we estimate that approximately half of the total legal professional time that in-house counsel
would have otherwise spent on reviewing and responding to Part E of Form N-CR will be shifted to outside
counsel. Accordingly, for purposes of this PRA, we estimate that a total of 9 hours will be shifted from inhouse counsel to outside counsel. Accordingly, we estimate that funds would incur external legal costs of
$3,600 (9 hours x $400 per hour for outside counsel) per set of initial and follow-up reports in response to
Part E.

2416

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 1.2 reports per year x 20 burden hours per report = 24
burden hours; 1.2 reports per year x $10,910 time cost per report = $13,092 in time costs; 1.2 reports per
year x $3,600 external cost per report = $4,320 in external costs.

2417

See supra section III.F.5 for a discussion of all our final amendments to Part F. For example, we have
made modifications to the board disclosure requirements. See supra section III.F.5 (Board Disclosures). In
addition, as noted in supra note 2376, commenters cited the particular burdens and the role of the board in
drafting and reviewing the board disclosures in Parts E and F. Accordingly, taking into account these and
our other changes to Part F, we have increased our cost estimates for Part F.

drafting and review of Form N-CR, thereby incurring additional external costs. 2420 Accordingly,
we estimate that the Commission will receive, in the aggregate, an average of 0.6 sets 2421 of
initial and follow-up reports 2422 per year in response to an event specified on Part F. Taking into
account a blend of legal and financial in-house professionals, 2423 as well as time spent by the
board reviewing the disclosure, we estimate that a fund will on average spend a total of 20
burden hours 2424 and time costs of approximately $10,910 2425 for one set of initial and follow-up
2420

See supra note 1376 and accompanying discussion.

2421

In the Proposing Release, we had previously estimated a total of 4 reports in response to Parts E and F
based on the previously proposed 15% weekly liquid asset trigger. See Proposing Release supra note 25 at
n.1202. However, we are revising this estimate in light of the amended higher 30% weekly liquid asset
threshold for discretionary gates. In particular, the DERA Study found that 83 prime funds per year had
their weekly liquid asset percentages fall below 30%. See supra section III.F.8 (Operational Costs of Part
E, F, and G: Imposition and Lifting of Fees and Gates). Similar to discretionary liquidity fees, we are
unable to estimate with any specificity how many of these 83 prime funds would have decided to impose a
discretionary gate upon breaching the 30% weekly liquid asset threshold. Cf. supra note 2408. However,
we conservatively estimate the number of instances in which a fund breached the 30% weekly liquid asset
threshold and its board determined to impose a voluntary gate to be equal to the number of instances in
which a fund breached the 30% weekly liquid asset threshold and its board determined to impose a
voluntary fee. This results in an estimate of approximately 0.6 sets of initial and follow-up reports filed per
year in response to Part F. Although we believe this estimate is likely to be high, we are using this estimate
to be conservative in our analysis. See supra section III.F.8 (Operational Costs of Part E, F, and G:
Imposition and Lifting of Fees and Gates).

2422

A fund must file a report on Form N-CR responding to Items F.1 and F.2 on the first business day after the
initial date on which a fund suspends redemptions. A fund must amend its initial report on Form N-CR to
respond to Items F.3 and F.4 by the fourth business day after the initial date on which a fund suspends
redemptions. See Form N-CR Item F Instructions.

2423

See supra note 2382.

2424

When filing a report, the Commission estimates that a fund would spend on average approximately 3 hours
of legal professional time and 4 hours of financial professional time to prepare, review and submit an initial
filing. In addition, the Commission estimates that a fund would spend on average approximately 6 hours of
legal professional time and 6 hours of financial professional time to prepare, review and submit a follow-up
amendment. The Commission also estimates that a fund would spend 1 hour for a board of directors to
review the reports. The estimates of the average legal professional time above have already been reduced
by the corresponding average amount of time that we estimate will be shifted in the aggregate from inhouse counsel to outside counsel. See infra note 2427.

2425

This estimate is based on the following calculations: ((3 hours for the initial filing + 6 hours for the followup filing) x $440 per hour for a legal professional = $3,960) + ((4 hours for the initial filing + 6 hours for
the follow-up filing) x $255 per hour for a financial professional = $2,550) + (1 hour x $4,400 per hour for
a board of 8 directors = $4,400) = 20 burden hours and time costs of $10,910.

775

reports in response to Part F. Because we expect most if not all funds may also engage legal
counsel to assist with the drafting and review of Form N-CR, 2426 we estimate funds also further
incur on average external costs of approximately $3,600 for each set of reports. 2427 The
Commission therefore estimates that the total annual burden for Part F reporting will be 12
burden hours, time costs of $6,546, and external costs of $2,160. 2428
g.

Part G: Removal of Liquidity Fees and/or Resumption of Fund
Redemptions

As discussed in the Proposing Release, we continue to believe the frequency of filings
under Part G on Form N-CR to be closely correlated to the frequency of filings under Parts E and
F. 2429 Given our revised estimates of the number of filings under Parts E and F, 2430 we are
correspondingly updating our estimate of the number of filings under Part G. We are further
updating our estimates for Part G, because the Commission expects the cost per filing associated

2426

Because, for the reason discussed in supra note 1301 and accompanying text, the potential imposition of a
gate is one of the most significant events that can occur to money market funds, to be conservative we
estimate that all funds would seek outside counsel for purposes of this estimate.

2427

On average, we estimate that approximately half of the total legal professional time that in-house counsel
would have otherwise spent on reviewing and responding to Part F of Form N-CR will be shifted to outside
counsel. Accordingly, for purposes of this PRA, we estimate that a total of 8 hours will be shifted from inhouse counsel to outside counsel. Accordingly, we estimate that funds will incur external legal costs of
$3,600 (9 hours x $400 per hour for outside counsel) per set of initial and follow-up reports in response to
Part F.

2428

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 0.6 reports per year x 20 burden hours per report = 12
burden hours; 0.6 reports per year x $10,910 time cost per report = $6,546 in time costs; 0.6 reports per
year x $3,600 external cost per report = $2,160 in external costs.

2429

See, e.g., Proposing Release supra note 25 at n.1202 and accompanying discussion. We expect there to be
a close correlation because Part G requires disclosure of the lifting of any liquidity fee or gate imposed in
connection with Part E or F.

See supra notes 2408 and 2421.

with responding to Part G to be lower than for Parts E or F. 2431 Unlike Parts B through F and H,
for which we have included estimated external costs to account for the possibility that funds may
engage legal counsel to assist in the preparation and review of Form N-CR, 2432 we have not done
so here because of the relative simplicity of Part G. Accordingly, we estimate that the
Commission will receive, in the aggregate, an average of 1.8 reports 2433 per year in response to
Part G. Taking into account a blend of legal and financial in-house professionals, 2434 we estimate
that a fund will on average spend a total of two burden hours 2435 and time costs of approximately
$695 2436 for a filing in response to Part G. The Commission therefore estimates that the total
annual burden for Part G reporting will be 3.6 burden hours, and time costs of $1,251. 2437

2431

The Proposing Release estimated that a fund would spend on average approximately 5 burden hours and
total time costs of $1,708 to prepare, review, and submit a report under any Part of Form N-CR. See
Proposing Release supra note 25 at n.1203 and accompanying text. However, we expect a response to Part
G to be shorter than under Parts E or F, given that Part G only requires disclosure of the date on which a
fund removed a liquidity fee and/or resumed Fund redemptions. See Form N-CR Item G.1. In addition,
unlike Part E or F, Part G would not require any follow-up report.

2432

See supra IV.D.2.g for our discussion of the external costs of Parts B through F; see also infra this section
for our discussion of the external costs of Part H.

2433

As discussed in section III.F, we expect the frequency of Part G filings will be closely correlated to any
filings under Part E of F, given that Part G will disclose the lifting of any liquidity fee or gate imposed in
connection with Part E or F. See supra section III.F.8 (Operational Costs of Part E, F, and G: Imposition
and Lifting of Fees and Gates). In particular, for purposes of this estimate the Commission estimates that
1.8 funds per year will file a report in response to Part G, based on the assumption that each time a fund
files a report under Parts E or F it will also eventually file a report under Part G. We believe this to be a
high estimate given that, among other things, at least some funds that impose a liquidity fee or gate will
likely to go out of business (and thus would never reopen), although we are unable to predict with certainty
how many would do so.

2434

See supra note 2382.

2435

When filing a report, the Commission estimates that a fund will spend on average approximately 1 hour of
legal professional time and 1 hour of financial professional time to prepare, review, and submit a filing in
response to Part G.

2436

This estimate is based on the following calculations: (1 hour x $440 per hour for a legal professional =
$440) + (1 hour x $255 per hour for a financial professional = $255) = 2 burden hours and time costs of
$695.

2437

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 1.8 reports per year x 2 burden hours per report = 3.6

777

h.

Part H: Other Events

Given the broad scope and voluntary nature of the optional disclosure under Part H of
Form N-CR, which is new from the proposal, we believe that, in an event of filing, a fund’s
particular circumstances that led it to decide to make such a voluntary disclosure will be the
predominant factor in determining the time and costs associated with filing a report on Part H.
To be conservative, we also expect that some funds may engage outside legal counsel to assist
with the drafting and review of Part H, thereby incurring additional external costs. 2438 We
estimate that the Commission will receive, in the aggregate, approximately 15 reports 2439 per year
in response to Part H of Form N-CR. Taking into account a blend of legal and financial in-house
professionals, 2440 we estimate that a fund will on average spend a total of four burden hours 2441

burden hours; 1.8 reports per year x $695 time cost per report = $1,251 in time costs.
2438

See supra note 2386 and accompanying discussion.

2439

For purposes of this estimate, the Commission conservatively estimates that funds will include a disclosure
under Part H in about a quarter of the instances they submit a follow-up filing under Parts B through F, as
well as with respect to a quarter of all filings under Part G. Because of the timing constraints, we generally
would not expect that funds will make a Part H disclosure in an initial filing. However, given the
possibility that funds might make a Part H disclosure in the initial filing or on a stand-alone basis, we
conservatively estimate one additional Part H filing per year under each scenario. We therefore estimate an
annual total of approximately 15 filings in response to Part H based on the following calculation: (20 sets
of Part B filings per year) + (30 sets of Part C filings per year) + (0.3 sets of Part D filings per year) + (1.2
sets of Part E filings per year) + (0.6 sets of Part F filings per year) + (1.8 Part G filings per year) =
approximately 54 Parts B-G filings per year. (54 Parts B-G filings per year ÷ 4) + (2 additional Part H
filings per year in an initial filing or on a stand-alone basis) = approximately 15 Part H filings per year.

2440

See supra note 2382.

2441

This estimate is derived in part from our current PRA estimate for Form 8-K under the Exchange Act. See
“Form 8-K, Current Report Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934” (OMB
Control No. 3235-0060), available at http://www.reginfo.gov. In particular, we estimate that Form 8-K
takes approximately 5 hours per response if rounded up to the next whole hour. As an initial step, we
conservatively added an additional hour, for a total of 6 hours. Of this total, we estimate that an average of
2 hours will be shifted to outside legal counsel (corresponding to the 2 hours of legal professional time
discussed immediately below). Accordingly, when filing a report, the Commission estimates that a fund
would spend on average approximately 2 hours of legal professional time and 2 hours of financial
professional time to prepare, review and submit a response to Part H.

778

and time costs of approximately $1,390 2442 for one set of initial and follow-up reports in response
to Part H. We also estimate funds will also incur on average external legal costs of
approximately $800 per report. 2443 The Commission therefore estimates that the total annual
burden for Part H reporting will be 60 burden hours, time costs of $20,850, and external costs of
$12,000. 2444
i.

Aggregate Burden of Form N-CR

In the aggregate, we estimate that compliance with Form N-CR will result in a total
annual burden of approximately 929 burden hours, 2445 total annual time costs of approximately
$339,588, 2446 and total external costs of $80,780. 2447 Given an estimated 559 money market funds
that will be required to comply with Form N-CR, 2448 this will result in an average annual burden

2442

This estimate is based on the following calculations: (2 hours x $440 per hour for a legal professional =
$880) + (2 hours x $255 per hour for a financial professional = $510) = 4 burden hours and time costs of
$1,390.

2443

In particular, we expect that funds are more likely to file a report on Part H when there are more complex
events that need to be addressed, which correspondingly we believe will make it significantly more likely
that funds will engage legal counsel. To be conservative, we estimate that funds would engage outside
legal counsel in all cases they file a response to Part H. Accordingly, we estimate that funds would incur
additional external legal costs of $800 (2 hours x $400 per hour for outside counsel) per set of initial and
follow-up reports in response to Part H (with the estimated 2 hours of outside counsel time corresponding
to the 2 hours of legal professional time we estimate in supra note 2441).

2444

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 15 reports per year x 4 burden hours per report = 60
burden hours; 15 reports per year x $1,390 time cost per report = $20,850 in time costs; 15 reports per year
x $800 external cost per report = $12,000 in external costs.

2445

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 270 hours (Part B) + 555 hours (Part C) + 4 hours
(Part D) + 24 hours (Part E) + 12 hours (Part F) + 3.6 hours (Part G) + 60 hours (Part H) = 929 aggregate
burden hours.

2446

This estimate is based on the following calculation: $96,600 (Part B) + $199,800 (Part C) + $1,449 (Part
D) + $13,092 (Part E) + $6,546 (Part F) + $1,251 (Part G) + $20,850 (Part H) = $339,588 aggregate time
costs.

2447

This estimate is based on the following calculation: $20,000 (Part B) + $42,000 (Part C) + $300 (Part D) +
$4,320 (Part E) + $2,160 (Part F) + $12,000 (Part H) = $80,780 total external costs.

2448

of approximately 1.7 burden hours, average annual time costs of approximately $607 on a perfund basis, and average annual external costs of $145. 2449
E.

Rule 34b-1(a)

Rule 34b-1 under the Investment Company Act is an antifraud provision governing sales
material that accompanies or follows the delivery of a statutory prospectus. Among other things,
rule 34b-1 deems to be materially misleading any advertising material by a money market fund
required to be filed with the Commission by section 24(b) of the Act that includes performance
data, unless such advertising also includes the rule 482(b)(4) risk disclosures already discussed in
section IV.F below. In the Proposing Release, the Commission noted that the proposal to amend
the wording of the rule 482(b)(4) risk disclosures would indirectly affect rule 34b-1(a), although
the Commission proposed no changes to rule 34b-1(a) itself. We also noted that our discussion
of the amendments to rule 482(b)(4) accounted for the burdens associated with the wording
changes to the risk disclosures in money market fund advertising, and by complying with our
amendments to rule 482(b)(4), money market funds would also automatically remain in
compliance with rule 34b-1(a) as affected by these amendments. Therefore, any burdens
associated with rule 34b-1(a) as a result of our proposed amendments to rule 482(b)(4) were
already accounted for in the Proposing Release’s Paperwork Reduction Act analysis of rule 482.
No commenters addressed rule 34b-1, and we continue to believe that any burdens associated
with rule 34b-1(a) as a result of the amendments we are adopting to rule 482(b)(4) are accounted
for in section IV.F below.
2449

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 929 burden hours ÷ 559 funds = 1.7 annual burden
hours per fund; $339,588 ÷ 559 funds = $607 annual time costs per fund; $80,780 ÷ 559 funds = $145
annual external costs per fund.

780

F.

Rule 482

We are adopting amendments affecting current requirements under rule 482 of the
Securities Act relating to the information that is required to be included in money market funds’
advertisements or other sales materials. Specifically, the amendments revise the particular
wording of the current rule 482(b)(4) risk disclosures required to appear in advertisements for
money market funds (including on the fund website). The fees and gates amendments, as well as
the floating NAV amendments, will change the investment expectations and experience of
money market fund investors. Accordingly, the amended wording of the rule 482(b)(4) risk
disclosures reflects the particular risks associated with the imposition of liquidity fees or gates
and/or a floating NAV. In the Proposing Release, using an estimate of 586 money market funds,
the Commission estimated that money market funds would incur, in aggregate, a total one-time
burden of 3,077 hours, at a time cost of $857,904, to comply with the amended requirements of
rule 482. This collection of information will be mandatory for money market funds that rely on
rule 2a-7, and the information will not be kept confidential.
Certain commenters generally noted that complying with all of the new disclosure
requirements, including the amended requirements of rule 482, would involve additional
costs. 2450 Several commenters provided dollar estimates of the initial costs to implement a fees
and gates or floating NAV framework and noted that these estimates would include the costs of
2450

See, e.g., Fin. Svcs. Roundtable Comment Letter (noting that the proposed disclosure requirements
generally would produce “significant cost to the fund and ultimately to the fund’s investors”); SSGA
Comment Letter (urging the Commission to consider the “substantial administrative, operational, and
expense burdens” of the proposed disclosure-related amendments); Chapin Davis Comment Letter (noting
that the disclosure- and reporting-related amendments will result in increased costs in the form of fund staff
salaries, or consultant, accountant, and lawyer hourly rates, that will ultimately be borne in large part by
investors and portfolio issuers).

781

related disclosure, but these commenters did not specifically break out the disclosure-related
costs in their estimates. 2451 One commenter stated that the costs to update website disclosures to
reflect the new floating NAV and fees and gates requirements would be “minimal when
compared to other costs,” 2452 and another commenter stated that the proposed disclosure
requirements should not produce any meaningful costs. 2453 As described above, we are adopting
amendments to rule 482 that have been modified from the proposed amendments to respond to
certain commenters’ concerns and other suggestions. The rule 482 disclosure requirements that
we are adopting therefore differ from the proposed rule 482 disclosure requirements in content
and format. 2454 We believe that these revisions to the proposed requirements do not produce
additional burdens for funds because the revisions only involve changes in the wording and
formatting of the required disclosure statement and do not impact the measures funds must take
to effect the disclosure requirements. Taking this into consideration, as well as the fact that we
received no comments providing specific suggestions or critiques about our methods for
estimating the burdens and costs associated with the rule 482 amendments, the Commission has
not modified its previous hour burden estimates. 2455

See supra section III.E.1.

2455

The compliance period for updating rule 482(b)(4) risk disclosures to reflect the floating NAV or liquidity
fees and gates amendments is 2 years. We understand that money market funds commonly update and
issue new advertising materials on a periodic and frequent basis. Accordingly, given the extended
compliance period proposed, we expect that funds should be able to amend the wording of their rule
482(b)(4) risk disclosures as part of one of their general updates of their advertising materials. Similarly,
we believe that funds could update the corresponding disclosure statement on their websites when
performing other periodic website maintenance. We therefore account only for the incremental change in
burden that amending the rule 482(b)(4) risk disclosures will cause in the context of a larger update to a

782

Based on an estimate of 559 money market funds that will be required to update the risk
disclosure included in fund advertisements pursuant to rule 482, as amended, we estimate that, in
the aggregate, the amendments will result in 2,935 total one-time burden hours, 2456 at a total onetime time cost of $818,376. 2457 Amortized over a three-year period, this will result in an average
additional annual burden of approximately 978 burden hours 2458 at a total annual time cost of
approximately $272,792 for all funds. 2459 Given that the amendments are one-time updates to the
wording of the risk disclosures already required under current rule 482(b)(4), we believe that,
once funds have made these one-time changes, the amendments to rule 482(b)(4) will only
require money market funds to incur the same costs and hour burdens on an ongoing basis as
under current rule 482(b)(4).
G.

Form N-1A

We are adopting amendments to Form N-1A relating to money market funds’ disclosure
of: (i) certain of the risks associated with liquidity fees and gates and/or a floating NAV; (ii)

fund’s advertising materials or website.
2456

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 5.25 hours per year (4 hours to update and review the
wording of the rule 482(b)(4) risk disclosure for each fund’s printed advertising and sales material, plus
1.25 hours to post and review the wording of the rule 482(b)(4) risk disclosures on a fund’s website) x 559
money market funds = approximately 2,935 hours.

2457

This estimate is based on the following calculation: $1,464 (total one-time costs per fund) x 559 funds =
$818,376. The $1,464 per fund figure is, in turn, based on the following calculations: (3 hours (spent by a
marketing manager to update the wording of the risk disclosures for each fund’s marketing materials) x
$254/hour for a marketing manager = $762) + (1 hour (spent by a webmaster to update a fund’s website
risk disclosures) x $227/hour for a webmaster = $227) + (1.25 hours (spent by an attorney to review the
amended rule 482(b)(4) risk disclosures) x $380/hour for an attorney = $475) = $1,464.

2458

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 2,935 hours ÷ 3 = approximately 978 hours. The
current approved collection of information for Rule 482 is 305,705 hours annually for all investment
companies. Adding 978 hours to this approved collection of information will result in a burden of 306,683
hours each year.

2459

This estimate is based on the following calculation: $818,376 ÷ 3 = $272,792.

783

historical occasions on which the fund has considered or imposed liquidity fees or gates; and (iii)
historical instances in which the fund has received financial support from a sponsor or fund
affiliate. Specifically, we are adopting amendments to Form N-1A that will require funds to
include certain risk disclosure statements in their prospectuses. We are also adopting
amendments to Form N-1A that will require money market funds (other than government money
market funds that have not chosen to retain the ability to impose liquidity fees and suspend
redemptions) to provide disclosure in their SAIs regarding any occasion during the last 10 years
in which: (i) the fund’s weekly liquid assets have fallen below 10%, and with respect to each
occasion, whether the fund’s board has determined to impose a liquidity fee and/or suspend
redemptions; and (ii) the fund’s weekly liquid assets have fallen below 30%, and the fund’s
board has determined to impose a liquidity fee and/or suspend redemptions. 2460 Finally, we are
also adopting amendments to Form N-1A that will require each money market fund to disclose in
its SAI historical instances in which the fund has received financial support from a sponsor or
fund affiliate. 2461
In addition, the fee and gate requirements we are adopting will entail certain additional
prospectus and SAI disclosure requirements that will not necessitate rule and form amendments.
Specifically, pursuant to current disclosure requirements, we will expect that money market
funds (besides government money market funds that have not chosen to retain the ability to
impose liquidity fees and suspend redemptions) will disclose in the statutory prospectus, as well
as in the SAI, as applicable, the effects that the potential imposition of fees and/or gates may

See supra section III.E.5.

2461

See supra section III.E.7.

784

have on a shareholder’s ability to redeem shares of the fund. 2462 We also expect that, promptly
after a money market fund imposes a redemption fee or gate, it will inform investors of any fees
or gates currently in place by means of a post-effective amendment or prospectus supplement. 2463
The floating NAV amendments we are adopting will also require certain additional
prospectus and SAI disclosures, which will not necessitate rule and form amendments. Pursuant
to current disclosure requirements, we expect that floating NAV money market funds will
include disclosure in their prospectuses about the tax consequences to shareholders of buying,
holding, exchanging, and selling the shares of the floating NAV fund. 2464 In addition, we expect
that a floating NAV money market fund will update its prospectus and SAI disclosure regarding
the purchase, redemption, and pricing of fund shares, to reflect any procedural changes resulting
from the fund’s use of a floating NAV. 2465 We also expect that, at the time a stable NAV money
market fund transitions to a floating NAV, it will update its registration statement to include
relevant related disclosure by means of a post-effective amendment or prospectus supplement. 2466
This collection of information will be mandatory for money market funds that rely on rule 2a-7,
and the information will not be kept confidential.
In the Proposing Release, the Commission estimated that the proposed amendments to
Form N-1A relating to the fees and gates proposal, the Form N-1A requirements relating to the
fees and gates proposal that would not necessitate form amendments, and the proposed sponsor

785

support disclosure requirements together would result in all money market funds incurring an
annual increased burden of 1,007 hours, at a time cost of $298,072. We also estimated that,
under the fees and gates alternative, there would be one-time aggregate external costs (in the
form of printing costs) of $6,269,175 associated with the new Form N-1A disclosure
requirements. The Commission estimated that the proposed amendments to Form N-1A relating
to the floating NAV proposal, the Form N-1A requirements relating to the floating NAV
proposal that would not necessitate form amendments, and the proposed sponsor support
disclosure requirements together would result in all money market funds incurring an annual
increased burden of 907 hours, at a time cost of $268,472. Additionally, we estimated that,
under the floating NAV alternative, there would be one-time aggregate external costs (in the
form of printing costs) of $3,134,588 associated with the new Form N-1A disclosure
requirements.
Certain commenters generally noted that complying with all of the new disclosure
requirements, including the Form N-1A disclosure requirements, would involve some additional
costs. 2467 Several commenters provided dollar estimates of the initial costs to implement a fees
and gates or floating NAV regime and noted that these estimates would include the costs of
related disclosure, but these commenters did not specifically break out the disclosure-related
costs in their estimates. 2468 One commenter stated that the costs to update a fund’s registration
statement to reflect the new fees and gates and floating NAV requirements would be “minimal

786

when compared to other costs,” 2469 and another commenter stated that the proposed disclosure
requirements should not produce any meaningful costs. 2470 As described above, we are adopting
amendments to the Form N-1A disclosure requirements that have been modified from the
proposed amendments to respond to commenters concerns. The amendments we are adopting to
the Form N-1A risk disclosure requirements therefore differ from the proposed requirements in
content and format. 2471 In addition, the amendments we are adopting to require funds to provide
disclosure in their SAIs about historical occasions on which the fund has considered or imposed
liquidity fees or gates, as well as historical occasions on which the fund has received financial
support from a sponsor or fund affiliate, have been modified in certain respects from the
proposed amendments. We believe that these revisions do not produce additional burdens for
funds 2472 and therefore do not affect the assumptions we used in estimating hour burdens and
related costs. The comments we received on the new disclosure requirements also do not affect
the assumptions we used in our estimates, as these comments provided no specific suggestions or
critiques regarding our methods for estimating hour and cost burdens associated with the Form
2469

See State Street Comment Letter, at Appendix A.

2470

2471

See supra section III.E.1.

2472

The revisions to the proposed Form N-1A risk disclosure requirements do not produce additional burdens
for funds because the revisions only involve changes in the wording and formatting of the required
disclosure statement and do not impact the measures funds must take to effect the disclosure requirements.
The revisions to the proposed SAI historical disclosure requirements do not produce additional burdens for
funds because the adopted amendments to Form N-1A require a fund to disclose less detailed information
than that which would have been required under the proposed amendments to Form N-1A. See supra text
following note 975 and text accompanying and following note 1019. Furthermore, because the SAI
historical disclosure overlaps with the information that a fund must disclose on Parts C, E, F, and G of
Form N-CR (see supra section III.E.8), we believe that the burden for a fund to draft and finalize this
historical disclosure will largely be incurred when the fund files Form N-CR, and thus the differences in the
Form N-1A historical disclosure requirements that we are adopting, compared to those that we proposed,
should not substantially affect our previous hour burden estimates.

787

N-1A requirements. As described below, however, our current estimates reflect the fact that the
amendments we are adopting today combine the floating NAV and fees and gates proposal
alternatives into one unified approach.
The burdens associated with the proposed amendments to Form N-1A include one-time
burdens as well as ongoing burdens. The Commission estimates that each money market fund
(except government funds that have not chosen to retain the ability to impose liquidity fees and
suspend redemptions, and floating NAV money market funds) will incur a one-time burden of
five hours, 2473 at a time cost of $1,595, 2474 to draft and finalize the required disclosure and amend
its registration statement. In addition, we estimate that each government fund that has not
chosen to retain the ability to impose liquidity fees and suspend redemptions will incur a
one-time burden of two hours, 2475 at a time cost of $638, 2476 to draft and finalize the required
2473

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 1 hour to update the registration statement to include
the required disclosure statement + 3 hours to update the registration statement to include the disclosure
about effects that fees/gates may have on shareholder redemptions, and the disclosure about historical
occasions on which the fund has considered or imposed liquidity fees or gates + 1 hour to update the
registration statement to include the disclosure about historical occasions of financial support received by
the fund = 5 hours.

2474

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (1 hour (to update registration statement to include
required disclosure statement) x $319 (blended hourly rate for a compliance attorney ($334) and a senior
programmer ($303)) = $319) + (3 hours (to update registration statement to include disclosure about effects
that fees/gates may have on shareholder redemptions, and disclosure about historical occasions on which
the fund has considered or imposed liquidity fees or gates) x $319 (blended hourly rate for a compliance
attorney ($334) and a senior programmer ($303)) = $957) + (1 hour (to update registration statement to
include disclosure about historical occasions of financial support received by the fund) x $319 (blended
hourly rate for a compliance attorney ($334) and a senior programmer ($303)) = $319) = $1,595.

2475

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 1 hour to update registration statement to include
required disclosure statement + 1 hour to update registration statement to include disclosure about financial
support received by the fund = 2 hours.

2476

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (1 hour (to update registration statement to include
required disclosure statement) x $319 (blended hourly rate for a compliance attorney ($334) and a senior
programmer ($303)) = $319) + (1 hour (to update registration statement to include disclosure about
financial support received by the fund) x $319 (blended hourly rate for a compliance attorney ($334) and a
senior programmer ($303)) = $319) = $638.

788

disclosure and amend its registration statement. We also estimate that each floating NAV money
market fund will incur a one-time burden of eight hours, 2477 at a time cost of $2,552, 2478 to draft
and finalize the required disclosure and amend its registration statement. In aggregate, the
Commission estimates that all money market funds will incur a one-time burden of 2,933
hours, 2479 at a time cost of $935,627, 2480 to comply with the Form N-1A disclosure requirements.
Amortizing the one-time burden over a three-year period results in an average annual burden of
978 hours at a time cost of $311,876. 2481
The Commission estimates that each money market fund (except government funds that
have not chosen to retain the ability to impose liquidity fees and suspend redemptions) will incur

2477

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 1 hour to update registration statement to include
required disclosure statement + 3 hours to update registration statement to include disclosure about effects
that fees/gates may have on shareholder redemptions, and disclosure about historical occasions on which
the fund has considered or imposed liquidity fees or gates + 3 hours to update registration statement to
include tax- and operations-related disclosure about floating NAV + 1 hour to update registration statement
to include disclosure about financial support received by the fund = 8 hours.

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (1 hour (to update registration statement to include
required disclosure statement) x $319 (blended hourly rate for a compliance attorney ($334) and a senior
programmer ($303)) = $319) + (3 hours (to update registration statement to include disclosure about effects
that fees/gates may have on shareholder redemptions, and disclosure about historical occasions on which
the fund has considered or imposed liquidity fees or gates) x $319 (blended hourly rate for a compliance
attorney ($334) and a senior programmer ($303)) = $957) + (3 hours (to update registration statement to
include tax- and operations-related disclosure about floating NAV) x $319 (blended hourly rate for a
compliance attorney ($334) and a senior programmer ($303)) = $957) + (1 hour (to update registration
statement to include disclosure about financial support received by the fund) x $319 (blended hourly rate
for a compliance attorney ($334) and a senior programmer ($303)) = $319) = $2,552.

2479

This estimate is based on the following calculations: (5 hours x 195 funds (559 money market funds – 205
institutional prime funds – 159 funds that will rely on the government fund exemption) = 975 hours) + (2
hours x 159 funds that will rely on the government fund exemption = 318 hours) + (8 hours x 205
institutional prime funds = 1,640 hours) = 2,933 hours. For purposes of this PRA analysis, our calculations
of the number of institutional prime funds and funds that will rely on the government fund exemption are
based on Form N-MFP data as of February 28, 2014.

2480

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 2,933 hours x $319 (blended hourly rate for a
compliance attorney ($334) and a senior programmer ($303)) = $935,627.

2481

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 2,933 burden hours ÷ 3 = 977 average annual burden
hours; $935,627 burden costs ÷ 3 = $311,876 average annual burden cost.

an ongoing burden of one hour, at a time cost of $319, 2482 each year to: 1) review and update the
SAI disclosure regarding historical occasions on which the fund has considered or imposed
liquidity fees or gates; 2) review and update the SAI disclosure regarding historical occasions in
which the fund has received financial support from a sponsor or fund affiliate; and 3) inform
investors of any fees or gates currently in place (as appropriate), or the transition to a floating
NAV (as appropriate), by means of a prospectus supplement. The Commission also estimates
that each government money market fund that has not chosen to retain the ability to impose
liquidity fees and suspend redemptions will incur an ongoing burden of 0.5 hours, at a time cost
of $160, 2483 each year to review and update the SAI disclosure regarding historical instances in
which the fund has received financial support from a sponsor or fund affiliate. In aggregate, we
estimate that all money market funds will incur an annual burden of 480 hours, 2484 at a time cost
of $153,120, 2485 to comply with the Form N-1A disclosure requirements.
Amortizing these one-time and ongoing hour and cost burdens over three years results in
an average annual increased burden of 2.3 hours per fund (other than government funds that have

on the government fund exemption = approximately 80 hours) = 480 hours.

NAV money market funds), 2486 at a time cost of $744. 2487 Government funds that have not
chosen to retain the ability to impose liquidity fees and suspend redemptions will incur an
average annual increased burden of 1 hour, 2488 at a time cost of $319, 2489 to comply with the Form
N-1A disclosure requirements. Floating NAV money market funds will incur an average annual
increased burden of 3.3 hours, 2490 at a time cost of $1,063, 2491 to comply with the Form N-1A
disclosure requirements.
In total, the Commission estimates that all money market funds will incur an average
annual increased burden of 1,285 hours, 2492 at a time cost of $413,716, 2493 to comply with the
Form N-1A disclosure requirements. Additionally, we estimate that there will be annual

2488

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 2 burden hours (year 1) + 0.5 burden hours (year 2) +
0.5 burden hours (year 3) ÷ 3 = 1 burden hour.

2490

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 8 burden hours (year 1) + 1 burden hour (year 2) + 1
burden hour (year 3) ÷ 3 = approximately 3.3 burden hours.

2491

This estimate is based on the following calculation: $2,552 (year 1 monetized burden hours) + $319 (year 2
monetized burden hours) + $319 (year 3 monetized burden hours) ÷ 3 = approximately $1,063.

2492

This estimate is based on the following calculation: (2.3 hours x 195 funds (559 money market funds – 205
institutional prime funds – 159 funds that will rely on the government fund exemption) = approximately
449 hours) + (1 hour x 159 funds that will rely on the government fund exemption = 159 hours) + (3.3
hours x 205 institutional prime funds = approximately 677 hours) = 1,285 hours.
The current approved collection of information for Form N-1A is 1,578,689 hours annually for all
investment companies. Adding 1,285 hours to this approved collection of information will result in a
burden of 1,579,974 hours each year.

2493

This estimate is based on the following calculation: ($744 x 195 funds (559 money market funds – 205
institutional prime funds – 159 funds that will rely on the government fund exemption) = $145,080) +
($319 x 159 funds that will rely on the government fund exemption = $50,721) + ($1,063 x 205

Advisers Act Rule 204(b)-1 and Form PF

Advisers Act rule 204(b)-1 requires SEC-registered private fund advisers that have at
least $150 million in private fund assets under management to report certain information
regarding the private funds they advise on Form PF. The rule implements sections 204 and 211
of the Advisers Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, which direct the Commission (and the
CFTC) to supply FSOC with information for use in monitoring potential systemic risk by
establishing reporting requirements for private fund advisers. Form PF divides respondents into
groups based on their size and the types of private funds they manage, with some groups of
advisers required to file more information than others or more frequently than others. Large
liquidity fund advisers—the only group of advisers affected by today’s amendments to Form
PF—must provide information concerning their liquidity funds on Form PF each quarter.
Form PF contains a collection of information under the PRA. 2495 This new collection of
2494

We expect that a fund that must include disclosure about historical occasions on which the fund has
considered or imposed liquidity fees or gates, or historical instances in which the fund has received
financial support from a sponsor or fund affiliate, will need to add 2-8 pages of new disclosure to its
registration statement. Adding this new disclosure will therefore increase the number of pages in, and
change the printing costs of, the fund’s registration statement. The Commission calculates the external
costs associated with the proposed Form N-1A disclosure requirements as follows: 5 pages (mid-point of 2
pages and 8 pages) x $0.045 per page x 27,863,000 money market fund registration statements printed
annually = $6,269,175 annual aggregate external costs. Our estimate of potential printing ($0.045 per page:
$0.035 for ink + $0.010 for paper) is based on data provided by Lexecon Inc. in response to Investment
Company Act Release No. 27182 (Dec. 8, 2005) [70 FR 74598 (Dec. 15, 2005)]. See Comment Letter of
Lexecon Inc. (Feb. 13, 2006) (“Lexecon Comment Letter”). For purposes of this analysis, our best estimate
of the number of money market fund registration statements printed annually is based on 27,863,000
money market fund shareholder accounts in 2012. See Investment Company Institute, 2013 Investment
Company Fact Book, at 178, available at http://www.ici.org/pdf/2013_factbook.pdf.

For purposes of the PRA analysis, the current burden associated with the requirements of rule 204(b)-1 is
included in the collection of information requirements of Form PF.

792

information will be mandatory for large liquidity fund advisers, and will be kept confidential to
the extent discussed above in section III.H. Based on data filed on Form PF and Form ADV, the
Commission estimates that, as of April 30, 2014, there were 28 large liquidity fund advisers
subject to this quarterly filing requirement that collectively advised 56 liquidity funds.
1.

Discussion of Amendments

Under our final amendments, for each liquidity fund it manages, a large liquidity fund
adviser will be required to provide, quarterly and with respect to each portfolio security, certain
additional information for each month of the reporting period. 2496 We discuss the additional
information we are requiring large liquidity fund advisers to provide in more detail in section
III.H.1 above. Generally, however, this additional information is largely the same as the
reporting requirements for registered money market funds under amended Form N-MFP, with
some modifications to better tailor the reporting to private liquidity funds. 2497 As proposed, the
final amendments will also remove current Questions 56 and 57 on Form PF, which generally
require large liquidity fund advisers to provide information about their liquidity funds’ portfolio
holdings broken out by asset class (rather than security by security). 2498 The amendments will
also require, as proposed, large liquidity fund advisers to identify any money market fund
advised by the adviser or its related persons that pursues substantially the same investment
objective and strategy and invests side by side in substantially the same positions as a liquidity
2496

See Question 63 of Form PF. Advisers will be required to file this information with their quarterly liquidity
fund filings with data for the quarter broken down by month. Advisers will not be required to file
information on Form PF more frequently as a result of today’s proposal because large liquidity fund
advisers already are required to file information each quarter on Form PF. See Form PF: Instruction 9.

fund the adviser reports about on Form PF. 2499 In addition, the final amendments have been
reorganized to minimize system changes and costs as much as possible. 2500 Finally, our changes
from the proposal to the final amendments to Form PF generally reflect any changes from the
proposal to the final amendments to Form N-MFP, such as the elimination of the proposed lot
level reporting. 2501
2.

Current Burden

The current approved collection of information for Form PF is 258,000 annual aggregate
hours and $25,684,000 in aggregate external costs. In estimating these total approved burdens,
we estimated that the amortized average annual burden of Form PF for large liquidity fund
advisers in particular would be 290 hours per large liquidity fund adviser for each of the first
three years, resulting in an aggregate amortized annual burden of 23,200 hours for large liquidity
fund advisers for each of the first three years. 2502 We estimated that the external cost burden
would range from $0 to $50,000 per large private fund adviser, which resulted in aggregate
estimated external costs attributable to large liquidity fund advisers of $4,000,000. The external
cost estimates also included estimates for filing fees, which are $150 per annual filing and $150

2499

See Question 64 to Form PF. See also supra section IV.H.1.

2500

By eliminating lot level sale data reporting (proposed question 64 of Form PF) and accordingly
renumbering proposed question 65 (parallel funds) as question 64, we have restructured the amendments to
Form PF so that the amendments keep the same numbering range as the current form. See question 64 of
Form PF; Axiom Comment Letter (suggesting to reorganize and consolidate the questions in the proposed
form amendments to minimize the system changes necessary to file the form).

per quarterly filing, resulting in annual filings costs for large liquidity fund advisers of
$48,000. 2503
3.

Change in Burden

The Commission continues to estimate that, as proposed, the paperwork burdens
associated with Form N-MFP (as adopted with our final amendments) are representative of the
burdens that large liquidity fund advisers could incur as a result of our final amendments to Form
PF because advisers will be required to file on Form PF virtually the same information money
market funds will file on Form N-MFP as amended and because, as discussed in section IV.H,
virtually all of the 28 large liquidity funds advisers affected already manage a money market
fund or have a related person that manages a money market fund. Therefore, we continue to
believe that large liquidity fund advisers—when required to compile and report for their liquidity
funds generally the same information virtually all of them already report for their money market
funds—likely will use the same (or comparable) staff and/or external service providers to
provide portfolio holdings information on Form N-MFP and Form PF.
Commenters provided no concrete cost estimates with respect to our amendments to
Form PF. As noted in section IV.H above, although one commenter asserted that the costs of
compliance for Form PF would outweigh the benefits, 2504 most commenters who discussed the

This estimate is based on the following calculation: ($150 quarterly filing fee x 4 quarters) x 80 large
liquidity fund advisers) = $48,000.

2504

See SSGA Comment Letter. See also, e.g., Wells Fargo Comment Letter (noting that the “[t]he burdens
associated with complying with the proposed amendments to Form PF are substantial” as a reason for why
the proposed amendments to Form PF should not apply to unregistered liquidity vehicles owned
exclusively by registered funds and complying with rule 12d1-1 under the Investment Company Act.)

795

Form PF amendments generally supported them. 2505 For the reasons discussed in section IV.C,
we believe our original cost estimates continue for Form N-MFP to be reasonable. Likewise, for
the same reasons, the Commission generally has not modified from our proposal the cost
estimates associated with the final amendments to Form PF. 2506 However, as with Form N-MFP,
the Commission has modified its estimates for Form PF based on updated industry data on time
costs as well as the updated total number of large liquidity funds that would be affected.
Accordingly, the Commission estimates that our final amendments to Form PF will result
in paperwork burden hours and external costs as follows. First, as discussed in the PRA analysis
for our amendments to Form N-MFP, the Commission estimates that the average annual
amortized burdens per money market fund imposed by Form N-MFP as amended are 149
hours 2507 and $8,552 in external costs. 2508 As discussed above, the Commission estimates that
large liquidity fund advisers generally will incur similar burdens for each of their liquidity funds.
Accordingly, we estimate that large liquidity fund advisers will incur a time cost of $38,740
associated with these 149 estimated burden hours for each large liquidity fund. 2509 The

2505

See, e.g., Goldman Sachs Comment Letter; ICI Comment Letter; Oppenheimer Comment Letter.

2506

Similarly, we estimate that our various other final changes to Form PF, such as those referenced in supra
note 2497 - 2500 and the accompanying discussion, will not significantly alter the estimated paperwork
burdens.

2507

As discussed in the PRA analysis for Form N-MFP, the Commission estimates that Form N-MFP, as
amended, will result in an aggregate annual, amortized collection of information burden of 83,412 hours.
See supra note 2343 and accompanying text. Based on the Commission’s estimated 559 money market
fund respondents, this results in a per fund annual burden of approximately 149 hours.

2508

As discussed in the PRA analysis for Form N-MFP, the Commission estimates that Form N-MFP, as
amended, will result in an aggregate external cost burden of $4,780,736. See supra note 2363 and
accompanying text. Based on the Commission’s estimated 559 money market fund respondents, this
results in a per fund annual external cost burden of approximately $8,552.

2509

The Commission estimates, as discussed above, that large liquidity fund advisers are likely to use the same
(or comparable) staff and/or external service providers to provide portfolio holdings information on Form

796

Commission therefore estimates increased annual burdens per large liquidity fund adviser with
two large liquidity funds each of 298 burden hours, at a total time cost of $79,566, and external
costs of $17,104. 2510 This will result in increased aggregate burden hours across all large
liquidity fund advisers of 8,344 burden hours, 2511 at a time cost of $2,227,848, 2512 and $478,912 in
external costs. 2513 Finally, the aggregate annual, amortized paperwork burden for Form PF as
amended therefore will be 251,264 burden hours 2514 and $23,531,712 in external costs. 2515

N-MFP and Form PF. Accordingly, the Commission estimates that large liquidity fund advisers will use
the same professionals, and in comparable proportions (conservatively based on the proportion of
professionals used with respect to our final amendments to Form N-MFP as amortized over the first three
years), for purposes of the Commission’s estimate of time costs associated with our amendments to Form
PF. As discussed in supra note 2362 and the accompanying text, amortizing these additional hourly and
cost burdens of our final amendments to Form N-MFP over three years results in an average annual
aggregate burden of approximately 38,198 hours at a total time cost of $9,914,238, or average time costs of
approximately $260 per hour. This results in the following estimated time cost for the Commission’s
estimated 149 hour burdens per liquidity fund: 149 burden hours (per liquidity fund for Form PF) x $260
(average per hour time costs) = $38,740 additional time costs per fund.
2510

This estimate assumes for purposes of the PRA that each large liquidity fund adviser advises two large
liquidity funds (56 total liquidity funds ÷ 28 large liquidity fund advisers). Each large liquidity fund
adviser therefore will incur the following burdens: 149 estimated burden hours per fund x 2 large liquidity
funds = 298 burden hours per large liquidity fund adviser; $38,740 estimated time cost per fund x 2 large
liquidity funds = $77,480 time cost per large liquidity fund adviser; and $8,552 estimated external costs per
fund (based on $4,780,736 in total external costs for 559 funds with respect to Form N-MFP) x 2 large
liquidity funds = $17,104 external costs per large liquidity fund adviser.

2511

This estimate is based on the following calculation: 298 estimated additional burden hours per large
liquidity fund adviser x 28 large liquidity fund advisers = 8,344.

2512

This estimate is based on the following calculation: $77,480 estimated time cost per large liquidity fund
adviser x 28 large liquidity fund advisers = $2,169,440.

2513

This estimate is based on the following calculation: $17,104 estimated external costs per large liquidity
fund adviser x 28 large liquidity fund advisers = $478,912.

2514

Form PF’s current approved burden includes 23,200 aggregate burden hours associated with large liquidity
fund advisers, based on 80 large liquidity fund advisers and an estimated 290 burden hours per large
liquidity fund adviser. As calculated below, because we are reducing our estimate of the number of large
liquidity funds from 80 to 28, our estimates of costs will actually decrease on an aggregate basis. However,
on a per fund basis, our amendments to Form PF will increase the burden hours per large liquidity fund
adviser by 298 hours, as discussed above, resulting in a total of 588 burden hours per large liquidity fund
adviser. Multiplying 588 by the current estimated number of 28 large liquidity fund advisers results in
16,464 burden hours attributable to large liquidity fund advisers, a 6,736 reduction from the approved
burden hours attributable to large liquidity fund advisers. This therefore results in 249,300 total burden
hours for all of Form PF (current approved 258,000 burden hours – 6,736 reduction = 251,264).

V.

REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT CERTIFICATION

Section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 2516 (“RFA”) requires the
Commission to undertake an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (“IRFA”) of the proposed rule
amendments on small entities unless the Commission certifies that the rule, if adopted, would not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 2517 As stated in the
Proposing Release, based on information in filings submitted to the Commission, we believe that
there are no money market funds that are small entities. 2518 Accordingly, the Commission
certified, pursuant to section 605(b) of the RFA, that new rule 30b1-8 and Form N-CR under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and the proposed amendments to rules 2a-7, 12d3-1, 18f-3,
22e-3, 30b1-7, and 31a-1 and Forms N-MFP and N-1A under the Investment Company Act,
Form PF under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and rules 482 and 419 under the Securities
Act of 1933, if adopted would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of

2515

Form PF’s current approved burden includes $25,684,000 in external costs, which includes $4,000,000
attributable to large liquidity fund advisers for certain costs ($50,000 per adviser), and $48,000 (or $600 per
adviser) for filing fees, in both cases assuming 80 large liquidity fund adviser respondents. Form PF’s
approved burden therefore includes a total of $4,048,000 in external costs attributable to large liquidity
fund advisers. As calculated below, because we are reducing our estimate of the number of large liquidity
funds from 80 to 28, our estimates of external costs will actually decrease on an aggregate basis. However,
we estimate external costs to increase on a per fund basis. Reducing these estimates to reflect the
Commission’s current estimate of 28 large liquidity fund adviser respondents results in costs of $1,400,000
(28 large liquidity fund advisers x $50,000 per adviser) and $16,800 (28 large liquidity fund advisers x
$600), respectively, for an aggregate cost of $1,416,800. These costs, plus the additional external costs
associated with our amendments to Form PF ($478,912 as estimated above), result in total external costs
attributable to large liquidity fund advisers of $1,895,712, a reduction of $2,152,288 from the currently
approved external costs attributable to large liquidity fund advisers. This therefore results in total external
cost for all of Form PF of $23,531,712 (current approved external cost burden of $25,684,000 - $2,152,288
reduction = $23,531,712).

small entities. 2519 We included this certification in section VI of the Proposing Release. 2520
We encouraged written comments regarding this certification. 2521 One commenter
responded. 2522 Among other things, this commenter argued that, while our certification evaluated
the impact of our amendments on money market funds to which the amendments directly apply,
we did not account for the “impact on numerous smaller entities that are investors in money
market funds or that do business with money market funds….” 2523 This RFA certification is
properly based on the economic impact of the amended rule on the entities that are subject to the
requirements of the amended rule. 2524 The numerous other entities suggested by the commenter
are not subject to the requirements of the amended rule and also are not included in the definition
of “small business” or “small organization” for purposes of the RFA under the Investment
Company Act, 2525 Investment Advisers Act 2526 or Securities Act. 2527 We recognize, however, that

In advancing the argument, the commenter relies on Aeronautical Repair Station Association v. Federal
Aviation Administration, 494 F.3d 161 (DC Cir. 2007). This case is inapposite, however, because there the
agency’s own rulemaking release expressly stated that the rule imposed responsibilities directly on certain
small business contractors. The court reaffirmed its prior holdings that the RFA limits its application to
small entities ‘‘which will be subject to the proposed regulation—that is, those small entities to which the
proposed rule will apply.’’ Id. at 176 (emphasis and internal quotations omitted). See also Cement Kiln
Recycling Coal v. EPA, 255F. 3d 855, 869 (DC Cir. 2001).

See rule 0-10 of the Investment Company Act, which defines the term “small business” or “small
organization” for purposes of rules under the Act to mean an investment company that, together with other
investment companies in the same group of related investment companies, has net assets of $50 million or
less as of the end of its most recent fiscal year.

2526

See rule 0-07 of the Investment Advisers Act, which defines the term “small business” or “small
organization” for purposes of rules under the Act to mean an investment adviser that, among other things,
has assets under management of less than $25 million. Our changes to rule 204(b)-1 and Form PF would
only apply to certain large liquidity fund advisers with at least $1 billion in combined liquidity fund and

799

entities other than those subject to the requirements of the amended rule may be affected by the
amendments we adopt today. As such, we have discussed in the appropriate sections of this
Release the effects of today’s amendments on entities other than those subject to the
requirements of the amended rule. 2528
The commenter also noted that our RFA analysis fails to consider money market funds
that have yet to enter the industry and may need to begin their operations as “small entities.” 2529
We believe that the commenter misconstrues the RFA, which contemplates that an agency shall
calculate the number of small businesses that currently would be affected by its proposed
regulation. 2530
For the reasons described above, the Commission again certifies that the amendments to new

(4) Money market funds. (i) An advertisement for an investment company that holds
itself out to be a money market fund, that is not a government money market fund, as defined in
§ 270.2a-7(a)(16) of this chapter, or a retail money market fund, as defined in § 270.2a-7(a)(25)
of this chapter, must include the following statement:
You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Because the share price of the
Fund will fluctuate, when you sell your shares they may be worth more or less
than what you originally paid for them. The Fund may impose a fee upon sale of
your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund’s
liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other
factors. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal

804

Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund’s
sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you
should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at
any time.
(ii) An advertisement for an investment company that holds itself out to be a money
market fund, that is a government money market fund, as defined in § 270.2a-7(a)(16) of this
chapter or a retail money market fund, as defined in § 270.2a-7(a)(25) of this chapter, and that is
subject to the requirements of § 270.2a-7(c)(2)(i) and/or (ii) of this chapter (or is not subject to
the requirements of § 270.2a-7(c)(2)(i) and/or (ii) of this chapter pursuant to § 270.2a-7(c)(2)(iii)
of this chapter, but has chosen to rely on the ability to impose liquidity fees and suspend
redemptions consistent with the requirements of § 270.2a-7(c)(2)(i) and/or (ii)), must include the
following statement:
You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the
Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per
share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. The Fund may impose a
fee upon sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your
ability to sell shares if the Fund’s liquidity falls below required
minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An
investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.
The Fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial

805

support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor
will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.
(iii) An advertisement for an investment company that holds itself out to be a money
market fund, that is a government money market fund, as defined in § 270.2a-7(a)(16) of this
chapter, that is not subject to the requirements of § 270.2a-7(c)(2)(i) and/or (ii) of this chapter
pursuant to § 270.2a-7(c)(2)(iii) of this chapter, and that has not chosen to rely on the ability to
impose liquidity fees and suspend redemptions consistent with the requirements of
§ 270.2a-7(c)(2)(i) and/or (ii)), must include the following statement:
You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the
Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per
share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund
is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation or any other government agency.

The Fund’s

sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the
Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide
financial support to the Fund at any time.

Note to paragraph (b)(4). If an affiliated person, promoter, or principal underwriter of
the Fund, or an affiliated person of such a person, has contractually committed to provide
financial support to the Fund, the statement may omit the last sentence (“The Fund’s sponsor has
no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the
sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.”) for the term of the agreement.
For purposes of this Note, the term “financial support” includes any capital contribution,

806

purchase of a security from the Fund in reliance on § 270.17a-9 of this chapter, purchase of any
defaulted or devalued security at par, execution of letter of credit or letter of indemnity, capital
support agreement (whether or not the Fund ultimately received support), performance
guarantee, or any other similar action reasonably intended to increase or stabilize the value or
liquidity of the fund’s portfolio; however, the term “financial support” excludes any routine
waiver of fees or reimbursement of fund expenses, routine inter-fund lending, routine inter-fund
purchases of fund shares, or any action that would qualify as financial support as defined above,
that the board of directors has otherwise determined not to be reasonably intended to increase or
stabilize the value or liquidity of the fund’s portfolio.

issuance had a remaining maturity of more than 397 calendar days but that has a remaining
maturity of 397 calendar days or less and that is an unrated security is not an eligible security if

sales of portfolio securities.
(b) Holding out and use of names and titles—(1) Holding out. It shall be an untrue
statement of material fact within the meaning of section 34(b) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-33(b))
for a registered investment company, in any registration statement, application, report, account,
record, or other document filed or transmitted pursuant to the Act, including any advertisement,
pamphlet, circular, form letter, or other sales literature addressed to or intended for distribution
to prospective investors that is required to be filed with the Commission by section 24(b) of the
Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-24(b)), to hold itself out to investors as a money market fund or the
equivalent of a money market fund, unless such registered investment company complies with
this section.
(2) Names. It shall constitute the use of a materially deceptive or misleading name or
title within the meaning of section 35(d) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-34(d)) for a registered
investment company to adopt the term “money market” as part of its name or title or the name or

817

title of any redeemable securities of which it is the issuer, or to adopt a name that suggests that it
is a money market fund or the equivalent of a money market fund, unless such registered
investment company complies with this section.
(3) Titles. For purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a name that suggests that a
registered investment company is a money market fund or the equivalent thereof includes one
that uses such terms as “cash,” “liquid,” “money,” “ready assets” or similar terms.
(c) Pricing and Redeeming Shares—(1) Share price calculation.
(i) The current price per share, for purposes of distribution, redemption and repurchase,
of any redeemable security issued by a government money market fund or retail money market
fund, notwithstanding the requirements of section 2(a)(41) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(41))
and of §§ 270.2a-4 and 270.22c-1 thereunder, may be computed by use of the amortized cost
method and/or the penny-rounding method. To use these methods, the board of directors of the
government or retail money market fund must determine, in good faith, that it is in the best
interests of the fund and its shareholders to maintain a stable net asset value per share or stable
price per share, by virtue of either the amortized cost method and/or the penny-rounding method.
The government or retail money market fund may continue to use such methods only so long as
the board of directors believes that they fairly reflect the market-based net asset value per share
and the fund complies with the other requirements of this section.
(ii) Any money market fund that is not a government money market fund or a retail
money market fund must compute its price per share for purposes of distribution, redemption and
repurchase by rounding the fund’s current net asset value per share to a minimum of the fourth
decimal place in the case of a fund with a $1.0000 share price or an equivalent or more precise

818

level of accuracy for money market funds with a different share price (e.g. $10.000 per share, or
$100.00 per share).
(2) Liquidity fees and temporary suspensions of redemptions. Except as provided in
paragraphs (c)(2)(iii) and (v) of this section, and notwithstanding sections 22(e) and 27(i) of the
Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-22(e) and 80a-27(i)) and § 270.22c-1:
(i) Discretionary liquidity fees and temporary suspensions of redemptions. If, at any
time, the money market fund has invested less than thirty percent of its total assets in weekly
liquid assets, the fund may institute a liquidity fee (not to exceed two percent of the value of the
shares redeemed) or suspend the right of redemption temporarily, subject to paragraphs (c)(i)(A)
and (B) of this section, if the fund’s board of directors, including a majority of the directors who
are not interested persons of the fund, determines that the fee or suspension of redemptions is in
the best interests of the fund.
(A) Duration and application of discretionary liquidity fee. Once imposed, a
discretionary liquidity fee must be applied to all shares redeemed and must remain in effect until
the money market fund’s board of directors, including a majority of the directors who are not
interested persons of the fund, determines that imposing such liquidity fee is no longer in the best
interests of the fund. Provided however, that if, at the end of a business day, the money market
fund has invested thirty percent or more of its total assets in weekly liquid assets, the fund must
cease charging the liquidity fee, effective as of the beginning of the next business day.
(B) Duration of temporary suspension of redemptions. The temporary suspension of
redemptions must apply to all shares and must remain in effect until the fund’s board of
directors, including a majority of the directors who are not interested persons of the fund,

819

determines that the temporary suspension of redemptions is no longer in the best interests of the
fund. Provided, however, that the fund must restore the right of redemption on the earlier of:
(1) The beginning of the next business day following a business day that ended with the
money market fund having invested thirty percent or more of its total assets in weekly liquid
assets; or
(2) The beginning of the next business day following ten business days after suspending
redemptions. The money market fund may not suspend the right of redemption pursuant to this
section for more than ten business days in any rolling ninety calendar day period.
(ii) Default liquidity fees. If, at the end of a business day, the money market fund has
invested less than ten percent of its total assets in weekly liquid assets, the fund must institute a
liquidity fee, effective as of the beginning of the next business day, as described in paragraphs
(c)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, unless the fund’s board of directors, including a majority of
the directors who are not interested persons of the fund, determines that imposing the fee is not
in the best interests of the fund.
(A) Amount of default liquidity fee. The default liquidity fee shall be one percent of the
value of shares redeemed unless the money market fund’s board of directors, including a
majority of the directors who are not interested persons of the fund, determines, at the time of
initial imposition or later, that a higher or lower fee level is in the best interests of the fund. A
liquidity fee may not exceed two percent of the value of the shares redeemed.
(B) Duration and application of default liquidity fee. Once imposed, the default liquidity
fee must be applied to all shares redeemed and shall remain in effect until the money market
fund’s board of directors, including a majority of the directors who are not interested persons of

820

the fund, determines that imposing such liquidity fee is not in the best interests of the fund.
Provided however, that if, at the end of a business day, the money market fund has invested
thirty percent or more of its total assets in weekly liquid assets, the fund must cease charging the
liquidity fee, effective as of the beginning of the next business day.
(iii) Government money market funds. The requirements of paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii)
of this section shall not apply to a government money market fund. A government money
market fund may, however, choose to rely on the ability to impose liquidity fees and suspend
redemptions consistent with the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(i) and/or (ii) of this section and
any other requirements that apply to liquidity fees and temporary suspensions of redemptions
(e.g., Item 4(b)(1)(ii) of Form N-1A (§ 274.11A of this chapter)).
(iv) Variable contracts. Notwithstanding section 27(i) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-27(i)), a
variable insurance contract issued by a registered separate account funding variable insurance
contracts or the sponsoring insurance company of such separate account may apply a liquidity
fee or temporary suspension of redemptions pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section to
contract owners who allocate all or a portion of their contract value to a subaccount of the
separate account that is either a money market fund or that invests all of its assets in shares of a
money market fund.
(v) Master feeder funds. Any money market fund (a “feeder fund”) that owns, pursuant
to section 12(d)(1)(E) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-12(d)(1)(E)), shares of another money market
fund (a “master fund”) may not impose liquidity fees or temporary suspensions of redemptions
under paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, provided however, that if a master fund, in
which the feeder fund invests, imposes a liquidity fee or temporary suspension of redemptions

821

pursuant to paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, then the feeder fund shall pass through to
its investors the fee or redemption suspension on the same terms and conditions as imposed by
the master fund.
(d) Risk-limiting conditions—(1) Portfolio maturity. The money market fund must
maintain a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity appropriate to its investment objective;
provided, however, that the money market fund must not:
(i) Acquire any instrument with a remaining maturity of greater than 397 calendar days;
(ii) Maintain a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity (“WAM”) that exceeds 60
calendar days; or
(iii) Maintain a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity that exceeds 120 calendar
days, determined without reference to the exceptions in paragraph (i) of this section regarding
interest rate readjustments (“WAL”).
(2) Portfolio quality—(i) General. The money market fund must limit its portfolio
investments to those United States dollar-denominated securities that the fund’s board of
directors determines present minimal credit risks (which determination must be based on factors
pertaining to credit quality in addition to any rating assigned to such securities by a designated
NRSRO) and that are at the time of acquisition eligible securities.
(ii) Second tier securities. No money market fund may acquire a second tier security
with a remaining maturity of greater than 45 calendar days, determined without reference to the
exceptions in paragraph (i) of this section regarding interest rate readjustments. Immediately
after the acquisition of any second tier security, a money market fund must not have invested
more than three percent of its total assets in second tier securities.

822

(iii) Securities subject to guarantees. A security that is subject to a guarantee may be
determined to be an eligible security or a first tier security based solely on whether the guarantee
is an eligible security or first tier security, as the case may be.
(iv) Securities subject to conditional demand features. A security that is subject to a
conditional demand feature (“underlying security”) may be determined to be an eligible security
or a first tier security only if:
(A) The conditional demand feature is an eligible security or first tier security, as the case
may be;
(B) At the time of the acquisition of the underlying security, the money market fund’s
board of directors has determined that there is minimal risk that the circumstances that would
result in the conditional demand feature not being exercisable will occur; and
(1) The conditions limiting exercise either can be monitored readily by the fund or relate
to the taxability, under federal, state or local law, of the interest payments on the security; or
(2) The terms of the conditional demand feature require that the fund will receive notice
of the occurrence of the condition and the opportunity to exercise the demand feature in
accordance with its terms; and
(C) The underlying security or any guarantee of such security (or the debt securities of
the issuer of the underlying security or guarantee that are comparable in priority and security
with the underlying security or guarantee) has received either a short-term rating or a long-term
rating, as the case may be, from the requisite NRSROs within the NRSROs’ two highest shortterm or long-term rating categories (within which there may be sub-categories or gradations
indicating relative standing) or, if unrated, is determined to be of comparable quality by the

823

money market fund’s board of directors to a security that has received a rating from the requisite
NRSROs within the NRSROs’ two highest short-term or long-term rating categories, as the case
may be.
(3) Portfolio diversification—(i) Issuer diversification. The money market fund must be
diversified with respect to issuers of securities acquired by the fund as provided in paragraphs
(d)(3)(i) and (d)(3)(ii) of this section, other than with respect to government securities and
securities subject to a guarantee issued by a non-controlled person.
(A) Taxable and national funds. Immediately after the acquisition of any security, a
money market fund other than a single state fund must not have invested more than:
(1) Five percent of its total assets in securities issued by the issuer of the security,
provided, however, that such a fund may invest up to twenty-five percent of its total assets in the
first tier securities of a single issuer for a period of up to three business days after the acquisition
thereof; provided, further, that the fund may not invest in the securities of more than one issuer
in accordance with the foregoing proviso in this paragraph at any time; and
(2) Ten percent of its total assets in securities issued by or subject to demand features or
guarantees from the institution that issued the demand feature or guarantee.
(B) Single state funds. Immediately after the acquisition of any security, a single state
fund must not have invested:
(1) With respect to seventy-five percent of its total assets, more than five percent of its
total assets in securities issued by the issuer of the security; and
(2) With respect to all of its total assets, more than ten percent of its total assets in
securities issued by or subject to demand features or guarantees from the institution that issued

824

the demand feature or guarantee.
(C) Second tier securities. Immediately after the acquisition of any second tier security, a
money market fund must not have invested more than one half of one percent of its total assets in
the second tier securities of any single issuer, and must not have invested more than 2.5 percent
of its total assets in second tier securities issued by or subject to demand features or guarantees
from the institution that issued the demand feature or guarantee.
(ii) Issuer diversification calculations. For purposes of making calculations under
paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section:
(A) Repurchase agreements. The acquisition of a repurchase agreement may be deemed
to be an acquisition of the underlying securities, provided the obligation of the seller to
repurchase the securities from the money market fund is collateralized fully and the fund’s board
of directors has evaluated the seller’s creditworthiness.
(B) Refunded securities. The acquisition of a refunded security shall be deemed to be an
acquisition of the escrowed government securities.
(C) Conduit securities. A conduit security shall be deemed to be issued by the person
(other than the municipal issuer) ultimately responsible for payments of interest and principal on
the security.
(D) Asset-backed securities—(1) General. An asset-backed security acquired by a fund
(“primary ABS”) shall be deemed to be issued by the special purpose entity that issued the assetbacked security, provided, however:
(i) Holdings of primary ABS. Any person whose obligations constitute ten percent or
more of the principal amount of the qualifying assets of the primary ABS (“ten percent obligor”)

825

shall be deemed to be an issuer of the portion of the primary ABS such obligations represent; and
(ii) Holdings of secondary ABS. If a ten percent obligor of a primary ABS is itself a
special purpose entity issuing asset-backed securities (“secondary ABS”), any ten percent obligor
of such secondary ABS also shall be deemed to be an issuer of the portion of the primary ABS
that such ten percent obligor represents.
(2) Restricted special purpose entities. A ten percent obligor with respect to a primary or
secondary ABS shall not be deemed to have issued any portion of the assets of a primary ABS as
provided in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(D)(1) of this section if that ten percent obligor is itself a special
purpose entity issuing asset-backed securities (“restricted special purpose entity”), and the
securities that it issues (other than securities issued to a company that controls, or is controlled
by or under common control with, the restricted special purpose entity and which is not itself a
special purpose entity issuing asset-backed securities) are held by only one other special purpose
entity.
(3) Demand features and guarantees. In the case of a ten percent obligor deemed to be
an issuer, the fund must satisfy the diversification requirements of paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this
section with respect to any demand feature or guarantee to which the ten percent obligor’s
obligations are subject.
(E) Shares of other money market funds. A money market fund that acquires shares
issued by another money market fund in an amount that would otherwise be prohibited by
paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section shall nonetheless be deemed in compliance with this section if
the board of directors of the acquiring money market fund reasonably believes that the fund in
which it has invested is in compliance with this section.

826

(F) Treatment of certain affiliated entities—(1) General. The money market fund, when
calculating the amount of its total assets invested in securities issued by any particular issuer for
purposes of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, must treat as a single issuer two or more issuers of
securities owned by the money market fund if one issuer controls the other, is controlled by the
other issuer, or is under common control with the other issuer, provided that “control” for this
purpose means ownership of more than 50 percent of the issuer’s voting securities.
(2) Equity owners of asset-backed commercial paper special purpose entities. The
money market fund is not required to aggregate an asset-backed commercial paper special
purpose entity and its equity owners under paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(F)(1) of this section provided that
a primary line of business of its equity owners is owning equity interests in special purpose
entities and providing services to special purpose entities, the independent equity owners’
activities with respect to the SPEs are limited to providing management or administrative
services, and no qualifying assets of the special purpose entity were originated by the equity
owners.
(3) Ten percent obligors. For purposes of determining ten percent obligors pursuant to
paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(D)(1)(i) of this section, the money market fund must treat as a single person
two or more persons whose obligations in the aggregate constitute ten percent or more of the
principal amount of the qualifying assets of the primary ABS if one person controls the other, is
controlled by the other person, or is under common control with the person, provided that
“control” for this purpose means ownership of more than 50 percent of the person’s voting
securities.
(iii) Diversification rules for demand features and guarantees. The money market fund

827

must be diversified with respect to demand features and guarantees acquired by the fund as
provided in paragraphs (d)(3)(iii) and (d)(3)(iv) of this section, other than with respect to a
demand feature issued by the same institution that issued the underlying security, or with respect
to a guarantee or demand feature that is itself a government security.
(A) General. Immediately after the acquisition of any demand feature or guarantee, any
security subject to a demand feature or guarantee, or a security directly issued by the issuer of a
demand feature or guarantee, a money market fund must not have invested more than ten percent
of its total assets in securities issued by or subject to demand features or guarantees from the
institution that issued the demand feature or guarantee, subject to paragraphs (d)(3)(iii)(B) and
(d)(3)(iii)(C) of this section.
(B) Tax exempt funds. Immediately after the acquisition of any demand feature or
guarantee, any security subject to a demand feature or guarantee, or a security directly issued by
the issuer of a demand feature or guarantee (any such acquisition, a “demand feature or
guarantee acquisition”), a tax exempt fund, with respect to eighty-five percent of its total assets,
must not have invested more than ten percent of its total assets in securities issued by or subject
to demand features or guarantees from the institution that issued the demand feature or
guarantee; provided that any demand feature or guarantee acquisition in excess of ten percent of
the fund’s total assets in accordance with this paragraph must be a demand feature or guarantee
issued by a non-controlled person.
(C) Second tier demand features or guarantees. Immediately after the acquisition of any
demand feature or guarantee, any security subject to a demand feature or guarantee, a security
directly issued by the issuer of a demand feature or guarantee, or a security after giving effect to

828

the demand feature or guarantee, in all cases that is a second tier security, a money market fund
must not have invested more than 2.5 percent of its total assets in securities issued by or subject
to demand features or guarantees from the institution that issued the demand feature or
guarantee.
(iv) Demand feature and guarantee diversification calculations—(A) Fractional demand
features or guarantees. In the case of a security subject to a demand feature or guarantee from
an institution by which the institution guarantees a specified portion of the value of the security,
the institution shall be deemed to guarantee the specified portion thereof.
(B) Layered demand features or guarantees. In the case of a security subject to demand
features or guarantees from multiple institutions that have not limited the extent of their
obligations as described in paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, each institution shall be
deemed to have provided the demand feature or guarantee with respect to the entire principal
amount of the security.
(v) Diversification safe harbor. A money market fund that satisfies the applicable
diversification requirements of paragraphs (d)(3) and (e) of this section shall be deemed to have
satisfied the diversification requirements of section 5(b)(1) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-5(b)(1))
and the rules adopted thereunder.
(4) Portfolio liquidity. The money market fund must hold securities that are sufficiently
liquid to meet reasonably foreseeable shareholder redemptions in light of the fund’s obligations
under section 22(e) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-22(e)) and any commitments the fund has made to
shareholders; provided, however, that:
(i) Illiquid securities. The money market fund may not acquire any illiquid security if,

829

immediately after the acquisition, the money market fund would have invested more than five
percent of its total assets in illiquid securities.
(ii) Minimum daily liquidity requirement. The money market fund may not acquire any
security other than a daily liquid asset if, immediately after the acquisition, the fund would have
invested less than ten percent of its total assets in daily liquid assets. This provision does not
apply to tax exempt funds.
(iii) Minimum weekly liquidity requirement. The money market fund may not acquire
any security other than a weekly liquid asset if, immediately after the acquisition, the fund would
have invested less than thirty percent of its total assets in weekly liquid assets.
(e) Demand features and guarantees not relied upon. If the fund’s board of directors has
determined that the fund is not relying on a demand feature or guarantee to determine the quality
(pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section), or maturity (pursuant to paragraph (i) of this
section), or liquidity of a portfolio security (pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section), and
maintains a record of this determination (pursuant to paragraphs (g)(3) and (h)(7) of this section),
then the fund may disregard such demand feature or guarantee for all purposes of this section.
(f) Downgrades, defaults and other events—(1) Downgrades.
(i) General. Upon the occurrence of either of the events specified in paragraphs
(f)(1)(i)(A) and (B) of this section with respect to a portfolio security, the board of directors of
the money market fund shall reassess promptly whether such security continues to present
minimal credit risks and shall cause the fund to take such action as the board of directors
determines is in the best interests of the money market fund:
(A) A portfolio security of a money market fund ceases to be a first tier security (either

830

because it no longer has the highest rating from the requisite NRSROs or, in the case of an
unrated security, the board of directors of the money market fund determines that it is no longer
of comparable quality to a first tier security); and
(B) The money market fund’s investment adviser (or any person to whom the fund’s
board of directors has delegated portfolio management responsibilities) becomes aware that any
unrated security or second tier security held by the money market fund has, since the security
was acquired by the fund, been given a rating by a designated NRSRO below the designated
NRSRO’s second highest short-term rating category.
(ii) Securities to be disposed of. The reassessments required by paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this
section shall not be required if the fund disposes of the security (or it matures) within five
business days of the specified event and, in the case of events specified in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(B)
of this section, the board is subsequently notified of the adviser’s actions.
(iii) Special rule for certain securities subject to demand features. In the event that after
giving effect to a rating downgrade, more than 2.5 percent of the fund’s total assets are invested
in securities issued by or subject to demand features from a single institution that are second tier
securities, the fund shall reduce its investment in securities issued by or subject to demand
features from that institution to no more than 2.5 percent of its total assets by exercising the
demand features at the next succeeding exercise date(s), absent a finding by the board of
directors that disposal of the portfolio security would not be in the best interests of the money
market fund.
(2) Defaults and other events. Upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in
paragraphs (f)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section with respect to a portfolio security, the money

831

market fund shall dispose of such security as soon as practicable consistent with achieving an
orderly disposition of the security, by sale, exercise of any demand feature or otherwise, absent a
finding by the board of directors that disposal of the portfolio security would not be in the best
interests of the money market fund (which determination may take into account, among other
factors, market conditions that could affect the orderly disposition of the portfolio security):
(i) The default with respect to a portfolio security (other than an immaterial default
unrelated to the financial condition of the issuer);
(ii) A portfolio security ceases to be an eligible security;
(iii) A portfolio security has been determined to no longer present minimal credit risks; or
(iv) An event of insolvency occurs with respect to the issuer of a portfolio security or the
provider of any demand feature or guarantee.
(3) Notice to the Commission. The money market fund must notify the Commission of
the occurrence of certain material events, as specified in Form N-CR (§ 274.222 of this chapter).
(4) Defaults for purposes of paragraphs (f)(2) and (3) of this section. For purposes of
paragraphs (f)(2) and (3) of this section, an instrument subject to a demand feature or guarantee
shall not be deemed to be in default (and an event of insolvency with respect to the security shall
not be deemed to have occurred) if:
(i) In the case of an instrument subject to a demand feature, the demand feature has been
exercised and the fund has recovered either the principal amount or the amortized cost of the
instrument, plus accrued interest;
(ii) The provider of the guarantee is continuing, without protest, to make payments as due
on the instrument; or

832

(iii) The provider of a guarantee with respect to an asset-backed security pursuant to
paragraph (a)(18)(ii) of this section is continuing, without protest, to provide credit, liquidity or
other support as necessary to permit the asset-backed security to make payments as due.
(g) Required procedures. The money market fund’s board of directors must adopt
written procedures including the following:
(1) Funds using amortized cost. In the case of a government or retail money market fund
that uses the amortized cost method of valuation, in supervising the money market fund’s
operations and delegating special responsibilities involving portfolio management to the money
market fund’s investment adviser, the money market fund’s board of directors, as a particular
responsibility within the overall duty of care owed to its shareholders, shall establish written
procedures reasonably designed, taking into account current market conditions and the money
market fund’s investment objectives, to stabilize the money market fund’s net asset value per
share, as computed for the purpose of distribution, redemption and repurchase, at a single value.
(i) Specific procedures. Included within the procedures adopted by the board of directors
shall be the following:
(A) Shadow pricing. Written procedures shall provide:
(1) That the extent of deviation, if any, of the current net asset value per share calculated
using available market quotations (or an appropriate substitute that reflects current market
conditions) from the money market fund’s amortized cost price per share, shall be calculated at
least daily, and at such other intervals that the board of directors determines appropriate and
reasonable in light of current market conditions;
(2) For the periodic review by the board of directors of the amount of the deviation as

833

well as the methods used to calculate the deviation; and
(3) For the maintenance of records of the determination of deviation and the board’s
review thereof.
(B) Prompt consideration of deviation. In the event such deviation from the money
market fund’s amortized cost price per share exceeds ½ of 1 percent, the board of directors shall
promptly consider what action, if any, should be initiated by the board of directors.
(C) Material dilution or unfair results. Where the board of directors believes the extent of
any deviation from the money market fund’s amortized cost price per share may result in
material dilution or other unfair results to investors or existing shareholders, it shall cause the
fund to take such action as it deems appropriate to eliminate or reduce to the extent reasonably
practicable such dilution or unfair results.
(ii) [Reserved]
(2) Funds using penny rounding. In the case of a government or retail money market
fund that uses the penny rounding method of pricing, in supervising the money market fund’s
operations and delegating special responsibilities involving portfolio management to the money
market fund’s investment adviser, the money market fund’s board of directors, as a particular
responsibility within the overall duty of care owed to its shareholders, must establish written
procedures reasonably designed, taking into account current market conditions and the money
market fund’s investment objectives, to assure to the extent reasonably practicable that the
money market fund’s price per share as computed for the purpose of distribution, redemption and
repurchase, rounded to the nearest one percent, will not deviate from the single price established
by the board of directors.

834

(3) Securities for which maturity is determined by reference to demand features. In the
case of a security for which maturity is determined by reference to a demand feature, written
procedures shall require ongoing review of the security’s continued minimal credit risks, and that
review must be based on, among other things, financial data for the most recent fiscal year of the
issuer of the demand feature and, in the case of a security subject to a conditional demand
feature, the issuer of the security whose financial condition must be monitored under paragraph
(d)(2)(iv) of this section, whether such data is publicly available or provided under the terms of
the security’s governing documentation.
(4) Securities subject to demand features or guarantees. In the case of a security subject
to one or more demand features or guarantees that the fund’s board of directors has determined
that the fund is not relying on to determine the quality (pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this
section), maturity (pursuant to paragraph (i) of this section) or liquidity (pursuant to paragraph
(d)(4) of this section) of the security subject to the demand feature or guarantee, written
procedures must require periodic evaluation of such determination.
(5) Adjustable rate securities without demand features. In the case of a variable rate or
floating rate security that is not subject to a demand feature and for which maturity is determined
pursuant to paragraph (i)(1), (i)(2) or (i)(4) of this section, written procedures shall require
periodic review of whether the interest rate formula, upon readjustment of its interest rate, can
reasonably be expected to cause the security to have a market value that approximates its
amortized cost value.
(6) Ten percent obligors of asset-backed securities. In the case of an asset-backed
security, written procedures must require the fund to periodically determine the number of ten

835

percent obligors (as that term is used in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(D) of this section) deemed to be the
issuers of all or a portion of the asset-backed security for purposes of paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(D) of
this section; provided, however, written procedures need not require periodic determinations
with respect to any asset-backed security that a fund’s board of directors has determined, at the
time of acquisition, will not have, or is unlikely to have, ten percent obligors that are deemed to
be issuers of all or a portion of that asset-backed security for purposes of paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(D)
of this section, and maintains a record of this determination.
(7) Asset-backed securities not subject to guarantees. In the case of an asset-backed
security for which the fund’s board of directors has determined that the fund is not relying on the
sponsor’s financial strength or its ability or willingness to provide liquidity, credit or other
support in connection with the asset-backed security to determine the quality (pursuant to
paragraph (d)(2) of this section) or liquidity (pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section) of the
asset-backed security, written procedures must require periodic evaluation of such determination.
(8) Stress Testing. Written procedures must provide for:
(i) General. The periodic stress testing, at such intervals as the board of directors
determines appropriate and reasonable in light of current market conditions, of the money market
fund’s ability to have invested at least ten percent of its total assets in weekly liquid assets, and
the fund’s ability to minimize principal volatility (and, in the case of a money market fund using
the amortized cost method of valuation or penny rounding method of pricing as provided in
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the fund’s ability to maintain the stable price per share
established by the board of directors for the purpose of distribution, redemption and repurchase),
based upon specified hypothetical events that include, but are not limited to:

836

(A) Increases in the general level of short-term interest rates, in combination with various
levels of an increase in shareholder redemptions;
(B) A downgrade or default of particular portfolio security positions, each representing
various portions of the fund’s portfolio (with varying assumptions about the resulting loss in the
value of the security), in combination with various levels of an increase in shareholder
redemptions;
(C) A widening of spreads compared to the indexes to which portfolio securities are tied
in various sectors in the fund’s portfolio (in which a sector is a logically related subset of
portfolio securities, such as securities of issuers in similar or related industries or geographic
region or securities of a similar security type), in combination with various levels of an increase
in shareholder redemptions; and
(D) Any additional combinations of events that the adviser deems relevant.
(ii) A report on the results of such testing to be provided to the board of directors at its
next regularly scheduled meeting (or sooner, if appropriate in light of the results), which report
must include:
(A) The date(s) on which the testing was performed and an assessment of the money
market fund’s ability to have invested at least ten percent of its total assets in weekly liquid
assets and to minimize principal volatility (and, in the case of a money market fund using the
amortized cost method of valuation or penny rounding method of pricing as provided in
paragraph (c)(1) of this section to maintain the stable price per share established by the board of
directors); and
(B) An assessment by the fund’s adviser of the fund’s ability to withstand the events (and

837

concurrent occurrences of those events) that are reasonably likely to occur within the following
year, including such information as may reasonably be necessary for the board of directors to
evaluate the stress testing conducted by the adviser and the results of the testing. The fund
adviser must include a summary of the significant assumptions made when performing the stress
tests.
(h) Recordkeeping and reporting—(1) Written procedures. For a period of not less than
six years following the replacement of existing procedures with new procedures (the first two
years in an easily accessible place), a written copy of the procedures (and any modifications
thereto) described in this section must be maintained and preserved.
(2) Board considerations and actions. For a period of not less than six years (the first
two years in an easily accessible place) a written record must be maintained and preserved of the
board of directors’ considerations and actions taken in connection with the discharge of its
responsibilities, as set forth in this section, to be included in the minutes of the board of
directors’ meetings.
(3) Credit risk analysis. For a period of not less than three years from the date that the
credit risks of a portfolio security were most recently reviewed, a written record of the
determination that a portfolio security presents minimal credit risks and the designated NRSRO
ratings (if any) used to determine the status of the security as an eligible security, first tier
security or second tier security shall be maintained and preserved in an easily accessible place.
(4) Determinations with respect to adjustable rate securities. For a period of not less
than three years from the date when the assessment was most recently made, a written record
must be preserved and maintained, in an easily accessible place, of the determination required by

838

paragraph (g)(5) of this section (that a variable rate or floating rate security that is not subject to
a demand feature and for which maturity is determined pursuant to paragraph (i)(1), (i)(2) or
(i)(4) of this section can reasonably be expected, upon readjustment of its interest rate at all times
during the life of the instrument, to have a market value that approximates its amortized cost).
(5) Determinations with respect to asset-backed securities. For a period of not less than
three years from the date when the determination was most recently made, a written record must
be preserved and maintained, in an easily accessible place, of the determinations required by
paragraph (g)(6) of this section (the number of ten percent obligors (as that term is used in
paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(D) of this section) deemed to be the issuers of all or a portion of the assetbacked security for purposes of paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(D) of this section). The written record must
include:
(i) The identities of the ten percent obligors (as that term is used in paragraph
(d)(3)(ii)(D) of this section), the percentage of the qualifying assets constituted by the securities
of each ten percent obligor and the percentage of the fund’s total assets that are invested in
securities of each ten percent obligor; and
(ii) Any determination that an asset-backed security will not have, or is unlikely to have,
ten percent obligors deemed to be issuers of all or a portion of that asset-backed security for
purposes of paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(D) of this section.
(6) Evaluations with respect to asset-backed securities not subject to guarantees. For a
period of not less than three years from the date when the evaluation was most recently made, a
written record must be preserved and maintained, in an easily accessible place, of the evaluation
required by paragraph (g)(7) of this section (regarding asset-backed securities not subject to

839

guarantees).
(7) Evaluations with respect to securities subject to demand features or guarantees. For
a period of not less than three years from the date when the evaluation was most recently made, a
written record must be preserved and maintained, in an easily accessible place, of the evaluation
required by paragraph (g)(4) of this section (regarding securities subject to one or more demand
features or guarantees).
(8) Reports with respect to stress testing. For a period of not less than six years (the first
two years in an easily accessible place), a written copy of the report required under paragraph
(g)(8)(ii) of this section must be maintained and preserved.
(9) Inspection of records. The documents preserved pursuant to paragraph (h) of this
section are subject to inspection by the Commission in accordance with section 31(b) of the Act
(15 U.S.C. 80a-30(b)) as if such documents were records required to be maintained pursuant to
rules adopted under section 31(a) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-30(a)).

statement: “The Fund was required to disclose additional information about this event [or “these
events,” as appropriate] on Form N-CR and to file this form with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Any Form N-CR filing submitted by the Fund is available on the EDGAR
Database on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Internet site at http://www.sec.gov.”
(11) Processing of transactions. A government money market fund and a retail money
market fund (or its transfer agent) must have the capacity to redeem and sell securities issued by
the fund at a price based on the current net asset value per share pursuant to § 270.22c-1. Such
capacity must include the ability to redeem and sell securities at prices that do not correspond to
a stable price per share.
(i) Maturity of portfolio securities. For purposes of this section, the maturity of a
portfolio security shall be deemed to be the period remaining (calculated from the trade date or
such other date on which the fund’s interest in the security is subject to market action) until the
date on which, in accordance with the terms of the security, the principal amount must
unconditionally be paid, or in the case of a security called for redemption, the date on which the
redemption payment must be made, except as provided in paragraphs (i)(1) through (i)(8) of this
section:
(1) Adjustable rate government securities. A government security that is a variable rate
security where the variable rate of interest is readjusted no less frequently than every 397
calendar days shall be deemed to have a maturity equal to the period remaining until the next
readjustment of the interest rate. A government security that is a floating rate security shall be

843

deemed to have a remaining maturity of one day.
(2) Short-term variable rate securities. A variable rate security, the principal amount of
which, in accordance with the terms of the security, must unconditionally be paid in 397 calendar
days or less shall be deemed to have a maturity equal to the earlier of the period remaining until
the next readjustment of the interest rate or the period remaining until the principal amount can
be recovered through demand.
(3) Long-term variable rate securities. A variable rate security, the principal amount of
which is scheduled to be paid in more than 397 calendar days, that is subject to a demand feature,
shall be deemed to have a maturity equal to the longer of the period remaining until the next
readjustment of the interest rate or the period remaining until the principal amount can be
recovered through demand.
(4) Short-term floating rate securities. A floating rate security, the principal amount of
which, in accordance with the terms of the security, must unconditionally be paid in 397 calendar
days or less shall be deemed to have a maturity of one day, except for purposes of determining
WAL under paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section, in which case it shall be deemed to have a
maturity equal to the period remaining until the principal amount can be recovered through
demand.
(5) Long-term floating rate securities. A floating rate security, the principal amount of
which is scheduled to be paid in more than 397 calendar days, that is subject to a demand feature,
shall be deemed to have a maturity equal to the period remaining until the principal amount can
be recovered through demand.
(6) Repurchase agreements. A repurchase agreement shall be deemed to have a maturity

844

equal to the period remaining until the date on which the repurchase of the underlying securities
is scheduled to occur, or, where the agreement is subject to demand, the notice period applicable
to a demand for the repurchase of the securities.
(7) Portfolio lending agreements. A portfolio lending agreement shall be treated as
having a maturity equal to the period remaining until the date on which the loaned securities are
scheduled to be returned, or where the agreement is subject to demand, the notice period
applicable to a demand for the return of the loaned securities.
(8) Money market fund securities. An investment in a money market fund shall be treated
as having a maturity equal to the period of time within which the acquired money market fund is
required to make payment upon redemption, unless the acquired money market fund has agreed
in writing to provide redemption proceeds to the investing money market fund within a shorter
time period, in which case the maturity of such investment shall be deemed to be the shorter
period.
(j) Delegation. The money market fund’s board of directors may delegate to the fund’s
investment adviser or officers the responsibility to make any determination required to be made
by the board of directors under this section other than the determinations required by paragraphs
(a)(11)(i) (designation of NRSROs), (c)(1) (board findings), (c)(2)(i) and (ii) (determinations
related to liquidity fees and temporary suspensions of redemptions), (f)(2) (defaults and other
events), (g)(1) and (g)(2) (amortized cost and penny rounding procedures), and (g)(8) (stress
testing procedures) of this section.
(1) Written guidelines. The board of directors must establish and periodically review
written guidelines (including guidelines for determining whether securities present minimal

845

credit risks as required in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) and procedures under which the
delegate makes such determinations.
(2) Oversight. The board of directors must take any measures reasonably necessary
(through periodic reviews of fund investments and the delegate’s procedures in connection with
investment decisions and prompt review of the adviser’s actions in the event of the default of a
security or event of insolvency with respect to the issuer of the security or any guarantee or
demand feature to which it is subject that requires notification of the Commission under
paragraph (f)(3) of this section by reference to Form N-CR (§ 274.222 of this chapter)) to assure
that the guidelines and procedures are being followed.

§ 270.2a-7(a)(25), include the following statement:
You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Because the share price of the
Fund will fluctuate, when you sell your shares they may be worth more or less
than what you originally paid for them. The Fund may impose a fee upon sale of
your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund’s

849

liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other
factors. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund’s
sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you
should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at
any time.

and suspend redemptions consistent with the requirements of §§ 270.2a-7(c)(2)(i) and/or (ii)),
include the following statement:
You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund
seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it
cannot guarantee it will do so. The Fund may impose a fee upon sale
of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares
if the Fund’s liquidity falls below required minimums because of
market conditions or other factors. An investment in the Fund is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
or any other government agency. The Fund’s sponsor has no legal
obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should

850

not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund
at any time.
(C) If the Fund is a Money Market Fund that is a government Money Market Fund, as
defined in § 270.2a-7(a)(16), that is not subject to the requirements of §§ 270.2a-7(c)(2)(i)
and/or (ii) of this chapter pursuant to § 270.2a-7(c)(2)(iii) of this chapter, and that has not chosen
to rely on the ability to impose liquidity fees and suspend redemptions consistent with the
requirements of §§ 270.2a-7(c)(2)(i) and/or (ii)), include the following statement:
You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund
seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it
cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
any other government agency.

The Fund’s sponsor has no legal

obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not
expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at
any time.
Instruction. If an affiliated person, promoter, or principal underwriter of the Fund, or an
affiliated person of such a person, has contractually committed to provide financial support to the
Fund, and the term of the agreement will extend for at least one year following the effective date
of the Fund’s registration statement, the statement specified in Item 4(b)(1)(ii)(A), Item
4(b)(1)(ii)(B), or Item 4(b)(1)(ii)(C) may omit the last sentence (“The Fund’s sponsor has no
legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the
sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.”). For purposes of this

851

Instruction, the term “financial support” includes any capital contribution, purchase of a security
from the Fund in reliance on § 270.17a-9, purchase of any defaulted or devalued security at par,
execution of letter of credit or letter of indemnity, capital support agreement (whether or not the
Fund ultimately received support), performance guarantee, or any other similar action reasonably
intended to increase or stabilize the value or liquidity of the fund’s portfolio; however, the term
“financial support” excludes any routine waiver of fees or reimbursement of fund expenses,
routine inter-fund lending, routine inter-fund purchases of fund shares, or any action that would
qualify as financial support as defined above, that the board of directors has otherwise
