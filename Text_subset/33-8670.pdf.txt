THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
GRANTING A WAIVER OF THE
DISQUALIFICATION PROVISION
OF RULE 602(c)(3)

Respondents.
______________________________
Bear, Stearns & Co., Inc. (“BS&Co.”) and Bear, Stearns Securities Corp.
(“BSSC”) (together, “Respondents”) have submitted a letter, dated February 7, 2006,
requesting a waiver of the disqualification from the exemption under Regulation E under
the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) arising from the settlement of a cease–and–
desist and administrative proceeding commenced by the Commission. On March 16,
2006, pursuant to the Respondents’ Offer of Settlement, the Commission instituted an
Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings,
and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to Section 8A
of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, and Sections 9(b) and 9(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“OIP”) against
Respondents.
The OIP censures Respondents and finds that (1) BS&Co. willfully violated
Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 15(c), and 17(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rules 10b-5, 15c1-2, and 17a-3(a)(6)
thereunder, and willfully aided and abetted and caused violations of Section 17(a) of the
Securities Act, Sections 10(b), 15(c) and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5,
15c1-2, and 17a-3(a)(6) thereunder, and Rule 22c-1(a) as adopted under Section 22(c) of
the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“Investment Company Act”); (2) BSSC willfully
violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 15(c) and 17(a) of the Exchange
Act and Rules 15c1-2 and 17a–3(a)(6) thereunder, and Rule 22c-1(a) as adopted under
Section 22(c) of the Investment Company Act, and willfully aided and abetted and caused
violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 15(c) and 17(a) of the
Exchange Act and Rules 15c1-2 and 17a-3(a)(6) thereunder; (3) requires Respondents to
cease and desist from committing or causing violations and future violations of the
preceding provisions; (4) requires Respondents to pay, jointly and severally, $160 million

in disgorgement and a $90 million civil penalty; and (5) requires Respondents to comply
with certain undertakings.
Regulation E provides an exemption from registration under the Securities Act,
subject to certain conditions, for securities issued by certain small business investment
companies and business development companies. The Regulation E exemption is not
available for the securities of an issuer if, among other things, any investment adviser or
underwriter for the securities to be offered is subject to an order of the Commission
entered pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act. See Rule 602(c)(3) under the
Securities Act. The Commission may waive the disqualification upon a showing of good
cause. See Rule 602(e) under the Securities Act.
Based on the representations set forth in Respondents’ February 7, 2006 request,
the Commission has determined that, pursuant to Rule 602(e), a showing of good cause
has been made and that the request for a waiver of the disqualification should be granted.
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Rule 602(e) under the Securities
Act, that a waiver of the disqualification provision of Rule 602(c)(3) under the Securities
Act resulting from the entry of the OIP is hereby granted.

By the Commission.

Secretary
