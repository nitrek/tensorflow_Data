NOTICE OF PROPOSED
PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
AND OPPORTUNITY
FOR COMMENT

Notice is hereby given, pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s (“Commission”) Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.1103, that the Division of Enforcement has submitted to the Commission a proposed
plan for the distribution of monies placed into a Fair Fund established in the above-captioned
matter.
On December 18, 2013, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative
and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 203(e) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Making
Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”) 1 against
G-Trade Services LLC (“G-Trade”), ConvergEx Global Markets Limited (“CGM”), and
ConvergEx Execution Solutions LLC (“CES”) (collectively, “Respondents”). The Order
found that Respondents engaged in a fraudulent scheme to conceal their practice of unnecessarily
routing certain global trading and transition management customer orders to an offshore affiliate
in order to charge undisclosed mark-ups and mark-downs, in addition to disclosed commissions
on those orders. The Order found that Respondents willfully violated Section 10(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that
Respondents G-Trade and CES willfully violated Section 15(c)(1) of the Exchange Act. The
Commission ordered Respondents to pay disgorgement of $79,802,448, prejudgment interest
of $7,621,981, and a civil monetary penalty of $20,000,000, totaling $107,424,429. The
Order created a Fair Fund pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as
amended.
