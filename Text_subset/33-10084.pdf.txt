In the Matter of
TERRY M. DERU

ORDER VACATING NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED STATISTICAL RATING
ORGANIZATION AND MUNICIPAL ADVISOR BARS
Terry M. Deru seeks to vacate an administrative order, dated July 11, 2012 (the "Order"),
to the extent that it bars him from association with any nationally recognized statistical rating
organization ("NRSRO") or municipal advisor.1 The NRSRO and municipal advisor bars at
issue were imposed based solely on conduct occurring prior to July 22, 2010, the effective date
of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.2 Accordingly, in our
discretion, we vacate the Order to the extent it prohibits Terry M. Deru from associating with any
NRSRO or municipal advisor, but otherwise leave the Order unmodified.
By the Commission.
