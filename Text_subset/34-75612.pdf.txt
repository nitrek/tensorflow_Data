APPLICATIONS BY SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS OR MAJOR SECURITYBASED SWAP PARTICIPANTS FOR STATUTORILY DISQUALIFIED ASSOCIATED
PERSONS TO EFFECT OR BE INVOLVED IN EFFECTING SECURITY-BASED
SWAPS
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Proposed rule.
SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 15F(b)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(“Exchange Act”), as added by Section 764(a) of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”), the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“Commission”) is proposing Rule of Practice 194. Proposed Rule of Practice 194
would provide a process for a registered security-based swap dealer or major security-based
swap participant (collectively, “SBS Entity”) to make an application to the Commission for an
order permitting an associated person who is subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be
involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity. Proposed Rule of
Practice 194 also would exclude an SBS Entity, subject to certain limitations, from the
prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) with respect to associated persons that are not
natural persons (i) for a period of 30 days following the associated person becoming subject to a
statutory disqualification or 30 days following the person that is subject to a statutory
disqualification becoming an associated person of an SBS Entity; (ii) for a period of 180 days
following the filing of a complete application under proposed Rule of Practice 194 and notice if
the application and notice are filed within the same 30-day time period; and (iii) for a period of
180 days following the filing of a complete application with, or initiation of a process by, the

Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), a self-regulatory organization (“SRO”) or a
registered futures association pending a final decision with respect to an application or process
with respect to the associated person for the membership, association, registration or listing as a
principal, where the application has been filed or process started prior to or within the same 30day time period and a notice has been filed with the Commission within the same 30-day time
period. The proposed Rule of Practice 194 also would provide, in certain circumstances, for an
extension of the temporary exclusion from the prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6)
with respect to associated persons that are not natural persons to comply with the prohibition in
Section 15F(b)(6). Finally, proposed Rule of Practice 194 would provide that, subject to certain
conditions, an SBS Entity may permit an associated person that is subject to a statutory
disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on its behalf, without
making an application pursuant to the proposed rule, where the Commission, CFTC, an SRO or a
registered futures association has granted a prior application or otherwise granted relief from a
statutory disqualification with respect to that associated person.

BACKGROUND
Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6), as added by Section 764(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act,

makes it unlawful for an SBS Entity to permit an associated person 1 who is subject to a statutory
disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS
Entity if the SBS Entity knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, of the
statutory disqualification, “[e]xcept to the extent otherwise specifically provided by rule,
regulation, or order of the Commission.” 2 In this regard, Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) gives

1

Exchange Act Section 3(a)(70) generally defines the term “persons associated with” an
SBS Entity to include (i) any partner, officer, director, or branch manager of an SBS
Entity (or any person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions); (ii) any
person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with an
SBS Entity; or (iii) any employee of an SBS Entity. See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(70). The
definition generally excludes persons whose functions are solely clerical or ministerial.
Id. The definition of “person” under Exchange Act Section 3(a)(9) is not limited to
natural persons, but extends to both entities and natural persons. 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(9)
(“The term ‘person’ means a natural person, company, government, or political
subdivision, agent, or instrumentality of a government.”).

2

Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) provides: “Except to the extent otherwise specifically
provided by rule, regulation, or order of the Commission, it shall be unlawful for a
security-based swap dealer or a major security-based swap participant to permit any
person associated with a security-based swap dealer or a major security-based swap
participant who is subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in
effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the security-based swap dealer or major
security-based swap participant, if the security-based swap dealer or major security-based

the Commission the discretion to determine, by order, that a statutorily disqualified associated
person may effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of an SBS Entity,
and/or to establish rules concerning the statutory prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6).
To date, however, the Commission has not established a separate, more specific rule by
which an SBS Entity may apply to the Commission to permit an associated person who is subject
to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf
of the SBS Entity. This proposal, if adopted, would establish such a rule. The proposal would
specify the process for obtaining relief from the statutory prohibition in Exchange Act Section
15F(b)(6), including by setting forth the required showing, the form of application and the items
to be addressed with respect to associated persons that are natural persons and that are not natural
persons.
The proposal would provide a temporary exclusion from the prohibition in Exchange Act
Section 15F(b)(6) that would apply both to the case where (i) an associated person entity that is
already effecting or involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of an SBS Entity
becomes subject to a statutory disqualification, and (ii) an entity that is already subject to a
statutory disqualification becomes an associated person that is effecting or involved in effecting
security-based swaps on behalf of an SBS Entity. Specifically, an SBS Entity would be
temporarily excluded from the prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) with respect to
associated person entities (i) for a period of 30 days following the associated person becoming
subject to a statutory disqualification or 30 days following the person that is subject to a statutory
disqualification becoming an associated person of an SBS Entity; (ii) for a period of 180 days

swap participant knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, of the
statutory disqualification.” 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(b)(6).

following the filing of a complete application under proposed Rule of Practice 194 and notice if
the application and notice are filed within the same 30-day time period; and (iii) for a period of
180 days following the filing of a complete application with, or initiation of a process by, the
CFTC, an SRO 3 or a registered futures association with respect to the associated person for the
membership, association, registration or listing as a principal, where the application has been
filed or process started prior to or within the same 30-day time period and a notice is filed with
the Commission within the same 30-day period. The proposed Rule of Practice 194 also
provides, in certain circumstances, an extension of the temporary exclusion from the prohibition
in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) with respect to associated person entities to comply with the
prohibition in Section 15F(b)(6) in cases where the temporary exclusion expires or where there is
an adverse decision.
Finally, this proposal would provide that an SBS Entity may permit, subject to certain
conditions, an associated person (whether a natural person or an entity) that is subject to a
statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of
the SBS Entity, without making an application, where the Commission, CFTC, an SRO or a
registered futures association has granted a prior application or otherwise granted relief from a
statutory disqualification with respect to the associated person.

U.S.C. 78c(a)(26)) as “any national securities exchange, registered securities association,

of [the Exchange Act]) the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board established by
section 15B of this title.”

register with the Commission, as well as additional provisions related to registration. 4 In the
Registration Proposing Release, the Commission solicited comment on potentially developing an
alternative process, in accordance with Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6), to establish exceptions
to the statutory prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6). 5 In doing so, the Commission
noted that Section 15F(b)(6) expressly authorizes the Commission to establish exceptions to the
prohibition by rule, regulation or order. 6 The Commission also solicited comment on whether
the Commission should consider excepting entities from the statutory prohibition in Exchange
Act Section 15F(b)(6). 7
The Commission received one comment relevant to potentially developing an alternative
process to establish exceptions to Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6). 8 The commenter stated that,
based on the Commission’s definition of the phrase “involved in effecting,” SBS Entities could
have hundreds, if not thousands, of associated natural persons who will effect or will be involved
in effecting security-based swaps. 9 Moreover, the commenter stated that the definition of
“associated person” could be read to extend not just to natural persons, but also to non-natural
persons (e.g., entities) that are affiliates of SBS Entities. 10 As a result, the commenter stated,
prohibiting statutorily disqualified entities from effecting or being involved in effecting security-

based swaps could result in “considerable” business disruptions and other ramifications. 11
To address these concerns, the commenter stated that the Commission should narrow the
scope of the associated persons considered to be effecting or involved in effecting security-based
swaps, or, alternatively, exercise its statutory authority to grant exceptions to the general ban on
an SBS Entity from associating with a person subject to a statutory disqualification. 12
B.

Registration Adopting Release

Concurrent with the issuance of this proposing release, 13 the Commission is adopting
registration requirements for SBS Entities. 14 Several aspects of the adopted rules relate to the
statutory prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6). In particular, the Commission adopted
Exchange Act Rule 15Fb6-1, 15 which provides that, unless otherwise ordered by the
Commission, an SBS Entity, when it files an application to register with the Commission as a

On June 15, 2011, the Commission issued an order that, among other things, granted
temporary relief from compliance with Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6), and Exchange
Act Section 29(b), 15 U.S.C. 78cc(b), concerning enforceability of contracts that would
violate, among other provisions, Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6). See Temporary
Exemptions and Other Temporary Relief, Together With Information on Compliance

36305-07 (June 22, 2011) (“Temporary Exemptions Order”). Under the Temporary
Exemptions Order, persons subject to a statutory disqualification who were, as of July 16,
2011, associated with an SBS Entity and who effected or were involved in effecting
security-based swaps on behalf of such SBS Entity could continue to be associated with
an SBS Entity until the date upon which rules adopted by the Commission to register
SBS Entities became effective. The Commission will consider separately the expiration
date of the temporary relief.

security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, may permit an associated
person that is not a natural person and that is subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be
involved in effecting security-based swaps on its behalf, provided that the statutory
disqualification(s) under Exchange Act Section 3(a)(39)(A) through (F) 16 occurred prior to the
compliance date set forth in the Registration Adopting Release. SBS Entities seeking to avail
themselves of the relief for disqualified associated entities will have to provide a list of
disqualified associated entities, which will be made public by the Commission as part of the
registration application. 17
The Commission also adopted a requirement in Rule 15Fb6-2 that the Chief Compliance
Officer of an SBS Entity certify on Form SBSE-C that it has performed background checks on
all of its associated persons that are natural persons who effect or are involved in effecting
security-based swaps on its behalf, and neither knows, nor in the exercise of reasonable care
should have known, that any of its associated persons that effect or are involved in effecting
security-based swaps on its behalf are subject to a statutory disqualification, unless otherwise
specifically provided by rule, regulation or order of the Commission. 18
Finally, the Commission modified its guidance on the scope of the phrase “involved in

16

15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(39)(A) – (F). As stated in the Registration Adopting Release, we intend
for this description to parallel Exchange Act Section 3(a)(39). If Congress were to
amend the definition of statutory disqualification in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(39), we
believe it would be appropriate for the Commission to consider amending Exchange Act
Rule 15Fb6-2, 17 CFR 240.14Fb6-2, to assure that this description remains consistent
with the statutory definition. See Registration Adopting Release, at Note 63.

DISCUSSION
A.

Overview of Proposed Rule

The Commission is proposing Rule of Practice 194, which would provide a process by
which an SBS Entity could apply to the Commission for an order permitting an associated person
to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity where the
associated person is subject to a statutory disqualification 20 and is thereby otherwise prohibited
from effecting or being involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of an SBS Entity
under Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6). For the Commission to issue an order granting relief
under proposed Rule of Practice 194, an SBS Entity would be required to make a showing that it

19

Specifically, the Commission stated that the term “involved in effecting security-based
swaps” generally means engaged in functions necessary to facilitate the SBS Entity’s
security-based swap business, including, but not limited to the following activities:
(1) drafting and negotiating master agreements and confirmations; (2) recommending
security-based swap transactions to counterparties; (3) being involved in executing
security-based swap transactions on a trading desk; (4) pricing security-based swap
positions; (5) managing collateral for the SBS Entity; and (6) directly supervising persons
engaged in the activities described in items (1) through (5) above. See Registration
Adopting Release, at Section II.B.1.ii.

20

Under Exchange Act Rule 15Fb6-1, 17 CFR 240.15Fb6-1, unless otherwise ordered by
the Commission, an SBS Entity, when it files an application to register with the
Commission as a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant,
may permit an associated person that is not a natural person and that is subject to a
statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on its
behalf, provided that the statutory disqualification(s) under Exchange Act Section
3(a)(39)(A) through (F), 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(39)(A) – (F), occurred prior to the compliance
date set forth in the Registration Adopting Release, and provided that it identifies each
such associated person on Schedule C of Form SBSE, Form SBSE-A, or Form SBSEBD, as appropriate. As a result, at the time a security-based swap dealer or major
security-based swap participant submits an application to register as an SBS Entity, it
would not have to file an application with the Commission under proposed Rule of
Practice 194 with respect to an associated person entity that is subject to a statutory
disqualification that occurred prior to the compliance date set forth in the Registration
Adopting Release. See Registration Adopting Release, at Section II.B.1.i.

- 12

-

would be consistent with the public interest to permit the associated person to effect or be
involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity, notwithstanding the
statutory disqualification.
The rule would prescribe the form of application and the items to be addressed with
respect to an associated person that is a natural person or entity. The rule would also provide for
notice to the applicant in cases where the Commission staff anticipates making an adverse
recommendation to the Commission with respect to an application made pursuant to this rule. In
such cases, the applicant would be provided with a written statement of the reasons for the
Commission staff’s preliminary recommendation, and the applicant would have 30 days to
submit a written statement in response.
The Commission is also proposing paragraph (i) to proposed Rule of Practice 194, which
would provide that an SBS Entity shall be temporarily excluded from the prohibition in
Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) with respect to a statutorily disqualified associated person that
is not a natural person (i) for a period of 30 days following the associated person becoming
subject to a statutory disqualification or 30 days following the person that is subject to a statutory
disqualification becoming an associated person of an SBS Entity, (ii) for a period of 180 days
following the filing of a complete application under proposed Rule of Practice 194 and notice if
the application and notice are filed within the same 30-day time period; and (iii) for a period of
180 days following the filing of a complete application with, or initiation of a process by, the
CFTC, an SRO or a registered futures association with respect to the associated person for the
membership, association, registration or listing as a principal, where the application has been
filed or process started prior to or within the same 30-day time period and a notice has been filed
with the Commission within the same 30-day time period. Proposed Rule of Practice 194(i) also

- 13

-

provides in paragraphs (i)(1)(ii), (i)(1)(iii) and (i)(3) for an extension of the temporary exclusion
to comply with the statutory prohibition in Exchange Section 15F(b)(6).
In addition, the Commission is proposing paragraph (j) to Rule of Practice 194, which
provides that, where certain conditions are met, an SBS Entity would not need to file an
application under proposed Rule of Practice 194 to permit a statutorily disqualified associated
person to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity.
Specifically, paragraph (j) to proposed Rule of Practice 194 would allow an SBS Entity, subject
to certain conditions, to permit a statutorily disqualified associated person to effect or be
involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity without making an
application to the Commission, where the Commission, CFTC, an SRO (e.g., FINRA or a
national securities exchange), or a registered futures association (e.g., the National Futures
Association (“NFA”)) has granted a prior application or otherwise granted relief from a statutory
disqualification with respect to that associated person. In such cases where an SBS Entity meets
the requirements of proposed paragraph (j), the SBS Entity would be permitted to file notice with
the Commission (in lieu of an application).
B.

Consistency with Other Processes for Permitting Association
Notwithstanding a Statutory Disqualification or Other Bar

Under the federal securities laws, certain registered entities have various procedural
avenues to be able to associate, where warranted, with persons subject to a statutory
disqualification or other bar, including the Commission’s Rule of Practice 193 21 and Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) eligibility proceedings (under the process set forth in

21

17 CFR 201.193.

- 14

-

Exchange Act Rule 19h-1). 22 As detailed below in Section II.C, Proposed Rule of Practice 194
is modeled on these existing processes where persons can reenter the industry despite previously
being barred by the Commission or to associate with a member of an SRO notwithstanding a
statutory disqualification. Proposed Rule of Practice 194 would establish a procedural
framework that is similar to processes that are familiar to market participants.
1.

Rule of Practice 193

Rule of Practice 193 provides a process by which individuals that are not regulated by an
SRO (e.g., employees of an investment adviser, an investment company, or a transfer agent) can
seek to reenter the securities industry despite previously being barred by the Commission.23
The rule requires the filing of an affidavit from the individual, addressing, among other
items, (1) the time period since the imposition of the bar; (2) any restitution or similar action
taken by the individual to recompense any person injured by the misconduct that resulted in the
bar; (3) the individual’s employment during the period subsequent to imposition of the bar;
(4) the capacity or position in which the individual proposes to be associated; (5) the manner and
extent of supervision to be exercised over such individual and, where applicable, by such
individual and (6) any relevant courses, seminars, examinations or other actions completed by
the individual subsequent to imposition of the bar to prepare for his or her return to the securities

other entity that is not a member of an SRO, should be submitted directly to the
Commission pursuant to Rule 29 [current Rule 193]”).

Rule 193 also requires a written statement from the proposed employer, describing,
among other things, the terms and conditions of employment and the supervision to be exercised
over the barred individual. 25
2.

FINRA Eligibility Proceedings

Under Exchange Act Section 15A(g)(2), “[a] registered securities association may, and in
cases in which the Commission, by order, directs as necessary or appropriate in the public
interest or for the protection of investors shall, deny membership to any registered broker or
dealer, and bar from becoming associated with a member any person, who is subject to a
statutory disqualification.” 26 Consistent with that provision, Article III, Section 3 of the FINRA
By-Laws provides that no person shall be associated with a member, continue to be associated
with a member, or transfer association to another member if such person is or becomes subject to

Under Article III, Section 4 of the FINRA By-Laws, a person is subject to a “disqualification”
with respect to membership, or association with a member, if such person is subject to any
“statutory disqualification” as such term is defined in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(39). 28 Article

15A(g)(2), 30 under Article 3, Section 3(d) of the FINRA By-Laws, the FINRA Board may, in its
discretion approve the continuance in membership, and may also approve the association or
continuance of association of any person, if the FINRA Board determines that such approval is
consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. 31
The FINRA Rule 9520 Series sets forth procedures for a person to become or remain
associated with a member, notwithstanding the existence of a statutory disqualification, and for a
current member or person associated with a member to obtain relief from the eligibility or
qualification requirements of the FINRA By-Laws and rules. 32 A member (or new member
applicant) seeking to associate with a natural person subject to a statutory disqualification must
seek approval from FINRA by filing a Form MC-400 application. 33 Members (and new member
applicants) that are themselves subject to a disqualification that wish to obtain relief from the
eligibility requirements are required to submit a Form MC-400A application. 34
Where required, FINRA sends a notice or notification to the Commission of its proposal
to admit or continue the membership of a person or association with a member notwithstanding

19h-1 provides for Commission review of notices filed by SROs proposing to admit any person
to, or continue any person in, membership or association with a member, notwithstanding
statutory disqualification. However, Exchange Act Rule 19h-1(a)(2) 36 and (3) 37 provide that, for
certain persons, and in limited circumstances, a notice does not need to be filed. With respect to
certain persons subject to a statutory disqualification, under Exchange Act Rule 19h-1(a)(4), 38 an
SRO is required to furnish to the Commission a notification (containing less information than a
notice). Under Exchange Act Section 15A(g)(2), 39 where it is necessary or appropriate in the
public interest or for the protection of investors, the Commission may, by order, direct the SRO
to deny membership to any registered broker or dealer, and bar from becoming associated with a
member any person, who is subject to a statutory disqualification.

CFTC’s Approach to Associated Persons of
Swap Entities Subject to a Statutory Disqualification

The statutory prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) 40 is parallel to a statutory
35

17 CFR 240.19h-1.

36

Exchange Act Rule 19h-1(a)(2), 17 CFR 240.19h-1(a)(2), provides that a notice need not
be filed with the Commission, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 19h-1, regarding an
associated person subject to a statutory disqualification if the person’s activities with
respect to the member are solely clerical or ministerial in nature and such person does not
have access to funds, securities, or books and records.

37

Exchange Act Rule 19h-1(a)(3), 17 CFR 240.19h-1(a)(3), provides that a notice need not
be filed with the Commission, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 19h-1, regarding a person
or member subject to a statutory disqualification if the person or member proposed for
continued association or membership, respectively, satisfies the requirements of
Exchange Act Rule 19h-1(a)(3)(i)-(vi).

38

17 CFR 240.19h-1(a)(4). A notification must be filed if the person or member proposed
for continued association or membership, respectively, satisfies the requirements of

provision for a swap dealer or major swap participant (collectively “Swap Entity”) as set forth in
Section 4s(b)(6) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”). 41 With respect to statutorily
disqualified associated persons of Swap Entities, the CFTC, among other things:
•

Defined associated persons of Swap Entities to be limited to natural persons. 42 As a
result, the prohibition in Section 4s(b)(6) of the CEA 43 applies to natural persons
associated with a Swap Entity (not entities).

•

Adopted Regulation 23.22(b), permitting association with a Swap Entity with respect to a
person who is already listed as a principal, registered as an associated person of another
CFTC registrant, or registered as a floor broker or floor trader, notwithstanding that the
person is subject to a statutory disqualification under the CEA. 44 With respect to those

41

See 7 U.S.C. 6s(b)(6), which states, “Except to the extent otherwise specifically provided
by rule, regulation, or order, it shall be unlawful for a swap dealer or a major swap
participant to permit any person associated with a swap dealer or a major swap
participant who is subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in
effecting swaps on behalf of the swap dealer or major swap participant, if the swap dealer
or major swap participant knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known,
of the statutory disqualification.”

42

Specifically, the CFTC amended CEA Regulation 1.3(aa), 17 CFR 1.3(aa), which
generally defines the term “associated person” for purposes of entities registered with it,
to cover Swap Entities. Consequently, with respect to Swap Entities, the definition reads,
“(aa) Associated Person. This term means any natural person who is associated in any of
the following capacities with: . . . (6) A swap dealer or major swap participant as a
partner, officer, employee, agent (or any natural person occupying a similar status or
performing similar functions), in any capacity that involves: (i) The solicitation or
acceptance of swaps (other than in a clerical or ministerial capacity); or (ii) The
supervision of any person or persons so engaged.”

See Registration of Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants, 77 FR 2613, 2315 (Jan.

provides: “No swap dealer or major swap participant may permit a person who is subject
to a statutory disqualification under section 8a(2) or 8a(3) of the [CEA] to effect or be
involved in effecting swaps on behalf of the [Swap Entity], if the [Swap Entity] knows,
or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, of the statutory disqualification;

applicants and registrants statutorily disqualified from registration under CEA Section
8a(2), 8a(3) or 8a(4). 45 Under NFA Registration Rules 504(b)(2) and 507, the applicant
or registrant must show that, notwithstanding the existence of a statutory disqualification,
his registration would pose no substantial risk to the public. 46 Likewise, under CFTC
Regulation 3.60(b)(2)(i), (e)(1) and (2) 47 an applicant or registrant must show that
registration would not pose a substantial risk to the public despite the existence of the
statutory disqualification. 48
Provided, however, that the prohibition set forth in this paragraph (b) shall not apply to
any person listed as a principal or registered as an associated person of a futures
commission merchant, retail foreign exchange dealer, introducing broker, commodity
pool operator, commodity trading advisor, or leverage transaction merchant, or any
person registered as a floor broker or floor trader, notwithstanding that the person is
subject to a disqualification from registration under section 8a(2) or 8a(3) of the [CEA].”
17 CFR 23.22(b).

7 U.S.C. 12a(2), (3) or (4).

46

Specifically, under NFA Registration Rule 507(a)(1), in actions involving statutory
disqualification set forth in CEA Section 8a(2), 7 U.S.C. 12a(2), the applicant or
registrant must make a clear and convincing showing that, notwithstanding the existence
of the statutory disqualification, full or conditioned registration would not pose a
substantial risk to the public; under NFA Registration Rule 507(a)(2), in actions
involving statutory disqualification set forth in CEA Section 8a(3) or 8a(4), 7 U.S.C.
12a(3) or (4), the applicant or registrant must show by a preponderance of the evidence
that, notwithstanding the existence of the statutory disqualification, full or conditioned
registration would not pose a substantial risk to the public

17 CFR 3.60(b)(2)(i), (e)(1), (e)(2).

48

Under CFTC Regulation 3.60(e)(1), 17 CFR 3.60(e)(1), in actions involving statutory
disqualifications set forth in CEA Section 8a(2), 7 U.S.C. 12a(2), the applicant or
registrant must make a clear and convincing showing that full, conditioned or restricted
registration would not pose a substantial risk to the public despite the existence of the
statutory disqualification. Under CFTC Regulation 3.60(e)(2), 17 CFR 3.60(e)(2), in
actions involving statutory disqualifications set forth in CEA Section 8a(3) or 8a(4), 7
U.S.C. 12a(3) or (4), the applicant or registrant must make a showing by a preponderance
of the evidence that full, conditioned or restricted registration would not pose a
substantial risk to the public despite the existence of the statutory disqualification.

In addition, CFTC staff has issued no-action relief to Swap Entities that allows them to
permit a statutorily disqualified associated person to effect or be involved in effecting
swap transactions on behalf of a Swap Entity, provided that NFA provides notice to the
Swap Entity that, had the person applied for registration as an associated person, NFA
would have granted such registration. 49 NFA has established a process by which such
associated persons of Swap Entities may apply for relief from CEA Section 4s(b)(6). 50
C.

Proposed Rule of Practice 194
1.

Scope of the Rule

Proposed paragraph (a) defines the scope of proposed Rule of Practice 194, providing a
process for submitting applications by an SBS Entity seeking an order of the Commission
permitting an associated person that is subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be
involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity. The proposed rule
would allow an SBS Entity to voluntarily submit an application to the Commission to request an
order where an associated person of an SBS Entity is subject to a statutory disqualification and
thereby prohibited from effecting or being involved in effecting security based swaps on behalf
of the SBS Entity under Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6). 51
Notably, however, where the conditions set forth in proposed paragraph (j) are met, an
SBS Entity would not need to file an application under Rule of Practice 194 to permit a
statutorily disqualified associated person to effect or be involved in effecting security-based

swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity. In such instances, a more limited notification would be
required.
2.

Required Showing

Proposed paragraph (b) sets forth the required showing for an application under proposed
Rule of Practice 194. For the Commission to issue an order granting relief under proposed Rule
of Practice 194, the Commission would need to find that it would be consistent with the public
interest to permit the associated person of the SBS Entity who is subject to a statutory
disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS
Entity.
In meeting the burden of showing that permitting the associated person to effect or be
involved in effecting security based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity is consistent with the
public interest, the application and supporting documentation must demonstrate that the terms or
conditions of association, procedures, or proposed supervision (if the associated person is a
natural person), for an associated person are reasonably designed to ensure that the statutory
disqualification does not negatively impact upon the ability of the associated person to effect or
be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity in compliance with the
applicable statutory and regulatory framework. In addition to the items set forth in paragraphs
(d) and (f) of proposed Rule of Practice 194, the Commission would consider the nature of the
findings that resulted in the statutory disqualification in determining whether the association is
consistent with the public interest.
The Commission preliminarily believes that the public interest standard is appropriate
because it is consistent with the overall purpose of the Exchange Act, and specifically for
“transactions in securities . . . [to be] effected with a national public interest which makes it
necessary to provide for regulation and control of such transactions and of practices and matters
- 22

-

related thereto.” 52 By prohibiting an SBS Entity from allowing a statutorily disqualified
associated person from effecting or being involved in effecting security-based swap transactions,
absent Commission relief, we believe that Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) is designed to limit
the potential that associated persons who have engaged in certain types of “bad acts” will be able
to negatively impact the security-based swap market, and the participants and investors in that
market. However, Section 15F(b)(6) also specifically provides that the Commission can allow
SBS Entities to continue to permit such statutorily disqualified associated persons to effect or be
involved in effecting security-based swap transactions. The Commission preliminarily believes
that the public interest standard is intended to capture those situations where the risk of the
associated person engaging in security-based swap activity that may harm the market or the
participants in the market is mitigated. For example, other items including, but not limited to,
other misconduct in which the associated person may have engaged, the nature and disciplinary
history of the associated person and SBS Entity requesting such relief, and the supervision to be
accorded the associated person, would be relevant to the Commission’s consideration of whether
the risks of permitting such associated persons to effect or be involved in effecting securitybased swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity are sufficiently mitigated. The Commission
preliminarily believes that the public interest standard appropriately reflects this type of
analysis. 53
3.

Form of Application for Natural Persons and Entities

Proposed paragraphs (c) and (e) specify the form of the application to be submitted under
proposed Rule of Practice 194 for natural persons and entities (respectively). Proposed
52

See, e.g., Exchange Act Section 2, 15 U.S.C. 78b.

53

A public interest standard also is consistent with the standard in Rule of Practice 193.
See 17 CFR 201.193(c).

- 23

-

paragraphs (c) and (e) would require that each application with respect to an associated person
subject to a statutory disqualification shall be supported by a written statement, signed by a
knowledgeable person authorized by the SBS Entity, which addresses the items in proposed Rule
of Practice 194(d) and (f). 54
The Commission proposes that the SBS Entity (rather than the associated person) submit
the application, including by providing the signed written statement under proposed paragraphs
(c) and (e), for several reasons. First, the SBS Entity is the person that is subject to the
restrictions under Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6). Second, requiring an SBS Entity to submit
the written statement with respect to an associated person would reinforce, in certain
circumstances, the necessity of additional oversight by the SBS Entity over the associated person
that is subject to a statutory disqualification, as SBS Entities would determine what information
and documents to include in an application with respect to an associated person. 55 Third, as
specified below, the Commission is proposing to require information (e.g., concerning the
supervision by the SBS Entity over the associated person) that is within the possession of the
SBS Entity itself. 56

54

In addition to the information required in proposed paragraph (c) – (g), the Commission
reserves the right to request from the applicant supplementary information to assist in its
review. See proposed Rule of Practice 194, Appendix, paragraph (c), and Section
II.C.10, infra.

55

See proposed Rule of Practice 194, Appendix, paragraph (b).

56

In addition, requiring an SBS Entity to submit the application would provide a familiar
practice, as it is consistent with the current practice for SBS Entities that are registered
with FINRA under FINRA Form MC-400. In particular, under FINRA Form MC-400,
an application for a statutorily disqualified associated person who is a natural person of a
member firm is submitted by a member firm (not by the individual). See FINRA Form
MC-400, Note 33, supra; see also Self-Regulatory Organizations; Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority, Inc.; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change to Adopt FINRA
Rule 1113 (Restriction Pertaining to New Member Applications) and to Amend the
FINRA Rule 9520 Series (Eligibility Proceedings), Exchange Act Release No. 63933
- 24

-

The application would be filed pursuant to Rules of Practice 151, 152 and 153. 57 The
Commission believes filing pursuant to these rules would provide the Commission with the
information that it needs to assess an application under proposed Rule of Practice 194.
Proposed paragraphs (c) and (e) would require that the following exhibits be included
with an application to help the Commission assess whether it is consistent with the public
interest to allow the associated person to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps
on behalf of an SBS Entity:
•

Proposed paragraphs (c)(1) and (e)(1) would require a copy of the order or other
applicable document that resulted in the associated person being subject to a statutory
disqualification. The proposed requirement would help inform the Commission about the
nature of the conduct that led to the statutory disqualification. For example, in the event
that the statutory disqualification arose from misconduct relating to security-based swap
transactions in particular, or is otherwise investment-related, it may inform the
Commission’s decision of whether it is consistent with the public interest for the
associated person to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of
an SBS Entity.

•

Proposed paragraphs (c)(2) and (e)(2) would require an undertaking by the applicant to
notify the Commission promptly in writing if any information submitted in support of the

(Feb. 18, 2011), 76 FR 10629, 10630 (Feb. 25, 2011) (“A member (or new member
applicant) seeking to associate with a person subject to a disqualification must seek
approval from FINRA by filing a Form MC-400 application, pursuant to the FINRA Rule
9520 Series.”).
57

17 CFR 201.151, 201.152, 201.153. Rule of Practice 151, 17 CFR 201.151, concerns the
procedure for filing of papers with the Commission; Rule of Practice 152, 17 CFR
201.152, concerns the form of filing papers with the Commission; Rule of Practice 153,
17 CFR 201.153, concerns the signature requirement and effect of filing papers.

-

application becomes materially false or misleading while the application is pending. This
proposed requirement is designed to require that information provided by the applicant be
complete and accurate so that the Commission is provided the necessary information in
order to effectively evaluate the pending application.
•

Proposed paragraphs (c)(4) and (e)(5) would require a copy of any decision, order, or
document issued with respect to any proceedings 58 resulting in the imposition of
disciplinary sanctions or pending proceeding against the associated person by the
Commission, CFTC, any federal or state or law enforcement regulatory agency,
registered futures association, foreign financial regulatory authority, registered national
securities association, or any other SRO, or commodities exchange, or any court, that
occurred during the five years preceding the filing of the application pursuant to proposed
Rule of Practice 194. The Commission believes that the information required by this
proposed provision would be useful to assess the disciplinary history of the associated
person. The disciplinary history of the associated person subject to a statutory
disqualification provides the Commission with relevant information to help assess the
risk that the associated person may engage in future misconduct. The Commission is
requesting the underlying decision, order, or other document itself (as opposed to a
description or record of the decision), so that the Commission can directly review the

58

For purposes of providing the information requested by paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(5),
applicants should look to the definition of “proceeding” in Form SBSE, which states that
a “proceeding” includes “a formal administrative or civil action initiated by a
governmental agency, self-regulatory organization or a foreign financial regulatory
authority; a felony criminal indictment or information (or equivalent formal charge); or a
misdemeanor criminal information (or equivalent formal charge). Does not include other
civil litigation, investigations, or arrests or similar charges effected in the absence of a
formal criminal indictment or information (or equivalent formal charge).” See
Registration Adopting Release, at Section II.G.1, and Form SBSE.

- 26

-

materials to assess the disciplinary history of the associated person. Where the associated
person has a history of misconduct, in addition to the conduct that triggered the statutory
disqualification, the Commission generally would be less likely to find it in the public
interest to permit the associated person to effect or be involved in effecting securitybased swaps on behalf of an SBS Entity. In addition, this proposed requirement would
help inform the Commission of any pending proceedings against the associated person,
which may factor into the totality of the information when the Commission makes a
determination as to whether the associated person should be allowed to effect or be
involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity. In this context,
the Commission preliminarily believes that the five-year timeframe is appropriate. We
balanced the burden that may be imposed by requiring SBS Entities to provide older
materials and documents that may not be as readily available with our need to evaluate
the context and circumstances underlying the application.
In addition to the information above, proposed paragraph (c) of the proposed rule would
require that each application with respect to an associated person that is a natural person include
the following information and documents:
•

Proposed paragraph (c)(3) would require a copy of the questionnaire or application for
employment specified in Exchange Act Rule 15Fb6-2(b) with respect to the associated
person, 59 which would provide the Commission with basic background information
concerning the associated person, as well as the disciplinary history of the associated
person. Information concerning the disciplinary history of the associated person is
important because it may help the Commission assess the risk of future misconduct by

59

See Registration Adopting Release, at Section II.B.2.

- 27

-

the associated person.
Additionally, proposed paragraph (e) of the proposed rule would require that each
application with respect to an associated person that is not a natural person include the following
information and documents:
•

Proposed paragraph (e)(3) would require a copy of any organizational charts of the
associated person, if available. To the extent that the associated person employs any
natural persons subject to a statutory disqualification (which would be required to be
disclosed pursuant to paragraph (e)(6) of proposed Rule of Practice 194, discussed infra),
organizational charts would assist the Commission in assessing whether such natural
persons are supervising or being supervised by other natural persons that are also subject
to a statutory disqualification, whether directly (i.e., an immediate supervisor) or
indirectly. This information would assist the Commission in making its determination
because, for example, the concentration of statutorily disqualified natural persons in an
associated person entity could pose a greater risk of future misconduct by such associated
person entity.

•

Proposed paragraph (e)(4) would require a copy of policies and procedures relating to the
conduct resulting in the statutory disqualification that the associated person entity has in
place to ensure compliance with any federal or state securities laws, the CEA, the rules or
regulations thereunder, or the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, any
SRO, or any foreign regulatory authority, as applicable. Such information would help
inform the Commission as to whether the associated person entity has adequate policies
and procedures in place, to the extent applicable, to ensure compliance with the federal
securities laws or SRO rules. The information requested here is also consistent with the

- 28

-

statutory scheme, as violations of the statutes and regulations listed here may result in a
statutory disqualification under Exchange Act Section 3(a)(39). 60 Given that violations
of any of the statutes and regulations listed here may result in a statutory disqualification
under Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act, the Commission believes that information
about the associated person entity’s policies and procedures would help inform the
Commission as to steps taken to reduce the risk of further misconduct by the associated
person entity. In particular, the Commission believes that where the associated person
entity does not have sufficient policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with
applicable laws, rules and regulations, there is a greater risk that the entity will engage in
future misconduct.
•

Proposed paragraph (e)(6) would require the name of any natural persons employed by
the associated person that are subject to a statutory disqualification and would effect or be
involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity. For any such
natural person, the applicant should indicate whether the individual is an officer, partner,
direct or indirect owner of the associated person. Because an SBS Entity separately
would be required to seek relief under proposed Rule of Practice 194 for any such natural
persons to be able to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of
the SBS Entity, the application would only require a list of the names, not any further
information that would be included in those separate applications.
4.

Written Statement for Natural Persons and Entities

Proposed paragraphs (d) and (f) under Rule of Practice 194 set forth the items to be
addressed for applications with respect to natural persons and entities (respectively). Each of the
60

See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(39); 15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(4).

- 29

-

items in proposed paragraphs (d) and (f) would be addressed in the written statement required by
proposed paragraphs (c) and (e). The Commission believes that the items listed are important to
help the Commission assess whether it would be consistent with the public interest to allow the
associated person subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting
security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity.
•

Proposed paragraphs (d)(1) and (f)(2) would require an applicant to address the
associated person’s compliance with any order resulting in the statutory disqualification,
including whether the associated person has paid fines or penalties, disgorged monies,
made restitution or paid any other monetary compensation required by any such order.
Whether an associated person has complied in full with any order resulting in the
statutory disqualification (including with all monetary penalties imposed) could be
relevant to assessing whether it is consistent with the public interest to allow the
associated person to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of
an SBS Entity. This information could be relevant because the Commission believes that
it generally would not be consistent with the public interest to issue an order granting
relief under proposed Rule of Practice 194 with respect to persons that have failed to
abide by the terms of a prior order resulting in a statutory disqualification. The
Commission believes that the failure to comply with an order resulting in the statutory
disqualification may be relevant for assessing the risk of whether an associated person
subject to a statutory disqualification may engage in future misconduct.

•

Proposed paragraphs (d)(3) and (f)(3) would require the applicant to address the capacity
or position in which the associated person subject to a statutory disqualification proposes
to be associated with the SBS Entity. In addressing the capacity or position in which the

- 30

-

associated person subject to a statutory disqualification proposes to be associated with the
SBS Entity, the applicant should provide a description of the proposed duties and
responsibilities of the associated person. An associated person effecting or “involved in
effecting” 61 security-based swaps on behalf of an SBS Entity may operate in a varied
range of capacities or positions, each presenting different risks. As a result, the
information requested by paragraphs (d)(3) and (f)(3) would provide information about
the nature of the activity that the associated person will be providing for the SBS Entity,
and thus may help the Commission assess whether the associated person is engaging in
activities that may create greater risks to SBS Entities, counterparties or other persons. In
the event a prior application has been submitted with respect to the associated person, as
set forth in proposed paragraph (g) to proposed Rule of Practice 194, the SBS Entity
should describe in what manner the association will differ, if at all, from the association
in any such prior application.
•

Proposed paragraphs (d)(6) and (f)(6) would require the applicant to describe the
compliance and disciplinary history, during the five years preceding the filing of the
application, of the SBS Entity. In addition to the description of the compliance and
disciplinary history, the applicant may provide any relevant documentation during the
five years preceding the filing of the application, including, but not be limited to, the
disclosure reporting pages on Forms SBSE, SBSE-A and SBSE-BD 62 for the SBS Entity
with respect to events occurring, along with any letters of caution, deficiency letters or

similar documents received from the Commission, an SRO or other law enforcement or
regulatory agency. The Commission believes that information regarding the compliance
and disciplinary history of the SBS Entity could be useful to the Commission in assessing
the risk that the associated person subject to a statutory disqualification may engage in
future misconduct. In cases where an associated person subject to a statutory
disqualification will be employed at an SBS Entity with significant compliance and
disciplinary issues during the five years preceding the filing of an application under
proposed Rule of Practice 194, the Commission would consider, among other things
noted in this rule, the nature of the conduct that resulted in the statutory disqualification
in determining whether the association is consistent with the public interest. In this
context, the Commission preliminarily believes that the five-year timeframe is
appropriate. We balanced the burden that may be imposed by requiring SBS Entities to
provide older materials and documents that may not be as readily available with our need
to evaluate the circumstances underlying the application.
•

Proposed paragraphs (d)(9) and (f)(5) would require a detailed statement of why the
associated person should be permitted to effect or be involved in effecting security-based
swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity, including what steps the associated person or
applicant have taken, or will take, to ensure that the statutory disqualification does not
negatively impact upon the ability of the associated person to effect or be involved in
effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity in compliance with the
applicable statutory and regulatory framework. This proposed requirement is designed to
provide an opportunity for an applicant to provide a narrative or rationale to explain why
it is consistent with the public interest to allow the associated person to effect or be

- 32

-

involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity.
•

Proposed paragraphs (d)(10) and (f)(7) would require an applicant to discuss whether,
during the five years preceding the filing of the application, the associated person has
been involved in any litigation concerning investment or investment-related activities 63 or
whether there are there any unsatisfied judgments outstanding against the associated
person concerning investment or investment-related activities, to the extent not otherwise
covered by proposed paragraph (d)(9); if so, the applicant should provide details
regarding such litigation or unsatisfied judgments. The Commission believes information
concerning such litigation may factor into the totality of the information when the
Commission makes a determination as to whether the associated person should be
allowed to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS
Entity. Information concerning unsatisfied judgments outstanding against the associated
person concerning investment or investment-related activities may help inform the
Commission as to whether the associated person subject to a statutory disqualification has
abided by any judgment or order, or has failed to compensate persons as required by a
court or other relevant authority. In this context, the Commission preliminarily believes
that the five-year timeframe is appropriate. We balanced the burden that may be imposed
by requiring SBS Entities to provide older information that may not be as readily

63

For purposes of providing the information requested by paragraphs (d)(10) and (f)(7),
applicants should look to the definition of “investment or investment-related” in Form
SBSE, which states that “investment or investment-related” includes “pertaining to
securities, commodities, banking, savings association activities, credit union activities,
insurance, or real estate (including, but not limited to, acting as or being associated with a
broker-dealer, municipal securities dealer, government securities broker or dealer, issuer,
investment company, investment adviser, futures sponsor, bank, security-based swap
dealer, major security-based swap participant, savings association, credit union, insurance
company, or insurance agency).” See Registration Adopting Release, Form SBSE.

available with our need to evaluate the circumstances underlying the application.
•

Proposed paragraphs (d)(11) and (f)(8) would require any other information that the
applicant believes to be material to the application. This provision is designed to require
an applicant to provide all information that likely will be material to the Commission’s
consideration of an application under proposed Rule of Practice 194, notwithstanding that
such information may not be specifically required by the rule. This provision also is
designed to provide the applicant with an opportunity to provide any additional
information that the applicant believes is important to the Commission’s consideration of
the SBS Entity’s application under proposed Rule of Practice 194, but that is not
specifically required by the rule.
In addition to the items discussed above, proposed paragraph (d) of the proposed rule

would require applications with respect to natural persons to address the following items:
•

Proposed paragraph (d)(2) would require the applicant to address the associated person’s
employment during the period subsequent to the issuance of the statutory disqualification.
Where the associated person subject to a statutory disqualification has been employed
without issue since the conduct resulting in the statutory disqualification, that fact may be
relevant to the Commission’s assessment as to whether it would be consistent with the
public interest for the person to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on
behalf of an SBS Entity.

•

Proposed paragraph (d)(4) would require the applicant to describe the terms and
conditions of employment and supervision to be exercised over the associated person
and, where applicable, by such associated person. The Commission is proposing this
requirement so that the Commission will be able to better assess the extent to which the

- 34

-

terms and conditions of employment and supervision may create or mitigate the risk that
the associated person subject to a statutory disqualification may engage in future
misconduct. Moreover, the Commission is proposing to require that the applicant
describe any supervision to be exercised by the associated person because the
Commission believes that there could be a greater risk of harm where an associated
person that is subject to a statutory disqualification has greater supervisory
responsibilities, or is supervising another person that is also subject to a statutory
disqualification. In the event a prior application has been submitted with respect to the
associated person, as set forth in proposed paragraph (g) to proposed Rule of Practice
194, the SBS Entity should describe in what manner the terms and conditions of
employment and supervision will differ, if at all, from the supervision in any such prior
application.
•

Proposed paragraph (d)(5) would require the applicant to list the qualifications,
experience, and disciplinary history64 of the proposed supervisor(s) of the associated
person. This provision is designed to assist the Commission in considering the capacity
of the supervisor to oversee the associated person subject to a statutory disqualification in

64

Disciplinary history would include, for example, the items contained in Exchange Act
Rule 17a-3(a)(12)(i)(D) – (G), 17 CFR 240.17a-3(a)(12)(i)(D) – (G), which items are
required to be collected by broker-dealers with respect to their associated persons and are
required to be provided on Form U-4. Such items include, among other things, a record
of any disciplinary action taken, or sanction imposed, upon the associated person by any
federal or state agency, or national securities exchange or national securities association,
a record of any permanent or temporary injunction entered against the associated person,
or a record of any arrest or indictment for any felony or certain specified types of
misdemeanors. See also Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements for Security-Based
Swap Dealers, Major Security-Based Swap Participants, and Broker-Dealers; Capital
Rule for Certain Security-Based Swap Dealers, Exchange Act Release No. 71958 (Apr.

assessing whether the supervision of a person is likely to minimize the risk of future
misconduct by the associated person. The Commission believes that the qualifications
and experience of the supervisor of an associated person subject to a statutory
disqualification has a bearing on the potential for future misconduct by that person.
•

Proposed paragraph (d)(7) would require the applicant to list the names of any other
associated persons at the SBS Entity who have previously been subject to a statutory
disqualification, and whether they are to be supervised by the associated person.
Proposed Rule of Practice 194(d)(7) is designed to assist the Commission in assessing
whether there could be a greater risk of misconduct where an associated person that is
subject to a statutory disqualification is working directly with or is supervising another
person that is subject to a statutory disqualification.

•

Proposed paragraph (d)(8) would require the applicant to address whether the associated
person has taken any relevant courses, seminars, examinations or other actions
subsequent to becoming subject to a statutory disqualification to prepare for his or her
participation in the security-based swap business. The information provided by proposed
paragraph (d)(8) would inform the Commission as to whether the associated person has
taken steps to apprise himself of relevant obligations under the federal securities or other
laws or regulations, and, as a result, may factor into the Commission’s decision as to
whether it would be consistent with the public interest for the person to effect or be
involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of an SBS Entity.
In addition to the items discussed above, proposed paragraph (f) of the proposed rule

would require applications with respect to persons that are not natural persons to address the
following items:

- 36

-

•

Proposed paragraph (f)(1) would require general background information about the
associated person, including (i) the number of employees, (ii) the number and location of
offices, (iii) the type(s) of business(es) in which the associated person is engaged; and
(iv) the SRO memberships and effective dates of such membership of the associated
person, if applicable. This requirement would assist the Commission in understanding
the business of the associated person, including determining what SROs, if any, oversee
the associated person. The Commission believes that obtaining basic background
information about the firm would aid the Commission in understanding the entity that is
an associated person, and therefore aid in its assessment of whether it is in the public
interest to permit the associated person to effect or be involved in effecting securitybased swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity.

•

Proposed paragraph (f)(4) would require a description of whether, with respect to the
statutory disqualification and the sanctions imposed, the associated person was ordered to
undertake any changes to its organizational structure or policies and procedures set forth
in proposed Rule of Practice 194(e)(4), and to the extent that such changes were
mandated, to describe what changes were mandated and whether the associated person
has implemented them. This proposed requirement may aid the Commission in assessing
whether the applicant has made changes to mitigate the occurrence of any future conduct
that may result in statutory disqualification.
5.

Prior Applications or Processes

Proposed paragraph (g) would require an applicant to provide as part of the application
any order, notice or other applicable document reflecting the grant, denial or other disposition
(including any dispositions on appeal) of any prior application concerning the associated person

- 37

-

under proposed Rule of Practice 194 and other similar processes. 65 This provision is designed to
inform the Commission when a similar application made with respect to the associated person
has been granted or denied (or been subject to some other disposition).
Information concerning the grant or denial (or other disposition) of a prior application or
other request for relief, and the reasons for the grant or denial, may be relevant to the
Commission’s assessment as to whether it would be consistent with the public interest for the
person to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of an SBS Entity. For
example, in the event that a prior application has been granted, but the terms and conditions of
employment with the other registrant are materially different from the SBS Entity, the
Commission could consider whether the terms and conditions at the SBS Entity that are different
may result in any greater risk of future misconduct. In addition, if a prior application has been
denied the Commission may take into consideration the prior application or request for relief in
its determination of whether permitting an associated person to effect or be involved in effecting
security based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity would be consistent with the public interest to
grant an application under Rule of Practice 194. Notably, under such circumstances (i.e., a
denial or where the terms and conditions of employment are not the same), an SBS Entity could
not avail itself of paragraph (j) of proposed Rule of Practice 194 66 and therefore would be
required to file an application under proposed Rule of Practice 194 in order to permit an
associated person subject to a statutory disqualification to be able to effect or be involved in
effecting security-based swaps on behalf of an SBS Entity.

65

In cases where a statutorily disqualified person was formerly associated with another SBS
Entity, an applicant should use reasonable efforts to obtain relevant documentation from
the other SBS Entity.

registered face-amount certificate company where, among other things: (1) that person
(or an affiliated person) within ten years has been convicted of any felony or
misdemeanor involving the purchase or sale of any security or arising out of such
person’s conduct as an underwriter, broker, dealer, investment adviser, or in other
specified categories; or (2) that person (or an affiliated person), by reason of any
misconduct, has been permanently or temporarily enjoined by order, judgment, or decree

associated person of a member, notwithstanding the existence of a statutory
disqualification. For example, for broker-dealers, where FINRA has granted or denied an
application for consent to be a member or an associated person of a member, or to
continue to be a member or an associated person of a member, notwithstanding the
statutory disqualification, the applicant would provide such information to the
Commission in accordance with proposed paragraph (g)(4).

Proposed paragraph (g)(5) would require an applicant to provide any order, notice or

dispositions on appeal) of any prior process concerning the associated person by the
CFTC or a registered futures association for listing as a principal, or for registration,
including as an associated person, notwithstanding the existence of a statutory
disqualification. Specifically, paragraph (g)(5) would provide as follows:

would be required to provide any order or other applicable document providing that
the associated person may be listed as a principal, registered as an associated person
of another CFTC registrant, or registered as a floor broker or floor trader,

Proposed paragraph (g)(5)(ii) addresses the CFTC and NFA’s current process for
granting relief from CEA Section 4s(b)(6), 76 the provision that is parallel to Exchange
Act Section 15F(b)(6), with respect to persons that are not exempt from that provision
pursuant to CFTC Regulation 23.22(b). 77 Under that process, available through noaction relief granted by CFTC staff, a Swap Entity may make an application to NFA
to permit an associated person of a Swap Entity subject to a statutory disqualification
to effect or be involved in effecting swaps on behalf of the Swap Entity. NFA will
provide notice to a Swap Entity whether or not NFA would have granted the person
registration as an associated person. 78 Proposed paragraph (g)(5)(ii) would require
the SBS Entity to submit any determination by NFA (the sole registered futures
association 79) with respect to that grant of no-action relief.

Notification to Applicant and Written Statement

Proposed paragraph (h) governs the procedure where there is an adverse recommendation
proposed by the Commission staff with respect to an application under proposed Rule of Practice
194. Consistent with Rule of Practice 193(e), 80 proposed Rule of Practice 194(h) would provide
that where there is such an adverse recommendation, the applicant shall be so advised and
provided with a written statement by the Commission staff of the reasons for such
recommendation.
Under proposed paragraph (h), Commission staff would be required to provide a written
statement for the reasons for an adverse recommendation. Consistent with Rule of Practice
193(e), 81 the applicant would then have 30 days to submit to the Commission a written statement
in response. This proposed provision is designed to give an applicant an opportunity to directly
address an adverse recommendation by Commission staff and to assist the Commission’s
evaluation of applications under proposed Rule of Practice 194.

Where the Commission does not or cannot make the determination that it is in the public interest
to permit the associated person of the SBS Entity to effect or be involved in effecting securitybased swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity, the Commission would issue an order denying the

Temporary Exclusion for Other Persons

Proposed paragraph (i) would provide for temporary relief from the statutory prohibition
in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) with respect to associated persons that are not natural persons
and that are subject to a statutory disqualification. Proposed paragraph (i) is designed to address
the situation where an operating SBS Entity becomes subject to the statutory prohibition in
Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) 83 with respect to an associated person that is not a natural
person—either as a result of an associated person that effects or is involved in effecting securitybased swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity becoming subject to a statutory disqualification, or as a
result of a person that is subject to a statutory disqualification becoming an associated person
effecting or involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity. 84
As noted in a separate release adopting registration rules for SBS Entities, the scope of
the prohibition in Section 15F(b)(6) of the Exchange Act covers a wide range of actions, given
the definitions of statutory disqualification and associated person, and the meaning of “involved
in effecting” a security-based swap transaction, and the conduct that led to a statutory
82

However, a notice pursuant to paragraph (i)(2) to proposed Rule of Practice 194 would be
made publicly available on the Commission’s website. See Section II.C.8, infra.

83

15 U.S.C. 78o-10(b)(6).

84

As stated in Section I.B, supra, the Commission has separately adopted Exchange Act
Rule 15Fb6-1, 17 CFR 240.15Fb6-1, which provides that unless otherwise ordered by the
Commission, an SBS Entity, when it files an application for registration as an SBS
Entity, may permit a person associated with such SBS Entity that is not a natural person
and that is subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting
security-based swaps on its behalf, provided that the statutory disqualification(s) occurred
prior to the compliance date set forth in the Registration Adopting Release. SBS Entities
seeking to avail themselves of this provision will have to provide a list of disqualified
associated entities, which will be made public by the Commission as part of the
registration application.

- 43

-

disqualification may pertain to management practices that occurred a long time ago or acts
engaged in by personnel that are no longer employed by the associated person. 85 A commenter
to the Registration Proposing Release stated that prohibiting statutorily disqualified entities from
effecting or being involved in effecting security-based swaps could result in “considerable”
business disruptions and other ramifications. 86
The Commission is concerned about the potential for business disruption to SBS Entities,
and disruption to the security-based swap market, if SBS Entities engaged in the business must
either cease operations, even temporarily, due to not being able to utilize the services of their
associated entities, or move services to another entity that may not be as equipped to handle them
pending a determination by the Commission on their application for relief under proposed Rule
of Practice 194 or pending a determination by another regulator for similar relief. 87 Therefore, to
provide for a fair and orderly process when an SBS Entity files an application with respect to
associated person entities pursuant to proposed Rule of Practice 194, the Commission
preliminarily believes that it is appropriate to provide a temporary exclusion, subject to certain
limitations and conditions, to allow an SBS Entity to permit an associated person entity that is
subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps
on its behalf pending a determination by the Commission or other regulatory body. In such

85

See Registration Adopting Release, at Section II.B.1.i.

86

See 12/16/11 SIFMA Letter, at 8, Note 8, supra.

87

Proposed Rule of Practice 194(j) provides that, subject to certain conditions, an SBS
Entity may permit an associated person that is subject to a statutory disqualification to
effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on its behalf, without making an
application pursuant to the proposed rule, where the Commission, CFTC, an SRO or a
registered futures association has granted a prior application or otherwise granted relief
from a statutory disqualification with respect to that associated person. See proposed
Rule of Practice 194(j) and Section II.C.9, infra.

- 44

-

cases, SBS Entities may consider implementing safeguards pending a determination by the
Commission or other regulatory body to ensure that the statutory disqualification does not
negatively impact upon the ability of the associated person to effect or be involved in effecting
security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity in compliance with the applicable statutory and
regulatory framework.
The Commission preliminarily believes that the approach in proposed Rule of Practice
194(i) would appropriately consider the potentially competing objectives of minimizing the
likelihood for business or market disruption while maintaining strong investor protections. In
particular, while the rule would provide targeted relief with respect to associated person entities,
it would not provide relief with respect to associated persons who are natural persons. The
Commission believes that replacing, even temporarily, a natural person performing a particular
security-based swap function would not create the same practical issues as with moving the
services provided by an associated person entity to another entity. 88 Further, associated persons
that are natural persons are the persons responsible for actually performing or overseeing the
functions necessary to effect security-based swap activities. As such, the Commission
preliminarily does not believe the scope of proposed Rule of Practice 194(i) should be extended
to cover associated persons that are natural persons.
Under proposed paragraph (i)(1)(i), an SBS Entity would be temporarily excluded from
the prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) with respect to an associated person that is
not a natural person (1) for 30 days following the associated person becoming subject to a

88

For example, we believe that moving the cash and collateral management services from
one entity to another would have a much more significant impact on the ability of the
SBS Entity to operate than assigning a different natural person to negotiate and execute
security-based swap transactions. See Registration Adopting Release, at Section II.B.1.i.

- 45

-

statutory disqualification, or (2) 30 days following the person that is subject to a statutory
disqualification becoming an associated person of an SBS Entity. 89 This provision is designed to
provide an applicant with an initial time period to determine whether the applicant should file an
application (or a notice in lieu of an application pursuant proposed paragraph (j)) with the
Commission under proposed Rule of Practice 194, and to afford the applicant sufficient time to
gather the materials for, draft, and file an application with respect to that associated person. The
Commission preliminarily believes that allowing longer than 30 days would permit the
associated person that is subject to a statutory disqualification to continue to effect or be
involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity for too long a period of
time without filing an application or notice under proposed Rule of Practice 194. Moreover, the
Commission believes that an SBS Entity should be able to submit an application or notice within
30 days, as the information requested should already be readily available or accessible to the

89

Because a person would not become an associated person of an SBS Entity until the
entity itself becomes a security-based swap dealer or a major security-based swap
participant pursuant to the Commission’s rules (see 17 CFR 240.3a67-8, 240.3a67-9,
240.3a71-2), proposed paragraph (i) to Rule of Practice 194 would not apply until such
time as the relevant entity is first deemed to be either a security-based swap dealer or a
major security-based swap participant. For example, a person whose security-based swap
dealing activity crosses a de minimis threshold contained in Exchange Act Rule 3a71-2
(17 CFR 240.3a71-a) would not be deemed to be a security-based swap dealer until the
earlier of the date on which it submits a complete application for registration pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 15F(b), 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(b), or two months after the end of the
month in which that person becomes no longer able to take advantage of the de minimis
exception. Therefore, the SBS Entity would be able to rely on the temporary exclusion
contained in proposed paragraph (i) to Rule of Practice 194 if the SBS Entity is
associated with any entity that is subject to a statutory disqualification that effects or is
involved in effecting security-based swaps on its behalf if: (1) the entity has filed a
complete application with the Commission to become registered with the Commission as
an SBS Entity within the time periods specified in the applicable Commission rules; and
(2) the entity has filed a complete application under proposed Rule of Practice 194 within
30 days from the date on which it filed its application with the Commission to become
registered as an SBS Entity.

SBS Entity.
Under proposed paragraph (i)(1)(ii), the SBS Entity would be excluded from the
prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) with respect to the associated person for 180 days
following the filing of a complete application and notice pursuant to proposed Rule of Practice
194 by the SBS Entity if the application and notice is filed within the time period specified in
proposed paragraph (i)(1)(i) (i.e., 30 days), or until such time the Commission makes a
determination on such application within the 180-day time period. The Commission
preliminarily believes that 180 days should provide a sufficient maximum amount of time for the
Commission to review the application, including obtaining any supplementary information from
the applicant, and any recommendation by Commission staff and any response thereto by the
applicant, and to make a determination on the application. The Commission anticipates that
many applications under proposed Rule of Practice 194 will be instances where the Commission
has not previously reviewed or acted on the underlying conduct by the associated person entity
that resulted in the statutory disqualification. As such, the 180-day time period would afford the
Commission a sufficient maximum amount of time to appropriately evaluate an application
under proposed Rule of Practice 194.
Proposed paragraph (i)(1)(ii) does not limit the Commission from making a
determination on the application prior to the expiration of the 180-day time period, and the
Commission anticipates that it would do so as appropriate. 90 The Commission may act sooner in
cases, for example, where the misconduct of an associated person is already familiar to the
Commission or otherwise conducive to immediate consideration. The Commission may also

90

The Commission expects that it will expeditiously process applications and take
necessary steps to facilitate timely action.

need to act quickly if there are imminent concerns regarding potential investor or counterparty
harm.
While we expect that most applications could be acted upon within the proposed 180-day
time period, a decision could be delayed for a number of reasons, such as when an application
raises complex issues associated with the Commission’s determination whether to grant
permanent relief from the statutory prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6). Proposed
paragraph (i)(1)(ii) thus would address the situation where the Commission does not render a
decision on the Rule of Practice 194 application within the 180-day time period. Specifically,
proposed paragraph (i)(1)(ii) provides that where the Commission does not render a decision
within 180 days following the filing of an application under proposed Rule of Practice 194, the
SBS Entity would have 60 additional days to conform its activities to comply with the
prohibition set forth in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6). As a result, the proposed rule would
provide that if the Commission does not act on the application within 180 days, the statutory
prohibition would apply.
As noted, Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) prohibits SBS Entities from permitting
associated persons that are subject to a statutory disqualification from effecting or being involved
in effecting security-based swap transactions on behalf of the SBS Entity, except to the extent
otherwise provide by rule, regulation or order of the Commission. The Commission is proposing
to provide in paragraph (i)(1)(ii) that, if the Commission does not act on the application within
the specified time period, the statutory prohibition would apply (subject to a 60-day period to
provide an SBS Entity time to conform its activities to the statutory prohibition, as discussed
below). The Commission preliminarily believes that in the context of this statutory framework,
the proposed time period provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii) is appropriately tailored. In

- 48

-

proposing to proceed in this manner and provide a period of time for the exception from the
prohibition to continue, the Commission has taken into consideration the potential for the risk of
market and business disruptions and the objective of maintaining strong investor and market
protections, as discussed above. We preliminarily believe that the approach has taken into
consideration these factors. 91 We note that it would also provide an SBS Entity certainty about
the applicable process and time frames, including the 60 additional days to comply, as discussed
below.
Proposed paragraph (i)(1)(ii) also would provide that where the Commission does not
render a decision within 180 days, the SBS Entity would have 60 additional days to comply with
the prohibition set forth in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6). This provision is designed to
provide the applicant, where the Commission does not act on an application under proposed Rule
of Practice 194 within 180 days and the SBS Entity becomes immediately subject to the statutory
prohibition set forth in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6), sufficient time to implement any
structural or other changes necessary to ensure that the SBS Entity would not have the associated
person that is subject to a statutory disqualification effect or be involved in effecting securitybased swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity. The 60-day time period is designed to provide the SBS
Entity a sufficient amount of time to make any structural or other changes necessary to ensure
compliance with the prohibition set forth in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) to avoid disruption,
but not so long as to continue to allow an SBS Entity to permit an associated person that is
subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps
on behalf of the SBS Entity for longer than necessary to avoid potential market or business
disruptions.
91

See Sections V.D and E, infra.

Under proposed paragraph (i)(1)(iii), the SBS Entity would be excluded from the
prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) for a period of 180 days following the filing of a
complete application with, or initiation of a process by, 92 the CFTC, an SRO or a registered
futures association with respect to the associated person for the membership, association,
registration or listing as a principal, where such application has been filed or process started prior
to or within the time period specified in paragraph (i)(1)(i) and a notice has been filed with the
Commission within the time period specified in proposed paragraph (i)(1)(i). This provision is
designed to provide a temporary exclusion to an SBS Entity such that an SBS Entity could avail
itself of filing a notice in lieu of an application, as set forth in proposed paragraph (j), and thus
would provide temporary relief to the SBS Entity from the prohibition set forth in Exchange Act
Section 15F(b)(6) during the pendency of an application or process by the CFTC, an SRO or a
registered futures association. As with the provisions of proposed paragraph (i)(1)(ii) with
regard to the Commission’s consideration of an application under proposed Rule of Practice 194,
this provision is designed to address the Commission’s concerns about potential market or
business disruptions while the SBS Entity has an application or process pending before the
CFTC, an SRO or a registered futures association with regard to the associated person subject to
a statutory disqualification. The Commission preliminarily believes that 180 days should
generally provide a sufficient amount of time for the CFTC, an SRO or a registered futures
association to make a determination on the application, and would also be consistent with the
time period proposed in paragraph (i)(1)(ii).

92

The commencement of the 180-day time period would begin at the time of filing of an
application with an SRO (e.g., Form MC-400A) or the initiation of a proceeding under
NFA Registration Rule 504 (e.g., a Notice of Intent to Revoke Registration) or CFTC
Regulation 3.60, 17 CFR 3.60.

- 50

-

In addition, under proposed paragraph (i)(1)(iii), where the CFTC, an SRO or a registered
futures association does not render a decision or renders an adverse decision with respect to the
associated person within the 180-day time period, the SBS Entity would have 60 additional days
to conform its activities to comply with the prohibition set forth in Exchange Act Section
15F(b)(6). Similar to proposed paragraph (i)(1)(ii), this provision is aimed at preventing market
or business disruptions that may result from the scenario where the CFTC, an SRO or a
registered futures association does not render a decision or renders an adverse decision with
respect to the associated person within the 180-day time period, and the SBS Entity therefore
becomes immediately subject to the statutory prohibition set forth in Exchange Act Section
15F(b)(6). The 60-day time period is designed to provide the SBS Entity a sufficient amount of
time to make any structural or other necessary changes to ensure compliance with the prohibition
set forth in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6), but not so long as to continue to allow an SBS
Entity to permit an associated person that is subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be
involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity for longer than necessary
to avoid potential market or business disruptions where the CFTC, an SRO or registered futures
association has not made a decision or has rendered an adverse decision within the 180-day time
period.
The SBS Entity would not be able to avail itself of the temporary exclusion set forth in
proposed paragraph (i)(1) in two circumstances. First, the temporary exclusion from the
prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) would not be available where the Commission
has otherwise ordered—for example, where the Commission, by order, has censured, placed
limitations on the activities or functions of the associated person, or suspended or barred such
person from being associated with an SBS Entity. Second, the temporary exclusion from the

- 51

-

prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) would not be available in cases where the
Commission, CFTC, an SRO or a registered futures association has previously denied
membership, association, registration or listing as a principal with respect to the associated
person that is the subject of the pending application. In both circumstances, the Commission,
CFTC, an SRO or registered futures association will have affirmatively made a determination to
not allow an associated person to participate in the financial industry. The Commission
preliminarily believes that, in such cases, the SBS Entity should not be able to avail itself of the
temporary exclusion with respect to the associated person because doing so would enable an
associated person to participate in the security-based swap market notwithstanding that the
Commission or another regulator has otherwise prohibited the associated person from
participating in another sector of the financial industry.
Proposed paragraph (i)(2) would provide that an SBS Entity would be excluded from the
statutory prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) 93 as provided in proposed paragraph
(i)(1)(ii) and (i)(1)(iii) only where the SBS Entity has filed (within the 30-day timeframe) a
notice with the Commission setting forth the name of the SBS Entity and the name of the
associated person that is subject to a statutory disqualification, and attaching as an exhibit to the
notice a copy of the order or other applicable document that resulted in the associated person
being subject to a statutory disqualification. 94 The Commission proposes to make publicly
available on its website the notice provided under proposed paragraph (i)(2). The Commission is
proposing to require such notice to help inform market participants of the fact that an SBS Entity
is availing itself of the temporary exclusion set forth in proposed paragraph (i) with respect to an

93

15 U.S.C. 78o-10(b)(6).

94

See proposed Rule of Practice 194(c)(1), (e)(1); Section II.C.3, supra.

- 52

-

associated person entity subject to a statutory disqualification that is effecting or involved in
effecting security-based swaps on behalf of an SBS Entity.
The Commission is not proposing to require such notice with respect to associated
persons that are natural persons, because natural persons would not be able to avail themselves of
the temporary exclusion proposed in paragraph (i). As a result, a natural person that is subject to
a statutory disqualification would not be permitted to effect or be involved in effecting securitybased swaps on behalf of an SBS Entity while an application is pending. Additionally, where the
association, registration or listing as a principal has been granted or otherwise approved with
respect to an associated person that is a natural person by the Commission, CFTC, an SRO or
registered futures association, notwithstanding that the associated person is subject to a statutory
disqualification, such an order or other relevant document would be made publicly available, 95
and thus would provide information to market participants with respect to the associated person
and the statutory disqualification.
Proposed paragraph (i)(3) would provide that where the Commission denies an
application pursuant to proposed Rule of Practice 194 with respect to an associated person that is
not a natural person, the Commission may provide by order an extension of the exclusion
provided for in proposed paragraph (i)(1)(ii) as is necessary or appropriate to allow the applicant
to comply with the prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6). Under this proposed
provision, the Commission would extend the temporary exclusion provided for in proposed
paragraph (i)(1)(ii) where the Commission determines that doing so is necessary or appropriate.
The Commission believes that proposed paragraph (i)(3) provides the Commission with
sufficient flexibility so that the Commission may determine, based on its discretionary review of
95

See Section II.C.7, supra.

- 53

-

the particular facts and circumstances with respect to an application, whether or not it is
necessary or appropriate to extend the temporary exclusion provided for in proposed paragraph
(i)(1)(ii). For example, under certain circumstances, the Commission may determine that is
necessary or appropriate to provide a certain amount of time for an SBS Entity to wind down
operations with an associated person entity that is subject to a statutory disqualification in order
to avoid disruptions to the security-based swaps business of the SBS Entity or to the securitybased swap market. In other instances, there may not be a risk of market or business disruptions
in the event that an SBS Entity is prohibited from permitting an associated person entity to effect
or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity. In such instances,
the Commission may specify in an order denying an application under proposed Rule of Practice
194 that no extension of the exclusion provided for in proposed paragraph (i)(1)(ii) would be
necessary or appropriate.
Although the Commission is proposing paragraph (i)(1) at this time, the Commission is
also soliciting comment on two alternative approaches with respect to this provision. First, the
Commission solicits comment on whether proposed paragraph (i)(1)(ii) should alternatively
provide that, if the Commission does not render a decision within the appropriate time frame, the
application shall be deemed granted. Under this alternative, the Commission would consider the
extent to which providing that the application would be deemed granted if the Commission does
not act in the 180-day time period would help to avoid potential market and business disruptions
that may result when the temporary exclusion expires after day 180 (as opposed to providing a
60-day conformity period). The Commission would also consider how such an approach would
impact counterparty and investor protection in cases where the Commission has not made a
specific finding that it is consistent with the public interest to permit a statutorily disqualified

- 54

-

associated person entity to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of an
SBS Entity.
Second, the Commission solicits comment on whether, alternatively, the Commission
should provide an exclusion to permit an SBS Entity to allow associated person entities subject
to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf
of SBS Entities. As noted in Section II.B.3, the CFTC has defined associated persons of Swap
Entities to be limited to natural persons, 96 which results in the application of Section 4s(b)(6) of
the CEA 97 to natural persons associated with a Swap Entity (not entities). As a result, this
alternative would result in consistency with the CFTC. As with the first alternative, under this
alternative, the Commission would take into consideration the extent to which the approach, by
providing an exclusion from the statutory prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) with
respect to associated person entities, would minimize potential disruptions to the business of SBS
Entities that could lead to possible market disruption. The Commission would also consider how
this approach, which would apply the statutory prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) to
associated persons that are natural persons, but not to associated person entities, would impact
counterparty and investor protection. 98
9.

Notice in Lieu of an Application

Paragraph (j) of proposed Rule of Practice 194 would limit the applicability of the
prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) by prescribing the conditions under which an
96

See Note 42, supra.

97

See 7 U.S.C. 6s(b)(6).

98

Moreover, although SBS Entities would be excluded from the statutory prohibition in
Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) with respect to associated person entities under this
alternative, the Commission nonetheless could, by order, censure, place limitations on the
activities or functions of the associated person, or suspend or bar such person from being
associated with an SBS Entity. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(l)(3).

- 55

SBS Entity may permit a person associated with it that is subject to a statutory disqualification to
effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on its behalf without being required to
file an application under Rule of Practice 194. 99 Generally, proposed paragraph (j) would permit
associated persons that are subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in
effecting security-based swaps on behalf of SBS Entities where the Commission or other
regulatory authority previously reviewed the matter and permitted the person subject to a
statutory disqualification to be a member, associated with a member, registered or listed as a
principal of a regulated entity notwithstanding statutory disqualification.
Under the proposed rules, the Commission, the CFTC, an SRO or a registered futures
association will have specifically reviewed the underlying basis for the statutory disqualification
and made an affirmative finding to grant or otherwise approve membership, association,
registration or listing as a principal, notwithstanding the statutory disqualification. So long as the
terms and conditions are adhered to in the context of the association with the SBS Entity, the
Commission believes it would not be necessary for the Commission (other than in cases where
the person is subject to a Commission bar) to re-examine an event for which relief has already
been granted. The Commission further notes, consistent with the CFTC in adopting an
analogous provision in Regulation 23.22(b), 100 that it would generally be anomalous for a person
to be able to engage in securities transactions with members of the retail public—for example, as
99

See proposed Rule of Practice 194(j).

100

In adopting Regulation 23.22(b), the CFTC stated that, if it did not provide an exception
as suggested, a person could be permitted to direct futures-related activities or solicit
futures-related business with members of the retail public—e.g., as, respectively, a
principal or associated person of futures commission merchant or commodity pool
operator —but that same person would be barred from soliciting, accepting, or otherwise
effecting or being involved in effecting swaps transactions with significantly more
sophisticated clients as an associated person of a Swap Entity. See CFTC Registration
Release, 77 FR at 2615.

-

an associated person of a broker-dealer—but be prohibited from effecting or being involved in
effecting security-based swap transactions with significantly more sophisticated clients as an
associated person of a SBS Entity.
Specifically, subject to the conditions specified in proposed paragraph (j)(2), proposed
Rule of Practice of Practice 194(j)(1) would provide as follows:
Proposed Rule of Practice 194(j)(1)(i) would permit a person associated with an SBS
Entity that is subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting securitybased swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity where the person has admitted to or continued in
membership, or participation or association with a member, of an SRO, such as FINRA,
notwithstanding that such person is subject to a statutory disqualification under Exchange Act
Section 3(a)(39). 101
Proposed Rule of Practice 194(j)(1)(ii) would permit a person associated with an SBS
Entity that is a natural person and that is subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be
involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity where the person has
been granted consent to associate pursuant to Rule of Practice 193. 102 As stated in Section
II.B.1, supra, Rule of Practice 193 provides a process by which persons that are not regulated by
an SRO (e.g., employees of an investment adviser, an investment company, or a transfer agent)
can seek to reenter the securities industry despite previously being barred by the Commission.
Proposed Rule of Practice 194(j)(1)(iii) would permit a person associated with an SBS
Entity that is subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security101

See 17 CFR 240.19h-1. As discussed in Section II.B.2, supra, Exchange Act Rule 19h-1
prescribes the form and content, and provides for Commission review of proposals
submitted by SROs to allow a member or associated person subject to a statutory
disqualification to become or remain a member or associated person of a member.

based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity where an application has previously been granted under
proposed Rule of Practice 194 with respect to the associated person. For example, proposed
paragraph (j)(1)(iii) would include instances where an SBS Entity had previously received
approval of an application under proposed Rule of Practice 194 with respect an associated
person, and the same person becomes an associated person of a different SBS Entity
Proposed Rule of Practice 194(j)(1)(iv) would permit a person associated with an SBS
Entity to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity
where, notwithstanding the a statutory disqualification under CEA Sections 8a(2) or 8a(3), 103 the
person (1) has been registered as or listed as a principal of a futures commission merchant, retail
foreign exchange dealer, introducing broker, commodity pool operator, commodity trading
advisor, or leverage transaction merchant, registered as an associated person of any of the
foregoing, registered as or listed as a principal of a swap dealer or major swap participant, or
registered as a floor broker or floor trader, and (2) is not subject to a Commission bar pursuant to
Sections 15(b), 15B, 15E, 15F or 17A of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o(b), 78o-4, 78o-7,
78o-10, 78q-1), Section 9(b) of the Investment Company Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-9(b)) or Section
203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b-3(f)). This provision is designed
to exclude from scope of the statutory prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) persons
that have previously been permitted to be registered or listed as a principal by the CFTC or the
NFA, notwithstanding that such persons are subject to a statutory disqualification, including
those persons that fall within the scope of the exclusion in CFTC Regulation 23.22(b) (thereby
harmonizing the approach of the Commission with the CFTC in that respect). 104 However, the

103

7 U.S.C. 12a(2), (3).

104

See Sections II.B.3 and II.C.5, supra, concerning CFTC Regulation 23.22(b), 17 CFR
- 58

-

provision would exclude instances where the Commission itself has made an affirmative
determination to bar or suspend the associated person. In such cases, the Commission believes
that it should be afforded an opportunity to review an application with regard to such barred
person or during the pendency of the suspension in cases where an SBS Entity requests relief
from the statutory prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6). 105
Paragraph (j)(2) of proposed Rule of Practice 194 would set forth the conditions
necessary for an SBS Entity to meet in order to permit an associated person that is subject to a
statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of
the SBS Entity. An SBS Entity seeking to rely on proposed Rule of Practice 194(j)(1) would
have to meet all of the conditions specified in proposed paragraph (j)(2).
Under proposed paragraph (j)(2)(i), all matters giving rise to a statutory disqualification
under Exchange Act Section 3(a)(39)(A) through (F) must have been subject to an application or
process where the membership, association, registration or listing as a principal has been granted
or otherwise approved by the Commission, CFTC, an SRO or registered futures association.
This provision is designed to ensure that either the Commission, CFTC, an SRO (e.g., FINRA)
or a registered futures association (i.e., NFA) has specifically reviewed the underlying basis for
each and every statutory disqualification under Exchange Act Section 3(a)(39)(A) through (F), 106

23.22(b). Under the proposed rule, such relief would not be available in cases where a
registered futures association has made a determination that, had the associated person
applied for registration as an associated person of an SBS Entity, notwithstanding a
statutory disqualification, the application would have been granted. See CFTC Staff NoAction Letter, supra Note 49, at 5-8.
105

A suspension remains in effect for a period not exceeding twelve months. Once the
suspension is lifted, the person is not deemed to be subject to a statutory disqualification,
and thus would not need to apply to the Commission to reassociate.

15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(39)(A) – (F).

and made an affirmative finding to permit or continue the membership, association, registration
or listing as a principal, notwithstanding the statutory disqualification. For example, the mere
fact that an associated person is permitted to effect or be involved in effecting swaps on behalf of
a Swap Entity because of the applicability of the exclusion in CFTC Regulation 23.22(b) would
not, by itself, allow the associated person of the SBS Entity to effect or be involved in effecting
security-based swaps on its behalf. Rather, the CFTC or NFA must have reviewed all matters
giving rise to a statutory disqualification for purposes of Exchange Act Section 3(a)(39)(A)
through (F). 107 The Commission believes that it is consistent with investor protection to provide
an exclusion for an SBS Entity from the statutory prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6)
where an appropriate regulatory authority has previously affirmatively considered and granted
relief with respect to the conduct underlying each statutory disqualification of an associated
person of the SBS Entity.
Proposed Rule of Practice 194(j)(2)(ii) would provide that an SBS Entity may permit a
person associated with it that is subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in
effecting security-based swaps on its behalf, without filing an application under proposed Rule of
Practice 194, only where the terms and conditions of the association with the SBS Entity are the
same in all material respects as those approved in connection with the prior order, notice or other
applicable document granting the membership, association, registration or listing as a principal
provided for in paragraph (j)(1). In short, to obtain relief from the statutory prohibition in
Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6), the associated person of the SBS Entity must be subject to the

107

For example, an associated person of an SBS Entity could potentially be subject to a
statutory disqualification for purposes of Exchange Act Section 3(a)(39)(A) through (F),
but not for purposes of CEA Section 8a(2) or (3). Compare 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(39)(A) –
(F), 7 U.S.C. 12a(2), (3).

same terms and conditions—including, for example, supervisory requirements—as those
previously imposed by the agency, an SRO or a registered future association (i.e., the
Commission, CFTC, NFA or SRO). 108
The Commission is proposing this provision so that an associated person subject to a
statutory disqualification remains subject to the same terms and conditions with respect to the
SBS Entity. For example, where relief previously granted by FINRA includes specific
supervisory requirements following an eligibility proceeding, but a person is not subject to the
same requirements by the SBS Entity, the Commission believes that it should review whether the
terms and conditions of the association with the SBS Entity are appropriate under an application
under proposed Rule of Practice 194.
Proposed Rule of Practice 194(j)(2)(iii) would provide that, where an SBS Entity seeks
for an associated person that is a natural person to be permitted to effect or be involved in
effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity without filing an application pursuant
to proposed Rule of Practice 194(j), the SBS Entity would be required to file a notice with the
Commission. Specifically, proposed Rule of Practice 194(j)(2)(iii) would require the following
information in the notice:
•

The name of the SBS Entity; 109

•

The name of the associated person subject to a statutory disqualification; 110

•

The name of the associated person’s prospective supervisor(s) at the SBS Entity; 111

•

The place of employment for the associated person subject to a statutory

disqualification; 112 and
•

The identity of any agency, SRO or registered futures association that has indicated its
agreement with the terms and conditions of the proposed association, registration or
listing as a principal. 113
The Commission believes that the information requested by the notice under proposed

paragraphs (j)(2)(iii) would aid the Commission and its staff in assessing risk at SBS Entities,
including for examination purposes. By knowing the name of the SBS Entity, name and location
of the associated person subject to a statutory disqualification, and the name of the supervisor of
the associated person, the Commission will obtain information that may be useful for
examination purposes, such as determining whether to examine a particular SBS Entity and
whom to speak to at the SBS Entity. The identity of an agency, SRO or registered futures
association that has indicated its agreement with the terms and conditions of the proposed
association could be useful to the Commission because the Commission staff could use the
information to confer with or seek information from that agency, SRO or registered futures
association, if necessary.
Proposed Rule of Practice 194(j)(2)(iv) would provide that, where an SBS Entity seeks
for an associated person that is not a natural person to be permitted to effect or be involved in
effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity without filing an application pursuant
to proposed Rule of Practice 194(j), the SBS Entity would be required to file a notice with the
Commission. Specifically, proposed Rule of Practice 194(j)(2)(iv), would require the following
information in the notice:

The Commission believes that knowing the name of the statutorily disqualified associated

person would aid the Commission and its staff in assessing risk at SBS Entities, including for
examination purposes. Additionally, the identity of an agency, SRO or registered futures
association that has indicated its agreement with the terms and conditions of the proposed
association could be useful to the Commission because the Commission staff could use the
information to confer with or seek information from that agency, SRO or registered futures
association, if necessary.
10.

Note to Proposed Rule of Practice 194

The proposed Note, which is similar to the Preliminary Note to Rule of Practice 193, is
designed to advise applicants of the importance of having adequate supervision in place at the
SBS Entity so as to minimize the risk of subsequent occurrences of misconduct.
In particular, the Note to proposed Rule of Practice 194 would provide that:
•

An application made pursuant to the rule must show that it would be consistent with the
public interest to permit the associated person of the SBS Entity to effect or be involved

-

in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity. 117
•

The nature of the supervision that an associated person will receive or exercise as an
associated person with a registered entity is an important matter bearing upon the public
interest. The Commission believes that this statement would inform applicants that
associated persons that are subject to a statutory disqualification should have adequate
supervision so as to prevent potential future harm to counterparties, SBS Entities
themselves, or other persons. The Commission would generally be less likely to issue an
order granting relief under Rule of Practice 194 where the associated person subject to a
statutory disqualification is not subject to adequate supervision. 118 Second, there may be
an increased risk of harm to counterparties, the SBS Entity and other market participants
where the associated person subject to a statutory disqualification supervises other
persons—in particular, where the supervision is over other persons that are also subject to
a statutory disqualification.

•

In meeting the burden of showing that permitting the associated person to effect or be
involved in effecting security based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity is consistent with
the public interest, the application and supporting documentation must demonstrate that
the terms or conditions of association, procedures, or proposed supervision (if the

1987), 48 S.E.C. 697, 700-01 (1987) (“In light of Shupack’s record, including the
misrepresentation contained in his original Rule 29 [the predecessor to Rule of Practice

associated person is a natural person), are reasonably designed to ensure that the statutory
disqualification does not negatively impact upon the ability of the associated person to
effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity in
compliance with the applicable statutory and regulatory framework. The Commission is
proposing to include this statement to advise applicants of the importance of these items
to the Commission’s consideration of whether to grant relief.
•

Normally, the applicant’s burden of demonstrating that permitting the associated person
to effect or be involved in effecting security based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity is
consistent with the public interest will be difficult to meet where the associated person is
to be supervised by, or is to supervise, another statutorily disqualified individual. The
Commission is proposing to include this statement because the Commission believes that
there may be a greater risk of harm where a person that is subject to a statutory
disqualification is supervising another person that is subject to a statutory
disqualification.

•

Where the associated person wishes to become the sole proprietor of a registered entity
and thus is seeking that the Commission issue an order permitting the associated person
who is subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting securitybased swaps on behalf of an SBS Entity notwithstanding an absence of supervision, the
applicant’s burden will be difficult to meet. The Commission is proposing to include this
statement because, as stated, the Commission believes that there is a greater risk of harm
where the associated person subject to a statutory disqualification is not subject to
adequate supervision.

•

The associated person may be limited to association in a specified capacity with a

- 65

-

particular registered entity and may also be subject to specific terms and conditions. The
Commission is proposing to include this statement to advise applicants that the
Commission may consider whether to impose limitations on permitting an associated
person subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting securitybased swap transactions on behalf of an SBS Entity. Those terms and conditions may
concern, for example, heightened supervisory conditions or other procedures with respect
to the associated person subject to a statutory disqualification.
Finally, the proposed Note discusses various procedural aspects of proposed Rule of
Practice 194, including the following:
•

In addition to the information specifically required by the rule, applications with respect
to natural persons should be supplemented, where appropriate, by written statements of
individuals who are competent to attest to the associated person’s character, employment
performance, and other relevant information. This statement is designed to encourage
applicants to provide written statements from individuals other than the applicant and the
associated person, to help the Commission better assess whether issuing an order granting
relief under proposed Rule of Practice 194 is consistent with the public interest.

•

In addition to the information required by the rule, the Commission staff may request
additional information to assist in the Commission’s review. This statement is designed
to inform applicants that the Commission staff may request additional information
beyond that provided by the SBS Entity in its application. For example, where the
information contained in an application raises additional questions regarding the nature of
the conduct resulting in the statutory disqualification, the capacity or position of the
associated person, or the terms and conditions of the association with the SBS Entity, the

- 66

-

Commission staff may request additional information to assist in the review of the
pending application.
•

Intentional misstatements or omissions of fact may constitute criminal violations of 18
U.S.C. 1001, et seq. and other provisions of law. This proposed statement is designed to
help ensure that the Commission receives accurate information in connection with an
application under Proposed Rule of Practice 194. In addition, providing a misstatement
in an application would weigh against a finding that providing relief by the Commission
under Rule of Practice 194 would be consistent with the public interest.

•

The Commission will not consider any application that attempts to reargue or collaterally
attack the findings that resulted in the statutory disqualification. This statement is
designed to advise applicants that Rule of Practice 194 may not be used as an appeals
process for the underlying findings. The Commission notes there are other appropriate
avenues for challenging decisions.

III.

REQUEST FOR COMMENT
The Commission is requesting comment regarding all aspects of proposed Rule of

Practice 194, including any investor protection or other concerns. The Commission particularly
requests comment from entities that intend to register as SBS Entities and that anticipate making
an application under proposed Rule of Practice 194, were it to be adopted, as well as
counterparties to such SBS Entities. This information will help inform the Commission’s
consideration of the appropriate process through which SBS Entities could seek relief from the
prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6). 119
The Commission also seeks comment on the particular questions below. The
119

15 U.S.C. 78o-10(b)(6).

- 67

-

Commission will carefully consider all comments and information received, and will benefit
especially from detailed responses.
Q-1. Is it necessary for the Commission to have a rule that specifies the process, such as
that proposed in Rule of Practice 194, for SBS Entities to seek relief for their associated persons
who are subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-based
swaps? Why or why not?
Q-2. How many SBS Entities are likely to submit applications pursuant to the proposed
rule? Please specify the number of applications that would likely relate to an associated person
that is a natural person versus an entity.
Q-3. Should the Commission make its determination based on whether it would be
consistent with the public interest to permit the person associated with the SBS Entity who is
subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps
on behalf of the SBS Entity? Should the Commission adopt a different standard of review? If
so, what should it be, and why?
Q-4. Should the Commission look to Rule of Practice 193 and FINRA Forms MC-400
and MC-400A in establishing the form of application in proposed Rule of Practice 194? Please
explain why or why not. In addition, if the Commission should not model the proposed rule on
Rule of Practice 193 or FINRA Forms MC-400 and MC-400A, what alternatives (if any) should
the Commission consider and why?
Q-5. Is the information requested in proposed Rule of Practice 194(c) for natural persons
appropriate? Should the Commission request any additional information? If so, what items?
Please explain the reasons for excluding any information or including any additional
information, as well as the costs and benefits of doing so.

- 68

-

Q-6. With respect to the requirement in proposed Rule of Practice 194(c)(1) and (e)(1) to
provide a copy of the order or other applicable document that resulted in the associated person
being subject to a statutory disqualification, is there information other than that which would be
contained in such order or other applicable document that the Commission should require the
applicant to provide (e.g., the record from an underlying proceeding resulting in a statutory
disqualification)? If so, please specify what additional information and the reasons for including
such information.
Q-7. Proposed Rule of Practice 194(c)(4) and (e)(5) require a copy of a decision, order or
other document issued other than with respect to a proceeding resulting in the imposition of
disciplinary sanctions or pending proceeding against the associated person issued by a court,
state agency, agency, SRO or foreign financial regulator. Is there additional information other
than that which would be contained in such documents that the Commission should require the
applicant to provide? If so, in what instances? Should the Commission not require documents
issued in connection with pending proceedings (e.g., orders instituting proceedings, indictments,
informations and other similar documents)?
Q-8. With respect to the requirement in proposed Rule of Practice 194(c)(4) and (e)(5), is
five years an appropriate time period with respect to requiring a copy of any decision, order, or
document issued by a court, state agency, agency, SRO or foreign financial regulator? Should
the Commission require a different time period? If so, please explain why.
Q-9. Are the items required to be addressed by proposed Rule of Practice 194(d) for
natural persons appropriate? Should the Commission require that additional items be addressed?
If so, what additional items? Please explain the reasons for excluding any item or including any
additional item, as well as the costs and benefits of doing so.

- 69

-

Q-10. With respect to the requirement in proposed Rule of Practice 194(d)(6) and (f)(6),
should the Commission require the compliance and disciplinary history during the five years
preceding the filing of the application of the SBS Entity? Should the Commission limit the
requirement, for example, by requiring only the compliance and disciplinary history of an office
or location of an SBS Entity?
Q-11. With respect to the requirement in proposed Rule of Practice 194(d)(6) and (f)(6),
is five years an appropriate time period with respect to the compliance and disciplinary history of
the SBS Entity? Should the Commission require a different time period? If so, please explain
why.
Q-12. With respect to the requirement in proposed Rule of Practice 194(d)(10) and
(f)(7), is five years an appropriate time period with respect to litigation or unsatisfied judgments
concerning investment or investment-related activities? Should the Commission require a
different time period? If so, please explain why. Should the request for information with respect
to litigation or unsatisfied judgments be limited to those concerning investment or investmentrelated activities? Should the request for information with respect to litigation or unsatisfied
judgments be expanded to those concerning swaps or other financial instruments? If so, please
explain why.
Q-13. Are the items requested in proposed Rule of Practice 194(e) for entities
appropriate? For example, should the Commission request organizational charts of an associated
person entity under proposed paragraph (e)(3)? Should the Commission request any additional
information? If so, what items? Please explain the reasons for excluding any item or including
any additional information, as well as the costs and benefits of doing so.
Q-14. Are the items to be addressed in proposed Rule of Practice 194(f) for entities

- 70

-

appropriate? Should the Commission request that any additional items be addressed? If so, what
additional items? Please explain the reasons for excluding any item or including any additional
item, as well as the costs and benefits of doing so.
Q-15. Should the Commission request information regarding prior applications or
processes concerning the associated person, as proposed in Rule of Practice 194(g)? If not, why
not? Are there any other prior applications or processes concerning associated persons that are
relevant that the Commission should request? Proposed paragraph (g) requests information
regarding prior applications or processes with respect to market intermediaries, such as brokerdealers. Should the Commission request information regarding prior applications or processes
with respect to other types of persons, such as issuers?
Q-16. Are there any restrictions (e.g., state or foreign law) on SBS Entities providing
any of the information required to be provided in connection with an application under proposed
Rule of Practice 194? If so, please identify the specific restrictions and the potential impact of
those restrictions.
Q-17. Is the process set forth in proposed Rule of Practice 194(h) appropriate? Does 30
days provide a sufficient time to provide a written statement in response to a notice of an adverse
recommendation by Commission staff? Should the time period set forth in proposed paragraph
(h) (30 days for a response by the applicant) be shorter or longer, and, if so, why?
Q-18. Should the Commission provide the temporary exclusion set forth in proposed
Rule of Practice 194(i)(1)? Does the temporary exclusion set forth in proposed paragraph (i)
adequately consider the interest in providing regulatory certainty and addressing concerns about
potential investor or counterparty harm? Is it consistent with the Commission’s investor
protection mandate? Is it consistent with the Commission’s mandates to maintain fair, orderly,

- 71

-

and efficient markets and facilitate capital formation? Should the temporary exclusion be
modified in any way? If so, please explain how the temporary exclusion should be modified and
the benefits and costs of such an approach. For example, should the temporary exclusion be
applicable only to associated persons that are not natural persons, as proposed, should it also be
applicable to associated persons that are natural persons, or should the temporary exclusion not
be provided to any associated person at all?
Q-19. Should the Commission provide for an exclusion from the prohibition in
Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) with respect to associated person entities for 30 days following
the associated person becoming subject to a statutory disqualification or 30 days following the
person that is subject to a statutory disqualification becoming an associated person of an SBS
Entity, as set forth in proposed Rule of Practice 194(i)(1)(i)?
Q-20. Should the Commission apply the temporary exclusion in proposed paragraph
(i)(1) with respect to both filings made within 30 days of an associated person becoming subject
to a statutory disqualification and those made within 30 days of a person that is subject to a
statutory disqualification becoming an associated person of an SBS Entity?
Q-21. Does 30 days provide a sufficient time period to file an application pursuant to
proposed Rule of Practice 194 such that an entity may be able to avail itself of the temporary
exclusion set forth in proposed Rule of Practice 194(i)(1)(ii) or (iii)? Should the Commission
provide for a process by which an applicant can submit a request for an extension of time? For
example, where good cause is shown, should the Commission or its staff be able to extend the
30-day time period provided for in proposed Rule of Practice 194(i)(1) upon request by an SBS
Entity? If so, during the time period for consideration of that request, should the SBS Entity be
temporarily excluded from the prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6)?

- 72

-

Q-22. As proposed in paragraph (i)(1)(ii), should the Commission provide that an SBS
Entity would be excluded from the prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) for 180 days
following the filing of a complete application pursuant to proposed Rule of Practice 194 by an
SBS Entity if the application is filed within the time period specified in proposed paragraph
(i)(1)(i) (i.e., 30 days)? If so, why; if not, why not. If so, is the proposed 180-day time period set
forth in proposed paragraph (i)(1)(ii) a reasonable time period for the Commission to
appropriately evaluate an application under proposed Rule of Practice 194? Should it be shorter
or longer, and, if so, why? For example, should proposed paragraph (i)(1)(ii) instead require that
the Commission act on an application within fewer days (e.g., 45 or 60 days), with an option for
the Commission to extend the temporary exclusion by additional days (e.g., 120 or 135 days), if
necessary? Alternatively, should the time period afford the Commission additional time to
evaluate an application (e.g., 210 or 270 days)? Or should the rule not specify a time period and
provide that the temporary exclusion will remain in effect during the pendency of the
Commission’s review of an application under proposed Rule of Practice 194? Do commenters
believe that there are circumstances in which the Commission’s decision may be delayed beyond
180 days such that the time period should be extended? Should the Commission consider
adopting any additional procedures or measures to promote timely consideration of applications?
Q-23. As proposed, if the Commission does not render a decision on the application
within 180 days, the temporary exclusion expires and the SBS Entity becomes subject to the
statutory prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6). As an alternative, as discussed above
in Section II.C.8, should the Commission provide that where the Commission does not render a
decision within 180 days following the filing of a complete application pursuant to proposed
Rule of Practice 194, the application shall be deemed granted? Please explain why, as well as

- 73

-

the costs and the benefits of this alternative approach.
Q-24. Proposed paragraph (i)(1)(iii) provides that an SBS Entity would be excluded
from the prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) for 180 days following the filing of a
complete application with, or initiation of a process by, the CFTC, an SRO or a registered futures
association with respect to an application or process with respect to the associated person for the
membership, association, registration or listing as a principal, where such application has been
filed or process started prior to or within the time period specified in paragraph (i)(1)(i) (i.e., 30
days). Is the proposed 180-day time period set forth in proposed paragraph (i)(1)(iii) an
appropriate time period for an SBS Entity to determine whether it needs to file an application
pursuant to proposed Rule of Practice 194 or a notice pursuant to proposed Rule of Practice
194(j) (see Question 33, infra)? Should it be shorter or longer (e.g., the length of the
proceeding), and, if so, why? What would be the impact of having a 180-day time period? For
example, does the 180-day time period provide a sufficient amount of time for the CFTC, an
SRO or a registered futures association to make a determination with respect to membership,
association, registration or listing as a principal with respect to a statutorily disqualified
associated person entity? Why or why not? Would SBS Entities seek to file applications under
proposed Rule of Practice 194 when there is a parallel application pending with the CFTC, an
SRO or registered futures association because of the risk that a decision will not be rendered by
the CFTC, an SRO or registered futures association within 180 days? If so, how should such
parallel applications (and determinations with respect to such applications) be addressed,
including any potential inconsistencies in substance or timing between the two?
Q-25. Should the proposed rule provide for either of the 60-day time periods set forth in
proposed paragraph (i)(1)(ii) and (iii) to comply to the prohibition set forth in Exchange Act

- 74

-

Section 15F(b)(6)? If so, why; if not, why not. Should the Commission provide for a process by
which an applicant can submit a request for an extension of time of these time periods? For
example, where good cause is shown, should the rule specify that the Commission or its staff
may extend the 60-day time period provided for in proposed Rule of Practice 194(i)(1)(ii) and
(iii) upon request by an SBS Entity? If so, during the time period for consideration of such
request, should the SBS Entity be temporarily excluded from the prohibition in Exchange Act
Section 15F(b)(6)?
Q-26. Should the Commission, as proposed in paragraph (i)(2), require that an SBS
Entity file a notice with the Commission setting forth the name of the SBS Entity, the name of
the associated person that is subject to a statutory disqualification, and attaching as an exhibit to
the notice a copy of the order or other applicable document that resulted in the associated person
being subject to a statutory disqualification in order to qualify for the temporary exclusion
provided in proposed paragraph (i)(1)(ii) and (i)(1)(iii)? Should any information be included or
excluded from the notice? If so, please specify what information should be included or
excluded.
Q-27. Should the notice required under proposed paragraph (i)(2) be made public? Why
or why not? Should any additional information be made public, such as the application and any
corresponding exhibits required under proposed paragraphs (c) through (g)?
Q-28. Should the Commission provide that, where the Commission denies an
application with respect to an associated person entity, the Commission may provide by order an
extension of the temporary exclusion as is necessary or appropriate to allow the applicant to
comply with the prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6), as set forth in proposed
paragraph (i)(3)? Should the Commission provide by rule a limitation on the maximum time

- 75

-

period allowed for any such extension?
Q-29. In addition to providing the Commission with the ability to extend the temporary
exclusion when the Commission denies an application, as proposed paragraph (i)(3), should the
Commission specify a minimum period of time for such an extension of the temporary exclusion
following the issuance of an adverse decision (e.g., 30 or 60 days following an adverse
decision)? If so, please explain what minimum time period and why.
Q-30. As noted in Section II.B.3, the CFTC rules provide that associated persons of
swap dealers and major swap participants are natural persons. 120 As a result, the prohibition in
Section 4s(b)(6) of the CEA 121 applies to natural persons associated with a Swap Entity, but not
entities associated with the Swap Entity. As discussed above in Section II.C.8, should the
Commission similarly limit the scope of the statutory prohibition set forth in Exchange Act
Section 15F(b)(6) to natural persons associated with an SBS Entity, beyond the parameters set
forth in Exchange Act Rule 15Fb6-1? For example, should the Commission provide, by rule,
that an SBS Entity may permit an associated person that is not a natural person that is subject to
a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on its
behalf, without making an application under proposed Rule of Practice 194? What would be the
comparative advantages, disadvantages, costs and/or benefits of such an approach?
Q-31. If the prohibition set forth in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) were limited to
natural persons associated with an SBS Entity, what would be the impact on SBS Entities,
counterparties and other market participants? For example, what would be the impact, if any, on
the legal and compliance burden on SBS Entities (including any restructuring costs)? What

120

See Note 42, supra.

121

See 7 U.S.C. 6s(b)(6).

- 76

-

would be the impact, if any, on counterparties’ evaluation of the risk of entering into securitybased swaps with an SBS Entity that had associated person entities subject to a statutory
disqualification? What would be the impact on investor protections and the fair and orderly
operation of the security-based swap market?
Q-32. If the prohibition set forth in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) were limited to
natural persons associated with an SBS Entity, should the Commission require that an SBS
Entity provide a notice to the Commission that would set forth the name of the associated person
entity that is subject to a statutory disqualification? Why or why not? What information should
any such notice contain or attach (e.g., a copy of the order or other applicable document that
resulted in the associated person entity being subject to a statutory disqualification)? Should any
such notice be made publicly available? What would be the comparative advantages,
disadvantages, costs and benefits of providing such a notice to the public?
Q-33. Proposed paragraph (j) would, in part, permit associated persons that are subject
to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf
of SBS Entities, without making an application pursuant to the proposed rule, in cases where
another regulatory authority (i.e., the CFTC, an SRO or registered futures association) has
specifically reviewed the underlying basis for the statutory disqualification and made an
affirmative finding, notwithstanding the statutory disqualification. Should the Commission
adopt this approach? Why or why not? What would be the comparative advantages,
disadvantages, costs and/or benefits of adopting such an approach? For example, how should the
Commission consider the impact of such an approach in circumstances where the Commission
has not itself reviewed the facts giving rise to the statutory disqualification, nor the steps taken
by the SBS Entity with respect to assuring sufficient oversight of the associated person?

- 77

-

Q-34. As an alternative, except with regard to cases where the Commission has
previously granted relief under the Commission’s Rule of Practice 193 or proposed Rule of
Practice 194, should the Commission remove the approach outlined in proposed Rule of Practice
194(j), and require the Commission to make the relevant determination to permit an associated
person that is subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting securitybased swaps on behalf of an SBS Entity?
Q-35. Should proposed Rule of Practice 194(j) be limited to only associated persons that
are natural persons? If so, please explain why.
Q-36. Should proposed Rule of Practice 194(j) be limited to only associated persons that
are not natural persons (i.e., entities)? If so, please explain why.
Q-37. If the Commission were to provide an exclusion from the prohibition in Exchange
Act Section 15F(b)(6) where another regulatory authority has previously made an affirmative
finding with respect to the statutory disqualification as proposed in paragraph (j)(1)(i) and (iv),
what regulatory authorities should be included in the scope of such a rule? For example, should
the Commission limit proposed Rule of Practice 194(j) only to persons that have been admitted
to or continued in membership, or participation or association with a member, of a national
securities association (i.e., FINRA)? Or should the Commission include as proposed other
SROs, the CFTC or a registered futures association? What would be the comparative
advantages, disadvantages, costs and/or benefits of any such approach? Should the Commission
only provide an exclusion where the CFTC, an SRO or a registered futures association has made
a determination with respect to an associated person that is not registered with the Commission?
Q-38. Should the exclusion from the statutory prohibition in Exchange Act Section
15F(b)(6) where another regulatory authority has previously made an affirmative finding, as

- 78

-

provided in proposed Rule of Practice 194(j)(1)(i) and (iv), be limited only to certain types of
conduct resulting in a statutory disqualification (e.g., conduct that is not investment-related and
certain other conduct)?
Q-39. Should the Commission exclude from the scope of Exchange Act Section
15F(b)(6), as proposed in paragraph (j)(1)(iv), a CFTC registrant notwithstanding that the person
is subject to a statutory disqualification under CEA Sections 8a(2) or 8a(3)? Are there any
categories of CFTC registrants that the Commission should not exclude? If so, please explain
why.
Q-40. Should the Commission exclude from the scope of the prohibition in Exchange
Act Section 15F(b)(6) associated persons whom NFA has determined pursuant to the CFTC Staff
No-Action Letter 122 that, had the associated person applied for registration as an associated
person of a swap dealer or a major swap participant, notwithstanding statutory disqualification,
the application would have been granted? If so, please explain why.
Q-41. Under proposed Rule of Practice 194(j), are there any other types of registrants or
persons that the Commission should exclude from the statutory prohibition in Exchange Act
Section 15F(b)(6)? For example, should the Commission exclude any persons associated with an
entity regulated by a prudential regulator or a foreign financial regulatory authority where the
prudential regulator or foreign financial regulatory authority has previously granted relief with
respect to the statutory disqualification? If so, please specify the regulator, and explain how the
process that regulator uses to assess an associated person subject to a statutory disqualification is
comparable to the applications or processes covered by proposed Rule of Practice 194(j).
Q-42. Under proposed Rule of Practice 194(j), are there any additional categories of
122

See Note 49, supra, at 5-8.

- 79

-

associated persons of SBS Entities that the Commission should exclude from the statutory
prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6)? If so, please provide the additional category and
provide the reasons for including the category.
Q-43. As proposed in paragraph (j)(1)(ii), should the Commission allow SBS Entities to
permit associated persons that are natural persons that are subject to a statutory disqualification
to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity, without
making an application pursuant to the proposed rule, in cases where the natural person has been
permitted to associate pursuant to the Rule of Practice 193? If so, why; if not, why not?
Q-44. As proposed in paragraph (j)(1)(iii), should the Commission allow SBS Entities to
permit associated persons (natural persons and entities) that are subject to a statutory
disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS
Entity, without making an application pursuant to the proposed rule, in cases where the person
has previously been permitted to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on
behalf of the SBS Entity pursuant to the Rule of Practice 194? If so, why; if not, why not?
Q-45. As proposed, for the exclusion in proposed Rule of Practice 194(j) to apply,
should the Commission require that all matters giving rise to a statutory disqualification under
Exchange Act Section 3(a)(39)(A) through (F) must have been subject to a process where the
membership, association, registration or listing as a principal has been granted or otherwise
approved? If so, please explain why. Should proposed Rule of Practice 194 address the scenario
where there were prior applications or processes arising from the same matter resulting in
statutory disqualification, but where one application was denied while the other one was granted?
For example, should the event that is later in time control whether the Commission should permit
the person subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-

- 80

-

based swap transactions? If so, please explain why.
Q-46. For the exclusion in proposed Rule of Practice 194(j) to apply, should the
Commission require that the terms and conditions of the association with the SBS Entity be the
same in all material respects as those approved in connection with a previous order, notice or
other applicable document granting the membership, association, registration or listing as a
principal, as set forth in proposed Rule of Practice 194(j)(2)(ii)? If so, why; if not, why not?
Q-47. For the exclusion in proposed Rule of Practice 194(j) to apply, should the
Commission require the notice set forth in proposed Rule of Practice 194(j)(2)(iii) and (iv)? If
so, why; if not, why not? Should the Commission require any additional information in either
notice? Are there any categories of information in either notice that the Commission should
exclude? If so, please provide the category and the reasons for excluding it. Should the
Commission adopt a different format for either notice, such as a form? If so, please explain why
and provide a description of the format for the notice. Should the notice required under proposed
paragraph (j)(2)(iii) and (iv) be made public? Why or why not?
Q-48. With respect to associated person entities, should the scope of proposed Rule of
Practice 194(j) be limited to entities that have previously been granted relief under proposed
Rule of Practice 194, as set forth in proposed paragraph (j)(1)(iii)? Should the Commission
exclude from the scope of proposed Rule of Practice 194(j) entities that have previously been
granted relief under another process (e.g., entities granted relief by the CFTC, an SRO or NFA)?
Q-49. Should the Commission have a different process with respect to associated
persons that are subject to a statutory disqualification as a result of certain types of conduct (e.g.,
conduct that is not investment-related)? If so, please specify what process and the reasons for
such an approach. Should the Commission exclude from the scope of the statutory prohibition in

- 81

-

Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) any types of statutory disqualifications that are not investmentrelated?
IV.

PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT
Proposed Rule of Practice 194 contains “collection of information requirements” within

the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”). The Commission has submitted
the information to the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) for review in accordance
with 44 U.S.C. 3507 and 5 CFR 1320.11. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person
is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a current valid control
number. The title of this collection is “Rule of Practice 194.” OMB has not yet assigned a
Control Number for this collection. The collections of information required by Rule of Practice
194 would be necessary for an SBS Entity to seek relief pursuant to the proposed rule or to rely
on the exception in the rule for associated persons.
A.

Summary of Collection of Information

Proposed Rule of Practice 194 would provide a process by which an SBS Entity could
apply for Commission for an order permitting an associated person to effect or be involved in
effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity notwithstanding a statutory
disqualification. To make an application under proposed Rule of Practice 194, the SBS Entity
filing an application with respect to an associated person that is a natural person would provide
to the Commission:
•

Exhibits required by proposed paragraph (c) to Rule of Practice 194, including a copy of
the order or other applicable document that resulted in the associated person being
subject to a statutory disqualification; an undertaking by the applicant to notify promptly
the Commission in writing if any information submitted in support of the application
becomes materially false or misleading while the application is pending; a copy of the
- 82

-

questionnaire or application for employment specified in Rule 15Fb6-2(b), 123 with
respect to the associated person; in cases where the associated person has been subject of
any proceedings resulting in the imposition of disciplinary sanctions during the five years
preceding the filing of the application or is the subject of a pending proceeding by the
Commission, CFTC, any federal or state regulatory or law enforcement agency,
registered futures association, foreign financial regulatory authority, registered national
securities association, or any other SRO, or commodities exchange or any court, a copy
of the related order, decision, or document issued by the court, agency or SRO.
•

A written statement that includes the information specified in proposed paragraphs (d)
and (g) to Rule of Practice 194, including, but not limited to: the associated person’s
compliance with any order resulting in statutory disqualification; the capacity or position
in which the person subject to a statutory disqualification proposes to be associated with
the SBS Entity; the terms and conditions of employment and supervision to be exercised
over such associated person and, where applicable, by such associated person; the
compliance and disciplinary history, during the five years preceding the filing of the
application, of the SBS Entity; information concerning prior applications or processes.
To make an application under proposed Rule of Practice 194, the SBS Entity filing an

application with respect to an associated person that is not a natural person would provide to the
Commission:
•

Exhibits required by proposed paragraph (e) to Rule of Practice 194, including a copy of
the order or other applicable document that resulted in the associated person being
subject to a statutory disqualification; an undertaking by the applicant to notify promptly

123

17 CFR 240.15Fb6-2(b).

- 83

-

the Commission in writing if any information submitted in support of the application
becomes materially false or misleading while the application is pending; organizational
charts of the associated person (if available); certain applicable policies and procedures of
the associated person; a copy of an order, decision, or document issued by the court,
agency or SRO issued during the five years preceding the filing of the application; in
cases where the associated person has been subject of any proceedings resulting in the
imposition of disciplinary sanctions during the five years preceding the filing of the
application or is the subject of a pending proceeding by the Commission, CFTC, any
federal or state regulatory or law enforcement agency, registered futures association,
foreign financial regulatory authority, registered national securities association, or any
other SRO, or commodities exchange or any court, a copy of the related order, decision,
or document issued by the court, agency or SRO; the names of any natural persons
employed by the associated person that are subject to a statutory disqualification and that
would effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS
Entity.
•

A written statement that includes the information specified in proposed paragraphs (f)
and (g) to Rule of Practice 194, including, but not limited to: general background
information about the associated person; the associated person’s compliance with any
order resulting in statutory disqualification; the capacity or position in which the person
subject to a statutory disqualification proposes to be associated with the SBS Entity; the
compliance and disciplinary history, during the five years preceding the filing of the
application, of the SBS Entity; information concerning prior applications or processes.

•

To be eligible for the temporary exclusion set forth in paragraph (i)(1)(ii) and (i)(1)(iii) to

- 84

-

proposed Rule of Practice 194, under proposed paragraph (i)(2), the SBS Entity would be
required to file with the application a notice setting forth the name of the SBS Entity and
the name of the associated person that is subject to a statutory disqualification, and
attaching as an exhibit to the notice a copy of the order or other applicable document that
resulted in the associated person being subject to a statutory disqualification.
Under paragraph (h) to proposed Rule of Practice 194, an applicant could submit a
written statement in response to any adverse recommendation proposed by Commission staff
with respect to an application under proposed Rule of Practice 194.
An SBS Entity would not be required to file an application under proposed Rule of
Practice 194 with respect to certain associated persons that are subject to a statutory
disqualification, as provided for in proposed paragraph (j) of proposed Rule of Practice 194. To
meet those requirements, however, the SBS Entity would be required to file a notice with the
Commission. For associated persons that are natural persons, the notice in proposed paragraph
(j)(2)(iii) would set forth: (1) the name of the SBS Entity; (2) the name of the associated person
subject to a statutory disqualification; (3) the name of the associated person’s prospective
supervisor(s) at the SBS Entity; (4) the place of employment for the associated person subject to
a statutory disqualification; and (5) identification of any SRO or agency that has indicated its
agreement with the terms and conditions of the proposed association, registration or listing as a
principal. For associated persons that are not natural persons, the notice in proposed paragraph
(j)(2)(iv) would set forth: (1) the name of the SBS Entity; (2) the name of the person associated
that is subject to a statutory disqualification and that will effect or be involved in effecting
security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity; and (3) identification of any SRO or agency
that has indicated its agreement with the terms and conditions of the proposed association,

- 85

-

registration or listing as a principal.
The information sought in connection with proposed Rule of Practice 194 would assist
the Commission in determining whether allowing associated persons to effect or be involved in
effecting security-based swaps on behalf of a SBS Entity, notwithstanding statutory
disqualification, is consistent with the public interest.
The Commission has sought to minimize the burdens and costs associated with proposed
Rule of Practice 194. First, the Commission is not requiring an application under proposed Rule
of Practice 194 with respect to certain associated persons subject to a statutory disqualification
previously granted relief (i.e., by Commission, CFTC, SRO, or NFA). Rather, in such instances,
SBS Entities would only be required to provide a brief notice to the Commission under proposed
Rule of Practice 194(j)(2)(iii) (with respect to associated persons that are natural persons) and
(j)(2)(iv) (with respect to associated person entities). Second, proposed Rule of Practice 194
generally requires information that is already required by Rule of Practice 193 124 and FINRA
Forms MC400 125 and MC-400A. 126 Because the requirements in proposed Rule of Practice 194
would generally be similar to pre-existing requirements in Rule of Practice 193 and FINRA
Forms MC-400 and MC-400A (and largely use the same terminology), proposed Rule of Practice
194 should provide a familiar process for respondents. 127 Third, where appropriate, the
Commission has limited the scope of certain requirements, including by limiting the time period
(for example, paragraphs (c)(4), (d)(6), (d)(10), (e)(5), (f)(6), and (f)(7) to proposed Rule of
124

17 CFR 201.193.

125

See FINRA Form MC-400, Note 33, supra.

See FINRA Form MC-400A, Note 34, supra.

The Commission has estimated that approximately 16 registered SBS Entities will be
broker-dealers, and thus registered with FINRA. See Registration Adopting Release, at
Section IV.C.

Practice 194) or the scope of information sought (for example, paragraph (d)(10) and (f)(7) to
proposed Rule of Practice 194). Finally, the documents that are requested to be provided with
the written statement in paragraphs (c) and (e) of proposed Rule of Practice 194 (e.g., a copy of
the order or other applicable document that resulted in statutory disqualification) should be
readily available or accessible to the SBS Entity or to the associated person.
B.

Proposed Use of Information

Information collected in connection with an application under proposed Rule of Practice
194 would assist the Commission in determining whether an associated person of an SBS Entity
should be permitted to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the
SBS Entity, notwithstanding that the associated person is subject to a statutory disqualification.
Although, absent the proposed rule, an SBS Entity could nonetheless submit an application for
an exemptive order directly under Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6), 128 proposed Rule of Practice
194 would specify the information the Commission needs to evaluate such an application, and
under what standard the Commission will consider whether to grant such relief.
Information collected in connection with the notices provided by Rule of Practice
194(j)(2)(iii) and (j)(2)(iv) would assist the Commission for examination purposes by identifying
associated persons that are subject to a statutory disqualification (and other basic information).
C.

Respondents

The Commission has previously stated that it believes that, based on data obtained from
the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation and conversations with market participants,
approximately fifty entities may fit within the definition of security-based swap dealer and up to
five entities may fit within the definition of major security-based swap participant—55 SBS
128

15 U.S.C. 78o-10(b)(6).

-

Entities in total.129
With respect to associated persons that are natural persons, as discussed in Section V.C.1
below, the Commission has estimated that there will be 423 total associated persons that are
natural persons at each SBS dealer and 63 total associated persons that are natural persons at
each major participant, or 21,465 total associated persons that are natural persons. 130 The
Commission anticipates that, on an average annual basis, only a small fraction of the natural
persons would be subject to a statutory disqualification. By way of comparison, of the nearly
4,000 currently registered broker-dealers and approximately 272,000 registered
representatives, 131 for 2014, FINRA received 24 MC-400 applications with respect to individuals
subject to a statutory disqualification seeking relief under the FINRA Rule 9520 Series. 132
Given that the Commission estimates that there will be far fewer SBS Entities (55) and
associated persons of SBS Entities that are natural persons (21,465 total associated persons that
are natural persons), the Commission anticipates that SBS Entities will file for relief under Rule
of Practice 194 with respect to substantially fewer associated persons that are natural persons.

See Application of “Security-Based Swap Dealer” and “Major Security-Based Swap
Participant” Definitions to Cross-Border Security-Based Swap Activities, Exchange Act
Release No. 72472 (June 25, 2014), 79 FR 47278, 47300 (Aug. 12, 2014) (“Cross-Border
Adopting Release”).

130

One commenter questioned the Commission’s estimate, stating that some entities “could
have hundreds, if not thousands, of associated natural persons that will effect or will be
involved in effecting security-based swaps.” See 12/16/11 SIFMA Letter, at 8.
However, the commenter did not provide supporting data. The Commission nonetheless
has revised its estimate of the number of associated persons. See Registration Adopting
Release, at Section IV.D.4.

131

Based on an analysis of regulatory filings, as of December 31, 2014, there are 3,954
broker-dealers that employed full-time registered representatives and were doing a public
business; these broker-dealers each employed on average 69 registered representatives, or
approximately 272,000 in total. See Note 158, infra.

132

See Section V.C.2, infra.

- 88

-

In addition, to estimate the number of such persons, the Commission staff has conferred
with NFA to assess how many associated persons of the 112 provisionally registered Swap
Entities 133 have applied for relief from CEA 4s(b)(6) 134 (the analogous provision to Exchange
Act Section 15F(b)(6) 135 for SBS Entities) for determination by NFA that, had the associated
person applied for registration as an associated person of a Swap Entity, notwithstanding
statutory disqualification, the application would have been granted. 136 NFA has informed
Commission staff that, from October 2012 to July 22, 2015, NFA determined that in 9 out of 11
requests NFA would have granted registration with respect to the associated person subject to a
statutory disqualification.
Accordingly, based on that available data, the Commission estimates that, on an average
annual basis, SBS Entities would seek relief in accordance with proposed Rule of Practice 194
for five natural persons subject to a statutory disqualification, and SBS Entities would provide
notices pursuant to proposed Rule of Practice 194(j)(2)(iii) for five natural persons.
With respect to associated persons that are not natural persons, as discussed in Section
V.C.1 below, the Commission has estimated that as many as 868 entity persons may be
associating with all SBS Entities. 137 In the Registration Adopting Release, the Commission
adopted Exchange Act Rule 15Fb6-1, 138 which provides that, unless otherwise ordered by the

Commission, an SBS Entity, when it files an application to register with the Commission as a
security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, may permit an associated
person associated that is not a natural person and that is subject to a statutory disqualification to
effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on its behalf, provided that the statutory
disqualification(s) under Exchange Act Section 3(a)(39)(A) through (F) 139 occurred prior to the
compliance date set forth in the Registration Adopting Release, and provided that it identifies
each such associated person in the registration application. Therefore, such SBS Entities will not
file an application or notice under proposed Rule of Practice 194 where Exchange Act Rule
15Fb6-1 140 is applicable.
The Commission preliminarily believes that Exchange Act Rule 15Fb6-1 will apply to
the bulk of statutorily disqualified associated persons that are not natural persons, and that, on an
average annual basis, a limited number of the associated persons that are not natural persons
would be subject to a statutory disqualification. By way of comparison, in 2014, of the nearly
4,000 registered broker-dealers, FINRA received 10 MC-400A applications with respect to
member firms (nine of which were related to the entity, while one was due to an owner/control
person of the member firm being subject to a statutory disqualification), 141 and the total number
of MC-400A applications received during that five year period (from 2010 – 2014) was 63. 142

17 CFR 240.15Fb6-1.

141

See Section V.C.2, infra.

142

We note that under FINRA rules, only the FINRA member itself (i.e., the broker-dealer
entity) would apply under Form MC-400A, not associated persons that are entities.
Therefore, these estimates may more closely represent the number of affected brokerdealers, rather than the number of statutorily disqualified entities seeking to associate.
However, under Exchange Act Section 3(a)(39)(E), 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(39)(E), a person
may be subject to a statutory disqualification if that person has associated with him any
- 90

-

Because there would be far fewer SBS Entities, the Commission preliminarily estimates that, on
an average annual basis, SBS Entities would seek relief in accordance with proposed Rule of
Practice 194 for two associated persons that are not natural persons and that are subject to a
statutory disqualification, and SBS Entities would provide notices pursuant to proposed Rule of
Practice 194(j)(2)(iv) for two associated persons that are not natural persons.
Therefore, the Commission anticipates that, on an average annual basis, SBS Entities
would file five applications under proposed Rule of Practice 194 with respect to associated
persons that are natural persons, two applications under proposed Rule of Practice 194 with
respect to associated persons that are entities, and seven notices for natural persons and entities
under proposed Rule of Practice 194(j)(2)(iii) and (j)(2)(iv). The Commission seeks comment on
these estimates.
D.

Total Burden Estimates Relating to Proposed Rule of Practice 194

It is likely that the time necessary to complete an application under proposed Rule of
Practice 194 would vary depending on the number of exhibits required to be submitted in
accordance with proposed Rule of Practice 194(c) and (e), and the amount of information that
would need to be discussed in the written statement, as specified in proposed Rule of Practice
194(d), (f) and (g).
Based on the Commission staff’s estimates and experience, 143 the Commission estimates

person who is known, or in the exercise of reasonable care should be known, to him to be
a person described by paragraphs (A), (B), (C), or (D) of Exchange Act Section 3(a)(39).
For purposes of identifying whether a member of an SRO is subject to a statutory
disqualification under Exchange Act Section 3(a)(39), an associated person may include
persons that are not natural persons. See FINRA Regulatory Notice 09-19, at 3.
143

For example, based on the experience relative to Form BD, the Commission has
estimated the average time necessary for an SBS Entity to research the questions and
complete and file a Form SBSE, including the accompanying schedules and disclosure
- 91

-

that the average time necessary for an SBS Entity to research the questions, and complete and
file an application under Rule of Practice 194 (including any response under proposed Rule of
Practice 194(h)), as well as the notice provided for in proposed paragraph (i)(2), if applicable,
with respect to an associated person that is an entity would be approximately one work week, or
40 hours. The Commission believes that, for applications with respect to associated persons that
are natural persons, the information requested under proposed Rule of Practice 194 is on average
less than for entities, and that the written statement and supporting papers would require less
time to complete. The Commission therefore estimates that for associated persons that are
natural persons it would take SBS Entities approximately 75% of the time that it would take to
research the questions, and complete and file an application under Rule of Practice 194 for
associated persons that are entities, or 30 hours. In addition, the Commission believes that the
average time necessary for an SBS Entity to research the questions, complete and file the brief
notice under proposed Rule of Practice 194(j)(2)(iii) or 194(j)(iv) would be less than for a full
application under proposed Rule of Practice 194 and the Commission estimates that it would take
approximately 3 hours.
Given that the Commission estimates that, on an average annual basis, there will be five
applications under proposed Rule of Practice 194 with respect to associated persons that are
natural persons, two applications under proposed Rule of Practice 194 with respect to associated
persons that are entities, and seven notices under proposed Rule of Practice 194(j)(2)(iii) and
(j)(2)(iv), the Commission estimates the total burden associated with filing such applications and

reporting pages—which solicit information regarding statutory disqualification—to be
approximately one work week, or 40 hours. See Registration Adopting Release, at
Section IV.D.1.

these estimates.
The Commission seeks comment on the collection of information burdens associated

Q-51. Is the estimate for the amount of time that it would take on average for an SBS
Entity to complete an application (and, if applicable, the accompanying notice provided for in
proposed paragraph (i)(2)) under Rule of Practice 194 appropriate? Is the estimate for the
amount of time that it would take on average for an SBS Entity to complete a notice under
proposed Rule of Practice 194(j)(2)(iii) and (j)(2)(iv) appropriate?

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.

Introduction

Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) 145 prohibits an SBS Entity from permitting an associated
person who is subject to a statutory disqualification from effecting or being involved in effecting
security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity if the SBS Entity knew, or in the exercise of
reasonable care should have known, of the statutory disqualification. Exchange Act Section
15(b)(6) also authorizes the Commission to provide relief from the statutory prohibition by rule,
regulation, or order.
Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) imposes a general prohibition on statutorily disqualified
associated persons from effecting or being involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf
of an SBS Entity unless otherwise permitted by the Commission. Concurrently with this
proposal, the Commission is adopting final rules and forms establishing the registration process
for SBS Entities. Among other things, these rules reference the events in the existing definition
of statutory disqualification in Exchange Act Section 3(a)(39)(A) through (F) 146 and apply them
to Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6). This definition disqualifies associated persons from
effecting or being involved in effecting security-based swaps due to violations of the securities
laws, but also for all felonies and certain misdemeanors, including felonies and misdemeanors
not related to the securities laws and/or financial markets. Under Exchange Act Section
15F(b)(6), absent Commission action, SBS Entities will be unable to utilize any associated
person, including associated entities and natural persons with potentially valuable capabilities,
skills or expertise, to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps if they have been

145

15 U.S.C. 78o-10(b)(6).

146

15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(39)(A) – (F). See Note 16, supra.

- 95

-

disqualified for any reason, including non-investment-related conduct that may not pose a risk to
security-based swap market participants. 147
Under the final registration rules, the statutory prohibition in Exchange Act Section
15F(b)(6) applies to all associated persons, including both natural persons and associated entities
of SBS Entities. The Commission is proposing Rule of Practice 194 to provide a process for a
registered SBS Entity to make an application to the Commission to issue an order permitting an
associated person who is subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in
effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity. Among other things, the proposed
rule would:
•

Specify how SBS Entities may apply to the Commission to permit an associated person
subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-based
swaps on behalf of an SBS Entity, including the form of application, items to be
addressed, and standard of review and requiring applicants to make a showing that
permitting the associated person to effect or be involved in effecting security-based
swaps is consistent with the public interest;

•

Provide a temporary exclusion from the general statutory prohibition pending a
Commission, CFTC, SRO or registered futures association decision on an application
regarding associated person entities effecting or involved in effecting security-based
swaps on behalf of SBS Entities, if the application is filed within 30 days of the
disqualification event or of the beginning of an association with a previously disqualified

147

Final registration rules also require the Chief Compliance Officer of an SBS Entity, or his
or her designee, to certify on its registration form that none of its associated persons that
effect or are involved in effecting security-based swaps on its behalf are subject to a
statutory disqualification. See Registration Adopting Release, at Section II.B.3.

- 96

-

entity and a notice has been filed with the Commission within the same 30-day time
period. The temporary exclusion expires 180 days following the filing of a complete
application with, or initiation of a process by, the CFTC, an SRO or a registered futures
association, and in the event of an adverse decision an SBS Entity will have 60 days to
conform with the general statutory prohibition. The temporary exclusion pending
Commission decision expires 180 days from the date of filing a complete application if
the Commission has not rendered a decision on the application, after which SBS Entities
will have 60 days to conform with the general statutory prohibition;
•

Allow SBS Entities, under certain conditions, to permit associated persons who are
subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-based
swaps on their behalf, provided the Commission, the CFTC, an SRO or a registered
futures association has granted a prior application or otherwise granted relief after a
statutory disqualification review of that associated person, and provided appropriate
notice has been filed.
Proposed Rule of Practice 194 is intended to establish a framework for SBS Entities

seeking relief from the statutory prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6). Exchange Act
Section 15F(b)(6) gives the Commission flexibility to address statutory disqualification
situations, including by order. Under this section, the prohibition with respect to statutorily
disqualified persons applies “[e]xcept to the extent otherwise specifically provided by rule,
regulation, or order of the Commission.” 148 This statutory provision gives the Commission
discretion to determine that a statutorily disqualified person may effect or be involved in
effecting security-based swaps on behalf of an SBS Entity. Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6),
148

15 U.S.C. 78o-10(b)(6).

- 97

-

however, does not specify what information should be provided to the Commission when an SBS
Entity seeks relief, nor does it set forth the standard under which the Commission would evaluate
requests for relief. Proposed Rule of Practice 194 specifies the information and documents that
SBS Entities should provide to the Commission, as well as the applicable procedures and
standard of review, for seeking relief from the statutory prohibition in Exchange Act Section
15F(b)(6). While the Exchange Act provides the Commission with the authority to make a
determination with respect to a statutorily disqualified person, the structured process outlined in
proposed Rule of Practice 194 is designed to ensure that the Commission has sufficient
information to evaluate whether providing relief for an associated person under Exchange Act
Section 15F(b)(6) is consistent with the public interest.
B.

General Economic Considerations

In considering proposed Rule of Practice 194 and alternative regulatory approaches to a
process for addressing statutory disqualification, we are mindful of the costs imposed by and the
benefits obtained from our rules. Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act 149 provides that whenever the
Commission is engaged in rulemaking pursuant to the Exchange Act and is required to consider
or determine whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, the Commission
shall also consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action will promote
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. In addition, Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange
Act 150 requires the Commission, when making rules under the Exchange Act, to consider the
impact such rules would have on competition. Exchange Act Section 23(a)(2) also provides that
the Commission shall not adopt any rule which would impose a burden on competition that is not

necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. The discussion
below addresses the potential economic effects of the proposed Rule of Practice 194, including
the likely benefits and costs of the rules and their potential impact on efficiency, competition,
and capital formation.
As we have noted, Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) gives the Commission authority to
provide relief from the statutory prohibition against associating with disqualified persons by rule,
regulation, or order, and the Commission is not bound by any particular approach in exercising
its discretion to provide relief. In particular, in the absence of the proposed rule or any other
proposed approach, SBS Entities would still be able to apply for relief from Exchange Act
Section 15F(b)(6) and the Commission would be able to issue an order either granting or denying
relief. When determining whether to make an application for relief with respect to an associated
person, an SBS Entity will weigh the scarcity and value of the particular skills of an associated
person that is a natural person or the profits generated by an associated person entity’s securitybased swap business against 1) the application costs and reputational costs that come with
choosing to associate with disqualified persons, and 2) their beliefs as to the likelihood of an
approval or denial decision by the Commission. To the extent that proposed Rule of Practice
194 alters an SBS Entity’s assessment of either application and reputational costs or beliefs about
likely outcomes and the decision to apply with the Commission, economic costs and benefits
may accrue to SBS Entities, associated persons, and counterparties to SBS Entities.
The Commission preliminarily believes that the primary benefits of the proposed
approach are in 1) providing SBS Entities clarity regarding the items to be addressed, the
information and supporting documentation to be submitted, and the standard of review (affecting
application costs and beliefs about likely outcomes), and 2) ensuring that the Commission has

- 99

-

sufficient information to make a meaningful determination that allowing an SBS Entity to permit
statutorily disqualified associated persons to effect security-based swaps is consistent with the
public interest. Finally, we note that regardless of the regulatory approach chosen, SBS Entities
may find it less costly to disassociate with, or reassign, disqualified persons than to apply for
relief.
The Commission lacks data on the complexity and variety of current SBS Entity business
structures and activities, the degree of SBS Entity business reliance on associated persons subject
to a statutory disqualification, the location and specificity of expertise of such persons, as well as
the reputational costs of associating with disqualified persons. Further, the economic effects of
various provisions of proposed Rule of Practice 194 hinge on whether and how significantly SBS
Entities may be affected by the statutory prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6); how
market participants will react to SBS Entities seeking relief through a Commission order
compared to relief under proposed Rule of Practice 194, which will affect the reputational costs
of the application under Rule of Practice 194 relative to baseline; and how other SBS Entities
will react to the newly opened market share should some SBS Entities temporarily cease
effecting security-based swaps or exit due to the statutory prohibition in Exchange Act Section
15F(b)(6). To the best of our knowledge, no such data are publicly available. We, therefore,
cannot quantify many of the effects, including the tradeoff behind an SBS Entity’s choice to
pursue relief and face potential reputational losses versus disassociating with the statutorily
disqualified associated person. Where we cannot quantify, we discuss in qualitative terms the
relevant economic effects, including the costs and benefits of proposed Rule of Practice 194 and
alternative approaches.
C.

Economic Baseline

To assess the economic impact of proposed Rule of Practice 194, the Commission is
- 100

-

using as a baseline the regulation of SBS Entities as it exists at the time of this proposal,
including applicable rules we have adopted, but excluding rules that we have proposed but not
yet finalized. Included in our baseline are final rules establishing registration requirements for
SBS Entities, which are being adopted concurrently with this proposal. 151
Our economic baseline presumes that the general prohibition in Exchange Act Section
15F(b)(6) 152 is in effect, and compliance with registration requirements is required. However,
we note that prior to adoption of final registration rules, the Commission previously provided
temporary relief from Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) for certain associated persons.
Specifically, on June 15, 2011, the Commission issued an order granting temporary relief from
Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) for persons subject to a statutory disqualification who were
associated with an SBS Entity as of July 16, 2011. 153 As discussed in the Registration Adopting
Release, SBS Entities are required to comply with the statutory prohibition set forth in Exchange
Act Section 15F(b)(6). 154 However, under Exchange Act Rule 15Fb6-1, 155 unless otherwise
ordered by the Commission, an SBS Entity, when it files an application to register with the
151

See Registration Adopting Release.

15 U.S.C. 78o-10(b)(6).

153

See Note 13, supra.

154

15 U.S.C. 78o-10(b)(6); see Registration Adopting Release, at Section II.B.1.i. The
compliance date set forth in the Registration Adopting Release is the later of: six months
after the date of publication in the Federal Register of a final rule release adopting rules
establishing capital, margin and segregation requirements for SBS Entities; the
compliance date of final rules establishing recordkeeping and reporting requirements for
SBS Entities; the compliance date of final rules establishing business conduct
requirements under Exchange Act Sections 15F(h) and 15F(k); or the compliance date for
final rules establishing a process for a registered SBS Entity to make an application to the
Commission to allow an associated person who is subject to a statutory disqualification to
effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on the SBS Entity’s behalf. See
Registration Adopting Release, at 1.

17 CFR 240.15Fb6-1.

- 101

-

Commission as a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, may
permit statutorily disqualified associated person entities to effect or be involved in effecting
security-based swaps on its behalf, provided that the statutory disqualification occurred prior to
the compliance date set forth in the Registration Adopting Release, and provided that the SBS
Entity identifies each such associated person on Schedule C of the applicable registration form.
Additionally, we note that the compliance date of final registration rules will not occur until,
among other things, the Commission adopts final rules establishing a process for a registered
SBS Entity to apply for relief from the statutory disqualification provision in Exchange Act
Section 15F(b)(6). 156
Thus, there are currently no registered entities that are required to comply with either the
statutory disqualification certifications in the final registration rules or the statutory prohibition
in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6). Nevertheless, the Commission believes that in order to
perform a meaningful assessment of proposed Rule of Practice 194, the appropriate baseline is
one where compliance with final registration rules is required, the general statutory prohibition is
in effect, and the Commission may use its authority under Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) to
issue an order providing relief.
1.

Affected Participants

Because final registration rules are being adopted concurrently with this proposal, but
compliance is not yet required, we do not have data on the actual number of SBS Entities that
will register with the Commission, or the number of persons associated with registered SBS
Entities. However, in the Registration Adopting Release, the Commission estimated that up to
50 entities may register with the Commission as security-based swap dealers, and up to five
156

See Note 154, supra.

- 102

-

additional entities may register as major security-based swap participants. 157 Furthermore, we
estimate that as many as 423 natural persons may associate with each dealer and as many as 63
natural persons may associate with each major participant, or 21,465 in total. 158 In addition, we
estimate that 868 entity persons may be associating with all SBS Entities. 159 We note that SBS

157

See Registration Adopting Release, at Section IV.C; Section V.B, supra.

158

Based on an analysis of broker-dealer FOCUS reports, as of December 31, 2014, there
were 3,954 broker-dealers that employed full-time registered representatives and were
doing a public business; these broker-dealers each employed on average 69 registered
representatives, or approximately 272,000 in total. However, based on our review of the
50 entities we believe may register as security-based swap dealers, the Commission
believes the subset of clearing broker-dealers provides a better estimate. As of December
31, 2014, there were 447 clearing broker-dealers which had, on average, each employed
423 persons who were registered representatives; we use this average as the basis for our
estimate of 21,150 natural persons associated with dealers. Note, however, that SBS
Entities will be limited to sales of security-based swaps, whereas broker-dealers are
generally engaged in the sale of a broader range of financial instruments, as well as other
business lines such as prime brokerage services. Thus, it is possible that fewer people
would be needed to facilitate this business.
Since registration requirements for major security-based swap participants are triggered
by position thresholds, as opposed to activity thresholds for dealer registration, we
anticipate that entities which may seek to register with the Commission as major securitybased swap participants may more closely resemble hedge funds and investment advisors.
To estimate the number of natural persons associated with major security-based swap
participants, we use Form ADV filings by registered investment advisers. Based on this
analysis, as of January 2, 2015 there were 11,506 registered investment advisers; these
investment advisers had an average 63 employees each. We use this average as the basis
for our estimate of 315 natural persons associated with major security-based swap
participants.

159

Based on an analysis of historical Form BD filings, broker-dealers with control affiliates
had an average of 6.84 control affiliates that started to associate between 2000 and 2014,
and have not ended the association by December 31, 2014. We preliminarily believe that
it may be appropriate to scale the figure by a factor of two to account for complexity in
business structures and for the fact that security-based swap dealers are likely to resemble
some of the larger broker dealers, which results in an estimate of up to 684
(6.84*50*2=684) entities associated with security-based swap dealers. As discussed in
our estimates of associated natural persons, SBS Entities will be limited to sales of
security-based swaps, whereas broker-dealers are generally engaged in the sale of a
broader range of financial instruments, and it is possible that fewer entities would be
needed to facilitate this business.

- 103

-

Entities currently intermediating security-based swaps are frequently part of complex
organizational structures, which may include thousands of natural persons and hundreds of
entities. Further, we preliminarily believe that SBS Entities may adjust their organizational
structures and activities in response to the associated person and other requirements of final
registration rules and the pending substantive Title VII rules. We also preliminarily anticipate
that there may be a high degree of heterogeneity in business structures and organizational
complexity among SBS Entities. The Commission lacks data on SBS Entity associations with
disqualified entities effecting or involved in effecting security-based swaps on their behalf. It is,
therefore, difficult to estimate with a high degree of certainty the number of associated persons
and associated persons currently intermediating security-based swaps on behalf of SBS Entities
that may be affected by the proposed rules.
2.

Incidence of Disqualification

While the Commission lacks data on the incidence of statutory disqualifications in the
security-based swap market, we look to the securities market and the experience of brokerdealers as a guide. 160 Based on information provided by FINRA to the Commission, in 2014

Using historical Form ADV filings for investment advisers with control persons as of
March 2015, investment advisors with control persons had an average of approximately
18.35 control persons listed as firms or organizations that started to associate between
2000 and 2014, and have not ended the association by December 31, 2014. We
preliminarily believe that it may be appropriate to scale the figure by a factor of two to
account for complexity in business structures and for the fact that major swap participants
are likely to be similar to some of the larger investment advisors, which results in an
estimate of up to approximately 184 (18.35*5*2 = 183.5) entities associated with major
security-based swap market participants.
160

We have also requested data from NFA. According to NFA staff, between October 11,
2012 and July 22, 2015, 11 applications had been made by Swap Entities to NFA for
NFA to provide notice to the Swap Entity that, had the person applied for registration as
an associated person, NFA would have granted such registration. See CFTC Staff NoAction Letter, supra Note 49, at 5-8. The Commission has estimated that up to 55 SBS
- 104

-

FINRA received 24 MC-400 applications for individuals subject to a statutory disqualification
seeking relief under the FINRA Rule 9520 Series. Of these applications, 13 were for
investment-related disqualification, 10 were non-investment-related, and one was for both
investment and non-investment disqualifications. Further, in 2014, FINRA received an
additional 10 MC-400A applications for statutorily disqualified member firms under Rule 9520
Series. Of the MC-400A applications received by FINRA, nine were related to the entity, while
one was due to an owner/control person of the member firm being disqualified (all with
investment-related trigger events).
The Commission preliminarily believes that the incidence of statutory disqualification
among broker-dealers serves as a reasonable basis to estimate the incidence of disqualification
among SBS Entities, because both broker-dealers and SBS Entities are engaged in the business
of intermediating trade in financial instruments. As described above, in 2014 FINRA received
24 applications for individuals and 10 applications for member firms, out of approximately
272,000 registered representatives and 4,000 currently registered broker-dealers. We estimate
that 55 entities will register with the Commission as SBS Entities, with an estimated 21,465
associated natural persons and 868 associated person entities. Assuming the number of
Entities may seek registration, while the CFTC has provisionally registered 112 Swap
Entities (https://www.nfa.futures.org/NFA-swaps-information/regulatory-info-sd-andmsp/SD-MSP-registry.HTML; last accessed July 24, 2015). Using the above data from
NFA concerning 11 applications over approximately 2.78 years, results in an estimate of
approximately 2 applications per year (11*55/112)/2.78~=1.94).
The Commission, however, recognizes that the number of applications received by NFA
may only present a partial picture of the potential impact of a disqualification because,
inter alia, (1) the CFTC defines “associated person” of a Swap Entity to be limited solely
to natural persons, not entities (see 17 CFR 1.3(aa)(6)); (2) in CFTC Regulation 23.22(b),
17 CFR 23.22(b), the CFTC provided an exception from the prohibition set forth in CEA
Section 4s(b)(6), 7 U.S.C. 6s(b)(6), for any person subject to a statutory disqualification
who is already listed as a principal, registered as an associated person of another CFTC
registrant, or registered as a floor broker or floor trader.

- 105

-

applications for association with statutorily disqualified persons at SBS Entities is the same as at
broker-dealers results in an estimate of approximately two applications for natural persons and
one application for entities per year. 161 Recognizing that this is an estimate, we preliminarily
believe it is reasonable to estimate that the Commission will receive up to five applications per
year with respect to natural persons and up to two applications per year with respect to
entities. 162
3.

Existing Regulatory Frameworks

As reflected in Section II.B, the Commission, CFTC, FINRA, and NFA have already
established processes that enable various persons subject to a statutory disqualification or other
bars to be permitted to associate with regulated entities transacting in equity, bond, commodity,
swap, and other markets. The numerous financial markets are integrated, often attracting the
same market participants that trade across corporate bond, swap, and security-based swap
markets, among others. The Commission has elsewhere estimated that approximately thirty-five
entities currently registered with the CFTC as Swap Entities are expected to have sufficiently
161

For natural persons: 21,465 * (24/272,000) = 1.89. For entities: 868 * (10/4000) =
2.18.

162

Notably, paragraph (j) of proposed Rule of Practice 194 provides that an SBS Entity may
permit, subject to certain circumstances, statutorily disqualified associated persons to
effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the SBS Entity where
the Commission, CFTC, an SRO or a registered futures association has granted a prior
application or otherwise granted relief from a statutory disqualification with respect to the
associated person. See Section II.C.9, supra. As a result, to the extent that SBS Entities
are using the same personnel to effect security-based swaps, swaps, and transact in
underlying securities, the number of applications the Commission receives may be lower.
We also note that registered broker-dealers retain the option of complying with statutory
disqualification provisions by disassociating with or reassigning disqualified persons. As
a result, many instances of disqualification may resolve through disassociation or
reassignment. Registered entities would likely take advantage of the provision only when
the benefits of associating with a disqualified person outweigh the costs, including
reputational costs, of making an application.

- 106

-

large security-based swap transaction volume or positions to require registration with the
Commission as SBS Entities. We further estimated that sixteen market participants expected to
register as SBS Entities have already registered with the Commission as broker-dealers 163 and,
therefore, are subject to oversight by FINRA or a national securities exchange. In total, all but
four entities that the Commission has estimated as potential registered SBS Entities are expected
to be subject to regulatory oversight from the CFTC, FINRA, or a national securities
exchange. 164 Therefore, we preliminarily expect SBS Entities to associate with persons effecting
or involved in effecting transactions across the various markets overseen by the CFTC, FINRA
and NFA.
More broadly, swaps and security-based swaps enable market participants to trade on the
risks of underlying reference securities, and these markets are integrated. As a result of crossmarket participation, informational efficiency, pricing and liquidity in swaps and security-based
swaps markets may influence reference security markets, and vice versa. 165

disqualification to effect security-based swaps. 166 As discussed above, clarity provided by the
proposed rule regarding the materials to be submitted, the items to be considered, and the
standard of review, which may alter an SBS Entity’s assessment of 1) the application costs and
reputational costs that come with choosing to associate with disqualified persons, and 2) their
beliefs as to the likelihood of an approval or denial decision by the Commission. To the extent
that any such alteration leads to greater or fewer applications for relief under Rule of Practice
194 relative to the baseline with no process rule in place, economic costs and benefits may
accrue to SBS Entities, associated persons, and counterparties to SBS Entities.
Broadly, limiting the involvement of statutorily disqualified persons in security-based
swap markets on behalf of SBS Entities mitigates compliance and counterparty risks arising from
disqualification and may facilitate competition among higher quality SBS Entities, better
supervision and integrity of security-based swap markets. However, limits on disqualified
persons may require SBS Entities to undergo business restructuring in the event of
disqualification or to apply with the Commission for relief, the costs of which may be passed on
to counterparties. Below we discuss this economic tradeoff as it pertains to individual rule
provisions and alternatives being considered.
We estimate that the Commission will receive seven or fewer applications under
proposed Rule of Practice 194 per year (with respect to both associated persons that are natural
persons and entities), and we preliminarily believe that SBS Entities may be able to easily
reassign or disassociate from disqualified natural persons for the purposes of effecting securitybased swaps on behalf of SBS Entities. Therefore, we preliminarily believe the overall economic
impact of the proposed rule will depend on how many associated person entities of SBS Entities
166

15 U.S.C. 78o-10(b)(6).

- 108

-

become disqualified after the compliance date of final registration rules, the relative market share
and structure of bilateral relationships of affected SBS Entities, and the response of other SBS
Entities and market participants. We are mindful of the economic tradeoffs inherent in our
policy choices and their impact on the securities markets. We discuss these economic effects in
more detail below.
1.

Anticipated Benefits
a.

Benefits to SBS Entities

Proposed Rule of Practice 194 establishes a structured process that provides SBS Entities
clarity and guidelines on the form of application, the items to be considered, and the standard of
review. Furthermore, the proposed rule ensures that the Commission will have sufficient
information to make a meaningful determination that providing relief for an associated person is
consistent with the public interest.
Under the baseline scenario, absent proposed Rule of Practice 194, SBS Entities would
still be able to apply to the Commission, and the Commission would still be able to exercise its
authority to grant relief. 167 Therefore, the proposed process does not affect the set of options
available to either SBS Entities or the Commission, nor does it affect the range of possible
outcomes. However, a key benefit of proposed Rule of Practice 194 is that, by articulating the
materials to be submitted, the items to be considered, and the standard of review, it provides a
structured process to SBS Entities, as well as clarity about the process.
Absent proposed Rule of Practice 194, we preliminarily believe that SBS Entities seeking
to apply for relief from Section 15F(b)(6) may apply to the Commission directly, outside of a

167

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(b)(6); see also Section V.C, supra.

- 109

-

formal process, possibly looking to either Rule of Practice 193 168 or an analogous process as a
guide. 169 However, we also believe that such applications, due to the lack of clarity, would be
more time-consuming, and would be more prone to errors or more likely to be deemed to contain
insufficient information to allow the Commission to make a determination. Under proposed
Rule of Practice 194, SBS Entities should generally be aware of the information they are
required to provide, as well as the standard of review. We also believe that clarity about the
items that the Commission will consider in making a determination, while not altering the set of
possible outcomes, will allow SBS Entities to make more-informed assessments as to the
likelihood that the Commission will either grant or deny relief. Thus, proposed Rule of Practice
194 may conserve resources and may allow SBS Entities to make more-informed evaluations
about the tradeoff between pursuing an application and either disassociating with or, in the case
of natural persons, reassigning a person subject to a statutory disqualification.
Finally, paragraph (j) of proposed Rule of Practice 194 provides relief in cases where the
Commission, the CFTC, an SRO, or a registered futures association has granted a prior
application or otherwise granted relief from a statutory disqualification with respect to that
associated person. To the extent that SBS Entities, Swap Entities, and broker-dealers use the
same personnel or entities to effect security-based swaps, swaps, and securities transactions, this
proposed rule may conserve resources in the sense that SBS Entities will not have to undergo
duplicate review when decisions about relief from statutory disqualifications have already been
made by the Commission or another regulatory authority. These benefits are discussed in greater

detail in Section V.D.1.c below. 170
b.

Benefits to Counterparties of SBS Entities

As stated in Section II.C.7 above, orders issued in accordance with Rule of Practice 194
would be made publicly available. Further, for SBS Entities to be able to avail themselves of the
temporary exclusion set forth in proposed paragraphs (i)(1)(ii) and (i)(1)(iii), applications related
to disqualified associated entities would have to include a notice, which would be publicly
disseminated by the Commission. The notice would set forth the name of the SBS Entity and the
name of the associated person that is subject to a statutory disqualification, and attach as an
exhibit to the notice a copy of the order or other applicable document that resulted in the
associated person being subject to a statutory disqualification. Publicly available and publicly
disseminated information regarding applications under proposed Rule of Practice 194 would
provide market participants with information they may find useful in assessing their
counterparties. In particular, market participants may use knowledge about whether an SBS
Entity has applied for relief and/or whether an SBS Entity currently employs or associates with
disqualified persons to effect security-based swaps when choosing counterparties. In general,
such information may be valued by market participants when selecting counterparties, if they
believe such knowledge is informative about the quality of a counterparty.
In addition, we note that this information may be useful to other SBS Entities. In
particular, publicly available information regarding the outcome of Rule of Practice 194
applications may inform other SBS Entities’ assessments of the likelihood that the Commission
170

We note that under paragraph (j) associated persons may be permitted to effect or be
involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of SBS Entities where the
Commission would not have made an individualized positive determination in the context
of such person effecting or being involved in effecting security-based swap transactions.
These potential effects are discussed in Section V.D.2.b below.

- 111

-

would grant relief in particular circumstances. For example, SBS Entities could look to
outcomes in applications where disqualifications were for similar reasons; such information may
be useful in determining whether it is cost effective to seek relief.
c.

Benefits of the Commission, CFTC, SRO, Registered Futures
Association Provision

Beyond establishing a process for submitting applications, proposed Rule of Practice 194
allows an SBS Entity, subject to certain conditions, to permit an associated person that is subject
to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf
of the SBS Entity without making an application to the Commission, if the associated person’s
membership, association, registration or listing as a principal has been granted or otherwise
approved by the Commission, CFTC, an SRO or a registered futures association. 171 In such
cases where an SBS Entity meets the requirements of proposed paragraph (j), these SBS Entities
would be able to provide notice to the Commission in lieu of having to compile the same
information and documentation for a repeated review, thereby eliminating redundancy and
decreasing SBS Entity costs.
The proposed rule concerning associated persons previously granted relief by the
Commission, CFTC, an SRO or a registered futures association provides SBS Entities with
flexibility in hiring and assigning employees, and associating with entities, depending on
business needs and required capabilities. Specifically, this provision would benefit SBS Entities
transacting across markets through disqualified associated persons previously granted relief by
the Commission, CFTC, NFA or FINRA, by enabling them to avoid costs of a separate
application process under proposed Rule of Practice 194 or business restructuring. We also

171

See proposed Rule of Practice 194(j); see also Section II.C.9, supra.

- 112

-

recognize that this provision reduces costs to SBS Entities from associating with disqualified
persons previously granted relief by the Commission, CFTC, NFA or FINRA, so it may benefit
these persons by potentially improving their employment options and business outcomes.
d.

Benefits of the Temporary Exclusion

The temporary exclusion pending decision by the Commission, the CFTC, an SRO or a
registered futures association with respect to an associated person entity 172 prevents potentially
unnecessary business restructuring or business disruption costs for SBS Entities that are affiliated
with disqualified entities but have not yet received a decision on their application. Under this
provision, provided that the conditions in proposed paragraph (i) are met, SBS Entities would not
have to comply with the statutory prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) with respect to
associated person entities while an application before the Commission, the CFTC, an SRO or a
registered futures association is pending. If the Commission, the CFTC, an SRO or a registered
futures association does not render a decision on the application within 180 days, an SBS Entity
will have 60 days to disassociate or otherwise restructure their business such that the disqualified
associated person entity is not effecting or involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf
of the SBS Entity. 173 In cases where the CFTC, an SRO or registered futures association makes
an adverse decision on a pending application, an SBS Entity will have 60 days to conform with
the general statutory prohibition, whereas for applications under Rule of Practice 194 denied by
the Commission, a conformance period may be provided by order as necessary and
appropriate. 174

172

See proposed Rule of Practice 194(i); see also Section II.C.8, supra.

173

See proposed Rule of Practice 194(i)(1)(ii), (iii).

174

See proposed Rule of Practice 194(i)(1)(iii).

- 113

-

The time-limited nature of the temporary exclusion pending review 175 may introduce
uncertainty concerning the eventual need to restructure before the Commission, the CFTC, an
SRO or registered futures association has rendered a decision on the application. To the extent
that the process under proposed Rule of Practice 194 provides benefits to SBS Entities and their
counterparties by not requiring them to incur the costs of restructuring and complying with the
statutory prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) until they have received certainty on
their application, the time-limited nature of the temporary exclusion pending review may reduce
these benefits.
We highlight that, as discussed in the Registration Adopting Release, inter-dealer
transactions account for greater than 60% of single-name CDS transactions. 176 The high level of
inter-dealer trading activity reflects the central position of a small number of dealers, each of
which may intermediate trades between many hundreds of counterparties. In the absence of a
temporary exclusion pending application review, some SBS Entities may have to bear costs of
restructuring or disassociating from disqualified entities. Given the small number of dealers, as
well as the potential reach of dealers to hundreds of counterparties, this may increase transaction
costs for counterparties should disruptions to existing bilateral relationships occur. The
temporary exclusion, 177 as well as the 60-day conformance period 178 and the possibility of an
extension of temporary exclusion by Commission order in cases where review applications are
denied, 179 may mitigate these effects.

At the same time, without the temporary exclusion, other SBS Entities are likely to step
in and intermediate the trades. The potential benefits of the temporary exclusion for market
quality and competition, therefore, depend on the relative importance of existing bilateral
relationships and on which SBS Entities would increase their participation, if some SBS Entities
are temporarily unable to intermediate swaps due to statutory disqualification absent the
temporary exclusion.
It is important to note that the temporary exclusion will not apply to associated person
entities with respect to which the Commission has otherwise ordered, or with respect to which
the Commission, CFTC, an SRO or registered futures association has previously denied an
application. 180 Temporarily excluding such associated person entities from the statutory
prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6), and allowing SBS Entities to permit associated
person entities to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps pending review may
pose significant counterparty and compliance risks. However, we recognize that this aspect of
the proposed rule mitigates the potential benefits described above.
We further note that the proposed temporary exclusion covers applications regarding
associated person entities only, and excludes applications regarding associated persons that are
natural persons. As a practical matter, an SBS Entity may be able to reassign or disassociate
from a statutorily disqualified natural person effecting or involved in effecting security-based
swaps, whereas disassociating from statutorily disqualified entities may require more costly
restructuring.

2.

Anticipated Costs
a.

Application Costs

Based on the Commission’s experience with similar applications, the Commission
preliminarily estimates that the average time necessary for an SBS Entity to research the
questions, and complete and file an application under Rule of Practice 194 would be
approximately 40 hours for applications regarding entities, and 30 hours for applications
regarding natural persons. 181 Furthermore, the Commission preliminarily estimates that SBS
Entities would make fewer than seven applications on an average annual basis. 182 Based on
those figures, the Commission estimates the economic costs to prepare, review, and submit
applications under proposed Rule of Practice 194 to be less than $95,380 per year. 183 The
Commission seeks comment on the reasonableness and accuracy of these estimates.
Notably, an SBS Entity would only submit such applications where the SBS Entity
believed that the economic value of retaining a particular person to effect security-based swaps
or continuing association with a statutorily disqualified entity outweighed the application costs
associated with proposed Rule of Practice 194. In other words, any application costs would be
incurred by SBS Entities on a voluntary basis. Furthermore, the decision to incur application
costs would also reflect an SBS Entity’s assessment of the likelihood of the Commission
181

See Section IV.D, supra.

182

See id.

183

This estimate is based on the following. Total burden hours = [(40 hours) x (2 SBS
Entities applying with respect to associated persons that are entities) + (30 hours) x (5
SBS Entities applying with respect to associated persons that are natural persons) + (3
hours) x (7 SBS Entities filing notices]. Attorney at $380 per hour x 251 burden hours =
$95,380. The hourly cost figure is based upon data from SIFMA’s Management &
Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013 (modified by the Commission staff
to account for an 1,800-hour-work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses,
firm size, employee benefits, and overhead).

- 116

-

granting relief under the public interest standard set forth in proposed Rule of Practice 194(b).
We also note that, under the baseline, an SBS Entity would not be precluded under
Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6) from seeking Commission relief. 184 However, as already
discussed, SBS Entities would lack clarity about the application process and, though they may
look to Rule of Practice 193 or similar processes as a guide, could potentially expend more
resources than necessary due to process uncertainty. Thus, notwithstanding the cost estimates
above, the proposed rule may mitigate application costs relative to the baseline due to the
structured process. We expect that this cost mitigation would be most significant for SBS
Entities that would be among the first to seek relief; SBS Entities seeking relief later would have
the benefit of learning by observing the process experienced by first-movers.
b.

Costs of the Commission, CFTC, SRO, Registered Futures
Association Provision

Exchange Act Rule 19h-1 provides for Commission review of notices filed by SROs
proposing to admit any person to, or continue any person in, membership or association with a
member, notwithstanding statutory disqualification. 185 The Commission does not review or
approve statutory disqualification decisions of NFA or CFTC. As a result, associated persons
may be able to transact in security-based swap markets on behalf of SBS Entities where the
Commission would not have made a determination on an individualized basis that it is consistent
with the public interest to permit them to do so had these persons been reviewed independently
by the Commission. Since this provision would result in a potentially greater number of
disqualified associated persons being permitted to effect or be involved in effecting securitybased swaps on behalf of SBS Entities, it may increase compliance and counterparty risks, but
184

See Section V.C, supra.

185

17 CFR 240.19h-1.

- 117

-

may decrease costs of business restructuring by affected SBS Entities, as discussed in section
V.D.
c.

Costs of the Temporary Exclusion

The temporary exclusion pending decision by the Commission, the CFTC, an SRO or a
registered futures association 186 is designed to mitigate SBS Entity costs of reassigning or
disassociating from statutorily disqualified associated person entities during the review process.
However, the provision allows associated person entities to continue to effect or be involved in
effecting security-based swaps on behalf of an SBS Entity after conduct that triggered statutory
disqualification and before the Commission, the CFTC, an SRO or a registered futures
association has made an individualized favorable determination. Statutory disqualification
triggers may point to risks of repeated misconduct or compliance shortcomings, and a review by
the Commission, the CFTC, an SRO or a registered futures association may result in a
determination that permitting such associations is not consistent with the public interest. In these
instances, statutorily disqualified associated person entities would have been effecting or
involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of SBS Entities, raising counterparty risks
during the review process as a result of the temporary exclusion. We note that if the
Commission, the CFTC, an SRO or a registered futures association does not render a decision
within 180 days, the temporary exclusion expires and SBS Entities will have 60 days to conform
with the general statutory prohibition. 187 The time-limited nature of the exclusion pending
review partially mitigates the potential risks to counterparties from disqualified entities effecting
or being involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of SBS Entities before the

186

See proposed Rule of Practice 194(i).

187

See proposed Rule of Practice 194(i)(1)(ii), (iii).

- 118

-

Commission renders a decision on the application.
Finally, if the CFTC, an SRO or a registered futures association renders an adverse
decision with respect to an entity that is an associated person an SBS Entity, SBS Entities will
have 60 days to conform with the general statutory prohibition. 188 In cases where the
Commission has made a determination that allowing an SBS Entity to permit an associated
person entity that is subject to a statutory disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting
security-based swaps is not consistent with the public interest, the Commission may provide an
extension to the temporary exclusion by order. 189 Associated person entities that are subject to a
statutory disqualification would be able to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps
on behalf of SBS Entities where the Commission, the CFTC, an SRO or NFA have made an
adverse determination based on the assessment of the facts and circumstances of the application,
which may pose risks to counterparties. However, these provisions provide time for SBS
Entities to restructure and comply with the statutory prohibition in Exchange Act Section
15F(b)(6) after disposition of the application. Further, with respect to the temporary exclusion
pending review by the Commission, in cases where an application has been disapproved, the
Commission will only provide an extension to the temporary exclusion where it deems doing so
is necessary or appropriate. 190
d.

Additional Costs

As we noted above, under proposed Rule of Practice 194, the Commission will make
public orders either approving or denying an application under the rule. 191 We note that SBS
188

See proposed Rule of Practice 194(i)(1)(iii).

189

190

191

- 119

-

Entities may prefer for such information to remain private if they believe that counterparties will
use this information as a signal of quality. Therefore, the reputational costs associated with
going through the process and potentially associating with statutorily disqualified persons may
discourage some SBS Entities from applying for relief under the proposed rule; such SBS
Entities may instead choose to disassociate with disqualified persons or reassign them (in the
case of natural persons) to responsibilities that do not involve effecting or being involved in
effecting security-based swaps.
Disassociation itself may be costly, particularly for SBS Entities associated with a
statutorily disqualified entity that is responsible for a large share of security-based swap
business. In considering disassociation, an SBS Entity will weigh reputational costs against the
cost of disassociation. For disqualified natural persons, such costs include the cost to an SBS
Entity of replacing an employee (or other associated person), and will depend on the scarcity and
value of a particular person’s skills. For statutorily disqualified associated person entities, such
costs may include the cost of eliminating or restructuring an entire business line.
3.

Effects on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation

The Commission has preliminarily assessed the effects arising from proposed Rule of
Practice 194 on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. As noted above, limiting the
ability of statutorily disqualified persons to effect security-based swaps on behalf of SBS Entities
may mitigate compliance and counterparty risks and may facilitate competition among higher
quality SBS Entities, enhancing integrity of security-based swap markets. At the same time,
limits on disqualified person participation in security-based swap markets may involve costly
business restructuring or costs of applying to the Commission for relief. As with the other
economic effects already discussed, effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation
flow primarily from how the rule alters an SBS Entity’s evaluation of the tradeoff between the
- 120

-

value of an associated person’s skill and expertise in effecting security-based swaps against the
costs of applying for relief, and how the rule alters an SBS Entity’s ultimate decision to seek
relief.
As noted above, by providing a structured process and clarity as to the standard of
review, proposed Rule of Practice 194 may conserve resources relative to the baseline for SBS
Entities applying for relief under Section 15F(b)(6), and therefore create a more efficient process
for SBS Entities that choose to apply. To the extent that the savings resulting from the proposed
rule may encourage more SBS Entities to apply for relief, especially in the case of associated
person entities, a greater number of SBS Entities may be able to effect security-based swaps
without potentially costly business restructuring.
SBS Entities incur reputational and application costs of permitting statutorily disqualified
persons to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps, and weigh these costs against
the level and substitutability of disqualified persons’ skills and expertise. Should more SBS
Entities apply for relief, a greater number of disqualified persons may seek employment and
business opportunities in security-based swap markets. However, persons eligible to rely on
paragraph (j) to proposed Rule of Practice 194, regarding disqualifications already reviewed by
the Commission, the CFTC, an SRO or a registered futures association, may enjoy a competitive
advantage over persons not eligible for the same treatment. Because SBS Entities would not
need to expend resources filing an application, they may prefer associating with persons who can
rely on proposed Rule of Practice 194(j) over their disqualified counterparts. If SBS Entities
exhibit a preference for persons that can take advantage of proposed Rule of Practice 194(j), it
could create competitive disparities among associated persons.
A temporary exclusion pending review by the Commission, the CFTC, an SRO or a

- 121

-

registered futures association, set forth in paragraph (i) to proposed Rule of Practice 194, would
enable SBS Entities to continue their security-based swap market participation without incurring
the costs of reassigning or disassociating from disqualified persons. As a result, SBS Entities
associating with entities that become subject to a statutory disqualification can continue dealing
in security-based swaps without incurring costs of business restructuring until the disposition of
the application. 192 SBS Entities that begin to associate with statutorily disqualified entities
would be eligible for the same temporary relief, conditional on timeliness of the application. If
the Commission denies the application under proposed Rule of Practice 194 related to an
associated person entity that is subject to a statutory disqualification, the Commission may by
order grant a temporary extension of the exclusion to enable the SBS Entity to become compliant
with the statutory prohibition in Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6). 193 Broadly, this temporary
exclusion may lower costs to SBS Entities of associating or beginning to associate with
statutorily disqualified entities.
The overall effects of the temporary exclusion from the general statutory prohibition
pending review are unclear. On the one hand, it may serve to mitigate potential disruptions
should associated entities of a number of SBS Entities become disqualified, leading some SBS
Entities to temporarily cease dealing activity pending Commission, CFTC, an SRO or registered
futures association review, or to effect business restructuring. At the same time, the presence
192

We note that with respect to applications for Commission review the proposed temporary
exclusion is time limited. If the Commission has not rendered a decision within 180 days
of filing a completed application under the Proposed Rule of Practice 194, SBS Entities
will have 60 days to become in compliance with the general statutory prohibition. See
proposed Rule of Practice 194(i)(1)(ii). If the Commission approves the application after
the temporary exclusion has expired, SBS Entities will again be able to permit the
disqualified associated entity to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on
their behalf.

193

See proposed Rule of Practice 194(i)(3).

- 122

-

and magnitude of the potential market disruption is unclear, since other SBS Entities are likely to
begin competing for the newly opened market share. The overall effects of this provision on
security-based swap market quality and competition depend primarily on whether and which
SBS Entities are able to win the newly opened market share in such cases.
Clarity about the items that the Commission will consider in making determinations may
allow SBS Entities to make informed assessments about whether a particular application is likely
to be approved or denied. Increased certainty about the process may, in turn, alter an SBS
Entity’s evaluation of its own cost-benefit tradeoff in determining whether to file an application
for relief, enabling the entity to more efficiently expend resources.
Finally, while security-based swaps are important financial instruments that may
facilitate the capital formation process, we preliminarily believe that the impact of proposed Rule
of Practice 194 on capital formation will be de minimis. Given that nothing about the statute
precludes either SBS Entities from seeking relief or the Commission from granting relief in the
absence of a rule, and given the low expected incidence of statutory disqualification among
natural persons associated with SBS Entities, we do not believe the rule will materially affect the
ability of either issuers to raise capital or financial intermediaries to hedge their investments with
issuers. Therefore, we do not expect the rule to have a material effect on capital formation,
either positively or negatively.
E.

Rule Alternatives

In addition to proposed Rule of Practice 194, the Commission has considered five
primary alternative approaches. We discuss these approaches below.
1.

Relief for All Entities from Exchange Act Section 15F(b)(6)

The Commission has considered blanket relief from the general prohibition in Exchange
Act Section 15F(b)(6) with respect to all associated person entities. Under this alternative, SBS
- 123

-

Entities cross-registered as Swap Entities with the CFTC would experience potential economies
of scope in associating with persons that are entities. Further, SBS Entities will avoid all costs of
business restructuring if associated person entities become statutorily disqualified, or in the event
of new associations with statutorily disqualified associated person entities effecting or involved
in effecting security-based swaps on their behalf.
Relative to the proposed temporary exclusion approach, SBS Entities would be less
constrained by the general statutory prohibition and would be able to associate with any and all
disqualified entity persons in any capacity without applying for relief under Exchange Act
Section 15F(b)(6) or under Rule of Practice 194. Further, the uniform entity exemption approach
gives SBS Entities certainty about their ability to permit disqualified entity persons to effect or
be involved in effecting security-based swaps, whereas the proposed temporary exclusion expires
after 180 days, and SBS Entities have 60 days to conform to the general statutory prohibition if
the Commission, the CFTC, an SRO or a registered futures association does not render a
decision on the application within that timeframe.
At the same time, the counterparty and compliance risks under the uniform entity
exemption approach may be greater than those under the proposed approach. If the Commission
excludes all disqualified associated entities from the scope of the general statutory prohibition,
the Commission would be unable to make an individualized determination under proposed Rule
of Practice 194 about whether permitting an associated person entity that is subject to a statutory
disqualification to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of an SBS
Entity is consistent with the public interest. 194 Further, statutory disqualification and an inability
194

However, the Commission could, by order, censure, place limitations on the activities or
functions of the associated person, or suspend or bar such person from being associated
with an SBS Entity. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(l)(3) and Note 98, supra.
- 124

-

to continue associating with SBS Entities may create a disincentive against underlying
misconduct for associated persons, and a blanket exception for disqualified associated persons
that are entities may reduce the disincentive against misconduct.
The overall effects of this alternative on security-based swap markets are unclear. Under
this alternative, disqualified persons would not undergo substantive review and all disqualified
entity persons would be able to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf
of SBS Entities, which may increase counterparty and compliance risks. However, SBS Entities
associating with disqualified persons would not have to undergo business restructuring, the costs
of which may flow through to counterparties, further mitigating the risk of disruptions.
2.

A Modified Temporary Exclusion

The Commission could adopt a modified temporary exclusion, where if the Commission
does not render a decision within 180 days the application would be considered granted. This
alternative would effectively default to relief from the statutory prohibition for applications for
Commission review, since SBS Entities would be able to permit disqualified associated entities
to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on their behalf, unless the Commission
makes an individualized determination that it is not consistent with the public interest to enable
them to do so within 180 days of the application being filed. This may benefit SBS Entities by
lowering uncertainty about the need to restructure the business and disassociate from the
disqualified entity person. However, it may lead some applications to be considered granted
before the Commission is able to perform an individualized assessment of the facts of each case,
particularly in complex cases that may require an extensive review. These modifications may
benefit SBS Entities, but may allow some disqualified associated entities to be able to effect or
be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of SBS Entities where the Commission
would not have deemed it consistent with the public interest to permit them to do so.
- 125

-

3.

Relief for Non-Investment-Related Offenses

The Commission could also adopt the approach of automatically excepting SBS Entities
that associate with statutorily disqualified persons if the matters that triggered the statutory
disqualification were non-investment-related, while requiring SBS Entities to apply for relief
under the proposed rules for investment-related statutory disqualifications. 195 Such an approach
would eliminate restructuring or application costs for SBS Entities associating with statutorily
disqualified persons when statutory disqualification arises out of non-investment related
offenses, which may increase competition among SBS Entity associated persons and attract new
natural persons into the SBS Entity labor market. SBS Entities associating with persons
statutorily disqualified for investment-related offenses would have to bear costs of disassociating
or applying for relief and would have to compete with a greater number of SBS Entities that do
not have to apply for relief.
Statutory disqualification and the potential inability to deal in various markets may
present an incentive against misconduct, including non-investment-related misconduct. This
alternative would also lower the information benefits of reviewing applications and supporting
materials, including information concerning supervisory structure, terms of employment and
other items, which will inform Commission understanding of SBS Entity associations and
ongoing oversight. Finally, some statutory disqualification triggers that may not fall in the
“investment related offense” category (e.g., thefts) may point to a higher risk of future
195

As discussed in the baseline, in a somewhat analogous scenario for broker dealers, 10 out
of 24, or approximately 42% of MC-400 applications for relief for individuals received
by FINRA in 2014 were for exclusively non-investment-related disqualifications. Over a
5 year period between 2010 and 2014, 2 out of 5 re-offenses by individuals were not
investment-related (177 MC-400 applications have been received over the same time
period). Reoffenses include subsequent regulatory actions and criminal offense
convictions after previous approvals to associate pursuant to Rule 19h-1, 17 CFR
240.19h-1.
- 126

-

misconduct, including violations of securities laws, federal rules and regulations thereunder.
Uniformly excepting such statutorily disqualified associated persons without an opportunity for
the Commission to review the circumstances of each case and to make a determination that
allowing SBS Entities to permit them to effect security-based swaps is consistent with the public
interest may pose risks to counterparties and security-based swap markets.
4.

No Relief for CFTC, SRO, Registered Futures Association Review

The proposed rules allow SBS Entities to permit statutorily disqualified persons to effect
or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on their behalf without an application to the
Commission, if the associated person’s membership, association, registration or listing as a
principal has been granted or otherwise approved by the CFTC, an SRO or a registered futures
association.

The proposed approach also provides a time limited temporary exclusion for

disqualified associated entities while their application before the CFTC, an SRO or a registered
futures association is pending; the proposed exclusion expires 180 days after the filing of an
application or initiation of a similar process, after which point SBS Entities have 60 days to
conform with the general statutory prohibition. The Commission could adopt an alternative
approach, under which such disqualified associated persons would not be automatically
permitted to effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of SBS Entities,
and would have to apply directly for a substantive review by the Commission under Rule of
Practice 194. The temporary exclusion pending Commission review would apply as proposed.
This alternative approach would allow the Commission to review the facts and
circumstances of each case and make an individualized public interest determination with respect
to each disqualified associated person concerning whether they should be permitted to effect or
be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of SBS Entities, and under which
conditions. If fewer SBS Entities choose to go through a separate review by the Commission,
- 127

-

this alternative may result in a smaller number of disqualified associated persons effecting or
involved in effecting security-based swaps. To the extent that statutory disqualification and
terms and conditions of reassociation may indicate compliance and counterparty risks, this may
improve compliance and counterparty protections for security-based swap market participants.
However, this alternative may increase costs for SBS Entities. Specifically, this
alternative would require SBS Entities to incur the application costs under Rule of Practice 194
with respect to associated persons that have already been approved by the CFTC, SRO or a
registered futures association, or costs of restructuring the business or disassociating from such
persons altogether. If the application is denied, SBS Entities would need to restructure the
business or disassociate from the associated person. In addition, in light of the high degree of
integration among swap and security-based swap markets and expected cross-registration, many
SBS Entities are expected to transact across swap, security-based swap and reference security
markets, and some SBS Entities may be relying on the same personnel and entities in effecting,
for instance, single name and index CDS. This approach would limit SBS Entity flexibility in
hiring and retaining disqualified associated persons where the SBS Entity believes the person’s
quality and expertise outweigh the reputational costs of associating with a disqualified person
and where the CFTC, an SRO or a registered futures association has made a favorable finding
with respect to the associated person.
The effects of this alternative on security-based swap markets will depend on the extent
of reliance by SBS Entities on disqualified persons approved by the CFTC, an SRO or a
registered futures association, magnitude of the above business restructuring costs, significance
of bilateral counterparty relationships, and the severity of compliance and counterparty risks
posed by disqualified associated persons. As discussed in earlier sections, we lack data or other

- 128

-

information to quantify these effects with any degree of certainty.
5.

No Relief for Entities from Exchange Act Section 15(F)(b)(6)

Lastly, the Commission could establish a uniform prohibition on associated person
entities subject to statutory disqualification effecting or being involved in effecting securitybased swaps on behalf of SBS Entities. Under this approach, all disqualified associated entities
not covered by the exemption in final registration rules would be barred from intermediating
security-based swaps on behalf of SBS Entities. To the extent that past disqualifications can
point to higher compliance and counterparty risks, this alternative could potentially strengthen
counterparty protections. Further, the inability to participate in various markets due to
disqualification disincentivizes misconduct. Adopting this approach would strengthen these
incentive effects, which may improve compliance with federal securities laws, rules and
regulations.
However, barring all disqualified associated entities from effecting or being involved in
effecting security-based swaps on behalf of SBS Entities would impose costs of business
restructuring for a number of SBS Entities, which may in turn affect market quality. In the event
of a disqualification after the compliance date of the final registration rules, SBS Entities would
be required to cease intermediating security-based swaps and restructure their business to
disassociate from all disqualified entities. If a number of entities associated with different SBS
Entities become disqualified at the same time, a number of SBS Entities may become
temporarily unable to effect security-based swaps due to disqualification. Currently, inter-dealer
transactions account for over 60% of single-name CDS transactions, which reflects the central
position of a small number of dealers, each of which may intermediate trades between many
hundreds of counterparties. If some of the central dealers are temporarily unable to effect
security-based swaps, higher transaction costs or market disruptions may occur. However, we
- 129

-

note that other SBS Entities may step in to pick up the market share. The overall economic
effects will depend on: (i) the costs and the required length of time for business restructuring;
(ii) which SBS Entities would be able to pick up the newly available market share; and (iii) the
relative importance of bilateral relationships between SBS Entities and counterparties.
Lastly, this alternative may decrease the number of entities seeking to associate with SBS
Entities since disqualified entity persons will no longer be able to effect or be involved in
effecting security-based swaps. Such disqualified entities may seek to associate with securitybased swap market participants that are not required to register (entities falling within the de
minimis exception set forth in Exchange Act Rule 3a71-2 196).

Request for Comment

The Commission is requesting comments regarding the economic analysis set forth here.
To the extent possible, the Commission requests that market participants and other commenters
provide supporting data and analysis with respect to the benefits, costs, and effects on
competition, efficiency, and capital formation of adopting proposed Rule of Practice 194, or any
reasonable alternatives.
Although the Commission is seeking comments on the economic analysis generally, the
Commission is also soliciting comment on the following specific issues:
Q-53. Has the Commission accurately characterized the costs and benefits of proposed
Rule of Practice 194? If not, why not? Should any of the costs or benefits be modified? What,
if any, other costs or benefits should the Commission take into account?
Q-54. Has the Commission accurately characterized the effects on competition,
efficiency, and capital formation arising from proposed Rule of Practice 194? If not, why not?

Q-55. Has the Commission reasonably estimated the application costs associated with
proposed Rule of Practice 194? Has the Commission reasonably estimated the average number
of applicants per year (with respect to both natural persons and entities)? Are there any other
costs that the Commission should take into account regarding preparing, reviewing, and
submitting an application under proposed Rule of Practice 194? If the application costs are too
high, how specifically should the Commission modify proposed Rule of Practice 194 to reduce
application costs?
Q-56. Is it a reasonable characterization that the effects of the rule on capital formation
will be de minimis? If not, why not?
Q-57. Has the Commission accurately characterized the costs, benefits, and effects on
competition, efficiency, and capital formation of the alternatives specified above? If not, why

REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT CERTIFICATION
A.

Regulatory Framework

The Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”) 197 requires federal agencies, in promulgating
rules, to consider the impact of those rules on small entities. Section 603(a) 198 of the

197

5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.

198

5 U.S.C. 603(a).

- 131

-

Administrative Procedure Act, 199 as amended by the RFA, generally requires the Commission to
undertake a regulatory flexibility analysis of all proposed rules, or proposed rule amendments, to
determine the impact of such rulemaking on “small entities.” 200 Section 605(b) of the RFA
provides that this requirement shall not apply to any proposed rule or proposed rule amendment,
which if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. 201
For purposes of Commission rulemaking in connection with the RFA, a small entity
includes: (i) when used with reference to an “issuer” or a “person,” other than an investment
company, an “issuer” or “person” that, on the last day of its most recent fiscal year, had total
assets of $5 million or less, 202 or (ii) a broker-dealer with total capital (net worth plus
subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the date in the prior fiscal year as of which its
audited financial statements were prepared pursuant to Rule 17a-5(d) under the Exchange Act, 203
or, if not required to file such statements, a broker-dealer with total capital (net worth plus
subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the last day of the preceding fiscal year (or in
the time that it has been in business, if shorter); and is not affiliated with any person (other than a

Although Section 601(b) of the RFA defines the term “small entity,” the statute permits
the Commission to formulate is own definition. The Commission has adopted definitions
for the term small entity for the purposes of Commission rulemaking in accordance with
the RFA. Those definitions, as relevant to this proposed rulemaking, are set forth in Rule
0-10, 17 CFR 240.0-10. See Exchange Act Release No. 18451, 47 FR 5212 (Feb. 4,
1982).

Under the standards adopted by the Small Business Administration, small entities in the
finance and insurance industry include the following:
(i)

for entities engaged in certain credit intermediation and related activities,
entities with $550 million or less in assets; 205

(ii)

for entities engaged in non-depository credit intermediation and certain other
activities, entities with $38.5 million or less in annual receipts; 206

(iii)

for entities engaged in financial investments and related activities, entities with
$38.5 million or less in annual receipts; 207

(iv)

for insurance carriers and entities engaged in related activities, entities with
$38.5 million or less in annual receipts, or 1,500 employees for direct property
and casualty insurance carriers; 208 and

(v)

for funds, trusts, and other financial vehicles, entities with $32.5 million or less
in annual receipts. 209

SBA definitions of small businesses apply to a firm’s parent company and all affiliates as
a single entity. 210

application by SBS Entity to the Commission for an order permitting an associated person that is
a natural person and that is subject to a statutorily disqualification to effect or be involved in
effecting security-based swaps on behalf of an SBS Entity. With respect to SBS Entities, based
on feedback from market participants and our information about the security-based swap
markets, the Commission continues to believe that (1) the types of entities that would engage in
more than a de minimis amount of dealing activity involving security-based swap—which
generally would be large financial institutions—would not be “small entities” for purposes of the
RFA; and (2) the types of entities that may have security-based swap positions above the level
required to be a “major security-based swap participant” would not be “small entities” for
purposes of the RFA. 211
C.

Certification and Request for Comment

For the foregoing reasons, the Commission certifies that the proposed Rule of Practice
194 would not, if adopted, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities for purposes of the RFA.
The Commission encourages written comments regarding this certification. The
Commission requests that commenters describe the nature of any impact on small entities and
provide supporting data to support the extent of the impact.
VII.

CONSIDERATION OF IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY
For purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996

(“SBREFA”) 212 the Commission requests comment on the potential effect of proposed Rule of
Practice 194 on the United States economy on an annual basis. The Commission also requests

any potential effect on competition, investment, or innovation. Commenters are requested to
provide empirical data and other factual support for their views to the extent possible.
VIII. STATUTORY AUTHORITY

the information specifically required by the rule, with respect to associated persons that are
natural persons, applications should be supplemented, where appropriate, by written statements
of individuals who are competent to attest to the associated person’s character, employment
performance, and other relevant information. In addition to the information required by the rule,
the Commission staff may request supplementary information to assist in the Commission’s
review. Intentional misstatements or omissions of fact may constitute criminal violations of 18
U.S.C. 1001, et seq. and other provisions of law. The Commission will not consider any
application that attempts to reargue or collaterally attack the findings that resulted in the statutory
disqualification.
(d) The nature of the supervision that an associated person that is a natural person will
receive or exercise as an associated person with a registered entity is an important matter bearing
upon the public interest. In meeting the burden of showing that permitting the associated person
to effect or be involved in effecting security based swaps on behalf of the security-based swap
dealer or major security-based swap participant is consistent with the public interest, the
application and supporting documentation must demonstrate that the terms or conditions of
association, procedures or proposed supervision, are reasonably designed to ensure that the
statutory disqualification does not negatively impact upon the ability of the associated person to
effect or be involved in effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the security-based swap
dealer or major security-based swap participant in compliance with the applicable statutory and
regulatory framework.

(e) Normally, the applicant’s burden of demonstrating that permitting the associated
person to effect or be involved in effecting security based swaps on behalf of the security-based
swap dealer or major security-based swap participant is consistent with the public interest will be
difficult to meet where the associated person that is a natural person is to be supervised by, or is
to supervise, another statutorily disqualified individual. In addition, where the associated person
wishes to become the sole proprietor of a registered entity and thus is applying to the
Commission to issue an order permitting the associated person to effect or be involved in
effecting security-based swaps on behalf of the security-based swap dealer or major securitybased swap participant notwithstanding an absence of supervision, the applicant’s burden will be
difficult to meet. The associated person may be limited to association in a specified capacity
with a particular registered entity and may also be subject to specific terms and conditions.
By the Commission.
