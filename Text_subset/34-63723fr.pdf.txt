Exchange Act of 1934 (‘‘Exchange Act’’),2
which governs the handling of proposed
rule changes submitted by selfregulatory organizations (‘‘SROs’’).
Among other things, the Dodd-Frank
Act’s amendments to Section 19 of the
Exchange Act require the Securities and
Exchange Commission (‘‘Commission’’)
to promulgate rules setting forth the
procedural requirements of proceedings
to determine whether a proposed rule
change should be disapproved. In
satisfaction of this requirement, the
Commission is adopting new Rules of
Practice to formalize the process it will
use when conducting proceedings to
determine whether an SRO’s proposed
rule change should be disapproved
under Section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange

Commission will use when conducting
proceedings to determine whether a
PCAOB proposed rule should be
disapproved.

instituting proceedings to determine
whether an SRO’s proposed rule change
should be disapproved under Section
19(b) of the Exchange Act (§ 201.700 et
seq.) and is making corresponding
changes to Rule 19b–4 under the
Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(4)). The
Commission is also adding Rule 170 to
Regulation P 5 to provide that § 201.700

I. Discussion of Rule Amendments
A. Background
Section 916 of the Dodd-Frank Act
amended Section 19(b) of the Exchange
Act, which governs the Commission’s
handling of proposed rule changes
submitted by SROs, including national
securities exchanges, the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority
(‘‘FINRA’’), and registered clearing
agencies.6 Notably, the amendments to
Section 19(b) in Section 916 of the
Dodd-Frank Act established new
statutory deadlines applicable to the
Commission’s publication and review of
proposed SRO rule changes.7
4 17

CFR 201 et seq.
CFR 202.100 et seq.
6 Pursuant to Section 107 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (3) of
Section 19(b) of the Exchange Act also govern
proposed rules of the PCAOB.
7 Pursuant to Rule 30–3(a) (17 CFR 200.30–3(a)),
the Commission has delegated authority to the
Division of Trading and Markets for certain
functions related to the handling of proposed rule
changes filed by SROs under Section 19 of the
Exchange Act.

Among other things, amended Section
19(b) imposes a requirement that an
SRO’s proposed rule change be sent by
the Commission to the Federal Register
for publication within 15 days of the
date on which the SRO posted its
proposed rule change on its Web site.8
Further, Section 916(a) of the DoddFrank Act amended Section 19(b)(2) of
the Exchange Act to require the
Commission, within 45 days of the
‘‘publication date’’ of notice of a
proposed rule change, to either approve
a proposed rule change, disapprove a
proposed rule change, or institute
proceedings to determine whether the
proposed rule change should be
disapproved.9 With the exception of the
ability to disapprove a proposed rule
change without first instituting
proceedings, the authority to either
approve a proposed rule change or
institute proceedings to determine
whether a proposed rule change should
be disapproved is not new.
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act
removed the concept of ‘‘abrogation’’ of
a filing that an SRO designated to be
effective immediately upon filing with
the Commission. Prior to the DoddFrank Act, the Commission had the
authority, within 60 days of the date of
filing, to summarily abrogate a proposed
rule change filed for immediate
effectiveness under former Section
19(b)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act 10 if the
Commission determined that such
action was necessary or appropriate in
the public interest, for the protection of
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of
the purposes of the Exchange Act.11
Abrogation suspended the effectiveness
of an immediately effective proposal
and obligated the SRO, if it desired to
proceed with its proposed rule change,
to refile the proposal for notice,
8 See Section 19(b)(2)(E) of the Exchange Act (15
U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(E)), as added by Section 916(a) of
the Dodd-Frank Act. The 15-day period commences
when the SRO, ‘‘after filing a proposed rule change
with the Commission,’’ posts its proposal on a
publicly available Web site. See id. Separately, Rule
19b–4(l) under the Exchange Act requires the SRO
to post a proposal on its Web site within two
business days after filing the proposal with the
Commission. See 17 CFR 240.19b–4(l). If the
Commission fails to send the notice to the Federal
Register by the applicable deadline, then the
‘‘publication date’’ would be deemed to be the date
on which the SRO Web site publication was made.
See 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(E).
9 See Exchange Act Section 19(b)(2)(A)(i). The
initial 45-day period may be extended by either the
Commission or the SRO for up to an additional 45
days to a maximum of 90 days total. See 15 U.S.C.
78s(b)(2)(A)(ii). If the Commission subsequently
fails to act within the applicable time frame, then
the proposed rule change will be ‘‘deemed to have
been approved.’’ See 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(D).
10 See 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A). 

11 See former Section 19(b)(3)(C); former 15

comment, and Commission
consideration under Section 19(b)(2) of
the Exchange Act. Section 916(c) of the
Dodd-Frank Act amended Section
19(b)(3)(C) of the Exchange Act and
replaced abrogation with a process in
which the Commission may
‘‘temporarily suspend’’ a proposed rule
change (if it appears to the Commission
that such action is necessary or
appropriate in the public interest, for
the protection of investors, or otherwise
in furtherance of the purposes of the
Exchange Act) and then must institute
proceedings under Section 19(b)(2)(B) to
determine whether to approve or
disapprove the SRO rule change.12
Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act’s
amendments to Section 19, proceedings
to determine whether to disapprove a
proposed rule change were rarely begun
and even more rarely concluded.13
Rather, an SRO typically modified or
withdrew a proposal when it
understood the Commission or its staff
had concerns that could lead it to
institute such proceedings. The DoddFrank Act’s amendments to Section 19
may increase the number of proceedings
that the Commission determines to
institute because, among other things,
the new authority to ‘‘temporarily
suspend’’ an immediately effective filing
obligates the Commission to institute
proceedings to determine whether to
disapprove the SRO rule change with
the imposition of the suspension. That
provision, together with the new
statutory deadlines applicable to
Commission review and publication of
an SRO’s proposed rule change, will
further increase the Commission’s
workload. Consequent constraints on
Commission resources would be
compounded to the extent that the
Commission continues to receive an
increasing number of proposed rule
changes from an increasing number of
SROs.
B. Rule Amendments
As required by Section 19(b)(2)(F) of
the Exchange Act (added by Section
916(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act), the
Commission is promulgating new Rules
of Practice setting forth the procedural
requirements for proceedings to
determine whether to disapprove an
SRO’s proposed rule change.14
12 See 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(C). Section 19(b)(3)(C)
further provides that a temporary suspension is not
reviewable under Exchange Act Section 25 nor is
it deemed to be ‘‘final agency action.’’
13 See, e.g., infra note 16 (citing to a 1984
disapproval proceeding order).
14 See 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(F). Section 19(b)(2)(F)
also requires the Commission, as part of its effort
to promulgate rules setting forth the procedural
requirements for proceedings to determine whether

Specifically, the Commission is
adopting rules to outline the procedures
that it will follow when exercising its
authority under Section 19(b)(2)(A)(i)(II)
of the Exchange Act, pursuant to which
the Commission either (1) may institute
proceedings to determine whether a
proposed rule change filed under
Section 19(b)(2) should be disapproved
or (2) shall institute such proceedings to
determine whether to disapprove an
immediately effective proposed rule
change filed under Section 19(b)(3)(A)
that the Commission determined to
temporarily suspend.
The procedural rules that the
Commission now is adopting are
intended to implement the mandate
imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act.15 The
rules also are intended to bring
transparency to the conduct of
proceedings to disapprove a proposed
rule change under Section 19(b) of the
Exchange Act and reflect the process
that the Commission generally has
followed when it has had occasion to
conduct such proceedings.16 Among
other things, the new rules outline the
process that the Commission will follow
to provide to the SRO notice of the
grounds for disapproval under
consideration.17
While the new rules are not within
the scope of the existing Rules of
Practice, they do incorporate three
existing Rules of Practice by reference:
Rule 103 (Construction of Rules), 104
(Business Hours), and 160 (Time
Computation). Rule 103, among other
things, specifies that the Rules of
Practice ‘‘shall be construed and
administered to secure the just, speedy,
and inexpensive determination of every
proceeding.’’ 18 It also states that counsel
to disapprove an SRO’s proposed rule change, to
have ‘‘consult[ed] with other regulatory agencies.’’
Id. In satisfaction of this requirement, Commission
staff has consulted with staff from the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Reserve
Board, and the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency.
15 Rules 700 and 701 are not affected by the other
Rules of Practice contained in part 201, except as
specifically provided for in Rule 700. See
amendment to Rule of Practice 100 (‘‘Scope of the
Rules of Practice’’) adding new subparagraph (b)(3).
16 See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No.
21439 (October 31, 1984), 49 FR 44577 (November
7, 1984) (File Nos. SR–CBOE–84–15 and SR–CBOE–
84–16) (Order Instituting Proceedings to Determine
Whether to Disapprove Rule Changes).
17 Though in a proceeding to determine whether
to disapprove a proposed rule change the
Commission is required to publish notice of its
grounds for disapproval under consideration, the
Commission could ultimately either disapprove or
approve the proposal following conclusion of the
proceedings. See Exchange Act Section 19(b)(2)(C);
15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(C) (setting forth the standards
applicable to Commission approval or disapproval
of a proposed rule change). See also infra note 27.

for a party may take any action required
or permitted to be taken by such party.19
Rule 104 sets forth the business hours
of the Commission, which will be
applicable to the filing of papers with
the Commission.20 Rule 160 governs the
computation of time periods, which will
be applicable when the Commission
establishes, for example, deadlines by
which comments must be received.21
Consistent with Exchange Act Section
19(b)(2)(B), when instituting
proceedings to determine whether to
disapprove an SRO’s proposed rule
change, the new rules state that the
Commission shall provide notice to the
SRO and to the public of the grounds for
disapproval under consideration. This
notice shall include a brief statement of
the matters of fact and law that the
Commission is considering in
determining whether to disapprove the
rule filing.22 In addition to publication
of such notice in the Federal Register,
the rules provide that the Commission
also will serve a copy of the notice to
the SRO that filed the proposed rule
change.23
As reflected in new Rule 700(b)(1),
such notice of the grounds for
disapproval under consideration may be
provided either simultaneously with the
initial publication by the Commission of
the notice of the SRO’s proposed rule
change in the Federal Register, or it
may be published separately in the
Federal Register subsequent to the
initial publication by the Commission of
the notice of the SRO’s proposed rule
change in the Federal Register.
Providing for publication of the grounds
for disapproval under consideration
simultaneous with the initial
publication of the proposed rule change
in the Federal Register recognizes that
a proposed rule change may initially
raise questions as to whether the
Commission would be able to approve
the proposal as consistent with the
Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to the
SRO. Simultaneous publication will
allow the Commission to highlight
prominently for public comment issues
19 See

17 CFR 201.103(c)(3).
17 CFR 201.104.
21 See 17 CFR 201.160. Among other things, Rule
160 addresses compliance with deadlines that fall
on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday.
22 As stated in Rule 700(e), the Commission is not
required to amend its notice of the grounds for
disapproval under consideration to consider
additional matters of fact and law beyond what was
set forth in its notice of the grounds for disapproval
under consideration.
23 Specifically, in addition to Federal Register
publication, notice will be served to the contact
person listed on the cover page of the Form
19b–4 filing filed with the Commission. See Rule
700(b)(1)(iii).

on which it seeks comment in an
efficient manner when the proposal is
first noticed for public comment. In
addition, it will allow the Commission
to proceed without additional delay to
act on a proposed rule change in a more
efficient manner. Alternatively,
providing for publication of the grounds
for disapproval under consideration
subsequent to the initial publication of
the proposed rule change in the Federal
Register recognizes that commenters or
the Commission may identify an issue
with a proposal after a proposal was
published for comment that warrants
the institution of proceedings to
determine whether to disapprove the
proposal. Further, as a consequence of
the short timeframe for noticing a
proposal that is established in revised
Section 19(b) of the Exchange Act, the
Commission may be compelled to
publish filings that are later found to
raise concerns under the Exchange Act,
in which case the Commission may
decide to institute proceedings
subsequent to the initial publication of
the proposed rule change in the Federal
Register.24
When instituting proceedings, Section
19(b)(2)(B)(i)(II) of the Exchange Act
requires the Commission to provide the
SRO with an opportunity for a hearing.
Accordingly, new Rule 700(c) outlines
the conduct of the proceedings and
establishes the opportunity for the SRO
that filed the proposed rule change, as
well as any other interested parties, to
be heard on the matter. Specifically,
Rule 700(c) states that all parties,
including the SRO, will be given a
specified amount of time (as indicated
in the notice of the grounds for
disapproval) to submit supporting or
opposing materials, in writing, for the
Commission’s consideration in
determining whether to approve or
disapprove a proposed rule change.25 In

particular, the SRO that submitted the
proposed rule change could file a
written statement in support of its
proposed rule change demonstrating, in
specific detail, how such proposed rule
change is consistent with the
requirements of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder
applicable to the SRO.26 The statement
could include a response to each of the
grounds for disapproval under
consideration as well as any specific
representations or undertakings (e.g.,
representations or undertakings
concerning the SRO’s plans for
surveillance or enforcement of a
proposed new trading rule).
At the conclusion of the initial
opportunity to submit written materials,
the rules provide an opportunity for the
SRO whose proposed rule change is
under consideration to respond to any
comments received on its proposal (i.e.,
a ‘‘rebuttal period’’).27 The rules state
that any failure by the SRO to respond
to comments received on the proposal
may result in the Commission not
having a sufficient basis to make an
affirmative finding as to whether the
SRO’s proposed rule change is
consistent with the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder
applicable to the SRO.28
Further, the new rules state that the
Commission may consider any failure
by the SRO to provide all of the
information required by Form 19b–4 in
the manner required by the Form, as
well as any failure to explain how the
proposed rule change is consistent with
the requirements of the Exchange Act
and the applicable rules and regulation
thereunder or any failure by the SRO to
provide a complete response to the
Commission’s grounds for disapproval
under consideration, in determining
whether to approve or disapprove the

24 As required by Section 19(b)(2)(E) of the
Exchange Act (added by Section 916(a) of the DoddFrank Act), the Commission must send notice of an
SRO’s proposed rule change to the Federal Register
for publication within 15 calendar days of the date
on which the SRO posts its proposed rule change
on its Web site. Failure to meet the 15 calendar day
statutory timeframe results in the ‘‘publication date’’
being deemed to be the day on which the SRO
posted its proposal on its Web site. Because the 45day statutory deadline for Commission action is
keyed off of the ‘‘publication date,’’ and because
failure to act by that deadline results in a proposal
being ‘‘deemed approved,’’ failure to notice a
proposal within 15 calendar days can effectively
reduce the time that the Commission and
commenters have to fully consider a proposal.
25 A request for an opportunity for an oral
presentation of views should be submitted as a
written request to the Secretary of the Commission
and should include a reference to the proposed rule
change’s file number. See Exchange Act Rule
19b–4(g). The Commission, in its sole discretion,
may determine whether any issues relevant to

approval or disapproval would be facilitated by the
opportunity for an oral presentation of views. See
Rule 700(c)(2).
26 Notably, the instructions to Form 19b–4 require
an SRO to present, in a clear and comprehensible
manner, how every proposed rule change it files
with the Commission is consistent with the
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to the SRO. These
standards are reflected in Rule 700(b)(3).
27 The Commission will indicate in the notice of
the grounds for disapproval the specified amount of
time for the rebuttal period. See Rule 700(c)(3).
28 The standard for approval of a proposed rule
change is that the Commission ‘‘shall approve a
proposed rule change * * * if it finds that such
proposed rule change is consistent with the
requirements of [the Exchange Act] and the rules
and regulations issued under [the Exchange Act]
that are applicable to [the SRO].’’ 15 U.S.C.
78s(b)(2)(C)(i). The standard for disapproval is that
the Commission ‘‘shall disapprove a proposed rule
change of [an SRO] if it does not make [such
finding].’’ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2)(C)(ii).

proposed rule change.29 In particular,
such failure may result in the
Commission not having a sufficient
basis to make an affirmative finding that
the proposed rule change is consistent
with the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to the
SRO.
After conclusion of the initial
comment period and the rebuttal period,
the opportunity for interested parties to
comment on the proposed rule change
would close. Thereafter, the
Commission would issue a written order
either approving or disapproving the
SRO’s proposed rule change that sets
out the reasons for the Commission’s
determination.30
The new rules also specify the record
that the Commission will consider in
the context of a proceeding to determine
whether to disapprove an SRO’s
proposed rule change. Specifically, Rule
700(d)(3) states that the Commission
will determine the matter on the basis
of the record, which shall include the
SRO’s proposed rule change filed on
Form 19b–4, any written materials
received from any party on the proposed
rule change, and any written materials
that reflect communications between
the Commission and any interested
parties.31 Further, the rules reflect that
written materials shall be filed with the
Secretary of the Commission and that all
materials received will generally be
made publicly available.
Further, the Commission is making
conforming edits to Rule 19b–4 in light
of new Rules of Practice 700 and 701.
In particular, the Commission is
removing existing paragraph (g) of that
rule, which references the opportunity
for interested persons to be heard in the
context of a proceeding to determine
whether to disapprove a proposed rule
change, and is replacing it with a cross
29 In addition, a filing that does not comply with
all applicable requirements, including the
requirements of Form 19b–4, may be rejected as not
properly filed under the circumstances outlined in
Section 19(b)(10) of the Exchange Act. See Section
19(b)(10) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(10)
(setting forth the rule of construction relating to the
filing date of proposed rule changes and the ability
of the Commission to reject incomplete filings).
Specifically, as stated in the general instructions to
Form 19b–4, any filing that does not comply with
the requirements of Form 19b–4 may be returned
to the SRO and any filing so returned shall for all
purposes be deemed not to have been filed with the
Commission. See also Rule 0–3 under the Exchange

reference to new Rules of Practice 700–
701.32 In addition, the Commission is
amending paragraph (l) of Rule 19b–4
concerning the obligation of an SRO to
post and maintain a copy of each
proposed rule change on its Web site to
provide specific guidance to the SRO as
to when to remove a proposed rule
change that is disapproved by the
Commission. Currently, Rule 19b–4(l)
does not specifically reference a
Commission disapproval order as one of
the potential final actions on a proposal.
Finally, the Commission is adding
Rule 170 to Regulation P 33 to provide
that § 201.700 et seq. establishes the
procedures for instituting proceedings
to determine whether a PCAOB
proposed rule should be disapproved.
Specifically, and consistent with
Section 107 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
new Rule 170 clarifies that § 201.700 et
seq applies to proposed rules of the
PCAOB as fully as if it were a proposed
rule change of a ‘‘registered securities
association’’. Rule 170, like Section
107(b)(4)(A) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
substitutes the approval criteria to be
‘‘consistent with the requirements of
title I of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
and the rules and regulations issued
thereunder applicable to such
organization, or as necessary or
appropriate in the public interest or for
the protection of investors * * *.’’
Further, given that the PCAOB is not
explicitly subject to Rule 19b–4, Rule
170 also clarifies the requirement for the
PCAOB to demonstrate that a proposed
rule is ‘‘consistent with the requirements
of title I of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, and the rules and regulations
issued thereunder applicable to such
organization, or as necessary or
appropriate in the public interest or for
the protection of investors.’’ 34
II. Administrative Procedure Act,
Regulatory Flexibility Act, and
Paperwork Reduction Act
The Commission finds, in accordance
with the Administrative Procedure Act
(‘‘APA’’),35 that the new rules and rule
amendments relate solely to agency
organization, procedures or practices.
Accordingly, these new rules and rule
amendments are not subject to the
provisions of the APA requiring notice,
opportunity for public comment, and
publication. The Regulatory Flexibility
32 Rule 19b–4(g) is consistent with the process
outlined in new Rules of Practice 700 and 701.
However, to avoid any confusion or overlap, the
Commission is amending the Rule 19b–4(g) to cross
reference the new Rules of Practice.

Act,36 therefore, does not apply.
Similarly, because these rules relate to
‘‘agency organization, procedure or
practice that does not substantially
affect the rights or obligations of nonagency parties,’’ analysis of major status
under the Small Business Regulatory
Enforcement Fairness Act is not
required.37 The new rules and rule
amendments do not contain any new
collection of information requirements
as defined by the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1995, as amended.38 Rather, the
new rules and rule amendments govern
a process that the Commission will be
able to institute when an SRO’s
proposed rule change submitted on
Form 19b–4 failed to provide the
Commission with a sufficient basis to
make a finding whether the proposed
rule change was or was not consistent
with the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to the
SRO. The required scope of information
that an SRO must submit to the
Commission to explain each proposed
rule change and demonstrate that each
proposed rule change is consistent with
the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder is established in
existing Form 19b–4, and the rules and
rule amendments do not contain any
additional collection of information
requirements beyond what SROs are
already required to provide to the
Commission.
III. Consideration of the Costs and
Benefits of the Rule Amendments and
Burden on Competition
The Commission is sensitive to the
costs and benefits imposed by its rules
and has identified certain costs and
benefits of these rules. The rules and
rule amendments that the Commission
is adopting are intended to implement
the mandate imposed by the DoddFrank Act. The benefits of the new rules
and rule amendments also include
increased transparency of the
Commission’s conduct of proceedings to
determine whether to disapprove an
SRO’s proposed rule change. New Rules
201.700 and 701 and new Rule 170
under Regulation P establish procedures
for the Commission to follow when
instituting and conducting proceedings
to determine whether to disapprove a
proposed rule filing. The new rules and
rule amendments provide procedures
for the Commission, SROs, the PCAOB,
and the public concerning the
administration of certain of the
Commission’s responsibilities under
Section 19 of the Exchange Act and

Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 15 / Monday, January 24, 2011 / Rules and Regulations

Section 107 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
and reflect a process that is intended to
help ensure that only those proposed
rule changes that are consistent with the
Exchange Act and title I of the SarbanesOxley Act, respectively, are permitted.
There also are potential costs of the
new rules. An SRO or the PCAOB may
incur costs as a result of the new rules,
for example, when submitting written
material in support of its proposed rule
change or providing a response to any
adverse comments received. However,
the Commission believes that such costs
typically are already incurred by the
SROs when filing proposed rule changes
on Form 19b–4, particularly since Form
19b–4 contains comprehensive and
rigorous requirements that an SRO must
follow when presenting, explaining, and
offering a thorough legal analysis of
each proposed rule change. Further,
SROs already typically submit
responses to adverse substantive
comments received during the rule
filing process. Similarly, the PCAOB has
incurred costs by presenting,
explaining, and offering similarly
rigorous legal analysis of each of its
proposed rules.
Further, because the new rules and
rule amendments relate to agency
organization, procedures or practice, the
Commission believes that they will have
no adverse impact on capital formation,
nor are they expected to have any
potential adverse impact on efficiency.
In particular, the new rules and rule
amendments are intended to add
transparency to the Commission’s
institution and conduct of proceedings
to determine whether to disapprove a
proposed rule change. To the extent that
interested parties identify issues and
present information that informs the
Commission’s decision-making with
respect to a particular proposed rule
change that itself may affect capital
formation or price efficiency, then the
Commission’s new rules and rule
amendments could, in turn, promote
capital formation and efficiency.
Section 23(a) of the Exchange Act 39
requires the Commission, when making
rules and regulations under the
Exchange Act, to consider the impact a
new rule would have on competition.
Exchange Act Section 23(a)(2) prohibits
the Commission from adopting any rule
that would impose a burden on
competition not necessary or
appropriate in furtherance of the
purposes of the Exchange Act.
The new rules and rule amendments
implement the Dodd-Frank Act
statutory changes to the rule change
process and are intended to enhance

transparency with respect to the
Commission’s conduct of proceedings
under the Exchange Act to determine
whether to disapprove an SRO’s
proposed rule change or a proposed rule
of the PCAOB. The new rules, which set
forth the administrative procedures
concerning the Commission’s conduct
of such proceedings, apply equally to all
SROs, including all national securities
exchanges, FINRA, and clearing
agencies that are required to submit
proposed rule filing changes with the
Commission. We note that many of the
substantive requirements of the new
rules come directly from the
amendments to Exchange Act Section
19(b) by the Dodd-Frank Act. In
addition, these rules are intended to
codify and reflect the typical process
that the Commission has followed when
conducting proceedings to determine
whether to disapprove an SRO’s
proposed rule change. Therefore, the
Commission does not expect the rules to
have an anti-competitive effect. To the
contrary, the new rules provide all
interested parties with an opportunity to
express their views to the Commission
concerning an SRO’s proposed rule
change or a proposed rule of the PCAOB
that the Commission is considering
potentially disapproving. To that extent,
the new rules are expected to promote
competition and help ensure that SRO
rules are consistent with the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder and PCAOB rules and
standards are consistent with the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.
IV. Statutory Basis and Text of Rules
The Commission is amending its
Rules of Practice and Rule 19b–4
pursuant to authority set forth in the
Exchange Act, including Sections 19(b)
and 23(a). The Commission is amending
Regulation P pursuant to authority set
forth in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
including Sections 3(b) and 107 and the
Exchange Act, including Sections 19(b)
and 23(a).

■ 3. Add §§ 201.700 and 201.701 to read
as follows:
§ 201.700 Initiation of proceedings for SRO
proposed rule changes.

(a) Rules of Practice. For purposes of
these Rules of Practice contained at 17
CFR 201.700 through 201.701, the
following Rules of Practice apply:
(1) Rule 103, 17 CFR 201.103
(Construction of Rules);
(2) Rule 104, 17 CFR 201.104
(Business Hours); and
(3) Rule 160, 17 CFR 201.160 (Time
Computation).
(b) Institution of proceedings; notice
and opportunity to submit written
views.
(1) Generally. If the Commission
determines to initiate proceedings to
determine whether a self-regulatory
organization’s proposed rule change
should be disapproved, it shall provide
notice thereof to the self-regulatory
organization that filed the proposed rule
change, as well as all interested parties
and the public, by publication in the
Federal Register of the grounds for
disapproval under consideration.
(i) Prior to notice. If the Commission
determines to institute proceedings
prior to initial publication by the
Commission of the notice of the selfregulatory organization’s proposed rule
change in the Federal Register, then the
Commission shall publish notice of the
proposed rule change simultaneously
with a brief summary of the grounds for
disapproval under consideration.
(ii) Subsequent to notice. If the
Commission determines to institute
proceedings subsequent to initial
publication by the Commission of the
notice of the self-regulatory
organization’s proposed rule change in
the Federal Register, then the
Commission shall publish separately in
the Federal Register a brief summary of
the grounds for disapproval under
consideration.

Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 15 / Monday, January 24, 2011 / Rules and Regulations
(iii) Service of an order instituting
proceedings. In addition to publication
in the Federal Register of the grounds
for disapproval under consideration, the
Secretary, or another duly authorized
officer of the Commission, shall serve a
copy of the grounds for disapproval
under consideration to the selfregulatory organization that filed the
proposed rule change by serving notice
to the person listed as the contact
person on the cover page of the Form
19b–4 filing. Notice shall be made by
delivering a copy of the order to such
contact person either by any method
specified in 17 CFR 201.141(a) or by
electronic means including e-mail.
(2) Notice of the grounds for
disapproval under consideration. The
grounds for disapproval under
consideration shall include a brief
statement of the matters of fact and law
on which the Commission instituted the
proceedings, including the areas in
which the Commission may have
questions or may need to solicit
additional information on the proposed
rule change. The Commission may
consider during the course of the
proceedings additional matters of fact
and law beyond what was set forth in
its notice of the grounds for disapproval
under consideration.
(3) Demonstration of consistency with
the Exchange Act. The burden to
demonstrate that a proposed rule change
is consistent with the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations issued
thereunder that are applicable to the
self-regulatory organization is on the
self-regulatory organization that
proposed the rule change. As reflected
in the General Instructions to Form 19b–
4, the Form is designed to elicit
information necessary for the public to
provide meaningful comment on the
proposed rule change and for the
Commission to determine whether the
proposed rule change is consistent with
the requirements of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations
thereunder applicable to the selfregulatory organization. The selfregulatory organization must provide all
information elicited by the Form,
including the exhibits, and must present
the information in a clear and
comprehensible manner. In particular,
the self-regulatory organization must
explain why the proposed rule change
is consistent with the requirements of
the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to the
self-regulatory organization. A mere
assertion that the proposed rule change
is consistent with those requirements, or
that another self-regulatory organization
has a similar rule in place, is not
sufficient. Instead, the description of the

VerDate Mar<15>2010

14:05 Jan 21, 2011

Jkt 223001

proposed rule change, its purpose and
operation, its effect, and a legal analysis
of its consistency with applicable
requirements must all be sufficiently
detailed and specific to support an
affirmative Commission finding. Any
failure of the self-regulatory
organization to provide the information
elicited by Form 19b–4 may result in the
Commission not having a sufficient
basis to make an affirmative finding that
a proposed rule change is consistent
with the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations issued thereunder that are
applicable to the self-regulatory
organization.
(c) Conduct of hearings.
(1) Initial comment period in writing.
Unless otherwise specified by the
Commission in its notice of grounds for
disapproval under consideration, all
interested persons will be given an
opportunity to submit written data,
views, and arguments concerning the
proposed rule change under
consideration and whether the
Commission should approve or
disapprove the proposed rule change.
The self-regulatory organization that
submitted the proposed rule change
may file a written statement in support
of its proposed rule change
demonstrating, in specific detail, how
such proposed rule change is consistent
with the requirements of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder applicable to the selfregulatory organization, including a
response to each of the grounds for
disapproval under consideration. Such
statement may include specific
representations or undertakings by the
self-regulatory organization. The
Commission will specify in the
summary of the grounds for disapproval
under consideration the length of the
initial comment period.
(2) Oral. The Commission, in its sole
discretion, may determine whether any
issues relevant to approval or
disapproval would be facilitated by the
opportunity for an oral presentation of
views.
(3) Rebuttal. At the end of the initial
comment period, the self-regulatory
organization that filed the proposed rule
change will be given an opportunity to
respond to any comments received. The
self-regulatory organization may
voluntarily file, or the Commission may
request a self-regulatory organization to
file, a response to a comment received
regarding any aspect of the proposed
rule change under consideration to
assist the Commission in determining
whether the proposed rule change
should be disapproved. The
Commission will specify in the
summary of the grounds for disapproval

Frm 00045

Fmt 4700

4071

under consideration the length of the
rebuttal period.
(4) Non-response. Any failure by the
self-regulatory organization to provide a
complete response, within the
applicable time period specified, to a
comment letter received or to the
Commission’s grounds for disapproval
under consideration may result in the
Commission not having a sufficient
basis to make an affirmative finding that
a proposed rule change is consistent
with the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations issued thereunder that are
applicable to the self-regulatory
organization.
(d) Record before the Commission.
(1) Filing of papers with the
Commission. Filing of papers with the
Commission shall be made by filing
them with the Secretary, including
through electronic means. In its notice
setting forth the grounds for disapproval
under consideration for a proposed rule
change, the Commission shall inform
interested parties of the methods by
which they may submit written
comments and arguments for or against
Commission approval.
(2) Public availability of materials
received. During the conduct of the
proceedings, the Commission generally
will make available publicly all written
comments it receives without change. In
its notice setting forth the grounds for
disapproval under consideration for a
proposed rule change, the Commission
shall inform interested parties of the
methods by which they may view all
written communications relating to the
proposed rule change between the
Commission and any person, other than
those that may be withheld from the
public in accordance with the
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552.
(3) Record before the Commission.
The Commission shall determine each
matter on the basis of the record. The
record shall consist of the proposed rule
change filed on Form 19b–4 by the selfregulatory organization, including all
attachments and exhibits thereto, and
all written materials received from any
interested parties on the proposed rule
change, including the self-regulatory
organization that filed the proposed rule
change, through the means identified by
the Commission as provided in
paragraph (1), as well as any written
materials that reflect communications
between the Commission and any
interested parties.
(e) Amended notice not required. The
Commission is not required to amend its
notice of grounds for disapproval under
consideration in order to consider,
during the course of the proceedings,
additional matters of fact and law
beyond what was set forth in the notice

the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board must explain in a clear

proposed rule change is consistent with
the requirements of title I of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the
rules and regulations thereunder, or as
necessary or appropriate in the public
interest or for the protection of
investors. A mere assertion that the
proposed rule change is consistent with
those requirements is not sufficient.
Instead, the description of the proposed
rule, its purpose and operation, its
effect, and a legal analysis of its
consistency with applicable
requirements must all be sufficiently
detailed and specific to support an
affirmative Commission finding. Any

ACTION: Interim rule. 

AGENCY:

The Copyright Office is
adopting interim regulations governing
the electronic submission of
applications for registration of
automated databases that predominantly
consist of photographs, and applications
for group registration of published
photographs. This interim rule
establishes a testing period and pilot
program during which the Copyright
Office will assess the desirability and
feasibility of permanently allowing such
applications to be submitted through the
Copyright Office’s electronic filing
system (‘‘eCO’’). Persons wishing to
submit electronic applications to
register copyrights of such photographic
databases or of groups of published
photographs should contact the Visual
Arts Division for permission and
guidance on electronic registration.
Notwithstanding the ordinary deposit
requirements for group registration of
automated databases, an electronic
application for group registration of an
automated database that consists
predominantly of photographic
authorship must include the image of
each claimed photograph in the
database. The interim regulations also
allow applicants to use forms other than
Form TX, as appropriate, when
submitting paper applications to register
group automated databases.
