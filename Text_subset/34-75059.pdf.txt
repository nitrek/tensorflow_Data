In the Matter of

EXTENSION ORDER

The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has requested an extension of time until
November 30, 2015 for entry of an order approving or disapproving the proposed plan of
distribution (“Plan”) that was noticed for public comment on March 30, 2015.
On November 20, 2013, the Commission issued an Order Making Findings and
Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to Section 8A of the
Securities Act of 1933 and Sections 15(b), 21B, and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (the “Order”) as to Respondents Gregg C. Lorenzo (“Lorenzo”) and Charles Vista, LLC
(“Charles Vista”) (collectively, “Respondents”) (Securities Act Rel. No. 9480 (November 20,
2013)). The Order found that Respondents made fraudulent misrepresentations to several
customers of Charles Vista, a broker-dealer controlled by Lorenzo, to induce them to invest in
convertible debentures issued by a start-up waste management company, Waste2Energy
Holdings, Inc. (“W2E”). The Order further found that Charles Vista had a considerable
financial interest in the debentures offering and was the exclusive placement agent for the
issuance of 12% W2E debentures. The debentures were convertible to W2E stock, which is a
penny stock. Additionally, the Order found that W2E’s financial situation was precarious and
W2E’s securities were extremely speculative because, among other reasons, the company had
millions of dollars of debt that was senior to the debt W2E was issuing through the debentures
offering. Finally, the Order found that after Respondents knowingly or recklessly made
fraudulent misrepresentations to several Charles Vista customers, these customers invested in
W2E debentures.
In the Order, Lorenzo and Charles Vista were jointly ordered to pay disgorgement of
$130,000 and prejudgment interest of $20,000. In addition, Lorenzo was ordered to pay a civil
penalty of $375,000 and Charles Vista was ordered to pay a civil penalty of $4,350,000. In
accordance with the Order, Lorenzo has paid $130,000 in disgorgement, $20,000 in
prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $375,000. Charles Vista has not made any

payments to date. Pursuant to the Order, a Fair Fund was created under Section 308(a) of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended. The Fair Fund is comprised of the disgorgement,
prejudgment interest and penalties paid and to be paid by Respondents for distribution to affected
customers of Charles Vista who suffered harm by virtue of the Respondents’ fraudulent
misrepresentations (collectively, “Eligible Customers”).
On March 30, 2015, the Commission published a Notice of Proposed Plan of
Distribution and Opportunity for Comment1 (“Notice”) pursuant to Rule 1103 of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans (“Rules”).2 The Notice advised
that all persons desiring to comment on the Plan could submit their comments, in writing, no
later than thirty (30) days from the date of the Notice. The Commission received three
comments on the Plan, two of which were received after the comment deadline.
In its request for an extension of time, the Division states that additional time is needed
for further evaluation, analysis, and consultation with other offices to properly address the
comments. The Division now requests that the Commission extend the time to issue an order
approving or disapproving the Plan to November 30, 2015.
Accordingly, for good cause shown, it is hereby ORDERED that, pursuant to Rule
1104 of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans,3 the time for entering
an order approving or disapproving the Plan is extended to November 30, 2015.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.
