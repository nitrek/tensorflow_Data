Rest of Asia-Pacific reported pre-tax profits of HK$21,908m compared with HK$23,551m in the first half of 2015, a
decrease of 7% largely due to an unfavourable impact from foreign exchange translation. Excluding this impact, pre-tax
profits decreased by 3%, mainly due to lower revenue and higher loan impairment charges, partly offset by lower
operating expenses.
Excluding the unfavourable impact from foreign exchange translation, revenue decreased by 2% compared with the first
half of 2015, driven by lower revenue in mainland China, partly offset by higher revenue in India and Indonesia.
In mainland China, revenue decreased by 16%, mainly from lower revenue in Rates, Capital Financing and Securities
Services in GB&M, coupled with lower income from insurance operations in RBWM.
Elsewhere in Asia, excluding the impact from foreign exchange translation, revenue increased in India due to higher net
interest income from growth in lending and deposit balances. Revenue in Indonesia also increased from higher trading
income in GB&M, mainly Rates and FX, coupled with higher net interest income from improved lending and deposit
spreads, mainly in CMB.
Loan impairment charges increased by HK$398m compared with the first half of 2015, driven by Australia from higher
individually assessed impairment charges in GB&M and CMB, partly offset by lower individually assessed impairment
charges in Indonesia in CMB.
Operating expenses decreased by HK$1,182m, or 7% compared with the first half of 2015, mainly due to the favourable
impact from foreign exchange translation. Excluding this impact, operating expenses decreased by 2%, mainly from lower
