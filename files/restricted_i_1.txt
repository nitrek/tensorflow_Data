ANNUAL OPERATING BUDGET
INTRODUCTION
The Annual Operating Budget provides financial information regarding anticipated revenue and anticipated expenses. Anticipated revenue and expenses reflect the expected revenue and expenses for the next year of operations and constitute the working budget for the facility. This form is of primary importance in providing selected information needed to determine financial responsibility at initial application as required by § 63.2-1702 of the Code of Virginia. When completing this form, do not include any revenue or expenses that are not directly associated with operation of the licensed facility. The instructions for completing the form which follow describe the information to be recorded for each item.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE FORM
ANTICIPATED REVENUE: This section should reflect the anticipated annual income available to operate the facility. It should not reflect the anticipated annual income of the applicant(s) unless this income was or will be used to operate the facility. Anticipated amounts should be as accurate as possible and supported by confirming documentation to the maximum extent feasible.
1. Fees for Care: The anticipated revenue which was or will be received each year as fees or payments for care should be entered here. Anticipated values should be based on the rate per child or adult to be charged by the facility and the number of children or adults who will actually be in care during the next year of operation. This may be estimated to be less than the licensed capacity which is being requested on the application and, if so, should be used rather than licensed capacity in determining the anticipated revenue to be received.
2. Fees for Other Clients/Services (only applies to assisted living facilities and children's residential facilities): The anticipated revenue which was and will be received each year as fees or payments for care or services provided to children or adults other than those in residential (24 hour) care.
3. Federal Funds: The revenue which will be received each year from Federal agencies. Do not include revenue already listed as part of "Fees for Care."
