Hong Kong reported pre-tax profits of HK$31,501m compared with HK$46,528m in the first half of 2015, a decrease of
32%, mainly reflecting the non-recurrence of the gain on partial disposal of Hang Seng’s shareholding in Industrial Bank
of HK$10,636m in 2015. Excluding this gain, pre-tax profit decreased by HK$4,391m, driven by lower net fee income.
Revenue decreased by HK$15,647m, or 22%, mainly reflecting the non-recurring gain mentioned above. Excluding this
gain, revenue decreased by HK$5,011m compared with the first half of 2015, mainly from RBWM and GB&M.
Revenue in RBWM decreased by 11% compared with the first half of 2015, driven by lower net fee income from
securities broking and unit trust fees, reflecting weaker investment sentiment in the first half of 2016, compared with a
very strong market performance in the first half of 2015. Insurance income also decreased due to weaker equity market
performance in the first half of 2016. This was partly offset by higher net interest income, reflecting improved deposit
spreads and growth in average deposit balances.
Revenue in GB&M decreased by 6%, mainly from lower Equities income due to lower market turnover, and lower
Foreign Exchange (‘FX’) revenue from reduced client activity, coupled with lower net interest income from Capital
Financing. This was partly offset by higher revenue in Balance Sheet Management (‘BSM’) driven by portfolio growth.
Revenue in CMB decreased by 1%, mainly due to lower net fee income from lower client demand for hedging products,
coupled with lower unit trusts and securities broking revenue. This was partly offset by higher net interest income from
improved deposit spreads and growth in average deposit balances.
Loan impairment charges increased by HK$664m compared with the first half of 2015, mainly due to an increase in
individually assessed impairment charges in CMB, coupled with the non-recurrence of an impairment release in GB&M in
the first half of 2015.
Operating expenses decreased by HK$1,307m or 6% compared with the first half of 2015, mainly due to lower staff costs
and the non-recurrence of charitable donations and other expenses in relation to the 150 th anniversary banknotes issuance
in 2015.
