making neural network using dnn and experimenting , results till now are as follows :-
(i put this in master in seperate folder as this is a stable build and giving prediction acc: 57.14 when i tested)

tested results
----------------
- increasing epochs does overfitting and reduces accuracy
- increasing internal connections between layers till a cretain point increases the accuracy


to test
--------
- effect on incresing hidden layers on accuracy


to do
---------
- use seeds
