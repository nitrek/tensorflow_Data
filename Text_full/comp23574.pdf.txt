COMPLAINT
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) alleges the following
against defendant James S. Hannon (“Hannon”).
SUMMARY
1.

This case involves trading by Hannon in the securities of his then-employer, the

TJX Companies, Inc. (“TJX”), a publicly-traded Massachusetts-based company that is the parent
company of retail store chains T.J. Maxx and Marshalls.
2.

In 2012 and 2013, Hannon was a mid-level manager at TJX and, as a result of his

position, he had daily access to material, nonpublic information about TJX’s sales. Using this
inside knowledge in part, Hannon purchased TJX stock in advance of certain press releases
publicly announcing the financial successes of TJX’s retail stores. Shortly thereafter, Hannon
sold his TJX stock, reaping trading profits totaling approximately $26,000 when the stock price
increased following these public announcements.

DEFENDANT
6.

James S. Hannon, age 51, is a resident of Merrimac, Massachusetts. In 2012 and

2013, Hannon was employed as the Northeast Regional Vice President of T.J. Maxx, a division
of TJX. Hannon was terminated by TJX in September 2014.
RELEVANT ENTITY
7.

The TJX Companies, Inc. (“TJX”) is a Delaware corporation with a principal

place of business in Framingham, Massachusetts. In the United States, TJX operates discount
2

Case 1:16-cv-11148 Document 1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 3 of 9

apparel and home fashion stores T.J. Maxx and Marshalls (collectively, “Marmaxx”) and
HomeGoods. TJX also operates similar discount stores in Canada and Europe. TJX stock is
quoted on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “TJX.” In 2012, Marmaxx
stores made up approximately 63% of all TJX stores worldwide. Likewise, Marmaxx sales
accounted for approximately 66% of TJX’s worldwide net sales. HomeGoods stores accounted
for approximately 13% of TJX’s total stores and 10% of TJX’s net worldwide sales.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
Hannon Had Access to Material, Nonpublic Information about TJX Sales
8.

Hannon began working for TJX in January 2003 as an Assistant Store Manager

for a T.J. Maxx store in Norwalk, Connecticut. By August 29, 2011, Hannon had been promoted
to the position of Northeast Regional Vice President for T.J. Maxx where he was responsible for
overseeing 122 T.J. Maxx stores.
9.

In this role, Hannon received daily emails from TJX’s finance division containing

consolidated daily comparable store sales (comparing the current year’s sales on a certain date to
the previous year’s sales on the same date) for all Marmaxx stores nationwide. Further, Hannon
received monthly emails containing nationwide Marmaxx month-, quarter-, and year-to-date
comparable store sales and current year-to-date sales before this information was made public.
In addition, the daily store sales and the monthly profit and loss expense reports for all T.J. Maxx
stores nationwide were available to him through a shared computer drive.
10.

Hannon also regularly received information through emails and in-person

meetings about HomeGoods stores’ sales from managers in that division because he oversaw
several “superstores” in his region, which were combinations of either T.J. Maxx or Marshalls
stores with HomeGoods stores.

3

Case 1:16-cv-11148 Document 1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 4 of 9

11.

Thus, at any given time while he was employed as the Northeast Regional Vice

President, Hannon received information about store sales and comparable store sales of
approximately 76% of TJX’s worldwide stores.
Hannon Traded in TJX Stock on the Basis of Material, Nonpublic Information
12.

On five occasions in 2012 and 2013, at the time Hannon held the position of

Northeast Regional Vice President for T.J. Maxx and received material, nonpublic company
sales information, he purchased large amounts of TJX stock a few days in advance of public
announcements of favorable sales or other financial information. Shortly after these public
announcements, Hannon sold his TJX stock for a total profit of $26,679, as follows:
a. On July 3, 2012, Hannon purchased 5,600 shares of TJX stock at an average price
of $42.54 per share (total price $238,224). On July 5, 2012 at 8:22 a.m., TJX
issued a press release reporting a 7% increase in consolidated comparable store
sales for June 2012. TJX also announced its decision to raise its second quarter
and full year earnings per share guidance. At 9:59 a.m. on July 5, 2012, Hannon
sold 5,600 shares at an average price of $44.11 per share, for a profit of $8,768.
b. On August 1, 2012, Hannon purchased 5,600 shares of TJX stock at an average
price of $44.10 per share (total price $246,932). On August 2, 2012 at 8:22 a.m.,
TJX issued a press release reporting a 7% increase in consolidated comparable
store sales for July 2012. Again, TJX announced its decision to further raise its
second quarter and full year earnings per share guidance. At 3:13 p.m. on August
2, 2012, Hannon sold 5,600 shares at an average price of $45.15 per share, for a
profit of $5,906.
c. On August 10, 2012, Hannon purchased 5,700 shares of TJX stock at an average
price of $44.25 per share (total price $252,218). On August 14, 2012 at 8:22 a.m.,
4

Case 1:16-cv-11148 Document 1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 5 of 9

TJX issued a press release reporting a 24% increase in second quarter earnings
per share. TJX also announced that it was raising its full-year earnings per share
guidance. At 11:43 a.m. on August 17, 2012, Hannon sold 5,700 shares at an
average price of $45.76 per share, for a profit of $8,615.
d. On September 18, 2012, Hannon purchased 5,200 shares of TJX stock at an
average price of $45.40 per share (total price $236,080). On September 20, 2012
at 3:40 p.m., TJX announced a quarterly common stock dividend. On October 4,
2012 at 7:22 a.m., TJX issued a press release reporting a 6% increase in
September 2012 consolidated comparable store sales. At 10:30 a.m. on October
4, 2012, Hannon sold 5,200 shares at an average price of $45.84 per share, for a
profit of $2,288.
e. On February 20, 2013, Hannon purchased 5,500 shares of TJX stock at an average
price of $44.90 per share (total price $246,950). On February 27, 2013 at 8:37
a.m., TJX reported a 28% increase to its adjusted earnings per share growth based
on $25.9 billion in sales during fiscal year 2013 and consolidated comparable
store sales growth of 7%. It further announced a $1.5 billion stock repurchase
program plus a 26% increase in dividends. At 9:40 a.m. on February 28, 2013,
Hannon sold 5,500 shares at an average price of $45.10 per share, for a profit of
$1,100.

Case 1:16-cv-11148 Document 1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 6 of 9

Hannon Violated his Duty to TJX by Trading on Material, Nonpublic Information
13.

TJX’s Global Code of Conduct Guide (“the Code”) explicitly prohibited all

employees from buying or selling TJX securities when in possession of material, nonpublic
information, which was explicitly defined in the Code to include certain types of sales
information. Specifically, the Code stated:
Do not buy or sell stock or other securities of TJX or
another company when you know information that
someone would consider important in deciding to buy, sell
or hold securities and that is not generally known to the
public; and
Do not tell others about any non-public information about
TJX or another company that you learn while doing your
job. This includes non-public information about
comparable store sales, financial results and trends or
current business conditions. You should never
communicate (“tip”) material, non-public information to
others so that they may trade securities based on that
information….
14.

The Code, in a section entitled “Confidentiality of Business Information,” also

required employees to protect and keep confidential nonpublic information about TJX’s
business. It explicitly cited comparable store sales as an example of the type of nonpublic
business information that must remain confidential.
15.

TJX also had an “Insider Trading” policy that explicitly prohibited all employees

from trading TJX securities at any time if in possession of material, nonpublic information. The
policy explained that insider trading was a violation of company policy, and also against the law.
This policy also listed sales and comparable store sales as examples of material information.
16.

When he was hired by TJX, Hannon acknowledged in writing that he received

and read the Code, including the section on Insider Information, and he agreed to comply with
the Code during his employment with TJX. Hannon acknowledged receiving updated copies of

6

Case 1:16-cv-11148 Document 1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 7 of 9

the Code in 2009, 2010, 2012 and 2014. He also received the company’s Insider Trading policy
annually starting in 2007, upon the receipt of TJX stock options as compensation.
17.

TJX explicitly stated in its Insider Information and Insider Trading policies that

the nation-wide store sales and comparable store sales for Marmaxx and HomeGoods, which
Hannon obtained in the course of his employment with TJX as the Northeast Regional Vice
President, was material information.
18.

At the time that Hannon purchased TJX stock, as described in paragraph 12

above, the daily and monthly store sales and comparable store sales was nonpublic information.
19.

Hannon thus purchased TJX stock on the basis of material, nonpublic information

about store sales and comparable store sales in breach of his duty to his employer, TJX.
CLAIM FOR RELIEF
Violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder
20.

The Commission realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations in

paragraphs 1 through 19 above.
21.

When Hannon purchased TJX stock on the basis of Marmaxx’s and HomeGoods’

store sales and comparable stores sales, this information was material and nonpublic. In
addition, TJX considered this information to be material and confidential. TJX had policies
prohibiting employees who possessed such material, nonpublic information from trading in TJX
securities.
22.

Hannon: (i) knew, or recklessly disregarded that, the information about

Marmaxx’s and HomeGoods’ store sales and comparable store sales was material and nonpublic;
(ii) knew, or recklessly disregarded that, he had a contractual or fiduciary duty, or obligation
arising from a similar relationship of trust and confidence, that he owed to TJX to keep this
information confidential, and to abstain from purchasing or selling securities based on this
7

Case 1:16-cv-11148 Document 1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 8 of 9

information; and (iii) knowingly or recklessly breached his duty by trading in TJX stock on the
basis of this material, nonpublic information.
23.

By virtue of the foregoing, Hannon, in connection with the purchase or sale of

securities, by the use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or of the mails, or
a facility of national securities exchange, directly or indirectly: (a) employed devices, schemes or
artifices to defraud; (b) made untrue statements of material fact or omitted to state material facts
necessary to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading; or (c) engaged in acts, practices or courses of business which operated or
would have operated as a fraud or deceit upon persons.
24.

By virtue of the foregoing, Hannon, directly or indirectly, violated and, unless

enjoined, will again violate, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule
10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5] thereunder.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, the Commission respectfully requests that the Court enter a Final Judgment:
A.

Permanently restraining and enjoining Hannon from violating Section 10(b) of the

Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5] thereunder;
B.

Ordering Hannon to disgorge, with pre-judgment interest, all ill-gotten gains

received as a result of the conduct alleged in this complaint, including all illicit trading profits;
C.

Ordering Hannon to pay civil monetary penalties pursuant to Section 21A of the

Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u-1];
D.

Retaining jurisdiction over this action to implement and carry out the terms of all

orders and decrees that may be entered; and
E.

Granting such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
