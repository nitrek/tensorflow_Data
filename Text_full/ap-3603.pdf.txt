In the Matter of
ORDER SETTING
PREHEARING
CONFERENCE DATE

SHREYANS DESAI

On January 5, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section
203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The OIP requires Respondent Shreyans Desai,
who is presently incarcerated at FMC Devens in Ayer, Massachusetts, to answer the allegations
within twenty days of service of the OIP. OIP at 3, 17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b). On January 27,
2016, I postponed the hearing scheduled for January 29, 2016, and ordered the Division of
Enforcement to confer with Respondent and to propose a date and time for a prehearing
conference. Shreyans Desai, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3534, 2016 SEC LEXIS 278.
On February 3, 2016, Respondent filed a petition to request stay, abeyance or other
appropriate findings in regard to this matter in which he seeks to stay this proceeding until a
parallel criminal action is completed or he has been released from custody, which he estimates
requires a stay of ninety to one hundred eighty days.
On February 10, 2016, the Division filed the declaration of Christina M. McGill, with
exhibits, showing that: Respondent was served with the OIP on January 11, 2016; the Division
has notified Respondent of the availability of the investigative file; Respondent’s prison
counselor has told the Division that Desai refuses to speak with the Division, including to discuss
his availability for a telephonic prehearing conference; the Division has sent Respondent three
letters by certified mail; and the Bureau of Prisons web site shows April 30, 2016, as
Respondent’s release date. The Division opposes Desai’s request for a stay, requests he be
ordered to file an answer, and requests leave to file a motion for summary disposition if he does
not do so. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.250. I find that Respondent was served in accordance with Rule
141(a)(2), 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2), on January 11, 2016. Because service was made by mail,
Respondent’s answer was due February 3, 2016. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. § 201.160(b), .220(b).
To date, Respondent has not filed an answer to the OIP.

Ruling
Respondent’s petition is a request for a postponement of the proceedings pursuant to Rule
161, 17 C.F.R. § 201.161. Under this rule, the Commission or hearing officer “should adhere to
a policy of strongly disfavoring such requests, except in circumstances where the requesting
party makes a strong showing that the denial of the request or motion would substantially
prejudice their case.” 17 C.F.R. § 201.161(b)(1). Respondent has not made such a showing
here. Additionally, the case law does not support postponing an administrative proceeding
pending appeal of a parallel criminal proceeding. Hunt v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 707 F.2d 1493,
1497 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (“Under well-settled federal law, the pendency of an appeal does not
diminish the res judicata effect of a judgment rendered by a federal court.”); Paul Free, CPA,
Exchange Act Release No. 66260, 2012 SEC LEXIS 322, at *6 (Jan. 5, 2012). (“As we have
previously stated, the pendency of an appeal generally is an insufficient basis upon which to
prolong a Commission proceeding.”). See also Jon Edelman, 52 S.E.C. 789, 790 (1996) (“The
pendency of an appeal of a criminal conviction generally is an insufficient basis upon which to
grant a motion to stay proceedings.”).
I ORDER a telephonic conference on February 18, 2016, at 11:00 a.m. EDT, a date and
time at which correctional authorities have told me that Respondent could arrange to be available
for a phone call at a number correctional authorities provided to my office. If Respondent does
not participate in the telephonic prehearing conference, file an answer, or otherwise defend the
proceeding, I will find him in default, deem the allegations in the OIP to be true, and grant the
Division leave to file a motion for sanctions. See OIP at 4; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f),
.221(f).
