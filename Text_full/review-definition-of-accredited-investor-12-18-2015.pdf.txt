REPORT ON THE REVIEW OF THE DEFINITION OF “ACCREDITED INVESTOR”
I.

Introduction
A.

Background

Absent an available exemption, the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) requires
that offers and sales of securities be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “Commission”). Registration is intended to provide investors with full and fair disclosure of
material information so that they are able to make their own investment decisions. 1 Congress,
however, recognized that in certain situations there is no practical need for registration or the
public benefits from registration are too remote. 2 Accordingly, the Securities Act contains a
number of exemptions to its registration requirements and authorizes the Commission to adopt
additional exemptions. The exemptions in Regulation D 3 are the most widely used transactional
exemptions for securities offerings by issuers. Issuers using these exemptions raised over $1.3
trillion in 2014 alone, an amount comparable to what was raised in registered offerings. 4

White Paper”), available at http://www.sec.gov/dera/staff-papers/white-papers/unregistered-offering102015.pdf. Underlying data in the Unregistered Offerings White Paper was obtained from Form D filings.
While Rule 503 of Regulation D (17 CFR 230.503) requires the filing of a notice on Form D no later than
15 days after the first sale of securities, the filing of a Form D is not a condition to a Regulation D safe
harbor or exemption. Consequently, it is possible that some issuers do not make Form D filings for
offerings relying on Regulation D and the available data on Regulation D offerings could underestimate the
actual amount of capital raised through those offerings.

Accredited Investor Definition

The “accredited investor” definition is a central component of Regulation D. It is
“intended to encompass those persons whose financial sophistication and ability to sustain the
risk of loss of investment or ability to fend for themselves render the protections of the Securities
Act’s registration process unnecessary.” 5 Qualifying as an accredited investor is significant
because accredited investors may, under Commission rules, participate in investment
opportunities that are generally not available to non-accredited investors, such as investments in
private companies and offerings by hedge funds, private equity funds and venture capital funds.
Issuers of unregistered structured finance products and debt securities also may rely on
Regulation D. Investors in unregistered offerings can be subject to investment risks not
associated with registered offerings because some securities law liability provisions do not apply
to private offerings, issuers of unregistered securities generally are not required to provide
information comparable to that included in a registration statement and Commission staff does
not review any information that may be provided to investors in these offerings. 6
Regulation D originated as an effort to facilitate capital formation, consistent with the
protection of investors, by simplifying and clarifying existing rules and regulations, eliminating
unnecessary restrictions those rules and regulations placed on issuers, particularly small
businesses, and achieving uniformity between federal and state exemptions. 7 While it is

particularly useful for small businesses, issuers of all sizes conduct offerings in reliance on
Regulation D, in general, and Rule 506(b) 8 in particular. 9 Under the accredited investor
definition, natural persons are accredited investors if their income exceeds $200,000 in each of
the two most recent years (or $300,000 in joint income with a person’s spouse) and they
reasonably expect to reach the same income level in the current year. 10 Natural persons are also
accredited investors if their net worth exceeds $1 million (individually or jointly with a spouse),
excluding the value of their primary residence. 11 Certain enumerated entities with over $5
million in assets qualify as accredited investors, 12 while others, including regulated entities such
as banks and registered investment companies, are not subject to the assets test. 13
In addition to being a historical cornerstone of Regulation D, the accredited investor
definition plays an important role in other federal and state securities laws contexts and has taken
on increased significance as a result of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS
Act”). 14 For example, the JOBS Act required the Commission to revise Rule 506 15 to permit
general solicitation and general advertising in offerings where all purchasers are accredited

Reasons for the Report

Section 413(b)(2)(A) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) 18 directs the Commission to review the accredited investor
definition as it relates to natural persons every four years to determine whether the definition
should be modified or adjusted for the protection of investors, in the public interest and in light
of the economy. Section 413(b)(2)(A) specifies that this review shall be conducted not earlier
than four years after enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act and no less frequently than once every
four years thereafter. The staff has prepared this report in connection with the first review.
The Dodd-Frank Act also required the Comptroller General of the United States to
conduct a study on the appropriate criteria for determining the financial thresholds or other
criteria needed to qualify for accredited investor status and eligibility to invest in private funds. 19

Although regulators and market participants increasingly rely on the accredited investor
definition, it has not been comprehensively re-examined since its adoption in 1982. Since that
time, general inflationary effects have expanded significantly the pool of persons that qualify as
accredited investors. In addition, developments such as increased informational availability, as
well as changes in the way investors communicate, have altered the investing landscape.
Further, financial product and process innovation over the past three decades have led to more
complex financial markets while greatly expanding the set of available investment opportunities.
Consequently, the financial criteria identified in 1982 may no longer serve as the most effective
proxies for determining when investors do not require the protections that come from registration
under the Securities Act. Altering the financial thresholds contained in the definition may not,
by itself, be sufficient to adapt to the current investing environment.
D.

Goals of the Accredited Investor Definition

The accredited investor definition attempts to identify those persons whose financial
sophistication and ability to sustain the risk of loss of investment or ability to fend for themselves
render the protections of the Securities Act’s registration process unnecessary. 21 An overly
narrow definition that limited the number of accredited investors could risk restricting
businesses’ access to a crucial source of capital and be inconsistent with the Commission’s
capital formation mandate. An overly broad definition, on the other hand, could potentially be
inconsistent with the Commission’s investor protection mandate and run counter to one of the

Accredited Investor Should Be Considered (July 18, 2013). The GAO Report recommended that the
Commission consider alternative criteria to help determine an individual’s ability to bear and understand
the risks associated with investing in private placements.

basic tenets of the Securities Act by failing to provide investors in need of protection with
adequate disclosures before they make an investment decision.
Additionally, a fundamental objective of the accredited investor definition is to create
bright-line tests that allow market participants to readily determine an investor’s status under the
definition. The need for clarity is particularly important because an issuer relying on an
exemption from registration carries the burden of proving that the exemption is available.
Clarity and certainty in the accredited investor definition foster greater confidence in
unregistered markets and ultimately could reduce the cost of capital, thereby promoting
increased capital formation, particularly for small businesses. Indeed, Regulation D was
adopted, in part, to bring a greater degree of clarity for small businesses than was present under
the prior exemptive scheme. 22
E.

Scope of the Report

Section 413(b)(2)(A) of the Dodd-Frank Act directs the Commission to review the
accredited investor definition, in its entirety, as it applies to natural persons. In the interest of
providing a comprehensive analysis of the definition, this report also addresses aspects of the
definition as it applies to entities. This report provides background information on the origins of
the accredited investor definition, changes to the definition since its adoption and recent
Commission proposals for further amendments to the definition. It describes relevant comments

See Proposed Revision of Certain Exemptions from the Registration Provisions of the Securities Act of
1933 for Transactions Involving Limited Offers and Sales, Release No. 33-6339 (Aug. 7, 1981) [46 FR
41791] (the “Regulation D Proposing Release”). In the context of small business hearings held in the late
1970s, commenters indicated that small businesses had frustrations with the subjective determinations
former Rule 146 required. Commenters indicated that the uncertain applicability of the rule complicated
legal opinions and increased transaction costs. See Summary of Comments Relating to Small Business
Hearings and Proposed Form S-18, Division of Corporation Finance, Securities and Exchange
Commission, File No. S7-734.

on the definition received in prior Commission rulemakings, academic literature on the topic and
recommended changes to the definition from a variety of sources. It also considers alternative
approaches under federal and state securities laws for identifying types of financially
sophisticated investors and considers the impact any definitional changes may have outside the
context of Regulation D. Finally, this report examines alternative approaches to defining the
term “accredited investor” and provides staff recommendations for updates and modifications to
the existing definition.
F.

Recommendations

The staff recommends that the Commission consider any one or more of the following
methods of revising the accredited investor definition:
•

The Commission should revise the financial thresholds requirements for natural
persons to qualify as accredited investors and the list-based approach for entities to
qualify as accredited investors. The Commission could consider the following
approaches to address concerns with how the current definition identifies accredited
investor natural persons and entities:
o Leave the current income and net worth thresholds in place, subject to investment
limitations.
o Create new, additional inflation-adjusted income and net worth thresholds that are
not subject to investment limitations.
o Index all financial thresholds for inflation on a going-forward basis.
o Permit spousal equivalents to pool their finances for purposes of qualifying as
accredited investors.
o Revise the definition as it applies to entities by replacing the $5 million assets test
with a $5 million investments test and including all entities rather than
specifically enumerated types of entities.
o Grandfather issuers’ existing investors that are accredited investors under the
current definition with respect to future offerings of their securities.

•

The Commission should revise the accredited investor definition to allow individuals
to qualify as accredited investors based on other measures of sophistication. The

7

Commission could consider the following approaches to identify individuals who
could qualify as accredited investors based on criteria other than income and net
worth:
o Permit individuals with a minimum amount of investments to qualify as
accredited investors.
o Permit individuals with certain professional credentials to qualify as accredited
investors.
o Permit individuals with experience investing in exempt offerings to qualify as
accredited investors.
o Permit knowledgeable employees of private funds to qualify as accredited
investors for investments in their employer’s funds.
o Permit individuals who pass an accredited investor examination to qualify as
accredited investors.
Section IX describes these recommendations in detail.
II.

History of the Accredited Investor Definition
The Securities Act and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder define the term

“accredited investor” in the following places:
•

Securities Act Section 2(a)(15) 23 and Rule 215 under the Securities Act 24 define
accredited investor for purposes of Section 4(a)(5). 25 Section 4(a)(5) exempts nonpublic offers and sales of up to $5 million made solely to accredited investors. The
definition of accredited investor in Section 2(a)(15) enumerates certain categories of
persons and authorizes the Commission to prescribe additional categories. Pursuant
to this authority, the Commission has prescribed additional categories in Rule 215. 26

•

Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act 27 defines accredited investor as that term is used

23

15 USC 77b(a)(15).

24

17 CFR 230.215.

25

15 USC 77d(a)(5).

26

This report focuses on the accredited investor definition as used in Regulation D, with the understanding
that any revisions to the definition should be made to the Rule 215 definition as well.

27

17 CFR 230.501(a).

in Regulation D. 28
Regulation D relates to transactions exempted from the registration requirements of
Section 5 29 of the Securities Act under Rules 504, 30 505, 31 506(b) and 506(c). 32
•

Rule 504 provides an exemption for the public offer and sale of up to $1 million in a
twelve-month period. General solicitation and general advertising are permitted if the
offering is registered in a state requiring the use of a substantive disclosure document
or sold exclusively to accredited investors under a corresponding state exemption.

•

Rule 505 provides an exemption for the offer and sale of up to $5 million in a twelvemonth period to an unlimited number of accredited investors and up to 35 additional
persons.

•

Rule 506(b) is available for sales of unlimited amounts of securities to accredited
investors and up to 35 non-accredited, but sophisticated, investors. Offerings relying
on Rule 506(b) cannot involve general solicitation or general advertising.

•

Rule 506(c) allows issuers to use general solicitation and general advertising,
provided all purchasers are accredited investors and the issuer takes reasonable steps
to verify their accredited investor status. Issuers may sell unlimited amounts of
securities under Rule 506(c).

The presence of non-accredited investors in Regulation D offerings has implications for
the type of disclosures that issuers are required to provide. Under Rules 505 and 506(b), issuers
must provide the financial and non-financial information specified in Rule 502(b) 33 to any non-

28

Rules 215 and 501(a) are identical except that Rule 501(a) permits reasonable belief by an issuer and
includes banks, insurance companies, investment companies, business development companies and small
business investment companies in the definition and permits additional entities to be fiduciaries for benefit
plans that are accredited investors. The accredited investor definition in Securities Act Section 2(a)(15)
contains banks, insurance companies, investment companies, business development companies and small
business investment companies and employee benefit plans with banks, insurance companies or registered
investment advisers as fiduciaries.

The accredited investor definition reflects movement away from general principles and
standards towards bright-line tests. This section discusses the background and history of the
accredited investor definition, from the legislative history of the Securities Act through the
original small business exemptions and the introduction of the term to the Securities Act, and
concludes with a description of the definition under Regulation D and its subsequent
amendments.
A.

Securities Act Section 4(a)(2) and Judicial Precedent

The legislative history of the Securities Act indicates that Congress’s main objective was
to provide full and fair disclosure in connection with the offer and sale of securities. Congress
recognized, however, that there were certain situations in which the protections afforded by the
Securities Act were not necessary. The House report stated that “[t]he Securities Act carefully
exempts from its application certain types of … securities transactions where there is no practical
need for its application or where the public benefits are too remote.” 35
Securities Act Section 4(a)(2), 36 an exemption from the registration requirements of
Section 5 of the Securities Act, provides that “the provisions of Section 5 shall not apply to …
transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering.” The Securities Act does not define
the phrase “transactions … not involving any public offering.” Accordingly, it has been left to

would be included in a registration statement for a registered offering.
34

The note to Rule 502(b)(1) states that when an issuer provides information to non-accredited investors it
should consider providing such information to accredited investors as well, in view of the anti-fraud
provisions of the federal securities laws.

court decisions and Commission interpretations to define the scope of the exemption.
In S.E.C. v. Ralston Purina Co., 37 the Supreme Court established the basic criteria for
determining the availability of Section 4(a)(2). The Court held that the availability of Section
4(a)(2) should turn on whether the particular class of persons affected need the protection
afforded by the Securities Act. The Court found that an offering to those who are shown to be
able to fend for themselves is a transaction not involving any public offering. The Court further
observed that offerings to persons who have access to the same kind of information that the
Securities Act would make available in the form of a registration statement may come within the
exemption.
Section 4(a)(2) was traditionally viewed as a way to provide “an exemption from
registration for bank loans, private placements of securities with institutions, and the promotion
of a business venture by a few closely related persons.” 38 In 1962, prompted by increased use of
the exemption for speculative offerings to unrelated and uninformed persons, the Commission
clarified limitations on the exemption’s availability. 39 The Commission stated that “[w]hether a
transaction is one not involving any public offering is essentially a question of fact and
necessitates a consideration of all surrounding circumstances, including such factors as the
relationship between the offerees and the issuer, the nature, scope, size, type and manner of the
offering.” 40

B.

Small Business Exemptions Prior to Regulation D

Securities Act Rule 146
The Commission adopted Rule 146 in 1974 in an effort to provide greater certainty in the
application of the Section 4(a)(2) exemption. 41 The rule was available to all issuers and could be
used to raise an unlimited amount of capital. Use of Rule 146 was conditioned on the following:
•

Offers and sales could be made only to persons the issuer reasonably believed had the
requisite knowledge and experience in financial matters to evaluate the risks and
merits of the prospective investment or who could bear the economic risks of the
investment.

•

Sales could not be made to persons who did not have the requisite knowledge and
experience in financial matters unless they had a representative who was capable of
providing the requisite financial knowledge and experience.

•

Offerees must have had access to, or been furnished with, information comparable to
what a registration statement would contain.

•

No more than 35 purchasers could participate in an offering.

•

General advertising and general solicitation were not permitted.

In the adopting release, the Commission identified two goals for Rule 146. First, the rule
would deter reliance on the Section 4(a)(2) exemption for offerings to persons who were unable
to fend for themselves in terms of obtaining and evaluating information about the issuer and, in
certain situations, of assuming the economic risk of investment. Second, the rule would reduce
uncertainty and provide more objective standards upon which to rely when raising capital.

41

See Transactions By an Issuer Deemed Not To Involve Any Public Offering, Release No. 33-5487 (Apr.
23, 1974) [39 FR 15261]. If all the conditions of Rule 146 were met, the offer and sale of securities were
deemed to not involve any public offering within the meaning of Section 4(a)(2). The Commission
rescinded Rule 146 in 1982 in connection with the adoption of Regulation D.

12

Securities Act Rule 240
In 1975, the Commission adopted Rule 240 42 for the purpose of benefiting small
businesses that did not have other exemptions available to them. 43 Rule 240 required issuers to
have no more than 100 beneficial owners both before and after the offering, limited the aggregate
amount of securities sold in a twelve-month period to $100,000 and prohibited general
advertising and general solicitation.
Securities Act Rule 242
Despite the adoption of Rules 146 and 240, the uncertainty surrounding private
placements and small business offerings continued. Beginning in 1978, the Commission
conducted an extensive evaluation, including public hearings, 44 into the impact of its rules and
regulations on the ability of small businesses to raise capital. 45 Primarily as a result of the views
expressed at the hearings, the Commission took several significant actions designed to ease the
impact of the federal securities laws on small businesses consistent with the protection of
investors, including adopting Rule 242. 46 Rule 242 provided a limited offering exemption under

42

See Exemption For Closely Held Issuers, Release No. 33-5560 (Jan. 24, 1975) [40 FR 6484]. The
Commission rescinded Rule 240 in 1982 in connection with the adoption of Regulation D.

Capital and the Impact on Small Businesses of Disclosure Requirements Under the Securities Acts; Release
No. 33-5914 (Mar. 6, 1978) [43 FR 10876] (the “Small Business Study Release”).

44

During April and May of 1978, the Commission held 21 days of public hearings in six cities across the
country.

See Small Business Study Release.

46

See Exemption of Limited Offers and Sales by Qualified Issuers, Release No. 33-6180 (Jan. 17, 1980) [45
FR 6362]. The Commission rescinded Rule 242 in 1982 in connection with the adoption of Regulation D.
Other actions included amending Regulation A to increase the aggregate offering amount of securities that
could be sold thereunder during a twelve month period from $500,000 to $1.5 million and amending Rule
146 to relax the disclosure requirements for offerings not in excess of $1.5 million. See also Simplified
Registration and Reporting Requirements for Small Issuers, Release No. 33-6049 (Apr. 3, 1979) [44 FR

13

Section 3(b)(1) of the Securities Act 47 for offerings up to $2 million. It also introduced the
accredited investor concept into the federal securities laws. Rule 242 allowed certain domestic
and Canadian corporate issuers to sell their securities to an unlimited number of accredited
persons and up to 35 non-accredited persons. Rule 242 did not require issuers to make any
subjective determination about the sophistication or financial condition of offerees and
purchasers. Rather, issuers were required to determine only whether potential investors were
accredited or non-accredited persons based on the objective criteria set forth in the rule. Rule
242 defined “accredited person” as a person purchasing $100,000 or more of the issuer’s
securities, a director or executive officer of the issuer or a specified type of entity. 48 If only
accredited persons were involved in an offering, there was no specific requirement to furnish
them with information, based on the assumption that accredited persons were in a position to ask
for and obtain the information they believed was relevant to an offering. 49 Like Rule 146, Rule
242 prohibited general advertising and general solicitation.
C.

The Small Business Investment Incentive Act of 1980

Congress responded to the need to reform the federal securities laws to facilitate small
business access to the capital markets by enacting the Small Business Investment Incentive Act

15 USC 77c(b)(1).

Specified entities were banks (whether acting in their individual or fiduciary capacities), insurance
companies, employee benefit plans (with investment decisions made by plan fiduciaries), investment
companies, and licensed Small Business Investment Companies.

of 1980 (the “Incentive Act”). 50 The Incentive Act exempted from Securities Act registration
non-public offers and sales of up to $5 million made solely to accredited investors 51 and added
the accredited investor definition to Section 2(a)(15) of the Securities Act.
Section 2(a)(15)(i) 52 defined accredited investor to mean certain enumerated entities 53 and
Section 2(a)(15)(ii) 54 authorized the Commission to adopt additional categories based on “such
factors as financial sophistication, net worth, knowledge, and experience in financial matters, or
amount of assets under management.” The Commission has used this authority to expand the
types of persons that qualify as accredited investors. 55 The Incentive Act also increased the
ceiling on the Commission’s authority to create small offering exemptions from $2 million to $5
million56 and authorized the Commission to work with the states to develop a uniform exemption
from registration for small issuers. 57

Regulation D

Prompted by the enactment of the Incentive Act, on December 23, 1980, the Commission
published an advance notice of rulemaking and announced that it was considering the

relationship between the Securities Act exemptions from registration and the capital formation
needs of small businesses. 58 The Commission asked commenters to focus on the
interrelationship between the statutory exemption from registration for sales to accredited
investors created by the Incentive Act and the Commission’s other exemptive rules, especially
Rules 146 and 242.
Regulation D was the product of the Commission’s evaluation of the impact of its rules
and regulations on the ability of small businesses to raise capital. 59 Promulgated in 1982,
Regulation D was a series of six rules that established two exemptions and one non-exclusive
safe harbor from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and replaced the exemptions
existing under Rules 146, 240 and 242. Rule 506 replaced Rule 146 and provided a nonexclusive safe harbor under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. Rules 504 and 505 replaced
Rules 240 and 242, respectively, and provided exemptions to registration under Section 3(b)(1)
of the Securities Act.
The Commission designed Regulation D to simplify existing rules and regulations,
particularly for small businesses, and achieve uniformity between state and federal exemptions to
facilitate capital formation consistent with the protection of investors. A significant achievement
in the adoption of Regulation D was the unification of much of the Commission’s exemptive
scheme into a single regulation with common definitions, terms and conditions. 60

16

The accredited investor definition is a cornerstone of Regulation D. 61 Rule 501 defines
the term by listing eight categories of persons and entities that qualify as accredited investors.
As originally constructed, certain institutional investors, private business development
companies, charitable organizations, company insiders, purchasers of more than $150,000,
natural persons with substantial net worth or income and entities, all of whose equity owners
were accredited, qualified as accredited investors. The concept intended to encompass those
persons and entities whose financial sophistication and ability to sustain the risk of loss of
investment or ability to fend for themselves render the protections of the Securities Act’s
registration process unnecessary. 62
The accredited investor definition originally included persons who purchased at least
$150,000 of the securities being offered where the total purchase price did not exceed twenty
percent of the person’s net worth. The premise behind the $150,000 minimum purchase
requirement was that individuals capable of investing large amounts of capital in an offering
should be considered accredited investors because of their bargaining power. 63 The Commission

61

See Regulation D Proposing Release; Regulation D Adopting Release. Like its predecessor, Rule 242, the
principal requirements of Regulation D depend upon whether or not an investor is accredited. An issuer
need not make a determination about an accredited investor’s sophistication, although an issuer is required
to make a determination about a non-accredited investor’s sophistication under Rule 506(b). Issuers may
sell to an unlimited number of accredited investors under Rules 505 and 506(b), but may sell to no more
than 35 non-accredited investors. Under Rules 505 or 506(b), issuers have no disclosure delivery
requirement if sales are exclusively to accredited investors. Regulation D relies upon the same assumption
employed by Rule 242 that accredited investors are in a position to ask for and obtain the information they
believe is relevant. Only if an issuer sells to a non-accredited investor do Rules 505 and 506(b) require
delivery of a specified disclosure document. Disclosures are required to the extent material to an
understanding of the issuer, its business and the securities being offered.

rescinded this provision in 1988 64 because of an anomaly with the $1 million net worth test and
concerns that purchase size alone, particularly at the $150,000 level, did not assure sophistication
or access to information. 65
Like Rule 242, the accredited investor definition includes an issuer’s directors and
executive officers, but unlike Rule 242, also includes the general partners of an issuer and the
directors, executive officers, and general partners of a general partner of the issuer. These
insiders are deemed not to need the protections provided by registration because their positions
should provide them with access to information about the issuer and the securities offered. 66
Income and Net Worth Tests
Regulation D established bright-line tests for individuals to qualify as accredited
investors based on their income or net worth. The income and net worth tests, respectively,
currently read as follows:
•

Any natural person who had individual income in excess of $200,000 in each of the
two most recent years or joint income with that person’s spouse in excess of $300,000
in each of those years and has a reasonable expectation of reaching the same income
level in the current year. 67

•

Any natural person whose individual net worth, or joint net worth with that person’s

64

65

The provision permitted a natural person with as little as $750,000 of net worth to be considered accredited
with a $150,000 purchase while a $1 million net worth was required to accredit a natural person for a
smaller purchase. See Regulation D Revisions Proposing Release.

66

After soliciting public comment, the Commission decided not to accredit sophisticated officers who are not
executive officers because it was not persuaded that, absent a policy-making function characterizing an
executive officer position, other officers and employees would have sufficient access to information and the
ability to bear the risk necessary to achieve the status of accredited investor. See Regulation D Revisions
Adopting Release.

Other than expanding the income test to include a joint income component 69 and
excluding the value of one’s primary residence from the net worth calculation, 70 the Commission
has not revised the income and net worth tests since 1982.
2006 Accredited Natural Person Proposal
In 2006, the Commission proposed, but ultimately never adopted, rules under the
Securities Act that would have created a new category of accredited investor called an
“accredited natural person.” 71 The new category would have been applicable only to offers and
sales of securities issued by companies relying on Section 3(c)(1) of the Investment Company
Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”). 72 “Accredited natural person” would have been
defined as any natural person who met the Regulation D net worth or income tests and owned at
least $2.5 million in investments. The term “investments” would have been defined based on the
definition used in Investment Company Act Rule 2a51-1(b). 73

the accredited investor definition as it applies to natural persons to: 74
•

add an alternative “investments-owned” test of $750,000 that could be used instead of
the net worth or income tests; 75

•

define a new term, “joint investments,” that would include only 50% of any
investment held jointly with a spouse unless both spouses sign and are bound by the
investment documentation; 76 and

•

establish an inflation adjustment for all dollar-amount thresholds on a going-forward
basis with adjustments every five years to reflect any changes in the value of the
Personal Consumption Expenditures Chain-Type Price Index (or any successor index
thereto), as published by the Department of Commerce, rounded to the nearest
multiple of $10,000.

Exclusion of Primary Residence from Net Worth Calculation
Section 413(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act excluded the value of a person’s primary residence
from the net worth calculation and directed the Commission to adjust similarly any accredited
investor net worth standard in its Securities Act rules. In 2011, the Commission revised Rules
215 and 501 to exclude any positive equity individuals have in their primary residences. 77 The
revised calculation requires that any excess of indebtedness secured by the primary residence
over the estimated fair market value of the residence be considered a liability for purposes of
determining accredited investor status on the basis of net worth. The Commission also added a
60-day look-back period to prevent investors from artificially inflating their net worth by

74

75

The proposed definition of “investments” was based on Rule 2a51-1 of the Investment Company Act of
1940, which defines “investments” for purposes of defining “qualified purchaser” in Section 2(a)(51)(A) of
the Investment Company Act.

76

In contrast, the current accredited investor definition includes all assets an individual owns jointly with a
spouse or that are part of a shared community interest in the net worth calculation.

incurring incremental indebtedness secured by their primary residence, thereby effectively
converting their home equity into cash or other assets that would be included in the net worth
calculation.
Rule 506(c) of Regulation D
Section 201(a) of the JOBS Act directed the Commission to eliminate the prohibition
against general solicitation and general advertising under Rule 506 where all purchasers of the
securities are accredited investors and the issuer takes reasonable steps to verify that the
purchasers are accredited investors. To implement Section 201(a), the Commission added
paragraph (c) to Rule 506. 78 Under Rule 506(c), an issuer may offer securities using general
solicitation and general advertising, provided that:
•

all purchasers in the offering are accredited investors;

•

the issuer takes reasonable steps to verify the purchasers’ accredited investor status;
and

•

certain other conditions in Regulation D are satisfied.

The determination of the reasonableness of the steps taken to verify accredited investor status is
an objective assessment. Issuers are required to consider the facts and circumstances of each
purchaser and the transaction. The final rule also provides a non-exclusive list of methods that
issuers may use to satisfy the verification requirement.
III. Other Regulatory Approaches
The federal securities laws and other regulatory regimes use a number of distinct
standards, including the accredited investor definition, to identify persons who are not in need of
certain investor protection features contained in those laws and regimes. While other standards
78

See Rule 506(c) Adopting Release.

21

may provide useful context for considering the accredited investor definition, each serves a
different specific regulatory purpose. Table 3.1 compares the different standards for natural
persons, their corresponding financial thresholds and regulatory purposes.

This section provides more detailed descriptions of the standards in the above table as
well as other approaches to identifying individuals who do not need certain investor protections.
Many of the standards described in this section use thresholds based on the amount of an
individual’s investments. In contrast, the accredited investor definition uses income and net
worth.
A.

Qualified Client

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”) generally prohibits
investment advisers from charging performance fees to clients. 79 Rule 205-3 80 under the
Advisers Act provides a limited exemption from that prohibition when a client meets the
definition of “qualified client.” A “qualified client” is a natural person who, or a company that:
•

has at least $1 million in assets under management with the adviser immediately after
entering into an investment advisory contract with the adviser;

•

the adviser reasonably believes has a net worth (together with assets held jointly with
a spouse) of more than $2 million immediately prior to entering into an advisory
contract;

•

the adviser reasonably believes is a “qualified purchaser” as defined in Section
2(a)(51)(A) of the Investment Company Act 81 at the time an advisory contract is
entered into;

•

is an executive officer, director, trustee, general partner, or person serving in a similar
capacity, of the adviser; or

•

is an employee of the adviser who participates in the investment activities of the

79

Section 205(a)(1) of the Advisers Act (15 USC 80b-5(a)(1)) restricts an investment adviser from entering
into, extending, renewing or performing any investment advisory contract that provides for compensation
to the adviser based on a share of capital gains on, or capital appreciation of, the funds of a client.

23

adviser, and has performed investment activities for at least twelve months.
By providing relief from the Advisers Act’s general prohibition against linking adviser
compensation to gains or appreciation of assets under management, Rule 205-3 recognizes that
some clients are financially experienced and able to bear the risks of performance fee
arrangements. 82 In adopting Rule 205-3, the Commission explained that it is consistent with
investor protection and the purpose of the Advisers Act to permit clients who are financially
experienced and able to bear the risks associated with performance fees to have the opportunity
to negotiate compensation arrangements which they and their advisers consider appropriate.
When proposing the qualified client definition, the Commission noted that an objective
financial means test would ensure that clients entering into performance fee contracts could bear
the risks associated with performance fees. 83 The Commission has adjusted this test over time.
In 1998, the Commission adopted a rule that increased the assets-under management test from
$500,000 to $750,000, and the net worth test from $1 million to $1.5 million. 84 These changes
adjusted for the effects of inflation since 1985. More recently, Section 418 of the Dodd-Frank
Act required the Commission to adjust the thresholds for inflation between 1998 and 2010 and
every five years thereafter. In 2011, the Commission issued an order that increased the threshold

amounts for both tests to their current levels 85 and in 2012 revised Rule 205-3 to provide for
inflation adjustments every five years. 86 In tandem, the Commission also amended the rule to
exclude the value of a person’s primary residence from the test of whether a person meets the net
worth requirement. The Commission noted that excluding the primary residence was similar to
the approach in the most recent amendments to the accredited investor definition and was
responsive to commenters who urged the Commission to promote regulatory consistency in the
treatment of primary residences.
B.

Qualified Purchaser Under the Investment Company Act

Congress determined that the amount of a person’s investments should be used to
measure a person’s financial sophistication for purposes of the Investment Company Act when it
enacted the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 (“NSMIA”). 87 NSMIA
created a new exception from the definition of “investment company” for issuers that sell their
securities solely to qualified purchasers. 88 The term qualified purchaser means:
•

natural persons who own not less than $5 million in investments;

•

family-owned companies that own not less than $5 million in investments;

•

certain trusts; and

85

See Order Approving Adjustments for Inflation of the Dollar Amount Tests in Rule 205-3 Under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Release No. IA-3236 (July 12, 2011) [76 FR 41838].

86

See Investment Adviser Performance Compensation, Release No. IA-3372 (Feb. 15, 2012) [77 FR 10358].
This release added Rule 205-3(e), which provides for inflation adjustments every five years based on the
Personal Consumption Expenditures Chain-Type Price Index (or any successor thereto) as published by the
United States Department of Commerce (the “PCE”). This release also codified the inflation-adjusted
amounts set in the 2011 order.

persons, acting for their own accounts or the accounts of other qualified purchasers,
who in the aggregate own and invest on a discretionary basis, not less than $25
million in investments (e.g., institutional investors). 89

The legislative history of NSMIA indicates that reliance on the exemption under Section
3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act 90 was to be limited to private investment companies
consisting solely of investors with a high degree of financial sophistication who are in a position
to appreciate the risks associated with investment pools that do not have the protections afforded
by the Investment Company Act. 91 The legislative history suggests that Congress viewed these
investors as capable of evaluating on their own behalf matters such as a fund’s management fees,
governance provisions, transactions with affiliates, investment risk, leverage and redemption
rights.
Congress tasked the Commission with defining the term “investments” for purposes of
the qualified purchaser definition 92 and the Commission adopted a broad definition. 93 Investment
Company Act Rule 2a51-1(b) 94 defines “investments” to include securities (other than
controlling interests in certain issuers), real estate held for investment purposes, commodity

93

See Privately Offered Investment Companies, Release No. IC-22597 (Apr. 3, 1997) [62 FR 17512] (the
“Privately Offered Investment Companies Adopting Release”). The Commission indicated that NSMIA’s
legislative history suggests that Congress intended for the “investments” definition to be broader than
securities, but that not every type of asset should be included. The Commission also indicated that the
legislative history suggests that an asset included in the definition should be held for investment purposes
and the nature of the asset should indicate that its holder has the investment experience and sophistication
necessary to evaluate the risks of investing in unregulated investment pools.

17 CFR 270.2a51-1(b).

interests held for investment purposes, physical commodities held for investment purposes,
financial contracts entered into for investment purposes and cash and cash equivalents held for
investment purposes.
NSMIA also directed the Commission to prescribe rules permitting knowledgeable
employees of a private fund (or knowledgeable employees of the fund’s affiliates) to invest in
the fund without causing the fund to lose its exemption from registration under the Investment
Company Act. 95 This provision permits individuals who participate in a fund’s management to
invest in the fund as a benefit of employment.
C.

Qualified Purchaser Under the Securities Act

NSMIA realigned the federal and state regulatory partnership governing securities
regulation. The legislative history of NSMIA indicates that Congress intended to preempt state
registration of certain offers and sales of securities for the purpose of providing uniform,
nationwide exemptions from registration and qualification requirements at the state level. 96
Among other changes, NSMIA added Section 18(b)(3) to the Securities Act, 97 which
provides an exemption from state securities registration and qualification requirements for
securities offerings and sales to “qualified purchasers.” 98 Section 18(b)(3) of the Securities Act
further provides that “the Commission may define the term ‘qualified purchaser’ differently with
respect to different categories of securities, consistent with the public interest and the protection

Release”).

of investors.”
In 2001, the Commission proposed to define the term “qualified purchaser” to mean an
“accredited investor,” as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D, for purposes of Section
18(b)(3). 99 The proposed definition was not limited to any particular type or class of security, or
transaction in such security. Rather, the Commission explained that the proposed definition
identified well-established categories of persons it previously determined to be financially
sophisticated and therefore not in need of the protection of state registration. The Commission
did not, however, adopt a qualified purchaser definition.
Title IV of the JOBS Act added Section 3(b)(2) to the Securities Act, 100 which directed
the Commission to adopt a new exemption from registration for securities offerings of up to $50
million in a twelve-month period. 101 Additionally, Title IV added Section 18(b)(4)(D)(ii) to the
Securities Act, 102 which provides that Section 3(b)(2) securities are covered securities for
purposes of Section 18 if they are “offered or sold to a qualified purchaser, as defined by the
Commission pursuant to [Section 18(b)(3)] with respect to that purchase or sale.”
In March 2015, the Commission adopted rules to implement Title IV of the JOBS Act by
amending Regulation A 103 to create two tiers of exempt offerings:
•

Tier 1 for offerings of up to $20 million in a twelve-month period, including no more
than $6 million offered on behalf of selling securityholders that are affiliates of the
issuer; and

Tier 2 for offerings of up to $50 million in a twelve-month period, including no more
than $15 million offered on behalf of selling securityholders that are affiliates of the
issuer. 104

All purchasers in a Tier 2 offering must be either accredited investors or persons who limit their
investment amounts to no more than 10% of the greater of their annual income or their net
worth. 105 Consistent with the authority provided in Sections 18(b)(3) and 18(b)(4)(D) of the
Securities Act, and in light of the total package of investor protections included in amended
Regulation A, 106 the Commission defined the term “qualified purchaser” for purposes of
Regulation A offerings to mean any person to whom securities are offered or sold in a Tier 2
offering. 107
D.

Qualified Institutional Buyer

In 1990, the Commission defined “qualified institutional buyer” (“QIB”), another
category of financially sophisticated investors as part of Rule 144A 108 under the Securities Act. 109
Rule 144A provides a safe harbor exemption from the registration requirements of the federal
securities laws for resales of restricted securities to QIBs. The term “qualified institutional

105

For non-natural persons, the investment limitation is 10% of the greater of annual revenues or net assets at
fiscal year end. The investment limitation does not apply to investments in securities that will be listed on
a national securities exchange upon qualification.

106

In addition to investment limitations, Tier 2 offerings include a substantive disclosure document, including
audited financial statements, that must be reviewed and qualified by Commission staff, bad actor
disqualification provisions and ongoing reporting obligations.

buyer” includes specified institutions that, in the aggregate, own and invest on a discretionary
basis at least $100 million in securities of non-affiliated issuers. Banks and other specified
financial institutions must also have a net worth of at least $25 million. A registered brokerdealer qualifies as a QIB if, in the aggregate, it owns and invests on a discretionary basis at least
$10 million in securities of issuers that are not affiliated with the broker-dealer.
E.

Qualified Investor

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act 110 added the term “qualified investor” to the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) for purposes of exemptions for banks from brokerdealer registration. 111 The exemptions permit banks to sell certain securities to qualified
investors without registering as broker-dealers with the Commission. Exchange Act Section
3(a)(54) 112 defines “qualified investor” to include a list of persons, some of which meet the
definition by merely being certain types of entities, while others must also meet an ownership
and investment test. For example, registered investment companies and banks are qualified
investors without having to meet an ownership and investment test; natural persons,

Eligible Contract Participant

The Exchange Act and the Commodity Exchange Act define certain persons as “eligible
contract participants” including based on their status as regulated entities or the amount of assets
they hold or invest. 115 Eligible contract participants can engage in derivatives and swaps
transactions in which non-eligible contract participants generally are more restricted.
Individuals with more than $10 million invested on a discretionary basis (more than $5
million if they are hedging) are eligible contract participants. 116 The eligible contract participant
definition also includes financial institutions, insurance companies, investment companies,
commodity pools with more than $5 million in assets under management, employee benefit plans
with more than $5 million in assets, corporations and other entities with more than $10 million in
assets, corporations and other entities with at least $1 million of net worth if they are hedging
commercial risk, governmental entities with at least $50 million in investments, registered
brokers or dealers, regulated futures commission merchants and regulated floor brokers or floor

Uniform Securities Act of 2002

The Uniform Securities Act of 2002 is a model state securities law drafted by the
National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. 117 It does not contain a specific
exemption for offers and sales to “accredited” or otherwise “sophisticated” natural persons. 118
For entities, however, the Uniform Securities Act of 2002 exempts offers and sales to
“institutional investors.” 119 The “institutional investor” definition generally parallels the
“accredited investor” definition in Securities Act Rule 501(a), but with $10 million asset
thresholds rather than $5 million asset thresholds. 120 The drafters noted that the Uniform
Securities Act of 2002 uses higher thresholds due to “the significant period of time since Rule
501(a) was adopted.” 121
H.

Franchise Laws

Franchise investment laws generally require franchisors to provide potential franchisees
with detailed information about the business and investment. 122 The Federal Trade Commission

117

According to the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, the Uniform Securities
Act of 2002 has been adopted in Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Michigan,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, U.S. Virgin
Islands, Vermont and Wisconsin.

118

Section 203 of the Uniform Securities Act of 2002, however, provides flexibility for state securities
administrators to adopt exemptions in addition to those provided. For example, state securities
administrators can adopt the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption or a Regulation D exemption to cover
natural persons.

A franchise enables someone to operate a business under a format or system developed by someone else.
For example, a franchisee may purchase the right to use a franchisor’s name for a specific number of years

32

(the “FTC”) administers franchise regulations at the federal level and some states have additional
laws governing the offer and sale of franchises. Like the federal securities laws, many franchise
regulatory regimes exempt from their disclosure requirements offerings made to sophisticated
prospective franchise investors. For example, FTC rules contain the following exemptions for
sophisticated investors:
•

The “large franchise investment” exemption for initial investments of at least
$1,084,900, exclusive of unimproved land and franchisor financing.

•

The “large franchisee” exemption for franchisees that have been in business at least
five years and have at least $5,424,500 in net worth.

•

The “insiders” exemption for franchise sales to the owners, directors and managers of
the franchisor. 123

The FTC must update the financial thresholds in the exemptions every four years for inflation. 124
Some states also require registration of franchise offers and sales. Model franchise rules
of the North American Securities Administrators Association (“NASAA”) contain “sophisticated
purchaser exemptions” from registration for large investments and for offers and sales to existing
franchisees, franchisor insiders and “sophisticated franchisees.” 125 A sophisticated franchisee is:
•

a person whose net worth, or joint net worth with that person’s spouse, exceeds $3
million at the time of purchase of the franchise, excluding the value of that person’s

and receive assistance launching and operating a business. See Federal Trade Commission, A Consumer’s
Guide to Buying a Franchise (June 2015).

16 CFR §§ 436.8(a)(5)(i)-(ii) & (6). See also Disclosure Requirements and Prohibitions Concerning
Franchising & Disclosure Requirements Concerning Business Opportunities (Mar. 30, 2007) [72 FR
15444] (referring to the three exemptions, collectively, as the “sophisticated investor exemptions”).

124

16 CFR § 436.8(b) requires inflation adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban
Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (the “CPI”). The FTC last updated the thresholds
in June 2012. See Disclosure Requirements and Prohibitions Concerning Franchising (June 18, 2012) [77
FR 36149].

personal residence, any and all retirement or pension plan accounts or benefits, home
furnishings and automobiles (a “high net worth individual”);
•

a person whose gross income exceeds $500,000 per year in each of the two most
recent years, or whose joint gross income with that person’s spouse exceeds $750,000
per year in each of those years, and who reasonably expects to reach the same income
level in the year following the purchase of the franchise (a “high income individual”);

•

an entity with shareholders’, members’ or partners’ equity exceeding $5 million and
which has been in business not less than five years;

•

a trust with total assets exceeding $5 million and which has been in operation not less
than five years; or

•

an entity or trust in which all of the equity owners are high net worth individuals or
high income individuals.

While the financial criteria used in franchise investment laws provides insight into
regulatory approaches to determining investor sophistication, there are distinguishing factors to
consider. For example, some states have varying financial thresholds applicable to prospective
franchisees beyond the federal FTC thresholds that may reflect specific investor characteristics
and economic conditions in the states. In contrast, the accredited investor definition applies on a
national level. Another distinguishing factor is that many franchisees take an active role in
management or act as owner-operators of the franchises. As a result, their investments may
represent higher percentages of their net worth.
I.

International Approaches

Many foreign jurisdictions provide exemptions from registration or disclosure
requirements for offers and sales of securities to sophisticated or accredited investors. These
jurisdictions use a variety of methods to identify sophisticated or accredited investors.
Criteria Based on Income and Net Worth
Table 3.2 provides examples of other regulatory regimes that use the concept of
measuring sophistication through income or net worth.

A$250,000 or greater in each of the previous two years or net assets of at least A$2.5 million. 128
Similarly, in Canada, an “accredited investor” is any natural person who earned net income of at
least C$200,000, or C$300,000 combined with a spouse, in each of the past two years, or has net
assets, alone or with a spouse, worth greater than C$5 million.129 Canada also uses a separate
financial assets test under which individuals qualify as accredited investors if they own gross
financial assets having an aggregate realizable value, before taxes but net of any related
liabilities, exceeding C$1 million, alone or with a spouse, that are generally liquid or relatively
easy to liquidate, such as cash and liquid securities. 130 In the United Kingdom, all natural
persons are presumed to be “retail” investors, and thus able to benefit from prospectus
requirements and restrictions on securities promotion, unless they choose to be treated as
“professional clients” or certify that they are either “certified high net worth individuals” or
“sophisticated investors.” 131 A certified high net worth individual is one who had an annual
income of at least £100,000 in the preceding year or has net assets valued at £250,000 or more. 132
In Singapore, individuals are “accredited investors” if their net personal assets exceed
S$2 million or their income in the preceding 12 months is not less than S$300,000. 133 The

income or wealth thresholds and considered to be sufficiently knowledgeable or experienced in
managing their financial affairs (whether directly or through professional advice) and protecting
their own investment interests.” 134
The methods for computing these financial criteria vary by country. Like the Regulation
D accredited investor definition, some countries exclude certain types of assets from the net
worth calculation. For example, the United Kingdom excludes the value of primary residences,
loans taken out on primary residences, insurance rights and retirement and death benefits. 135
Criteria Based on Investment Amounts
Some jurisdictions have used a minimum investments test to determine whether an
individual investor is sophisticated. Australia’s definition of sophisticated investor encompasses
any purchase of securities greater than A$500,000. 136 Canada had a prospectus exemption for
purchases of C$150,000 or greater by an individual, but in February 2015 the CSA adopted
amendments to eliminate the exemption. 137 Provisions like this extend the analog of accredited

investor status to the purchaser regardless of whether or not the individual would qualify under
other sophistication measures.
Certification or Verification by Financial Professionals
The United Kingdom provides that investors may be deemed to be sophisticated if they
have a written certificate signed within the last 36 months by a firm confirming that it has
assessed the individual as sufficiently knowledgeable to understand the risks associated with
engaging in investment activity in the relevant investments. 138 Alternatively, investors can
certify that they are “self-certified sophisticated investors.” 139
In Australia, a qualified accountant must certify that an individual meets the net assets
and gross income requirements in a certificate given no more than six months before the offer of
securities is made. 140 In the European Union, it is the responsibility of the issuer or the financial
intermediary to ensure that an individual meets the exemptive criteria and thus may be deemed a
“qualified investor.” 141

sophistication to determine who is able to understand the risks of and bear the loss on private
investments. For instance, in the European Union, an individual who meets at least two of the
following three qualifications can opt to be treated as a “qualified investor” and participate in
securities transactions that might not otherwise be available to ordinary retail investors:
•

Cash deposits and other financial instruments in excess of €500,000.

•

Sophistication based on previous market participation, including the execution, on
average, of at least ten large transactions per quarter over the previous four quarters in
the relevant financial market.

•

Employment in the financial sector for at least one year in a professional position
requiring knowledge of the market transactions contemplated. 142

In Israel, an individual who meets at least two of the following three conditions is
considered a “qualified client” and is able to participate in private placements:
•

Cash, deposits, financial assets and securities totaling in excess of NIS 12 million.

•

Capital markets expertise and skills or work experience for at least one year in a
professional position that required capital markets expertise.

•

Execution of at least 30 transactions, on average, during each of the four previous
quarters, other than transactions a portfolio manager performed for an investment
management client. 143

As this summary indicates, a number of foreign jurisdictions also look to wealth or
income as proxies for financial sophistication and those criteria provide bright-line standards. It
is, however, noteworthy that some foreign jurisdictions also focus on a person’s investment
experience by looking to factors such as the amount of investments owned, transaction history

IV. Accredited Investor Attributes
The accredited investor definition as applied to natural persons has been the subject of
significant commentary and study. Commission requests for comment in connection with recent
rulemaking initiatives have yielded hundreds of comment letters. 144 The GAO Report, mandated
by the Dodd-Frank Act and published in 2013, examined market participants’ views on the
existing criteria for accredited investor status and alternative criteria. The Commission’s
Investor Advisory Committee and the Commission’s Advisory Committee on Small and
Emerging Companies both have provided the Commission with their recommendations on the
accredited investor definition and several of the recommendations from the 2014 SEC
Government-Business Forum on Small Business Capital Formation relate to the definition. 145
This section examines the current definition, common criticisms of the definition, various views
on whether the definition should be modified and potential ways of doing so.

144

On July 10, 2013, the Commission proposed amendments to Regulation D, Form D and Rule 156 (Release
No. 33-9416). The proposing release requested public comment on the definition of accredited investor as
it relates to natural persons. Comment letters related to this request are available at
http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-06-13/s70613.shtml. To facilitate public input on Dodd-Frank Act
rulemaking, before the issuance of rule proposals, the Commission invited members of the public to make
their views known on various regulatory initiatives under the Dodd-Frank Act in advance of any
rulemaking. Comment letters submitted in response to this invitation are available at
http://www.sec.gov/comments/df-title-iv/accredited-investor/accredited-investor.shtml. On August 3,
2007, the Commission proposed revisions to the limited offering exemptions in Regulation D (Release No.
33-8828). The proposing release requested public comment on various matters related to Regulation D.
Comment letters related to this request are available at http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-1807/s71807.shtml.

One of the primary objectives of Regulation D is to facilitate capital formation by
simplifying the rules and regulations applicable to small businesses. 146 The accredited investor
definition for individuals consists of bright-line financial thresholds that are relatively easy to
understand and administer, and some commenters note that Regulation D should remain
streamlined and easy for small businesses to use. 147
A.

Current Definition

Under the current definition, natural persons are accredited investors if their income or
net worth exceeds certain thresholds.
Income
The Commission originally adopted the $200,000 annual income threshold in 1982 148 and
added the provision for joint income in 1988. 149 These thresholds have never been adjusted.
Rule 501(a)(6) 150 does not define the term “income.” The Commission originally
proposed to base the income standard on “individual adjusted gross income…as reported for
Federal income tax purposes in [the] most recent tax return.” 151 At adoption, however, the
Commission chose a more flexible approach by changing the term “adjusted gross income” to

“income.” 152 The Commission noted commenter objections that adjusted gross income may not
be an appropriate metric for foreign investors, persons who file jointly or reside in a community
property state or persons who use legitimate tax planning measures to reduce their adjusted gross
income. The adopting release provided one possible method of calculating income: adjusted
gross income plus the amounts of any deductions for long-term capital gains and depletion, any
exclusions for interest and any limited partnership losses. Commission staff also has indicated
that income includes amounts contributed on a person’s behalf to profit-sharing and pension
plans so long as the person’s rights to the benefits have vested, 153 but that income generally does
not include unrealized capital appreciation. 154
Net Worth
The Commission originally adopted the $1 million net worth threshold in 1982 155 and
revised it in 2011 to reflect changes made by the Dodd-Frank Act that excluded the value of a
person’s primary residence from the calculation. 156 The $1 million threshold has not otherwise
been adjusted.

See Securities Act Rules Compliance and Disclosure Interpretation 255.16 (Jan. 26, 2009). See also
Raymond, James & Associates, Inc., SEC Division of Corporation Finance Interpretive Letter (Dec. 19,
1984). The staff also has expressed the view that a person who has the same marital status during the threeyear period in which income is measured must satisfy the income test in the same way (that is, based on
either individual income or joint income) in all three years. See Securities Act Rules Compliance and
Disclosure Interpretation 255.15 (Jan. 26, 2009).

Section II.D for a historical discussion of the adoption of Regulation D.

156

Primary Residence Adopting Release.

42

The Commission originally proposed an individual net worth threshold of $750,000. 157
Some commenters recommended excluding certain assets, such as principal residences and
automobiles, from the net worth calculation. 158 In response to those comments and for the sake
of simplicity, the Commission increased the net worth threshold to $1 million but did not exclude
any assets from the calculation. The Commission also modified the net worth standard to
include joint net worth in response to comments. 159
Rule 501(a)(5) 160 does not define the term “net worth.” However, when calculating net
worth, the rule excludes the value of a person’s primary residence and includes as a liability
indebtedness secured by a person’s primary residence in excess of the estimated fair value of the
residence. Commission staff also has indicated that “[n]et worth is simply the excess of assets
over liabilities” 161 and that “assets in an account or property held jointly with a person who is not
the purchaser’s spouse may be included in the calculation for the net worth test, but only to the
extent of his or her percentage ownership of the account or property.” 162

Criticisms of the Current Definition

Some commenters state that the current accredited investor definition is over-inclusive

because the financial thresholds contained in the definition have not been adjusted for inflation 163
or because the net worth calculation includes certain assets, such as retirement accounts, that
should be omitted. 164 Other commenters state that the accredited investor definition as it applies
to individuals is under-inclusive because financially sophisticated individuals who are not
wealthy may not qualify. 165 Many commenters question the correlation between wealth and
financial sophistication and, as a result, feel that the income and net worth tests simply fail to
identify correctly those individuals who should be accredited investors. 166
Some academic studies lend support to the theory that wealth is correlated to financial
sophistication. For example, one study found evidence that individuals with higher net worth or
income did not engage in most “irrational” investor behaviors as frequently as lower net worth
individuals. 167 Another study based on trading records of more than 50,000 individuals from a

See, e.g., letter from Rebecca L. Eisenberg (Nov. 4, 2013). Some commenters also have expressed the
view that the accredited investor definition is both over- and under-inclusive because certain financially
sophisticated individuals may not qualify, while wealthy, financially unsophisticated individuals may. See,

Annette Vissing-Jorgensen, Perspectives on Behavioral Finance: Does “Irrationality” Disappear with
Wealth? Evidence from Expectations and Actions, NBER Macroeconomics Annual 2003, Vol. 18. The
study identified the following “irrational” investor behaviors: (1) delayed selling of losing investments in
the hopes of recovery; (2) limited diversification of stock portfolios; (3) limited asset market participation;
(4) naïve diversification of retirement account contributions; (5) status quo bias in retirement account
allocations and (6) excessive trading. Excessive trading was the main exception to the study’s finding. The

44

large brokerage firm between 1991 and 1996 found empirical evidence that wealthier individuals
and individuals employed in professional occupations exhibit a lower tendency to delay selling
investments on which they have incurred losses in the hope that they will recover them. 168 In
addition, a 2009 paper sought to measure the financial sophistication of households by
constructing a financial sophistication index to explain the investment mistakes of under
diversification, inertia in risk taking and delayed selling of investments on which households
have incurred losses in the hope that they will recover them. 169 Using the entire population of
Sweden as a data set, the study concluded that the financial sophistication index increased
strongly with wealth. The study also summarized existing empirical literature, noting that
“growing empirical literature documents a cross-sectional correlation between household
characteristics and investment mistakes. Richer, better educated households tend to be better
diversified, display less inertia, and have a weaker disposition to hold losing and sell winning
stocks than other households.” Financial literacy surveys reflect similar results. For example, a
2012 study by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) Investor Education
Foundation found that higher income individuals correctly answered 3.5 out of five questions on
a financial literacy quiz compared to only 2.2 correct responses for lower income individuals. 170
The reasons underlying the correlation between wealth and sophistication found in the studies

study was based on information obtained from UBS PaineWebber/Gallup on U.S. individual investors.

and surveys are not definitively known. Higher net worth and higher income investors may
make more rational investment decisions based on past investing experience or outside factors
such as education levels or by learning through social interactions. 171 They may also have more
access to information and technology and may more frequently use outside professional advisors.
Regardless of the underlying reasons, however, these findings appear to support the continued
use of financial thresholds as one method of qualifying as an accredited investor.
C.

Potential Adjustments to Income and Net Worth

A number of commenters recommend potential adjustments to the accredited investor
definition as it relates to the income and net worth thresholds. These potential adjustments range
from changing the thresholds themselves to implementing revised or alternative financial criteria.
Adjustments to the Income and Net Worth Thresholds
As previously noted, the individual income threshold has not been adjusted since 1982,
the joint income threshold has not been adjusted since 1988 and the net worth threshold has only
been revised since 1982 to exclude the value of a person’s residence. In 2007, the Commission
proposed adjusting the thresholds for inflation on a going-forward basis every five years
beginning in 2012. 172 The Commission noted a staff report indicating that “inflation, along with
the sustained growth in wealth and income of the 1990s, has boosted a substantial number of
investors past the accredited investor standard.” 173 The Commission further noted that not

Community Effects and Stock Market Participation, Journal of Finance, Vol. 63, No. 3 (2008). See also,

successor thereto) from December 31, 2006.

adjusting the thresholds for inflation has effectively lowered them. 174 The Commission,
however, noted that raising the thresholds significantly may have undesirable results if issuers
return to the practice of conducting private placements under the Section 4(a)(2) statutory
exemption rather than Regulation D. 175
As Table 4.1 indicates, inflation has eroded considerably the individual income and net
worth thresholds since their adoption in 1982 and the joint income threshold since its adoption in
1988. 176

The 1.51 million households qualifying in 1983 represented approximately 1.8% of U.S.
households, while the 12.38 million qualifying in 2013 represented approximately 10.1% of U.S.
households. Adjusting the income and net worth thresholds for inflation would reduce
significantly the number of individuals that qualify as accredited investors under those tests.
Using CPI, the percentage of qualifying households would fall to approximately 3.6% of total
households and using PCE the percentage would fall to approximately 4.1%. In each case,
however, the number of qualifying households would still be approximately three times as large
as in 1983.

(the “SCF”) for 1983 and 2013. The SCF is a triennial survey. See Section X for definitions of income and
net worth used in the analysis. The income and net worth data underlying the number of qualifying
households is estimated in 2015 dollars.

Some commenters favor raising the financial thresholds based on investor protection
concerns. 178 Commenters opposed to any increase cite the critical importance of the exempt
offering market to the economy, arguing that decreasing the size of the accredited investor pool
by raising the thresholds would adversely affect the market and small businesses seeking
capital. 179 Raising the financial thresholds could restrict some investors’ access to investments
that are uncorrelated to their existing investment portfolios, thereby restricting their ability to
diversify the risk of investment loss. Additionally, some commenters are concerned that raising
the financial thresholds in the accredited investor definition would have a disproportionate
impact in less wealthy areas of the country. 180
Some commenters support automatic inflation adjustments to the financial thresholds 181
while others opposed automatic adjustments. 182 One commenter notes that automatic inflation
adjustments could eventually result in Investment Company Act Section 3(c)(1) 183 funds having

Adjustments to the Calculation of Income and Net Worth
As noted above, Regulation D does not define the term “income” and only limited
guidance exists about its interpretation. Some commenters suggest that specifically excluding
certain income sources or using an alternative term, such as “disposable income,” would more
appropriately capture the set of individuals with sufficient discretionary funds to bear investment
risks. 185
With respect to net worth, the Dodd-Frank Act excluded the value of primary residences
from the accredited investor net worth calculation 186 and the Commission excluded any positive
equity individuals have in their primary residences. 187 Some commenters suggest that other asset
categories, such as retirement assets, also should be excluded from the calculation. 188 Table

percentage of U.S. households that qualify as accredited investors based on net worth.

Of the 12.4 million U.S. households that currently qualify as accredited investors, 2.5

excluding retirement assets argue that those assets are not an indicator of sophistication and that
the illiquid nature of private offerings poses risks to retirees who depend on their investments as
a source of regular income. 191 In addition, excluding retirement assets from the net worth
calculation could have a more proportionate impact across the country than raising the income or
net worth thresholds, which may have a disproportionate impact in less wealthy areas. 192
Excluding retirement assets, however, could have the unintended consequence of discouraging
individuals seeking to meet the net worth threshold from contributing to retirement plans or even

encouraging them to withdraw assets from retirement plans. In addition, defining what assets are
included in or excluded from the term “retirement assets” could be difficult. 193
Percentage-Based Adjustments to Income and Net Worth
Currently, the income and net worth financial thresholds are based on fixed dollar
amounts and the results are absolute. An individual who exceeds the income or net worth
threshold by one dollar can invest an unlimited amount in private offerings, while an individual
who falls below the thresholds by one dollar cannot invest any amount at all. Including
investment thresholds or limitations in the accredited investor definition based on a percentage of
net worth or income would lead to less absolute results.
Other Commission rules contain investment limitations. For example, amended
Regulation A limits the amount of securities non-accredited investors can purchase in certain of
those offerings to no more than 10% of the greater of their annual income or their net worth. 194
In adopting the investment limitation, the Commission noted that the limits should help mitigate
any concerns that non-accredited investors may be unable to absorb the potential loss of the
investment. 195 In addition, recently adopted securities-based crowdfunding regulations 196 under
Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act 197 contain aggregate individual investment limitations based
on income and net worth. 198

Some commenters suggest permitting all individuals to invest up to a certain percentage
of their income or net worth in private offerings. 199 Other commenters recommend allowing only
individuals who exhibit some indicia of sophistication to invest a certain percentage of their
income or net worth in private offerings. 200 Similarly, the original accredited investor definition
in Rule 501(a) provided that a person investing at least $150,000 in an offering qualified as an
accredited investor so long as the amount purchased did not exceed 20 percent of the person’s
net worth. 201 Permitting all individuals, or those who exhibit some indicia of financial
sophistication, to invest in private offerings subject to an investment cap could expand
significantly the accredited investor pool while limiting potential losses from any one specific
investment. While investment limitations may be beneficial in limiting losses, they would not
serve as proxies for financial sophistication or identify those individuals who are able to fend for
themselves and thus may not, unless coupled with other relevant criteria, serve as effective

period (1) the greater of: $2,000 or five percent of the lesser of the investor’s annual income or net worth, if
either annual income or net worth are less than $100,000, or (2) ten percent of the lesser of the investor’s
annual income or net worth, not to exceed $100,000, if both annual income or net worth are $100,000 or
more. These limitations apply to both accredited and non-accredited investors.
199

See, e.g., letter from Joseph Karwat (Aug. 20, 2013) (suggesting that investors be permitted to invest up to
five percent of their net worth plus income in start-up companies every year, regardless of income and net
worth levels).

200

See, e.g., letters from National Investment Banking Association (Sept. 23, 2013) (the “NIBA Letter”)

experience should be accredited with respect to some level of investment defined as a percentage of net
worth or income); Stephanie Lee (Sept. 24, 2013) (suggesting an expansion of the accredited investor base
by allowing for investments as a percentage of net worth from “qualified investors”); Angel Capital Group
(July 22, 2014) (suggesting that “sophisticated” investors with incomes between $50,000 and $100,000 be
permitted to invest up to five percent of their income, “sophisticated” investors with incomes between
$100,000 and $200,000 be permitted to invest up to ten percent of their income, and “sophisticated”
investors with incomes over $200,000 be unrestricted in the amount they can invest).

indicators of those individuals who do not require the protections of registration.
Some commenters suggest imposing limitations on the amount accredited investors can
invest in private offerings. 202 This approach would not affect the size of the accredited investor
pool, but could decrease the amount of capital available for investment in the private placement
market. 203 Imposing investment limitations could promote diversification and help to protect
against accredited investors incurring unaffordable losses. Investment limitations could be
implemented in any number of ways. For example:
•

An investment limitation could apply evenly across the spectrum of accredited
investors where all investors would be subject to the same percentage limitation. This
approach would protect all accredited investors from substantial losses, but would
adversely impact the accredited investors who are most able to incur losses.

•

An investment limitation could gradually decrease as net worth or income increases
until the limitation is eventually eliminated. This approach would protect those
accredited investors who are least able to incur losses and have less of an impact on
those accredited investors who are most capable.

•

Separately or in conjunction with the above approaches, investment limitations could
apply on a per issuer basis, a per investment basis or an aggregate investments per
investor basis.

Some commenters, however, raise concerns that implementing any type of percentage-based
investment limitation would add complexity to the accredited investor definition and may prove

202

See, e.g., letters from AARP (Sept. 24, 2013) (the “AARP Letter”) (suggesting that, like the JOBS Act’s
crowdfunding investment percentage limitation, “the Commission should consider whether there should be
a limit on how much even an accredited investor can invest in a Rule 506 Regulation D offering”); Artivest
(Sept. 19, 2013) (the “Artivest Letter”) (suggesting that investors should not be permitted to invest more
than a certain percentage of net worth or liquid assets into certain types of products); Investor Advisory
Committee Recommendation.

203

Because the current average private placement investment size is unknown, it is unclear how significantly
investment limitations would affect the amount of capital available for investment in the private placement
market. To the extent investors generally invest less than any contemplated limitations, the impact on
available capital would be minimal.

54

to be difficult to administer. 204
Alternatives to Net Worth
Several commenters suggest that the amount of a person’s investments may be more
accurate than a person’s net worth as an indicator of sophistication and ability to fend for
oneself. 205 The GAO Report also indicates that this sentiment exists among market participants.
In 2007, the Commission proposed adding a $750,000 “investments-owned” standard as
an additional and alternative method of establishing accredited investor status. 206 The
Commission noted that an investments-owned standard was a potentially more accurate method
of assessing an investor’s need for the protections of registration under the Securities Act than
existing standards. The Commission noted that $750,000 “is the same as the dollar-amount
threshold initially proposed in Regulation D for the asset test, which, as initially proposed,
excluded certain assets, including personal residences. The assets threshold was increased to $1
million and adopted for the sake of simplicity and reflected a $250,000 increase in large part to
account for the value of the primary residence.” Commenters generally supported an
investments-owned test. 207

204

See, e.g., Gunderson Dettmer Letter (indicating that “[w]hile such a formula could, theoretically, produce a
more appropriate test, we are not convinced that the benefits of such a formula outweigh the complexity in
understanding and administering such a requirement.”).

The Commission proposed to define “investments” based on the definition used in
Investment Company Act Rule 2a51-1(b) for purposes of the “qualified purchaser” definition. 208
As discussed above, in addition to securities, that definition includes real estate, physical
commodities, commodity interests and financial contracts, in each case if held or entered into for
investment purposes. When adopting Rule 2a51-1, the Commission noted that “the legislative
history [of NSMIA] suggests that the asset should be held for investment purposes and that the
nature of the asset should indicate that its holder has the investment experience and
sophistication necessary to evaluate the risks of investing ...” 209 Additionally, controlling
interests in an issuer generally do not qualify as investments under Rule 2a51-1(b). The
Commission noted that “limiting the definition in this manner is designed to exclude, among
other things, controlling ownership interests in family-owned and other closely-held
businesses.” 210
Some commenters characterized the 2007 proposed definition of investments as too
narrow or proposed a more principles-based approach. 211 A principles-based approach, however,

208

The 2007 Proposing Release noted that the proposed definition is substantively the same as the definition
proposed in December 2006 in the Private Pooled Investment Vehicle Release. The Private Pooled
Investment Vehicle Release based the definition of investments on the Investment Company Act definition
because it would provide a bright-line standard for ascertaining an investor’s status.

proposed definition was unnecessarily narrow by excluding, for example, secondary residences).

away from investing experience. Other commenters stated that adopting the same definition as
used in the Investment Company Act would promote issuer compliance and investor
understanding. 212
Another possible approach to defining “investments” would be to limit the definition to
investments in securities or liquid assets. The GAO Report described market participant support
for the inclusion of an investment-based test measured by investments that could be easily
liquidated to cover losses. 213 Regardless of the approach taken to define investments, an
important consideration would be whether the definition contains bright-line standards that
minimize the need for subjective evaluations.
D.

Potential New Criteria

Many commenters who believe income and net worth are not accurate proxies for
investor sophistication suggest alternative approaches for determining accredited investor status.
Some commenters generally recommend including alternative measures of sophistication in the
definition 214 while others suggest specific approaches based on criteria such as investors’
education, profession, investing experience, relationships with issuers, use of financial
intermediaries and financial expertise. Although these criteria do not correlate to an investor’s
ability to bear financial losses, some commenters suggest they may effectively identify persons
who do not need the protections of registration.

212

See, e.g., letter from Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP (Oct. 9, 2007) (the “Katten Muchin Letter”).

213

The GAO Report defined “liquid investments” as “assets that can be easily sold, are marketable, and the
value of which can be verified by a financial institution.”

214

See, e.g., ACSEC Recommendations; GAO Report.

57

Education
Many commenters state that certain educational backgrounds more appropriately reflect
investor sophistication than financial metrics and have suggested criteria such as college
degrees 215 and advanced degrees in relevant areas 216 for the accredited investor definition. While
certain types of degrees likely imply knowledge in the areas of finance and investing, 217 a
challenge with this suggested approach could be determining which degrees would be sufficient
for an individual to qualify as an accredited investor. This approach could also be difficult to
administer because of the different types of institutions that grant degrees. For example, should
the Commission consider differently a graduate degree in finance from an unaccredited
institution and an undergraduate business degree from a university with a well-established
finance curriculum? This problem could be exacerbated when one considers the various career
paths that degree holders can take. For instance, a corporate securities attorney and an
environmental attorney both have law degrees, but, based on professional experience alone, it is
probable that their knowledge of finance and investing is not equivalent.
Business Experience and Professional Certifications
Commenters also suggest that the accredited investor definition should consider an
individual’s financial and business sophistication and include criteria such as having operated a

business or being a certified public accountant (“CPA”), chartered financial analyst (“CFA”),
certified financial planner (“CFP”), investment adviser representative or broker-dealer registered
representative. 218 Some commenters note that under the current accredited investor definition,
individuals with relevant credentials may be qualified to provide advice to investors on private
placement offerings, even though they may not qualify as accredited investors and may not be
able to participate in the offerings in their personal capacities. 219
A challenge with this approach could be determining which professional certifications
and designations would be sufficient for an individual to qualify as an accredited investor.
Certain professional certifications and designations may, however, provide demonstrable
evidence of investor sophistication. For example, FINRA administers a number of examinations
that test an individual’s knowledge and understanding in the areas of securities and investing,
and individuals must pass examinations to become CPAs, CFAs and CFPs.

be accredited investors, the Commission may need to review periodically the definition to ensure
that the standards underlying the examinations continue to identify persons having the requisite
financial sophistication to invest in private securities markets. Another potential problem with
this approach could be that some individuals who obtain certifications and designations may not
practice in fields related to the certifications or designations. For these individuals, the validity
of the credential as a proxy for financial sophistication could be lessened, especially if a
substantial amount of time has elapsed since obtaining the certification or designation. This
concern, however, could be mitigated for individuals who maintain active certifications or
designations.
Use of Professionals
Some commenters believe that individuals who are advised by professionals should be
considered accredited investors. 226 Professionals may be able to evaluate the risks and benefits of
a particular offering, and help their clients understand those risks and benefits. Regulation D,
however, already contains a mechanism for individuals to participate in offerings made in
reliance on Rule 506(b) by using “purchaser representatives” even if, acting alone, they may lack
the requisite knowledge and experience to independently evaluate the merits and risks of the
offerings. 227 Purchaser representatives must be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of each

226

See, e.g., Artivest Letter (suggesting that financial services professionals, as well as certain others having
financial experience, such as financial advisers, accountants, etc., should be permitted to invest in Rule 506
offerings); SeedInvest Letter (suggesting that individuals who have consulted a licensed expert and act in
accordance with their recommendations should be deemed to be able to fend for themselves); letters from
Investment Adviser Association (Sept. 23, 2013) (recommending that the Commission consider the GAO
Report’s finding that some market participants supported alternative criteria such as use of an investment
adviser); Morrison & Foerster LLP (Sept. 23, 2013) (the “Morrison Foerster Letter”) (suggesting including
non-accredited investors advised by an “investment professional”).

227

Rule 506(b) allows up to 35 non-accredited investors to participate in an offering if they, alone or together
with a purchaser representative, have such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that

61

prospective investment. 228 An issuer selling to these non-accredited individuals must provide
them with certain information about the issuer, including financial information. 229 Revising the
accredited investor definition to include individuals advised by professionals appears to run
counter to the Commission’s prior determination to allow persons who are unable to evaluate the
merits and risks of private offerings to participate in those offerings only if the issuer provides
them with additional information about the issuer. In addition, there may be significant overlap
between individuals who receive advice from professionals and those who meet the existing
financial standards in the accredited investor definition. 230
Investing Experience in Private Markets
Some commenters recommend considering individuals’ investing experience, 231 possibly
as evidenced by membership in an established “angel” investing group, 232 when determining
whether they are accredited investors. Angel investors provide capital to start-up businesses,

they are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment, or the issuer reasonably
believes immediately prior to making any sale that these investors come within this description.
228

“Purchaser representative” is defined in Rule 501(i). Other conditions to being a purchaser representative
relate to a purchaser representative’s relationship to the issuer, disclosures a purchaser representative must
provide the purchaser and a written acknowledgement from the purchaser. The Commission’s Investor
Advisory Committee recommends prohibiting purchaser representatives from having any personal financial
stake in the investment being recommended, prohibiting purchaser representatives from accepting
compensation from the issuer and requiring purchaser representatives who are compensated by the
purchaser to accept a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the purchaser. Investor Advisory
Committee Recommendation.

229

Rule 502(b). In some cases, issuers must provide information equivalent to that which they would be
required to provide in a registration statement. Given the adoption of amended Regulation A and
securities-based crowdfunding rules, the Commission could consider whether scaled disclosure
requirements are appropriate.

either individually or as a group of investors. 233 A marketplace survey reported that, in 2014,
there were approximately 316,600 active angel investors in the United States and angel investing
funded 73,400 entrepreneurial ventures. 234 According to the survey, the average angel deal size
in 2013 was $328,500. Angel investors appear to have an average of nine years of angel
investing experience and have made an average of ten investments. 235 Angel groups screen
potential investments, perform due diligence, negotiate investment terms and make valuation
determinations. 236
The United Kingdom allows individuals to declare that they are “self-certified
sophisticated investors” based on, among other criteria, having been a member in a network or
syndicate of business angels for at least the last six months or having made more than one
investment in an unlisted company in the last two years. 237 These criteria may correlate to an
individual’s knowledge of the private securities markets generally, including the risks associated
with investing in those markets. Defining the angel groups that qualify, or the standards by

which such groups may qualify, however, could present significant interpretive challenges. If
the definition included a minimum number of investments in private offerings as a criteria, it
could be difficult for individuals who were not previously accredited investors to qualify because
few non-accredited investors participate in such offerings. 238 In addition, because not all types of
exempt offerings give investors the relevant experience for Regulation D investments, 239 the
types of exempt offerings that qualify for this criteria may need to be limited.
Knowledgeable Employees
Several commenters recommend expanding the accredited investor definition to include
an issuer’s knowledgeable employees. 240 Certain commenters 241 specifically recommend
including “knowledgeable employees” of private funds as defined in Rule 3c-5 of the Investment
Company Act. 242 That definition includes executive officers, directors, trustees, general partners,
advisory board members, or persons serving in similar capacities, of the “covered company” 243 or
an “affiliated management person” 244 of the covered company as well as employees who, in
connection with their regular duties participate and have participated for at least twelve months,
238

There are ways individuals could conceivably qualify. For instance, an individual could participate as a
non-accredited investor in Rule 505 or Rule 506(b) offerings, to the extent those opportunities are
available.

239

For instance, participation in crowdfunding transactions.

accredited investor definition already includes officers, directors and general partners.
Expanding the definition in this manner would allow trustees, advisory board members and
certain investment fund professionals to participate in their funds’ private offerings. A private
fund’s knowledgeable employees likely have meaningful investing experience and sufficient
access to the information necessary to make informed investment decisions about the fund’s
offerings.
Accredited Investor Examination
Some commenters recommend permitting individuals to become accredited investors by
passing an examination that tests their investing and market knowledge. 247 An accredited
investor examination could be a universal criteria that would be available to anyone regardless of
wealth, educational background, professional experience or any other factor. Individuals who
are unable to qualify as accredited investors under any other criteria could take an examination
as an alternative means to qualify.

See, e.g., SeedInvest Letter (suggesting a standardized accredited investor test with publicly available
results); EarlyShares Letter (suggesting that a licensing test be created); letter from SecondMarket (Sept.

representative takes to obtain a Series 7 license, to determine a natural person’s investment sophistication
regardless of financial status”). See also Stephen Choi, Regulating Investors Not Issuers: A Market-Based
Proposal (Dr. Choi’s focus was broader than the accredited investor definition. He proposed shifting the
Commission’s regulatory focus from issuers to investors, with protections tailored to specific categories of
investors.); Wallis K. Finger, Note, Unsophisticated Wealth: Reconsidering the SEC’s “Accredited
Investor” Definition Under the 1933 Act (suggesting a licensing scheme based on accredited investor status

individuals’ financial sophistication and understanding of private offerings and their ability to
appreciate the risks involved in those offerings. Requiring that examination results be relatively
recent (e.g., within five years) or requiring continuing education could help to ensure that
investors remain informed of marketplace trends and risks and regulatory changes. Another
advantage of an accredited investor examination is that issuers may be able to easily verify
accredited investor status by asking investors for evidence that they have passed the examination.
One academic also noted that an investor licensing model could increase the level of investmentrelated knowledge in the market. 248
An accredited investor examination could include elements that test investors’ knowledge
of the risks present in unregistered offerings, as well as financial and investing concepts in
general. Portions of FINRA’s Series 7 and Series 82 examinations cover these areas and could
potentially be used as a model for developing an accredited investor examination. Among other
subjects, the Series 7 examination covers securities regulatory requirements, securities
characteristics and financial analysis. 249 Knowledge of the regulatory landscape is particularly
important because individuals who invest in unregistered offerings should understand that they
will generally not receive the type of information contained in a registration statement. The
Series 7 examination consists of 250 multiple choice questions that candidates have six hours to
complete. Among other subjects, the Series 82 examination similarly includes questions related
to the regulation of the markets for registered and unregistered securities, securities

66

characteristics and financial analysis. 250 The scope of the Series 82 examination is more limited
than the Series 7 examination because it focuses on private transactions. It contains 100 multiple
choice questions that candidates have two-and-a-half hours to complete. Although these
examinations may not test knowledge of every type of unregistered investment, they include a
focus on private investments and the inherent risks in unregistered offerings.
Whether an accredited investor examination would be feasible depends on a number of
factors, such as the cost of developing and administering the examination and the number of
individuals who would take the examination. The Commission could explore the feasibility of
developing an examination. If an accredited investor examination meeting the Commission’s
standards could be developed, the Commission could recognize the examination for purposes of
meeting the accredited investor definition.
V.

Should the Accredited Investor Definition Be More Flexible?
With limited exceptions,251 individuals currently qualify as accredited investors based on

fixed financial thresholds that apply to all transactions, irrespective of investor sophistication, the
amount of information provided to investors or other transaction-specific factors. Many
commenters recommend altering the current approach by looking to objective measures of
sophistication as alternative accredited investor criteria. 252 Under such an approach, investors
with greater levels of demonstrable sophistication could be accredited despite having lower
levels of assets or income. The current definition also does not consider issuer-specific factors,

250

http://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/Series_82_Outline.pdf.

251

Rule 501(a)(4) provides that directors, executive officers and general partners of the issuer and its general
partners qualify as accredited investors.

252

See, e.g., NYS Bar Letter; NIBA Letter.

67

such as whether the issuer is an operating company versus an investment fund. This section
considers the implications of adopting more flexible, issuer- and transaction-specific approaches
to the accredited investor definition.
A. Opportunities for Scaling
Sliding scale requirements could be based on a variety of criteria related to specific
investors and transactions.
Type of Information Provided
Currently, Regulation D requires issuers in Rule 505 and 506(b) offerings to provide the
financial and non-financial information specified in Rule 502(b) to prospective purchasers that
are not accredited investors. 253 Issuers in accredited investor-only offerings, including those
made under Rule 506(c), have no such requirement. Nevertheless, companies and funds
conducting private accredited investor-only offerings often provide prospective purchasers with
some information about the issuer. The provision of issuer information to prospective purchasers
in private offerings may provide an opportunity for scaling the financial thresholds in the
accredited investor definition.
For example, the accredited investor definition could establish reduced financial
thresholds that would expand the pool of accredited investors for offerings in which an issuer
provides investors with prescribed information, such as audited financial statements. Under this
potential framework, issuers relying on Rule 505 or 506 could sell securities:
•

253

Exclusively to accredited investors under the default financial thresholds, without
being required to provide financial or non-financial information;

A note to Rule 502(b)(1) indicates that when an issuer provides information to non-accredited investors, it
should consider providing the information to accredited investors as well.

68

•

To persons meeting reduced financial thresholds, if the issuer provides, for example,
audited financial statements; or

•

To non-accredited investors, if the issuer provides the financial and non-financial
information required by Rule 502(b). 254

While including scaled financial thresholds in the accredited investor definition based on
information provided to investors could afford issuers additional flexibility in conducting their
offerings, it would add complexity to the definition and could increase transaction costs. These
consequences could be offset by the larger pool of potential investors and an increased amount of
capital available to invest in the offerings, which could reduce the cost of capital for issuers.
Type of Offering or Issuer
A more particularized approach to the accredited investor definition could require
investors to meet heightened qualification standards for offerings with more intrinsic risks or
complexities. While private fund investments may offer some advantages over investing in
operating companies, 255 in 2006 the Commission noted that private pools have become
increasingly complex and involve risks generally not associated with many other securities
issuers. 256 The regulation of private securities offerings based on risk levels, however, may not
be feasible because of the challenge of categorizing investment risks and the possibility that
some risks may erode or fluctuate over time.

254

This option would not apply to Rule 506(c) offerings, which are limited to accredited investors only.

255

See, e.g., John Morley, The Separation of Funds and Managers: A Theory of Investment Fund Structure
and Regulation, 123 Yale L. J. 1228 (2014) (noting that investors in investment funds, such as hedge funds,
can move their money by redeeming their investments, while investments in operating companies may be
locked in and not removed unless companies pay dividends).

256

Private Pooled Investment Vehicle Release (restating concerns expressed in the Staff Hedge Fund Report).

69

Contextual Approach
Alternatively, or in conjunction with the objective criteria described above, a more
flexible approach could involve a contextual evaluation of an investor’s attributes with respect to
a particular offering. For example, in conjunction with scaled financial criteria, the accredited
investor definition could use the fact-specific and contextual provisions of former Rule 146,
under which investors could be accredited for some offerings but not others. 257 The Supreme
Court in Ralston Purina also used a contextual approach by looking to the ability of offerees to
obtain information about the offering. The concept of accrediting a narrow class of individuals
deemed to be able to fend for themselves based on their knowledge and access to information,
even if those individuals would not otherwise meet the specific criteria in the accredited investor
definition, is an additional example of the contextual approach.
Layered Approach
The accredited investor definition could layer a scaled approach onto existing or
proposed accredited investor criteria. For example, two sets of financial criteria could be
established – one set at the current thresholds that would be subject to absolute or percentagebased investment limitations and another set with higher thresholds that would not be subject to
investment limitations. Similarly, absolute or percentage-based investment limitations could be
imposed for individuals who do not meet certain financial thresholds, but who do meet other
non-financial indicia of financial sophistication.

257

Former Rule 146(e) required that offerees either have access to or have been provided with the same kind
of information specified in Schedule A of the Securities Act. A note to the rule explained that access could
only exist by reason of the offeree’s position with respect to the issuer, and that position meant employment
or family relationship or economic bargaining power that enables the offeree to obtain information from the
issuer to evaluate the merits and risks of the prospective investment.

70

B. Advantages and Disadvantages of Scaling
Scaling provides opportunities to more closely mirror the considerations outlined in
Ralston Purina than using fixed financial thresholds. Scaling could also yield more tailored
results for investors and issuers. This benefit could be significant because while Regulation D
originated as an effort to assist small business capital formation, today all sizes and classes of
issuers rely on Regulation D for their offerings. 258 A more flexible approach would perhaps
better reflect the diversity of issuers that depend on Regulation D and individuals that seek to
participate in these offerings. Scaling could also expand the pool and categories of eligible
investors to reflect changes in the marketplace that have occurred since the adoption of
Regulation D, including the increased amount of information available to many retail investors.
Another benefit of a more flexible approach is that it may better identify the persons the
accredited investor definition was intended to cover. The definition was intended to encompass
those individuals whose financial sophistication and ability to sustain investment losses or fend
for themselves render Securities Act registration unnecessary. A test that addresses all of these
characteristics could result in a more calibrated definition. For example, it may not be
appropriate to accredit individuals based on financial sophistication alone because financial
sophistication does not necessarily have any bearing on an individual’s ability to sustain losses or
ability to obtain the information necessary to evaluate an offering. If an individual, however, has
the financial sophistication to ask for and evaluate information to decide whether and how much
to invest, and the bargaining power to obtain the information, then it may not be necessary for
that individual to demonstrate that he or she has the ability to sustain losses.

258

See 2007 Proposing Release. See also Unregistered Offerings White Paper.

71

On the other hand, the flexibility associated with scaling may increase uncertainty and
complexity in the application of the accredited investor definition. Regulation D simplifies
private placement offerings by using bright-line tests. A more flexible approach could require
market participants to perform additional evaluations to determine whether potential investors
are eligible to participate in a particular offering. The increased complexity would result in
multiple pools of accredited investors containing different types of persons. This could create
uncertainty in accredited investor-only trading venues or increase compliance costs for issuers.
Lastly, the variety of issuers, investor profiles, asset classes and risks involved in private
offerings could make a scaled approach difficult to implement.
VI. Spouses and Spousal Equivalents
An individual, together with a spouse, may qualify as an accredited investor by
surpassing the $300,000 joint income threshold or the $1 million joint net worth threshold. The
Commission did not define the term “spouse” for purposes of calculating joint net worth when it
originally adopted Regulation D 259 or for purposes of calculating joint income when it added the
concept of joint income to the accredited investor definition in 1988. Historically, issuers and
investors have faced uncertainties about whether persons in legally recognized unions such as
domestic partnerships, civil unions and same-sex marriages were considered spouses for
purposes of the accredited investor definition. Because of these uncertainties, commenters and a
rulemaking petition have urged the Commission to update the accredited investor definition to

259

The Commission originally proposed an individual net worth standard for the accredited investor
definition. The joint net worth concept was incorporated into the final definition to simplify the net worth
calculation. The Commission explained that limiting net worth to that of the individual investor presented
potential issues for individuals in community property states and for individuals with assets held jointly
with a spouse and that modifying the test to include joint net worth was a way to alleviate those potential
issues. See Regulation D Adopting Release.

72

clarify that income and assets of both parties in same-sex unions may be included in the joint
income and joint net worth calculations. 260
Recent events have clarified some of these uncertainties. Prior federal law under the
Defense of Marriage Act (“DOMA”) 261 provided that “[i]n determining the meaning of any Act
of Congress, or of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the various administrative bureaus
and agencies of the United States, the word ‘marriage’ means only a legal union between one
man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word ‘spouse’ refers only to a person of the
opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.” In U.S. v. Windsor, 262 however, the United States
Supreme Court held that this provision of DOMA “violates basic due process and equal
protection principles applicable to the Federal Government” and that DOMA could not “survive
under these principles.” Accordingly, the Commission clarified that, where they appear in the
federal securities statutes administered by the Commission, the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, releases, orders and any guidance issued by the Commission or the
staff, the Commission will read the term “spouse” to include an individual married to a person of
the same sex if the couple is lawfully married under state law, and the term “marriage” to include
a marriage between individuals of the same sex if they are lawfully married under state law. 263
At the time the Commission issued this guidance, a number of states did not permit same-sex

73

marriages. In Obergefell v. Hodges, 264 however, the United States Supreme Court recently held
that “same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry in all States.” Therefore,
the references to “spouse” in Rule 501 now include all individuals married to persons of the
same sex.
Although recent Supreme Court decisions and Commission guidance have clarified any
ambiguity with regard to same-sex marriages, issuers and investors may continue to face
uncertainty regarding the treatment of legal unions other than marriage, same-sex or otherwise,
such as domestic partnerships and civil unions. Under the current accredited investor definition,
which refers to but does not define “spouse,” some couples may be unable to pool their financial
resources for purposes of qualifying as accredited investors if they are not considered lawfully
married under state law. To address the remaining uncertainty surrounding legal unions other
than marriage, the Commission could add the following defined term to Rule 501 of Regulation
D, as two commenters previously had requested:
A spouse of a natural person shall mean another person, regardless of gender or sexual
orientation, whose relationship with the person specified: (1) may be characterized as
such person’s (i) husband, (ii) wife, (iii) spouse, (iv) domestic partner, or (v) designated
beneficiary under any applicable state law for the purpose of ensuring that each person in
a two-person relationship has certain rights or financial protections based upon such
designation; or (2) is that of the other party to a civil union with such person. 265
Alternatively, the Commission could expand Rule 501(a) to permit “spousal equivalents”
to pool their financial resources. In 2011, the Commission adopted a rule to define “family
offices” excluded from the definition of “investment adviser” under the Advisers Act. 266 The

Commission defined the term “family member” to include “spousal equivalents.” 267 The term
“spousal equivalent” means a cohabitant occupying a relationship generally equivalent to that of
a spouse. 268 Commenters generally supported the Commission’s inclusion of spousal
equivalents. 269 The Commission rule governing accountant independence also includes “spousal
equivalents.” 270
The Commission also considered this issue when adopting crowdfunding rules to
implement the requirements of Title III of the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act provides that securities
issued in reliance on the crowdfunding exemption may not be transferred by the purchaser for
one year after the date of purchase, except when transferred to, among other persons, “a member
of the family of the purchaser or the equivalent.” 271 The Commission included “spousal
equivalent” in the definition of the term “member of the family of the purchaser or the
equivalent” and the term “spousal equivalent” has the same definition as the definition used for
family offices. 272
Revising Rule 501(a) to permit “spousal equivalents” to pool their financial resources
would maintain consistency with existing adopted and proposed Commission rules. In addition,
the term “spousal equivalent” is sufficiently flexible to encompass future evolutions in federal or

VII. Accredited Investor Entities
Section 413(b)(2)(A) of the Dodd-Frank Act directs the Commission to examine the
accredited investor definition as applied to natural persons. This report also addresses the
definition as applied to entities because requests for interpretive guidance 273 and comment letters
submitted in response to the 2007 Proposing Release suggest that revisions to the definition as
applied to entities may be appropriate.
A.

Current Framework

The accredited investor definition for entities relies on a list of enumerated categories
found in the various subsections of Rule 501(a):
•

Rule 501(a)(1) 274 includes banks, savings and loan associations and similar
institutions; registered broker-dealers; insurance companies; registered investment
companies; licensed Small Business Investment Companies; state and political
subdivision employee benefit plans with total assets in excess of $5 million and
certain employee benefit plans within the meaning of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974. 275

•

Rule 501(a)(2) 276 includes private business development companies as defined in

273

See, e.g., Alaska Permanent Fund, SEC Division of Corporation Finance Interpretive Letter (July 14, 2011)
(the “Alaska Permanent Fund Interpretive Letter”); Cardinal Financial Management Corporation, SEC

Interpretive Letter”); Voluntary Hospitals of America, Incorporated, SEC Division of Corporation Finance
Interpretive Letter (Dec. 30, 1982) (the “Voluntary Hospitals of America Interpretive Letter”); The
Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, SEC Division of Corporation Finance Interpretive
Letter (Feb. 1, 1986) (the “Equitable Life Assurance Society Interpretive Letter”); MIG Realty Advisors,
Incorporated, SEC Division of Corporation Finance Interpretive Letter (Nov. 2, 1987) (the “MIG Realty
Advisors Interpretive Letter”); Wolf, Block, Schorr and Solis-Cohen, SEC Division of Corporation Finance

Rule 501(a)(3) 278 includes 501(c)(3) 279 tax exempt nonprofit organizations,
corporations, Massachusetts or similar business trusts and partnerships, in each case
not formed for the specific purposes of acquiring the securities offered and with total
assets in excess of $5 million.

•

Rule 501(a)(7) 280 includes trusts with total assets in excess of $5 million not formed
for the specific purpose of acquiring the securities offered and whose purchase is
directed by a sophisticated person as described in Rule 506(b)(2)(ii). 281

•

Rule 501(a)(8) 282 includes entities in which all equity owners are themselves
accredited investors.

Any entity not covered specifically by one of the enumerated categories is not an accredited
investor under the rule. Entities not covered include limited liability companies, Indian tribes,
other governmental entities and educational expense plans operated under Section 529 of the
Internal Revenue Code (“529 Plans”). 283 Not enumerating these and other legal entities in the
definition has led to some degree of uncertainty as to whether they may qualify as accredited
investors. 284 In addition, state law developments since the adoption of Regulation D have
expanded the types of business entities that exist and relatively recent concepts, such as low

profit limited liability companies, 285 suggest that developments in this area are ongoing.
In 2007, the Commission proposed amending the Rule 501(a)(3) list of entities to include
“any corporation (including any non-profit corporation), Massachusetts or similar business trust,
partnership, limited liability company, Indian tribe, labor union, governmental body or other
legal entity with substantially similar legal attributes.” 286 The Commission also proposed
defining the term “governmental body” as it commonly appears in transactional financing
documents. 287 In proposing these changes, the Commission noted that it was attempting to
reduce uncertainty and legal costs and promote more efficient private capital formation.
Commenters generally supported the proposal to expand Rule 501(a)(3). 288 Ultimately, the
Commission did not adopt revisions to Rule 501(a)(3).

285

See, e.g., Wyo. Stat § 17-29-102(a)(ix).

286

2007 Proposing Release.

287

The Commission proposed defining “governmental body” as any: (1) nation, state, county, town, village,
district or other jurisdiction of any nature; (2) federal, state, local, municipal, foreign or other government;
(3) governmental or quasi-governmental authority of any nature (including any governmental agency,
branch, department, official or entity and any court or other tribunal); (4) multi-national organization or
body; or (5) body exercising, or entitled to exercise, any administrative, executive, judicial, legislative,
police, regulatory or taxing authority or power of any nature.

288

See, e.g., ABA Letter (supporting the proposal to expand Rule 501(a)(3) but also recommending using the
term “any legal entity” without specifying any particular types of entities); Katten Muchin Letter

and including “qualified purchasers” as defined in Section 2(a)(51)(A) of the Investment Company Act);

including any “statutory business trust” instead of any “Massachusetts or similar business trust” and
clarifying that investment funds sponsored by governmental entities and agencies thereof would be covered
by the definition); 2007 MFA Letter (supporting the proposal to expand Rule 501(a)(3) but also
recommending including “qualified purchasers” as defined in Section 2(a)(51)(A) of the Investment
Company Act); 2007 NASAA Letter (not opposing the proposal to expand Rule 501(a)(3) if the minimum
assets threshold was increased to $10 million); letters from Native Capital Investment, Inc. (Oct. 8, 2007)

bodies such as state governmental bodies); Davis Polk & Wardwell (Oct. 9, 2007) (supporting the proposal
to expand Rule 501(a)(3) but also recommending including “qualified purchasers” as defined in Section
2(a)(51)(A) of the Investment Company Act).

B.

Certain Entities Not Included in the Current Definition

Indian Tribes
The omission of Indian tribes from the accredited investor definition has limited their
investment opportunities and created capital raising difficulties for tribal enterprises. 289 In the
2007 Proposing Release, the Commission proposed expanding the accredited investor definition
to specifically include Indian tribes. The Commission also solicited comments on whether the
term “Indian tribe” should be defined and, if so, how. Specifically, the Commission asked if
“Indian tribe” should be defined in terms of a tribe, band, nation, pueblo, village or community
that the Secretary of the Interior acknowledges to exist as an Indian tribe under the Federally
Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994 290 and if it should include state-recognized Indian
tribes. Several commenters supported including Indian tribes in the accredited investor
definition, either as specifically enumerated entities 291 or by expressly including them in the
definition of “governmental body.” 292
Other Governmental Entities
Several governmental and quasi-governmental entities have asked the Division of
Corporation Finance for interpretive guidance about whether they may qualify as accredited

289

See, e.g., Gavin Clarkson, Accredited Indians: Increasing the Flow of Private Equity into Indian Country
as a Domestic Emerging Market, 80 U. Colo. L. Rev. 285 (2009) (suggesting that the lack of tribal
investment in Indian Country’s emerging economy due to tribes being excluded from the accredited
investor definition creates some degree of hesitation among non-Indian investors);

See, e.g., Native Capital Letter; SOAR Letter.

292

The 2007 Proposing Release proposed adding the term “governmental body” to the list of entities
enumerated in Rule 501(a)(3) and some commenters suggested that it was appropriate to include Indian
tribes in the definition of that term. See, e.g., letters from National Congress of American Indians (Jan. 2,
2008); Gavin Clarkson (Oct. 9, 2007).

79

investors under Rule 501(a). 293 For example, in 2011, the Alaska Permanent Fund requested an
interpretation that it is an accredited investor under Rule 501(a)(3). 294 The Alaska Permanent
Fund is a large sovereign wealth investment fund with a unique form of organization established
by name in the constitution of the State of Alaska. The request noted that “[s]ome uncertainty
exists as to the coverage of institutions substantially similar to those listed [in Rule 501(a)(3)]”
and explained that “because the [Alaska Permanent] Fund has a unique constitutional statutory
form and history it does not fit neatly with the more common forms of business trusts,
corporations or partnerships that are the form commonly taken by private investment funds.”
Based on the facts presented, the Division provided interpretive guidance indicating that,
although the Alaska Permanent Fund is not organized as an entity specifically listed in Rule
501(a)(3), it may be treated as an accredited investor if it satisfies the other requirements of the
definition.
In the 2007 Proposing Release, the Commission proposed expanding the accredited
investor definition to specifically include government bodies. Several commenters supported
including government bodies in the definition and provided recommendations about the
approach. 295 One commenter urged the Commission to exclude governmental entities from the

See, e.g., ABA Letter (recommending a principles-based approach to describing governmental bodies,
rather than providing a detailed definition); Arnold & Porter Letter (supporting the inclusion of
governmental bodies as proposed); Maryland State Bar Letter (recommending clarifying that investment
funds sponsored by governmental entities and agencies thereof would be covered by the definition); letters
from Keith Paul Bishop (Oct. 11, 2007) (the Bishop Letter) (recommending that any assets or investments
threshold not apply to governmental entities); National Association of Independent Public Finance
Advisors (Mar. 10, 2008) (recommending a threshold of $5 million of investments under direct active
management).

80

definition because of the involvement of some governmental entities in troubled investments. 296
In light of the impact troubled investments can have on governmental entities, their
constituents and their states, any expansion of the accredited investor definition to include
governmental entities requires careful consideration of an entity’s financial sophistication and
ability to fend for itself. For example, expanding Rule 501(a)(3) to include any governmental
entity could result in entities with $5 million in non-financial assets, such as land, buildings and
vehicles, qualifying as accredited investors even if they have no investment experience. An
asset-based test likely would not serve as a reliable method for ascertaining whether a
governmental entity is likely to have sufficient knowledge in financial and business matters to
evaluate the merits and risks of prospective investments without the protections of registration.
An investments-based test, however, could reflect meaningful investing experience and exposure
to financial markets.
Limited Liability Companies and Newer Categories of Business Entities
While limited liability companies are a familiar part of the business landscape, only two
states had limited liability company statutes when the Commission adopted Regulation D. 297
Because of the static nature of the accredited investor definition, market participants have sought
interpretive relief from the staff to adapt to state law developments. Commission staff provided
relief in the case of limited liability companies, stating that a limited liability company may be
treated as an accredited investor as defined in Rule 501(a)(3) if it satisfied the other requirements

296

See Melton Letter.

297

In 1982, only Wyoming and Florida had limited liability company statutes. See William J. Carney, Limited
Liability Companies: Origins and Antecedents, 66 U. Colo. L. Rev. 855 (1995).

81

of the definition. 298 In 2007, the Commission proposed to include limited liability companies in
the list of legal entities included in Rule 501(a)(3). 299 Commenters generally supported
expanding the categories of entities qualifying as accredited investors, but one noted that the
proposed approach of enumerating specified entities would not allow for future developments. 300
Business Trusts
Rule 501(a)(3) includes Massachusetts or similar business trusts within the scope of
entities that may qualify as accredited investors. 301 One commenter on the 2007 Proposing
Release indicated that referencing a specific type of business trust under one state’s business
code was unnecessarily limiting and confusing. 302 This potential confusion is indicative of the
overall limitations inherent in attempting to enumerate all qualifying entities within a list.
529 Educational Savings Plans
529 Plans are not specifically enumerated in the accredited investor definition. 303 To the
extent these plans meet the financial criteria applicable to other entities, there is no apparent
regulatory rationale for excluding them. It appears more appropriate to focus on whether the
corresponding financial criteria accurately serve as proxies for financial sophistication or ability
to fend for oneself instead of on how entities are organized or treated for taxation purposes.

303

A 529 Plan may qualify under Rule 501(a)(3) if it is organized as a corporation or under Rule 501(a)(8) if it
is organized as a trust.

82

Non-501(c)(3) Tax Exempt Nonprofit Organizations
Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3) tax exempt nonprofit organizations are included
in the accredited investor definition but other tax exempt nonprofit organizations are not.
Examples of tax exempt nonprofit organizations that do not qualify as accredited investors
include civic leagues, labor organizations, business leagues, chambers of commerce and
voluntary employees’ beneficiary associations. 304 In response to requests for interpretive
guidance, the staff has indicated that a federal income tax exempt governmental unit meeting the
substantive criteria of Section 501(c)(3) with total assets in excess of $5,000,000 may be deemed
a Section 501(c)(3) organization for purposes of qualifying as an accredited investor. 305 In
contrast, the staff has indicated that tax exempt organizations not substantially meeting the
requirements of Section 501(c)(3) will not be deemed to constitute accredited investors. 306
C.

Alternative Frameworks

The principal limitations with the current accredited investor framework for entities are
that some types of entities are not accredited investors because the definition does not
specifically include them, and that the definition does not provide flexibility for legal
developments. As a result, entities not specifically included must request clarification through
interpretive guidance, which increases legal costs and creates transactional uncertainties.
Rule 501(a)(3) originated as a narrow provision with limited applicability and has

304

These organizations may qualify under Rule 501(a)(3) if they are organized as corporations or under Rule
501(a)(8) if they are organized as trusts.

305

See, e.g., Voluntary Hospitals of America Interpretive Letter; Equitable Life Assurance Society Interpretive
Letter.

306

See, e.g., C.U. Brokerage Services, Inc., SEC Division of Corporation Finance Interpretive Letter (Mar. 5,
1985).

83

evolved over time into a common way for entities to qualify as accredited investors. 307 If the
accredited investor definition continues to apply to only specific enumerated entities instead of
all types of entities, revisions may be required periodically in response to legal and economic
developments. In the 2007 Proposing Release, the Commission asked whether it should delete
the list entirely and simply say that any legal entity that can sue or be sued in the United States
can qualify as an accredited investor, provided it meets the other standards for becoming an
accredited investor. Commenters generally supported a catch-all provision. 308
Making the definition applicable to all types of entities, however, could result in entities
without access to sufficient information and lacking the financial sophistication needed to
conduct meaningful investment analysis becoming accredited investors. Expanding the
definition in that manner would require careful consideration of whether the existing asset-based
test identifies those entities that do not need the protections of registration.
In the 2007 Proposing Release, the Commission proposed adding an alternative
investments-owned standard to the accredited investor definition that would have allowed
entities with investments in excess of $5 million to qualify as accredited investors. The
Commission indicated that an investments-owned standard would add a potentially more
accurate method to assess an investor’s need for the protections of registration under the
Securities Act. An investments-owned standard may be a more effective proxy for financial

As originally proposed, Rule 501(a)(3) included only college and university endowment funds with assets

of the Internal Revenue Code. In tandem, the Commission lowered the asset threshold to $5 million.

sophistication than an asset-based test, as it reflects exposure to investment markets. The
Commission also indicated that an investments-owned standard might reduce and simplify
compliance burdens for companies by providing an alternative standard that may be assessed
more easily than the assets standard. The Commission received support for including this
alternative standard. 309 Commenters generally preferred a principles-based definition of the term
“investments” rather than the proposed definition, which was based on Investment Company Act
Rule 2a51-1(b). 310
A revised accredited investor definition for entities that includes a catch-all provision and
an investments-owned test may more effectively measure financial sophistication than the
current definition, which focuses on an entity’s form of organization and its assets, which may
include illiquid and non-investment assets. As noted in the 2007 NASAA Letter, “[the revisions
included in the 2007 Proposing Release] will eliminate arbitrary distinctions based on the
organizational types of various entities, where there is no correlation between the form of entity
and the need for the protections of securities registration.” Instead, NASAA recommended that
the Commission ensure that the entities have the financial qualifications to protect themselves in
a securities transaction. 311
VIII. Implications Outside of the Regulation D Context
In addition to being a historical cornerstone of Regulation D, the accredited investor
definition is used in other federal and state securities law provisions and has taken on increased

310

See, e.g., ABA Letter; Maryland State Bar Letter; NVCA Letter; letter from Price Meadows Incorporated
(Oct. 5, 2007).

The 2007 NASAA Letter also suggested increasing the minimum assets from $5 million to $10 million.

85

significance as a result of the JOBS Act. For example, the JOBS Act and the proposed and
adopted rules thereunder use the definition for the following purposes:
•

Section 501 of the JOBS Act increased the holders of record threshold for purposes of
registration under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act 312 for issuers that are neither
banks nor bank holding companies to either 2,000 persons or 500 persons who are not
accredited investors. As a result, issuers seeking to rely on the increased thresholds
will need to differentiate between record holders who are accredited investors and
non-accredited investors. The Commission has proposed that the accredited investor
definition in Rule 501(a) apply in making those determinations. 313

•

Section 401 of the JOBS Act required the Commission to amend Regulation A to
exempt offerings of up to $50 million of securities annually from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act. Amended Regulation A limits the amount of
securities non-accredited investors can purchase in certain of those offerings to no
more than 10% of the greater of their annual income or their net worth. 314 Accredited
investors are not subject to investment limitations.

•

Section 201(a) of the JOBS Act required the Commission to revise Rule 506 to permit
general solicitation in private offerings, provided that all purchasers are accredited
investors and the issuer takes reasonable steps to verify such accreditation. The
Commission revised Rule 506 in July 2013. 315

Some states use the accredited investor definition to determine whether investment
advisers to certain private funds are required to be registered. 316 States also incorporate the
definition in a variety of other contexts. For example, the definition is used in government

finance, 317 finance lending, 318 mortgage lending, 319 insurance 320 and financial institution
regulation. 321 The accredited investor definition also served as a model for an exemption under
the Uniform Securities Act of 2002. 322
FINRA also uses the accredited investor definition to provide an exemption from the
general requirement that each member firm that sells an issuer’s securities in a private placement
file with FINRA a copy of any private placement memorandum, term sheet or other offering
document the firm used within 15 calendar days of the date of the sale, or indicate that it did not
use any such offering documents. 323 FINRA Rule 5123 contains an exemption for offerings sold
to, among other persons, accredited investors described in Securities Act Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3)
or (7). The rule does not incorporate the entire accredited investor definition, and in particular
excludes the net worth and income criteria set forth in Rule 501(a)(5) and (6) respectively. The
Commission release approving FINRA’s adoption of this rule noted the following rationale:
Several commenters requested additional exemptions from coverage under Rule 5123.
[One commenter], for example, requested an exemption for all accredited investors.
FINRA stated that it does not believe that the exemption should extend to offers to
accredited investors under Rule 501(a)(4), (5), or (6) of Regulation D. In particular,
FINRA stated that it believes that the criteria used to measure whether a person meets the
accredited investor standard do not necessarily reflect a sufficiently high level of
sophistication to justify exemption from the proposed rule. 324

IX. Recommendations
Registration under the federal securities laws is intended to help ensure the adequate
provision of relevant information about an issuer and its offering of securities so that investors
can make informed investment decisions. Exemptions from registration are provided for
situations where there is no practical need for registration or the public benefits from registration
are too remote. The accredited investor concept in Regulation D was designed to identify, with
bright-line standards, a category of investors whose financial sophistication and ability to sustain
the risk of loss of investment or ability to fend for themselves render the protections of
registration unnecessary.
The Regulation D market has become a large and vibrant market for raising capital,
especially for small business capital formation. 325 The Unregistered Offerings White Paper data
shows that Regulation D offerings occur with far greater frequency than any other offering
markets surveyed. As accredited investors play a critical role in providing capital for this
market, any change to the accredited investor definition would have to consider both the impact
the change could have on investors and the supply of capital to the Regulation D market.
There is a tradeoff between using a principles-based accredited investor definition and the

Amendments No. 2 and No. 3 and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change, as
Modified by Amendments No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 to Adopt FINRA Rule 5123 (Private Placements of
Securities) in the Consolidated FINRA Rulebook, Release No. 34-67157 (June 7, 2012) [77 FR 35457].
325

The aggregate amount of capital raised through Regulation D offerings is large, but a significantly lower
median offering size indicates a large number of small offerings, consistent with the original regulatory
objective to target the capital formation needs of small businesses. See Unregistered Offerings White
Paper.

88

need for bright-line standards that investors, issuers and their advisors can understand and apply
easily. Uncertainty surrounded private placements and small business offerings during the
principles-based regulatory regime that was in place prior to the adoption of Regulation D.
Bright-line standards, however, are necessarily under- and over-inclusive. For example, the fact
that an individual has a high net worth does not necessarily mean the individual is financially
sophisticated, while a personal finance expert without requisite levels of income or net worth is
not an accredited investor under the current definition. The staff believes that the Commission
should consider any one or more of the following methods of revising the accredited investor
definition.
1.

The Commission Should Revise the Financial Thresholds Requirements for Natural
Persons to Qualify as Accredited Investors and the List-Based Approach for Entities
to Qualify as Accredited Investors.
Regulation D uses income and net worth thresholds to identify natural persons as

accredited investors. The Commission established the $200,000 individual income and $1
million net worth thresholds in 1982 and the $300,000 joint income threshold in 1988. Since
then, the number of U.S. households qualifying as accredited investors has increased from
approximately 2% of the population to over 10% as a result of inflation. While the size of the
accredited investor pool has increased significantly, the staff is not aware of evidence suggesting
that individuals qualifying as accredited investors under the current financial thresholds and
participating in the Regulation D market require the protections of registration. On the other
hand, inflation has increased the likelihood that the current pool of accredited investors may
contain individuals the definition did not originally intend to encompass.
Regulation D uses enumerated categories to identify entities as accredited investors.
Some types of entities qualify as accredited investors with over $5 million in assets, while other

89

types of entities qualify as accredited investors without being subject to the asset test. Any type
of entity not covered specifically by one of the enumerated categories is not an accredited
investor. The approach of specifically enumerating types of entities has resulted in the exclusion
of some entities that likely should be accredited investors.
The staff believes that the following approaches could address concerns with how the
current definition identifies accredited investor natural persons and entities.
A.

Leave the Current Income and Net Worth Thresholds in Place, Subject to
Investment Limitations.

Inflation has expanded significantly the number of individuals who qualify as accredited
investors based on income and net worth. Limiting investment amounts for individuals who
qualify as accredited investors based solely on the current income or net worth thresholds could
provide protections for those individuals who are less able to bear financial losses. In addition,
leaving the current thresholds in place, instead of simply increasing them to reflect inflation,
would not diminish the size of the accredited investor pool and would provide a mechanism for
individuals to continue to invest in private offerings. The Commission could consider leaving
the current income and net worth thresholds in the accredited investor definition in place, but
limiting investments for individuals who qualify as accredited investors solely based on those
thresholds to a percentage of their income or net worth (e.g., 10% of prior year income or 10% of
net worth, as applicable, per issuer, in any 12-month period).
B.

Add New Inflation-Adjusted Income and Net Worth Thresholds that Are Not
Subject to Investment Limitations.

The income and net worth thresholds have never been adjusted, although inflation has
eroded them considerably. The $200,000 individual income threshold established in 1982
represents approximately $433,000 to $491,000 in today’s dollars and the $300,000 joint income

90

threshold established in 1988 represents approximately $529,000 to $601,000 in today’s dollars.
The $1 million net worth threshold established in 1982 represents approximately $2.16 million to
$2.45 million in today’s dollars. While many commenters oppose increasing the financial
thresholds in the definition, others support such an adjustment. The staff believes that the
financial thresholds should be adjusted to reflect inflation to be consistent with the
Commission’s 1982 and 1988 policy choices. The staff also believes that the potential
alternative criteria identified below could provide adequate avenues for sophisticated individuals
to qualify as accredited investors. The Commission could consider adding new inflationadjusted income and net worth thresholds. Thresholds such as $500,000 for individual income,
$750,000 for joint income and $2.5 million for net worth would reflect inflation and maintain the
ratios in the current definition. Under this approach, individuals who meet the new income or
net worth thresholds would not be subject to the investment limitations suggested in paragraph A
above.
C.

Index All Financial Thresholds in the Definition for Inflation on a GoingForward Basis.

Indexing the financial thresholds in the accredited investor definition for inflation would
be consistent with the Commission’s approach in its 2007 proposed revisions to the definition, as
well as the approach Congress took in the Dodd-Frank Act with respect to the “qualified client”
definition and in the JOBS Act with respect to crowdfunding and emerging growth companies.
Section 413(b)(2)(A) of the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Commission to undertake a review of
the accredited investor definition at least once every four years. The Commission could consider
indexing all financial thresholds in the accredited investor definition for inflation, rounded to the
nearest $10,000, on a going-forward basis every four years to coincide with the Commission
reviews.

91

D.

Permit Spousal Equivalents to Pool their Finances for the Purpose of
Qualifying as Accredited Investors.

When first adopted, the accredited investor definition attempted to simplify financial
calculations for investors living in community property states or where property was held jointly
by providing for qualification based on joint net worth. Allowing spousal equivalents to pool
their finances would provide consistent regulatory treatment among marriages, civil unions and
domestic partnerships.
The Commission could consider adding the term “spousal equivalent” to the accredited
investor definition. To promote consistency across Commission rules, the term could be defined
as “a cohabitant occupying a relationship generally equivalent to that of a spouse,” which is the
same definition as used in the family office rule, accountant independence standards and
crowdfunding rules.
E.

Permit All Entities With Investments In Excess of $5 Million to Qualify as
Accredited Investors.

The accredited investor definition does not provide a mechanism for limited liability
companies and certain other business entities, Indian tribes, labor unions, social enterprises,
sovereign wealth funds, 529 Plans, and any other entities not specifically listed in the definition
to qualify as accredited investors. Limiting the exemption to specific entities has resulted in
regulatory uncertainty and may not effectively serve the rule’s investor protection objectives.
The Commission could consider modifying the definition to permit any entity with investments
in excess of $5 million, and not formed for the specific purpose of investing in the securities
offered, to qualify as an accredited investor.
The Commission also could consider replacing the assets test in the current definition
with an investments test because the staff believes it would provide a more meaningful standard

92

for ascertaining whether an entity is likely to have sufficient knowledge in financial and business
matters to enable it to evaluate the merits and risks of potential investments without the
protections of registration. An “investments” definition based on the definition of investments in
Rule 2a51-1(b) would promote consistency across securities laws and provide a predictable
framework.
The Commission could consider retaining the current provisions that permit certain
regulated entities (e.g., banks, savings and loan associations, insurance companies) to qualify as
accredited investors without any financial thresholds.
F.

Permit an Issuer’s Investors That Meet and Continue to Meet the Current
Accredited Investor Definition to Be Grandfathered with Respect to Future
Offerings of the Issuer’s Securities.

If the Commission modifies the accredited investor definition, the Commission also
should consider grandfathering issuers’ current investors who meet and continue to meet the
current accredited investor standards with respect to future offerings of the same issuers’
securities. Grandfathering would provide protection from investment dilution for any person
who would no longer be accredited investors because of any changes to the definition. The
grandfathering provision could apply to future investments in a particular issuer only, and not to
future investments in affiliates of the issuer.
2.

The Commission Should Revise the Accredited Investor Definition to Allow
Individuals to Qualify as Accredited Investors Based on Other Measures of
Sophistication.
The existing accredited investor definition as applied to natural persons uses only

financial measures to serve as a proxy for financial sophistication and ability to sustain
investment losses or fend for one’s self. It is not likely, however, that any single criteria –
including the existing income and net worth standards – can determine that an individual will
possess those attributes. The staff believes that it is reasonable to view an investor’s financial
93

sophistication, on the one hand, and ability to absorb losses, on the other, as providing different
ways to assess accredited investor status. For example, very well informed investors who are not
wealthy may be in a position to take on risks that they understand well, while very wealthy
investors may be in a position to take on risks even if they lack financial sophistication.
The staff believes that the following approaches could be considered to identify
individuals who could qualify as accredited investors based on criteria other than income and net
worth.
A.

Permit Individuals With a Minimum Amount of Investments to Qualify as
Accredited Investors.

Investments may in some cases be a more meaningful measure of individuals’ experience
with and exposure to the financial and investing markets than income or net worth. Commenters
and market participants have expressed support for the accredited investor definition to include
an investments test, although they have different views about how to establish such a test. An
“investments” definition based on the definition of investments in Rule 2a51-1(b) would promote
consistency across securities laws and provide a predictable framework. The Commission could
consider adding an investments test to the accredited investor definition so that individuals with a
minimum amount of investments, as that term is defined in Rule 2a51-1(b), qualify as accredited
investors. 326
B.

Permit Individuals With Certain Professional Credentials to Qualify as
Accredited Investors.

Expanding the accredited investor definition to include persons holding certain
professional credentials would recognize an objective indication of sophistication. The

326

In 2007 the Commission proposed applying a $750,000 minimum investment threshold. See 2007
Proposing Release.

94

Commission could consider adding a new category to the accredited investor definition that, for
example, includes individuals who have passed the Series 7 examination, Series 65 examination
or Series 82 examination. Those credentials may provide demonstrable evidence of relevant
investor sophistication because of the subject matter their examinations cover.
C.

Permit Individuals With Experience Investing in Exempt Offerings to Qualify
as Accredited Investors.

Expanding the accredited investor definition to include individuals with relevant
investment experience would recognize an objective indication of financial sophistication and
allow experienced investors to maintain their accredited investor status. These individuals
presumably have developed knowledge about the private capital markets, including their inherent
risks. This experience may include performing due diligence, negotiating investment terms and
making valuation determinations. As previously noted, on average, current angel investors
appear to have invested in ten prior offerings. The Commission could consider adding a new
category to the accredited investor definition that includes individuals who have invested in at
least ten private securities offerings, each conducted by a different issuer, under Securities Act
Section 4(a)(2), the safe harbor promulgated thereunder, or Rule 506(c). This limitation would
focus the criteria on recognizing only relevant investment experience.
D.

Permit Knowledgeable Employees of Private Funds to Qualify as Accredited
Investors for Investments in their Employer’s Funds.

A private fund’s knowledgeable employees likely have significant investing experience
and sufficient access to the information necessary to make informed decisions about investments
in their employer’s funds. Expanding the accredited investor definition to include
knowledgeable employees of private funds would recognize this specific category of individuals
as capable of fending for themselves. The Commission could consider adding a new category to

95

the accredited investor definition that includes “knowledgeable employees” of “covered
companies” as those terms are defined in Rule 3c-5 of the Investment Company Act.
E.

Permit Individuals Who Pass an Accredited Investor Examination to Qualify
as Accredited Investors.

Creating an accredited investor examination could provide a path for individuals who can
objectively demonstrate they are financially sophisticated and understand the nature and risks of
unregistered offerings to qualify as accredited investors. This approach could enable financially
sophisticated individuals to qualify as accredited investors regardless of their wealth, educational
background or professional experience. An accredited investor examination may reduce
compliance burdens on issuers, since verification of a passing score on an examination would
typically not require significant time or cost. The staff believes that any such accredited investor
examination would need to test financial and investing knowledge, as well as understanding of
private offerings and the risks involved with them. Portions of FINRA’s Series 7 and Series 82
examinations cover these areas and could potentially serve as a model for an accredited investor
examination. The Commission could explore the possibility of developing an accredited investor
examination. If development of an accredited examination is feasible, the Commission could
consider revising the accredited investor definition to provide that individuals who pass the
examination qualify as accredited investors.

96

X.

Impact of the Potential Approaches on the Pool of Accredited Investors
Revising the standards for qualifying as an accredited investor would alter the size and

composition of the pool of accredited investors that are natural persons. In this section, the staff
presents estimates for the number of U.S. households that would qualify as accredited investors
under the potential criteria. 327 We also provide broad profiles of the pools of investors that meet
the current and potential criteria based on various demographic characteristics. Where the
potential criteria are not easily quantifiable, we qualitatively evaluate their impact on the
accredited investor pool.
The underlying household data for this analysis was obtained from the Federal Reserve
Board’s Survey of Consumer Finances (the “SCF”) for 1983 and 2013. 328 The SCF is a triennial
survey that provides insights into household income and net worth, where the household is
considered to be the primary economic unit within a family. While the SCF collects information
on families’ total income before taxes for the preceding calendar year, the bulk of the data,
including family balance sheet data and demographic characteristics, covers the status of the
family at the time of the interview. 329 The SCF employs weights to make the data representative
of the U.S. population. 330 Thus, the 1983 SCF and the 2013 SCF are representative of the U.S.

327

We estimate households and not individuals due to data limitations; the database underlying our analysis
measures wealth and income at the household level.

328

http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/scf/scfindex.htm.

329

A major feature of the database is that missing data is imputed by repeatedly drawing an estimate from the
conditional distribution of the data. This is done five times and the imputations are recorded as five
replicates for each household. As replicate weights are calculated only for the first implicate for each
household, we use only the first implicate in our analysis. Nevertheless, we compared the estimates
provided below with estimates using all five implicates. We do not find any statistically significant
differences between the two sets of estimates.

330

See Jesse Bricker, Lisa J. Dettling, Alice Henriques, Joanne W. Hsu, Kevin B. Moore, John Sabelhaus,
Jeffrey Thompson and Richard A. Windle, Changes in U.S. Family Finances from 2010 to 2013: Evidence

97

population in 1983 (approximately 83.9 million households) and 2013 (approximately 122.5
million households), respectively.
For the analysis, we use variables as defined by Bricker, et al. 2014. 331 We provide
descriptions of the main variables below. Data for inflation was obtained from the CPI indices
database of the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the PCE indices database of the Bureau of
Economic Analysis, United States Department of Commerce.
•

Income – Includes wage income, business income, rent income, interest and dividend
income, pension income, social security income, income from retirement accounts,
transfers and other income. According to the SCF documentation, income data is
collected for the year prior to the year of the SCF. 332 As suggested by Bricker, et al.
2014, we adjust the income data by a factor of 1.0145 to reflect 2013 dollars so that it
is comparable to the data for net worth and other variables. We further adjust the data
by a factor of 1.0162 to account for inflation for the period 2013-2014 and to reflect
the value in 2014 dollars.
It should be noted that in the SCF database income is reported at the household level.
We do not attempt to differentiate income based on marital status of the household 333
because data on individual income from all sources is not available, at least in the
public version of the database. 334 As a result, accredited investor (household)
estimates based on individual income thresholds are likely to be overestimated and
would represent upper bounds.
A household can have multiple family members with independent sources of income
that qualify them as accredited investors based on income. We count them as one
accredited investor for each household, which implies we are also likely
underestimating the actual pool of accredited investors when we provide household

from the Survey of Consumer Finances, Federal Reserve Bulletin, Vol. 100, No. 4 (2014) (“Bricker, et al.
2014”). The dollar amounts are adjusted to 2013 dollars using the ‘current methods’ version of the CPI.
331

Id. See also http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/scf/files/bulletin.macro.txt.

332

Id.

333

We find that three-fifths of the households that qualify on individual income basis have spouses that are
self-employed or are employed by someone else.

334

Individual wage income at the time of survey (not the previous year as with total income data) is available,
but it is an incomplete representation. For example, individual income of self-employed household
members, or investment income of individuals in the household is not available.

98

estimates. Consequently, the household estimates we derive utilizing the joint
income threshold would represent a lower bound for individuals qualifying on the
basis of income.
The actual number of individuals that qualify as accredited investors on income basis
(individual or joint) would, in all likelihood, lie between the estimates that we derive
for the individual income threshold and the joint income threshold.
•

Net Worth – This measure represents the difference between household assets and
household debt. Assets include all financial and non-financial assets. 335 Debt
includes mortgage and home equity loans, lines of credit, credit card debt, installment
loans including vehicle loans, margin loans, pension loans and other debt (e.g., loans
against insurance). We exclude the value of the household’s principal residence and
any outstanding mortgages associated with the principal residence. We also adjust the
net worth figure by a factor of 1.0162 to reflect 2014 dollars.

•

Investments – We calculate investments, for the purpose of defining “minimum
investments,” based on Investment Company Act Rule 2a51-1. Investments thus
includes:
o All financial assets
o Non-financial assets - real estate (excluding primary residence) and other nonfinancial assets (including commodities, antiques, stamp collections,
oil/gas/mineral leases, etc.)

A.

Impact of Potential Approaches

1. New Income Threshold of $500,000 and Net Worth Threshold of $2.5 Million
That Reflect Inflation and Are Not Subject to Investment Limitations
Increasing the individual income threshold from $200,000 to $500,000 and the net worth
threshold from $1 million to $2.5 million to reflect the impact of inflation since 1982 would
shrink considerably the number of households that qualify as accredited investors, without any
investment limitations, on the basis of income or net worth. As Table 10.1 below shows, the
number of households that would qualify under the new thresholds is approximately 28% of the

335

Financial assets include all stocks, bonds, mutual funds, cash, and cash management accounts, retirement
assets, life insurance, managed assets like trusts and annuities, and other financial assets like deferred
compensation, royalties, futures etc.

99

households that currently qualify under the individual or joint income standards. Similarly, as
Table 10.2 below shows, the number of households that would qualify under the $2.5 million net
worth standard is approximately 40% of the households that currently qualify under the $1
million standard.

The SCF database uses sampling to estimate population characteristics. The standard error of the mean
measures the accuracy with which the sample represents the population. It enables us to calculate the range
within which the true (population) estimate of the sample mean is likely to be. Statistically (assuming
certain distributional characteristics), the population estimate would be within one standard of the mean at
least 68% of the time and within two standard errors of the mean at least 95% of the time. For example, the
number of households that currently qualify as accredited investors on the basis of individual income is
estimated (using 2013 SCF data) to be 8.07 million households. The standard error of 0.39 million
households indicates that we can have 95% confidence that the actual number of accredited investor
households are between 7.31 million households and 8.83 million households (i.e., 8.07-1.96*0.39,
8.07+1.96*0.39).

2. Current Income and Net Worth Thresholds, Subject to Investment Limitations
Conditional qualification 337 of households that have individual income between $200,000
and $500,000, joint income between $300,000 and $750,000, or net worth between $ 1 million
and $2.5 million would ensure that all the households that currently qualify as accredited
investors on the basis of income or net worth continue to be qualified to participate in Regulation
D offerings as accredited investors. At the same time, an investment limitation per offering,
while maintaining the number of accredited investors, could decrease the supply of capital that is
available for investment in Regulation D offerings.

337

As used in this section, the term “conditional qualification” means limiting the investment amounts for
these individuals to a percentage of their income or net worth (e.g., 10% of prior year income or 10% of net
worth, as applicable, per issuer, in any 12-month period).

3. Permit Individuals With a Minimum Amount of Investments to Qualify as
Accredited Investors.
Adding a new minimum investments criteria would increase the number of households
that qualify as accredited investors. The net increase to the accredited investor pool would be
attributed to any households that do not currently qualify as accredited investors but would
qualify under the new minimum investments criteria.
We find a large overlap between households that qualify under current standards and
those that would qualify under a new minimum investments criteria. Table 10.4 below presents
the proportion of the U.S. household population that would qualify under different minimum
investments thresholds and the net impact the new criteria would have on the current accredited
investor pool. We also present, in the last column, the net impact a minimum investments
criteria would have on the number of households that would not be limited in their investment
amounts. The additional households would be those that qualify under the conditional income
and net worth thresholds outlined in Tables 1 and 2 above whose investments would not be

102

limited because they also qualify under the minimum investments criteria. As can be seen in
Table 4 below, under a minimum investment threshold of $750,000, 338 while almost 10.3 million
households meet the criteria, only 1.65 million households do not currently qualify as accredited
investors.

respectively, and not be subject to investment limitations.

B.

Non-Quantifiable Approaches

For the potential approaches 1.D through 1.F and 2.B through 2.E, due to unavailability
of adequate data, we are unable to provide reasonable estimates of the number of households or
individuals that may qualify under each of these potential approaches. It is to be noted that most
of these additional criteria will serve primarily as proxies for investor sophistication. We expect
that the number of households that would qualify under these additional criteria will have some

338

The Commission proposed a $750,000 minimum investments criteria in 2007. See 2007 Proposing
Release.

103

degree of overlap with the households that qualify as accredited investors based on the income,
net worth or minimum investments criteria listed above. We anticipate that, to the extent that the
households qualifying under these do not overlap with those qualifying under the quantifiable
approaches, the net effect of these non-quantifiable approaches would be to increase the size of
the accredited investor pool.
C.

Combined Impact of Quantifiable Approaches

Table 10.5 below presents the impact of various alternate standards on the pool of
accredited investors. We assume a minimum investments threshold of $750,000 for our analysis.
Adjusting the income and net worth thresholds solely for inflation to reflect current
dollars would shrink the accredited investor pool considerably to approximately 4.4 million
households, from the current pool of approximately 12.4 million households. The first three
approaches under this study would result in the pool increasing to approximately 14 million
households or 11.5% of total U.S. population, in terms of households. We anticipate that the
non-quantifiable approaches would further expand the pool of households that would qualify as
accredited investors. The table presents the estimated number of households that qualify as
accredited investors under the current and potential criteria, and as a proportion of the U.S.
population in terms of households.

While the number of qualifying households under the recommended criteria would
increase over the current accredited investor pool, the composition of the pool would change as
the number of households that would not have any investment limitations would decline from the
current level of 12.39 million to 10.77 million. It is therefore possible that the amount of capital
available for investment in Regulation D offerings could be lower than the current amount due to
the investment limitations chosen for certain levels of income and net worth. Table 10.6 below
presents the composition of the accredited investor pool if the first three approaches were
implemented, based on investment limitations.

Accredited Investor Pool

Number of Accredited Investors that May Invest in Regulation D Offerings

The proportion of the U.S. population that qualifies as accredited investors has grown
from approximately 1.8% of the population in terms of households, to approximately 10.1% of
the population (Table 10.5 above), and if the proposed approaches in 1.A, 1.B and 2.A are
adopted, the pool could grow to approximately 11.5% or more of U.S. households. Data from
the 2013 SCF also shows that approximately 95% of households held some form of financial

339

Assuming a minimum investments threshold of $750,000.

107

asset, including approximately 49% of U.S. households that held stock directly or through
mutual funds, pension funds, trusts or annuities.
The data above and in the preceding tables provides an estimate of the overall pool of
qualifying households in the United States. It does not, however, represent the actual number of
accredited investors that do or would invest in the Regulation D market, or how that number
would change if the approaches recommended for consideration in the study were adopted. 340
Form D filings do not provide a break-down of investors by type – institutions or natural persons
– that invested in an offering. 341 In addition, because there is no requirement to file an amended
Form D upon completion of an offering, reported information in the Form D filings may not
reflect the actual number of accredited investors who participated in any particular offering.
Whether individuals who qualify as accredited investors will invest in private offerings is
likely largely a function of their risk aversion. 342 One way to obtain an upper bound for potential
Regulation D investors is to consider the number of households that hold retail equity (i.e., direct
investment in stock). Assuming publicly-traded retail equity investments are a gateway to
participation in private capital markets, accredited investors with publicly-traded retail equity
investing experience are more likely to participate in private offerings than accredited investors
without retail investing experience.
Table 10.7 below presents the proportion of U.S. households with direct retail stock

340

In addition, the data does not provide insight into whether increasing the size of the accredited investor
pool would result in an increase in private offerings compared to public offerings.

341

Initial Form D filings for the period 2009-2014 indicate that approximately 250,000-300,000 investors have
invested in new Regulation D offerings annually. This number includes entities as well as natural persons.

342

Risk aversion measures an investor’s appetite for risk. A “risk-tolerant” investor would opt for an
investment opportunity that has more uncertain payoffs than an opportunity with more certain, but possibly
lower expected payoffs.

108

investments. 343 The data indicates that less than 14% of U.S. households participate in the retail
equity market. 344 For the current accredited investor pool, the retail equity market participation
rate is much higher at approximately 49%. This would imply that the actual number of
accredited households that would potentially invest in private offerings is likely to be at least half
of the overall pool of 12.5 million, or approximately 6.25 million households. Under the
potential approaches recommended for consideration, the number of accredited households that
would potentially invest in private offerings would increase to 6.9 million households, or
approximately 53% of the pool.

Profile of Accredited Investor Pools Qualifying Under Current Standards
and Recommended Standards

In this section we provide a brief overview of certain demographic characteristics of the
estimated accredited investor pool, based on the current and potential criteria. We also include

343

Not including equity holdings through mutual funds, pension funds and other non-retail investments.

344

U.S. household direct retail equity investment participation has declined in recent years. For example, the
participation rate was reported to be more than 15% in the 2010 SCF survey and 17% in the 1992 SCF
survey. A 2003 study indicates that U.S. household participation in direct stock ownership was 19% in
1998. Luigi Guiso, Michael Haliassos and Tullio Jappelli, Household Stockholding in Europe: Where Do

Geographic Distribution of Accredited Investor Households

The public version of the SCF database does not provide information regarding
geographical location of households. As a result, we are unable to identify where households
that qualify as accredited investors are likely to be concentrated.
The Federal Reserve Board’s 2013 SCF Chartbook 346 provides information on median
and mean income and net worth of U.S. households based on four regions categorized as
Northeast, Midwest, South and West. The data is presented in Table 10.8 below. The data
shows that household income and net worth tend to be much higher in the Northeastern and

346

http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/scf/files/BulletinCharts.pdf.

112

Western regions. This indicates that households that would qualify as accredited investors are
more likely to be located in these two regions.

The U.S. Census Bureau (the “USCB”) provides data on number of households that have
net worth greater than $1.5 million by state. The most recent data available on the USCB’s
website is for the year 2004. Based on available data for 2004, California had the largest
percentage of households (16.5%) with net worth greater than $1.5 million. Other states with the
largest percentage were Florida (9.1%), New York (7.7%), Texas (4.9%) and Illinois (4.6%). 347
The states with the lowest percentage were Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska and North Dakota.
Similarly, 2009 census data shows that California had the largest percentage (16.2%) of
households with income greater than $200,000. The other states with the largest percentage were
New York, Texas, New Jersey and Florida. 348 With regard to states of solicitation, the Form Ds

households with net worth greater than $1 million. The ranking of top five states is the same as that for
2004.

offerings were solicited in Florida (5.9%), followed by California (5.6%), Texas and New York.

Future Indexing for Inflation

Under the approach identified in 1.C, the dollar-amount thresholds in the accredited
investor definition would be adjusted every four years to reflect inflation. The quadrennialadjusted dollar amounts would be rounded to the nearest multiple of $10,000. Adjusting the
thresholds for inflation in the future would help to maintain the income, net worth and
investments requirements in real dollar terms, so that the accredited investor thresholds do not
erode over time. Table 9 below presents data (rounded to nearest $10,000) on current, potential
and future (estimated) income, net worth and minimum investment thresholds. We use average
CPI-based inflation for the past 20 years (approximately 2.37% 349) to obtain the inflation rate
estimate for future years.

Figures in parenthesis show the amounts when we use PCE-based inflation of 1.94% for the 20-year period.

Increased thresholds due to inflation adjustment could decrease or increase the size of the
accredited investor pool, depending on the rate at which personal income or net worth fluctuates,
relative to the inflation rate. For example, all else remaining constant, a higher rate of income
growth in nominal terms than the inflation rate would result in an expansion in the pool of
accredited households qualifying on an income basis, relative to our baseline numbers.
Data from the USCB’s Current Population Survey shows that U.S. household income has
increased in nominal terms, on average, by 2.65% per year over the last 20 years. 350 This is

350

Data available at: https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/historical/inequality/. Household
income is defined to include wages or salary, farm and non-farm income, social security, transfer payments,
investment income including rental income, unemployment/veterans’ compensation, alimony or child
support.

115

higher than the average annual inflation of 2.37% actually observed over the same period. The
data also shows that household income has grown at a faster average annual rate for the top
quintile of the households (3.07%), and was even higher (3.14%) for the top five percent of the
households. If historical trends hold in the future, adjusting accredited investor thresholds for
inflation will not shrink the pool of accredited investors, relative to the number of households
that would qualify based on approaches identified for consideration in the study.
