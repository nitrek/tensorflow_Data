In the Matter of

ORDER

DANIEL CHRISTIAN STANLEY POWELL
The Securities and Exchange Commission initiated this proceeding against Respondent
Daniel Christian Stanley Powell in April 2016 by issuing an order instituting proceedings (OIP)
under Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. OIP at 1; see 15 U.S.C. § 78o(b).
The Division of Enforcement has filed a dispositive motion in which it seeks imposition of the
full range of associational bars listed in Exchange Act Section 15(b)(6)(A). Mot. at 1 & n.1, 9;
see 15 U.S.C. § 78o(b)(6)(A).
During a telephonic prehearing conference held in May 2016, Division counsel explained
that although the OIP alleges that Powell was associated with a broker-dealer from May through
September 2009, based on conversations with Powell’s former employer, “the correct date[s]
[are] March 2010 through September 2010.” Tr. 19-20. In light of Division counsel’s statement,
I asked whether he felt it would be necessary to amend the OIP. Tr. 27. Counsel stated that
although he believed amending the OIP would be unnecessary, he would do so “if [I]
prefer[red].” Tr. 27. I then mentioned that I was uncertain how the factual allegations would
affect my ability to impose all of the collateral bars the Division seeks in this case.1 Tr. 27-28. I
left the decision how to proceed to the Division. Tr. 28.

1

Exchange Act Section 15(b)(6)(A) authorizes the Commission to impose a range of
collateral bars—bars from participating in the securities industry in capacities in addition to the
capacity in which an individual functioned at the time of his or her misconduct at issue. 15
U.S.C. § 78o(b)(6)(A). Effective July 22, 2010, Section 925(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act added two additional bars to this list: bars from
associating with municipal advisors or nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. See
Pub. L. No. 111-203, §§ 4, 925(a), 124 Stat. 1376, 1390, 1850-51. The District of Columbia
Circuit later held on retroactivity grounds that the Commission cannot apply the Dodd-Frank
amendments to bar a respondent from associating with municipal advisors or statistical rating
organizations based on conduct predating Dodd-Frank. See Koch v. SEC, 793 F.3d 147, 157-58
(D.C. Cir. 2015).

In a subsequently filed dispositive motion, the Division asks that I impose all the bars
contemplated in Section 15(b), including the two bars that were the subject of the decision in
Koch. Mot. at 1 & n.1. In its motion, the Division has not fully explained why, in light of the
factual allegations in the OIP, imposing bars on Respondent from associating with municipal
advisors and statistical rating organizations would not raise retroactivity concerns. Additionally,
although it represents in its motion that the allegations in the OIP as to the period of Powell’s
association with a broker-dealer are mistaken, Mot. at 9 n.2, the Division has not moved to
amend the OIP.
In light of the foregoing, I order that within fourteen days, the Division should either:
(1) file a brief fully explaining why, in light of the factual allegations in the OIP and the
reasoning in Koch, it would be permissible to consider barring Powell from
associating with a municipal advisor or a nationally recognized statistical rating
organization; or
(2) move to amend the allegation in paragraph 1 of Section II.A of the OIP.2
