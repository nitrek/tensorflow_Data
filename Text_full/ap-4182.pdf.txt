In the Matter of

ORDER POSTPONING
HEARING

PAMELLA B. WATSON

The Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting proceedings (OIP)
on August 29, 2016, pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. A hearing is currently scheduled for
October 11, 2016.
On September 19, 2016, the Division of Enforcement submitted a motion to continue the
hearing and schedule a telephonic prehearing conference and a notice of filing of proof of
service. The Division reports that it received a copy of the return receipt for the OIP sent by U.S.
Postal Service certified mail to Respondent, who is incarcerated. The return receipt states that
the OIP was received and signed for by K.A. Candle as agent for Respondent on September 6,
2016, and contained specific instructions noted on the return receipt of “SPECIAL MAIL OPEN
ONLY IN THE PRESENCE OF INMATE.” Notice at 1, Ex. A. It therefore appears that
Respondent was served with the OIP on September 6, 2016, in accordance with Rule of Practice
141(a)(2)(i), 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(i). If so, Respondent’s answer is due on September 29,
2016. OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.160(b), .220(b).
The Division’s motion is GRANTED IN PART and the hearing scheduled for October
11, 2016, is POSTPONED. I direct the Division to confer with Respondent’s counselor at FCI
Coleman to determine an agreeable date and time for a telephonic prehearing conference during
the week of October 17, 2016, and to notify my office of the result of those discussions.
